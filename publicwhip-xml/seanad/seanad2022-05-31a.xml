I am sure she is well aware of the matter as she is working hard in this area.  I have seen some of the great work that has been done over the last number of years, particularly in St. Finian's College in Mullingar.  Special education units have been very useful and well resourced under this Government and the previous one, to be fair.</p> <p>South Meath is a commuter belt area.  Ratoath has a population of approximately 15,000 and is growing.  It is a town that has really sprung up.  The parents and the school are very happy to push ahead with a special needs unit for Ratoath junior school.  Time is of the essence.  With September on the horizon, there is a short timeframe to do what we are talking about.  If the Minister of State could shed some light on the matter of a special needs unit in Ratoath junior school, I would really appreciate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#B00400"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  He will be aware that the creation and opening of special classes are of paramount importance to me and the Department.  To put it in context, we have 2,118 special classes in the country at present.  We have opened 300 special classes this year, creating about 1,800 special class places.  By the end of this year, we will have 2,148 special classes.  We are making substantial progress, especially considering that we only had 548 special classes in 2011.</p> <p>The Senator has made a specific request around Ratoath junior school.  I understand the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, sanctioned a special class by letter in November last year.  Once the NCSE sanctions a special class, it is then up to the particular school to apply to the Department.  The school did that under the additional accommodation scheme for the refurbishment of rooms to accommodate a special education class.  I understand the school submitted this request for the refurbishment only in April of this year.  The Department has asked for more information from the school.  A reminder was also issued to the school to get that information to the Department in order that it can progress this matter.</p> <p>I understand Ratoath junior school is enrolling students already for its special class and there should be no difficulty in supporting it under the additional school accommodation scheme.  However, the school needs to respond to the Department with the additional information sought.  The Department has to ensure it does everything by the book and gets all the information it needs for value for money reasons and so on.  Perhaps the Senator will request that the school contact the Department as soon as possible so that, as he says, the special class can be opened in September.  I understand the school is enrolling children for this year.</p> <p>I also note the Senator's comment that there are approximately 15,000 people living in Ratoath.  It is not just about providing a special class for Ratoath National School.  We have four special classes already serving Ratoath, two in St. Paul's National School and two in Ashbourne Educate Together National School, and there is going to be demand for more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is up to the National Council for Special Education to have an adequate forecasting model in place to ensure we can predict ahead of time that we have capacity for the demand that will accrue.  Every year, I am scrambling to get special class places and special school places.  That is not something that I, the NCSE or the Department wish to see into the future.  We wish to make sure that every child gets the education he or she deserves, particularly those children with additional needs, who need it more than most.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1652" speakername="Aidan Davitt" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#C00200"><p>The Minister of State seems to be aware of the timeline.  The school applied to the Department in April.  Is it long since the Department sought the additional information back?  My understanding is that the school is very gung ho and keen to move on with the project.  If the request from the Department was made recently, it may be that we could liaise a bit more strongly with the school or try to dot the i's and cross the t's.  I am curious as to the situation in that regard.  I will leave it to the discretion of the Minister of State.  If it is something that needs a little push along or a personal touch, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State were to provide that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#C00300"><p>I appreciate that.  My understanding from speaking to the Department is that the school contacted the Department in April of this year for the refurbishment under the additional school accommodation scheme.  My understanding is that the Department liaised quite quickly with the school in respect of particular information it required to progress the application and that it had to issue a reminder recently because the information was not forthcoming.  It might be worthwhile for the Senator to speak to the principal and the school.  Obviously, I can liaise with the Senator or his staff in terms of giving more information regarding what is required.  The school is aware, however, that there is information outstanding.  Once we have that information, there should be no difficulty in getting this special class up and running.  The fact that the school is currently enrolling children augurs well but summer will be upon us quickly.  That is not to say that the ASA scheme and the planning and building unit will not be working during summer.  If the Senator were to speak to the school, that would be worthwhile and we would be able to get this progressed.</p></speech>

I am grateful to the Seanad Office and the office of the Cathaoirleach for selecting this Commencement matter.  It follows on from the Commencement matter I tabled last week in respect of Project Ireland 2040 and the capital plan for national cultural institutions.</p> <p>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g will take place on Saturday, 11 June.  It is an initiative of Creative Ireland, in partnership with local authorities, RT&Eacute; and the Department.  Events for children and young people will take place in the National Concert Hall, the Gallery of Photography Ireland, the Ark, the Hugh Lane Gallery and Dublin city libraries to name just a few locations in this city.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, there are events taking place for thousands of children and young people throughout the country.  It is important that we give Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g a lift.  I commend the teams bringing it together, namely, the Department staff, Creative Ireland, the artists and facilitators, the arts officers in local authorities, Youth Theatre Ireland and all organisations that support our young people.  I mention in particular Youth Theatre Ireland which will host introductory theatre workshops, including a workshop by Dublin Youth Theatre.  The contribution of youth theatres throughout our country is extraordinary.  It seems as though everyone in theatre has come through these structures.  It is good to know that children and young people have the kinds of places, spaces like youth theatres, to go to express and be themselves, feel safe, build characters, write stories and create situations in a fun and creative environment.  That is beautiful.</p><p>The Creative Ireland programme has recently been extended from this year until 2027.  The programme for Government commitments include developing a creative industries roadmap.  I raised this matter with the Minister, Deputy Martin, on 24 November 2021.  I appreciate she is not here today but if I ask the questions, perhaps they can be conveyed to the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.</p><p>It was my understanding that the roadmap for the creative industries would be published in the latest Create Ireland programme, from 2017 to 2022.  The roadmap was being finalised in 2019 or thereabouts.  Hundreds of meetings were held with academics, stakeholders, small businesses, industry representatives and EU officials.  A considerable amount of work and resources have gone into the roadmap, which was supposed to be published.  However, to date, no plan has been published.  There is obviously a problem somewhere.  I am not sure if it will be mentioned in the Minister of State's statement, but it is hard to see what the blockage is from the outside.  When will this creative industries roadmap, as part of Creative Ireland and the programme for Government, be published?  I also wish to give a lift to Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, which takes place on 11 June.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#D00200"><p>I will be making a statement on the future of the Creative Ireland programme on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, who is currently in Cabinet.  Many of the questions the Senator has asked are given a comprehensive response.  In December 2016, a new all-of-government initiative, entitled cl&aacute;r &Eacute;ire IId&aacute;nach or the Creative Ireland programme, was approved as a legacy project arising from the Ireland 2016 centenary programme and as the main implementation vehicle for national cultural policy priorities.</p> <p>More recently, the Government agreed that significant progress had been made to date to support each citizen in realising his or her creative potential and to mainstream creativity into public policy across Departments through the implementation of the Creative Ireland Programme 2017 to 2022.  It was recognised, however, that there was a requirement to provide an early indication of the preferred direction of travel concerning the future of the programme after 2022, to which the Senator alluded.  Departments and public bodies, including local authorities and stakeholders, in particular the community and voluntary sectors, would require a lead-in period to prepare key strands of the new phase of the programme.</p> <p>Since detailed work to develop a new five-year programme would also, among other things, require extensive consultations, including with the public, a two-step process to secure Government agreement is being pursued.  This process consists of an initial in-principle approval for a further five-year framework for the Creative Ireland Programme 2023 to 2027 to enable the necessary programme detail to be developed in collaboration with other Departments, public bodies and key stakeholders and a final more detailed version of the programme, to be brought back to Government for its agreement in autumn 2022 prior to its publication, launch and implementation on an all-of-government basis.</p> <p>In February 2022, the Government provided the initial in-principle approval.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In so doing the Government reaffirmed the vision of the Creative Ireland programme to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation so that individually and collectively, in our personal lives and in our institutions, we can realise our full creative potential thereby promoting individual, community and national well-being to which we all aspire.  The programme identified issues of access as it sought to reach new audiences, in particular those not currently engaging.  It will therefore continue to collaborate and communicate with as broad a network as possible as it seeks to empower communities nationwide through its values of collaboration and communication, community empowerment and internationalisation.  There is undoubtedly a recognition that significant scope remains for continuing implementation regarding children and young people through Creative Youth.  The publication of the Creative Youth plan in 2017 provided a vision for which there has been substantial success and delivery across the primary areas centred on educational settings, community engagement and the development of a professional education and arts supporting ecosystem.  </p><p>Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of free creativity for children, is now in its fifth year and has become firmly embedded in the national calendar.  The 31 local authorities are crucial to its delivery and the programme officials continue to refine an approach of key strategic partnerships with community and voluntary organisations of national reach that can complement and further enable the efforts of local authorities.  As an aside I should mention that Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g takes place this year on 11 June.  </p><p>While advances have been made regarding the audiovisual action plan significant benefits are anticipated from a focus on creative industries more broadly.  To that end discussions are again under way among officials regarding the preparation of a roadmap for the creative industries.  I will come back with more in the next contribution.  I thank the Senator.</p></speech>

The statement the Minister of State has made is very helpful for my own information.  I will analyse it.</p> <p>There is undoubted success from the Creative Youth programme.  I look forward to meeting with more facilitators, artists and schools that have taken part to get their sense of that.  Schools are provided with &euro;4,000 and I wonder if that is enough.  Are we reaching as many schools as we can?  Is there room for an increased budget in order to reach more schools and more after-school environments?</p> <p>I welcome the fact that discussions are again under way about the roadmap for the creative industries.  We were promised that roadmap in 2019.  As I said before, there is a blockage somewhere.  From the outside it is difficult for me to see where that is.  I hope that will be published as soon as possible so that we can have sight of it and start the implementation.  A good deal of resources go into that work and it will not be relevant forever.</p></speech>

Take a little latitude.</p></speech>

We missed the benefits of the arts, culture and creativity.  They are so important for our well-being, in particular mental health and well-being.  It was brought into sharp focus during Covid-19.  I firmly believe enhanced collaboration and integration across the arts, health and social care sectors through a focus on creative health and well-being could systemically and sustainably embed these benefits in Ireland.</p> <p>To inform this approach my own Department, together with the Department of Health, the HSE and the Arts Council, are collaborating to host a very important national symposium on 22 June which will consider the evidence base regarding the health benefits from creative arts and discuss arts and health activities in hospitals that can help deliver better health outcomes for patients and their carers.  The Senator will be aware of the Covid-19 concerts that were held in nursing homes over the past two years.  Now they are delivering these concerts to community nursing units and day care centres, which is absolutely phenomenal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When I attended an outdoor concert in Dungarvan Community Hospital in my constituency, there was one particular lady there with dementia who could not remember anything.  As soon as the music started, she knew every single word.  It was absolutely phenomenal.</p><p>They will also explore the operational role of the arts, cultural and creative sectors in delivering healthcare and well-being in the community.  The Creative Ireland Programme 2023-2027 will therefore focus on the following strategic areas: creative youth; creative communities; creative industries; creative health and well-being; and creative climate action and sustainability.  I think it is an area that we all very much welcome because people have missed out so much in the past couple of years.  To see young people, middle aged people and older people enjoying the arts, culture and everything we have so much of in this country is very important.  </p><p>There is a huge amount of detail in the response and I acknowledge that.  If the Senator has any further questions, he can take them up with the Minister, if that is okay.  I thank him for his interest.</p></speech>

We are coming into the summer season.  Many more people are availing of our beaches and swimming is becoming more popular year round.  However, the problem continues to arise around jet skis and small motorised vehicles.  I am aware that legislation is in place that will allow local authorities to put by-laws in place.  Those by-laws are supposed to be enforced, but one of the difficulties is around the question of enforcement.  At the moment, even though there are by-laws regulating where jet skis can go &ndash; and they should not be going into bathing areas &ndash; there is no requirement on the owner of a jet ski to register that ownership.</p> <p>There are now jet skis that can travel at up to 100 km/h in some cases and have 1,000 cc engines.  Anybody can go and buy them.  There are no requirements in terms of training, insurance or registration.  Think about a vehicle that powerful in comparison with, say, a motor vehicle.  What happens if there is an accident?  What happens if one of those jet skis collides with a swimmer?  This is a fear in many of our coastal communities.  What are the insurance implications?  Who is responsible?</p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that there was a joint appeal last year by a number of bodies, including Waterways Ireland, the Coast Guard and Water Safety Ireland, around the responsible use of jet skis.  However, we as a country are an outlier in terms of registration of these small motor vehicles.  We need to look at treating jet skis essentially in the same way as we treat cars, with the same registration requirements.  That way, if an incident occurs, somebody can be held to account.  </p> <p>We do not want to stop people from using jet skis.  Encouraging water sports is important, but people should do them responsibly.  However, at the moment, we are allowing unlicensed, uninsured and untrained people out on these very powerful vehicles.  When one talks to the Garda and the Coast Guard, the Coast Guard does not want to be spending its time chasing errant jet skiers and the Garda is not often in a position to be able to do it.  It may be that at some stage in the future we need to consider the idea of water police for some of our busiest beaches, who could be shared around the country, to be able to monitor situations where jet skiers and swimmers are close to each other.</p> <p>It is an area that is coming up as a matter of concern, not just in Wexford.  I have been chatting to councillors and other representatives around the country and there is a real concern that this area is not sufficiently regulated.  As the Minister of State knows, there is no point in putting by-laws in place if they cannot be enforced and if those who breach the by-laws cannot be caught and then held accountable.  I would ask that we look at the model again and go beyond the by-laws.  I ask that we look at treating jet skis in the same way as we treat motor vehicles and put in place requirements around registration, insurance and some level of training in the interests of all water users.</p></speech>

I recognise many of the significant points made by the Senator.  He attended in Waterford last Friday afternoon, when we celebrated 20 years of the search and rescue service in the south east located at Waterford regional airport.  We must achieve the right balance.  We have seen the amount of search and rescue requests at sea and inland, and these are coupled with the supports provided by the Garda and other bodies that help people who may get lost on mountains or whatever.  There is a huge range of supports in place and we must be very conscious of that.</p> <p>The Minister of State informs me a range of control mechanisms relating to the regulation of jet skis exist under the Maritime Safety Act 2005.  The Act strengthened the law against improper use of certain personal watercraft and recreational craft, and promotes good practice in the operation of vessels generally.  Section 6 in Part 2 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005 allows local authorities, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland to make by-laws to regulate or control the operation of craft or specified classes of craft, including jet skis, in waters under their control or management or in their functional areas.</p> <p>The prohibition or restriction of jet skis may be general or in specified places and in the interests of the safety of persons using waters at certain times, or for the prevention of nuisance or injury to persons or damage to watercraft or other property on the waters.  It may also be for the protection of a natural heritage area or protected monument.  The by-laws may also address matters relating to launching, mooring or berthing craft, the conditions to be observed by operators of craft or maximum speed limits at which craft may be operated.</p> <p>Section 6 of the Act also includes an offence and penalty regime for persons who operate a craft in contravention of a by-law made under the section.  The penalties are, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding &euro;1,000 for a first offence or not exceeding &euro;2,000 for a second or subsequent offence.  I take on board the Senator's points about ensuring these by-laws are enforced.</p> <p>The Act recognises that the conditions and issues can vary in different parts of the country.  Therefore, it is a matter for the individual by-law making authorities to assess the particular circumstances in their area and decide on the appropriate response.  There are general enforcement provisions contained in the 2005 Act that allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or authorised persons to act in particular circumstances.  These include requiring the ceasing of the operation of craft, the seizure of craft in the interests of safety and other enforcement actions.  I accept that the only reason the Senator is raising this matter is from a health and safety perspective and he is not trying to stop anyone enjoying the water or the beautiful beaches we have.  We are very lucky to live on an island with fabulous and spectacular beaches.</p> <p>The Senator indicates there is no provision under the Merchant Shipping Act for the licensing of jet skis.  The provision of the Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Act 2014, when fully commenced, will assist in the identification of owners of jet skis for enforcement purposes.  An extension of mandatory registration to additional ship categories, including personal watercraft such as jet skis, is proposed for the future when the new ship registration regime is rolled out.  However, this will take some time as the full commencement of the Act requires the establishment of a new electronic ship register and registration regime, which will be progressed under a separate information technology project.  There will be new ship registration regulations to complement and align with the registration information technology project.  It is one of the Senator's main concerns that these craft are not registered currently.</p></speech>

The response is quite clear nonetheless and my concern is the length of time this may take.  There are incidents every summer and we hope none are too serious.  There are certainly concerns that jet skiers come too close to swimmers, for example, and others cause a nuisance in some of our harbours.</p> <p>As the Minister of State said, I want people to be able to use the water and jet skis but they should do it in a way where they are properly trained and do it in appropriate areas.  They should be insured and registered.  We must look to treating these machines in the same way as we treat cars.  I ask the Minister of State to request that this element of legislation and regulations might be expedited as it would be enormously beneficial for harbour communities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We can have all the by-laws we want, but if we cannot enforce them, then there is little point.  </p></speech>

I refer specifically to the Maritime Safety Act 2005, under which local authorities, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland may make by-laws to regulate or control the operation of jet skis in their functional areas.  Such by-laws may also address matters relating to the launching of craft or the maximum speed limits at which craft may be operated.  Under this Act, a range of offences and enforcement provisions may be employed in this context by authorised persons or members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>Given conditions can vary in different parts of the country, I hope the Senator will appreciate why it is a matter for the individual by-law-making authorities to assess the specific circumstances in their areas and then to decide on the appropriate responses to those local conditions.  It is reasonable that those closest to the issues and possessing local knowledge should regulate for local circumstances.  I encourage the relevant authorities to explore actions permissible under the provisions of the 2005 Act if specific problems may be arising with jet skis in particular local areas or waters.  I take on board the Senator's point, however, about the legislation and I will bring this back to the Minister.</p></speech>

I call for balance in regional air routes in the context of what is happening in Dublin Airport.  We must explore short-, medium- and long-term solutions.  I tweeted over the weekend to encourage people to consider using regional airports and particularly Shannon Airport.  It has the longest runway and the capacity to handle up to 4 million passengers annually.  The numbers using the airport in the context of that overall capacity are low, but as we emerge from the impacts of Covid-19, the availability of flights and the numbers of passengers using them is increasing.  It is good to see that happening.</p> <p>A great deal of investment went into Shannon Airport during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The security processes there now use scanners that allow passengers to put their bags right through.  There is no need to take bags off for security personnel to examine.  This development has significantly reduced the time taken to go through security at the airport.  What happened in Dublin Airport over the weekend has caused reputational damage to Ireland.  Even looking at the news headlines on Sunday evening, we heard from people from other countries saying they would never come back.  This experience has caused reputational damage not just for Dublin Airport, but for our tourism industry nationwide.  People come here because airlines, such as Ryanair and others, offer many cheap flights and encourage people to come here for long weekends or short holidays.  People have been doing that and many are travelling more frequently because they could not do so during the worst of the pandemic.  They might now be going away once a month or something like that.  </p> <p>It upset me to hear people on the television say they would not come back here.   The Minister of State is from the regions.  Waterford has its own airport, and we have Shannon on our doorstep.  We also have airports in counties Kerry and Mayo.  We have many fine regional airports.  When I posted my tweet encouraging people to use these regional airports, it got more than 1,000 likes.  We often see people liking tweets, but then giving out in the comments.  The comments from people over the weekend, however, were good and positive.  It is encouraging.  Equally, however, I read a tweet from someone who drove from Clare to Dublin Airport to go to London for the weekend.  That flight cost &euro;32.  If the person had flown from Shannon Airport, the equivalent cost would have been &euro;303 one way.  That is a big cost differential.  This situation will not solve the problems experienced at Dublin Airport.  Flights to many holiday destinations could be given to the regional airports to operate.  People from the mid-west or the west should not have to go to Dublin to be able to access these flights.  Equally, with business flights, there are no European connections from Shannon Airport.  This is something the Government must consider.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We encourage regional development for job creation and education but not for flights.  The Government needs to sit down with the regional airports and the DAA and work out a plan.  </p><p>While I know the DAA was short-staffed, I understand it has taken on 300 staff and is only short another 70.  If those 70 staff were in place, we would still have had queues.  This morning, I saw that some of my colleagues visiting the European People's Party, EPP, congress got through to their flights in two hours or thereabouts.  We need a long-term plan and to use our regional airports because we cannot afford to have reputational damage to our tourism sector.</p><p>On a final point, some people are being very abusive to staff at the airport.  It is not the fault of staff so people should be courteous towards them.</p></speech>

She did not say anything I disagreed with.  I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who, as the Senator pointed out, is attending meetings on this very issue.</p> <p>What we witnessed at Dublin Airport last weekend was totally unacceptable.  The Government and Minister are very dissatisfied with the current situation and the impact that these unacceptable delays are having on passengers.</p> <p>This is an operational matter for the Dublin Airport Authority which has the statutory responsibility to operate, manage and develop Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with screening and security at the airport.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, met the CEO of the Dublin Airport Authority, Dalton Philips, and his management team first thing yesterday morning.  The Ministers expressed their immense disappointment and frustration at the unacceptable scenes at Dublin Airport over the weekend.  Reputational damage was caused last Sunday.  The images went viral very quickly.  My niece flew out of Dublin Airport at 6.30 a.m. on Sunday and it took her three hours to get through to her flight.  That was before the peak.  </p> <p>I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator on balanced regional development, which is the cornerstone of the programme for Government.  Sometimes issues arise in the capital city where more than 1.5 million people live.   The Senator spoke about the various airports.  There is positive mood music in Waterford today in respect of the extension to the runway.  There is no doubt, however, that many of our regional airports, in Cork, Shannon, Kerry and Knock, are underutilised at times.</p> <p>I will outline the response to the situation that gave rise to the events last Sunday.  In seeking to address the security staff shortage at the airport, Dublin Airport Authority has stepped up recruitment and to date has successfully recruited 300 additional staff.  As the Senator stated, a further 70 security staff are required.  The number of new staff being on-boarded at the same time as passenger numbers are increasing is bringing fresh challenges.  It is vital that staff maintain operational security compliance as a priority.</p> <p>I am advised that the DAA put a number of additional measures in place since queueing issues first arose in March, including initiating a senior management task force, redeployment of staff to manage queues and assist with better presentations to security, and the opening of terminal 1, or T1, security lanes on a 24-7 basis.  Until last weekend, these measures were having an impact.  In general, the majority of passengers were getting through security in less than 45 minutes, even in busy periods.  However, last weekend, on Sunday in particular, wait times fell well short of any acceptable level.</p> <p>To return to the point raised by Senator Byrne, there are great opportunities for people living in the south of the country to use Cork and Shannon airports.  When people compare and contrast the costs of flight from the various airports, it sometimes encourages them to travel to seek the best value.</p> <p>I was struck over the weekend by how upset some people were.  Families with young babies, elderly people and people travelling to funerals were unable to make their flights, which is unacceptable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know many of the Senator's colleagues have said similar to what she has said about having other airports in the country.  Every effort should be made to utilise them.  There is no doubt that nobody wants to see what happened last Sunday happen again.  We are facing into a very busy bank holiday period.  I reiterate the point the Senator made.  Staff are under pressure.  It is a very difficult situation and it is very important that they are treated with respect at all times.</p></speech>

This issue is mainly with regard to Dublin Airport and what is happening there.  I will be speaking to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, about this.  This is an opportune time for the Government.  We have to put in place a plan, whether it be a five-point plan or another type of plan, to develop regional balance for flights.  The Minister of State, the Minister and their teams need to sit down with representatives from all of the airports.  They need to look at the various routes available.  They have to take routes from Dublin Airport and give them to the other airports.  It may not happen in the short term but in the long term this needs to happen.  This is obvious from what we saw last Sunday.</p> <p>We need to put in place proper regional balance to encourage people and to support those airports that need support.  Airlines such as Aer Lingus and Ryanair need to be given incentives to give people flights at competitive rates.  We also need to provide connectivity from the regional airports.  We need business connectivity to Europe and Heathrow.  Some routes at regional airports have flights only two or three times a week.  They need to be daily.</p></speech>

The Government recognises the undue stress these unacceptable delays are having on passengers.  It is like a perfect storm.  People have not been able to holiday abroad for the past two and a half years.  We have seen similar pressures in the Passport Office.  People want to enjoy a holiday if they can at all.  Some people are travelling for work.  Some people are travelling because of a family bereavement and they have no choice.</p> <p>The Minister and the Minister of State are working extremely hard to make sure what happened last Sunday will not be replicated.  The challenges faced by the DAA at the airport are expected to continue until the end of June when all new recruits are expected to be in place and trained.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will continue to engage with Dublin Airport Authority on a daily basis to ensure all that can be done is being done for passengers using Dublin Airport.  I will certainly bring back the Senator's comments.  I agree with them wholeheartedly.  There is an opportunity to grow and develop regional airports, as we have already said.  It is something that should be looked at as soon as possible.  There is no point having a pinch point in one area when there is capacity in others.  Pricing will have to be taken into account.  It is very important that we acknowledge the busy staff who worked in the airport last Sunday and over the weekend.</p></speech>

The national day of Sweden commemorates Gustav Vasa being made king in 1523 and the new government being formed in 1809, which is viewed as the foundation of the constitutional monarchy of Sweden.  Last year, Sweden celebrated the 100th anniversary of the introduction of universal voting and equal voting rights.  The origins of the national day date back to 1893.  It is known as Swedish Flag Day.  The Swedish national holiday comes just before its very important Midsummer festival.</p> <p>Sweden has a history of being in close contact and having close relations with Ireland.  After 1949, Sweden was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic links with Ireland.  Ireland is, of course, an important partner of Sweden in the EU.  Our peacekeepers also work closely together.  Sweden shares with Ireland the common interest of having a strong and effective EU.  We look forward to strengthening the bilateral relations, deepening diplomatic dialogue and promoting trade between our two countries.  In due course, the Swedish embassy will be re-established in Dublin, which we are delighted to see.</p> <p>A total of four Irish writers have won the Swedish Nobel Prize for Literature, George Bernard Shaw, Samuel Beckett, Seamus Heaney, and Senator W.B. Yeats.  On receiving the Nobel prize, Yeats said "when I received from the hands of your King the great honour your Academy has conferred upon me, I felt that a young man&rsquo;s ghost should have stood upon one side of me and at the other a living woman in her vigorous old age".  I wish the ambassador, His Excellency, Mr. Magnus Ryd&eacute;n, and all the Swedish people here in Ireland and around the world, a very happy national day of Sweden.  I thank the ambassador for being with us today.</p></speech>

My sister and her partner were going home to the UK yesterday and were extremely worried about what faced them.  They left at around 7 o'clock.  Thankfully, yesterday was not as bad but the images on Sunday put the frighteners on them and on hundreds and thousands of people who took fright and left a couple of hours earlier than planned.  This is not good enough for an international airport.  We have to look at the image this creates of our country and capital city and at the facilities we have in other airports.  We talk about regionally balanced development and all of that.  We have three fine international airports on the west coast, namely, Ireland West Airport Knock, Shannon and Cork.  They have had difficulties in the past but anybody who has used those facilities know how handy and quick they are.  There is pre-clearance at Shannon as well.  There is a wonderful opportunity for people across the country to re-engage with those airports.  We do not always have to look to Dublin for international travel.  The more people that use the facilities and the more throughput and engagement they have, the more airlines that will provide services from them.</p> <p>I ask for a debate on the area of air travel and tourism.  The potential for the use of Ireland West Airport Knock, Shannon and Cork can be seen now, as well as their importance and the need for them.  As the numbers of tourists grow in this country and the population increases, we need to look at all our assets regarding international travel.  It would be hugely beneficial to have a fuller debate on this issue.</p> <p>I acknowledge the ministerial engagement over recent days and weeks on capacity in Dublin Airport but it is not good enough to have people queueing on the street.  Thankfully the weather was good but, on the law of averages, we will have a wet day soon and it will be even less pleasant than it is now.  I cannot imagine bringing my mother to the airport and expecting her to queue outside for an hour before getting inside to continue queueing.  There needs to be a thorough shake-up of the DAA and its actions and inaction regarding Dublin Airport.  I look forward to a debate in the near future.</p></speech>

Some of the debate in Sweden around foreign policy and human rights is something useful that we could share.  In this House, we have talked about how we should work more closely with non-aligned countries who are members of the European Union.  I look forward to the reopening of the embassy.</p> <p>With regard to our partnership in the European Union, I welcome the decision of the EU Council last night to impose further sanctions, particularly a ban on all seaborne oil from Russia.  However, I am concerned by the continued approach of Hungary and Viktor Orb&aacute;n.  His actions are facilitating the ongoing war in Ukraine and his relationship with Vladimir Putin should be of serious concern.  The EU must be based around values and there has to be responsibility on the part of EU leaders.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When those leaders do not exercise responsibility to defend EU values, we need to take action. </p><p>This is blockchain awareness week.  Blockchain is a technology that could transform public administration in many ways.  For example, an Irish company, AID:Tech, is transforming how we look at the development of overseas development aid and ensuring that it is done in a very efficient way.  I call again for a debate about how technology is changing our lives and how we all need to upskill and reskill for those challenges.  We are going to see the introduction of a digital euro within a few years.  We are going to see blockchain underpinning a lot more of the technologies that we use.  It is important that we debate those issues in this House.</p><p>Yesterday at Wexford County Council, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, launched Wexford's second age-friendly strategy.  It is a comprehensive strategy to ensure that as we get older, we live in age-friendly communities.  Some 22% of our population will be over the age of 65 within the next decade.  We have to ensure that our communities are as age-friendly as possible.  I pay tribute to the team in Wexford County Council, Ann Marie Laffan, Ger Mackey and also the volunteers led by Kevin Molloy, who brought about the production of this age-friendly strategy.  I wish them well in the implementation of the strategy.</p></speech>

Greater love hath no one than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends.  On this day 23 years ago at 5.30 a.m., the 85th Infantry Battalion came under fire at post 642.  Private Billy Kedian was awoken by the sound of mortars going off.  In order that the people who were on duty could take care of the urgent work that needed to be done, Kedian ran from place to place waking colleagues to get them to go under cover to protect their lives.  In the end, Billy Kedian was subjected to a mortar blast some 6 ft. away from him.  As Billy lay dying, Lieutenant Morgan, Sergeant Spellman, Private Carr and Private Clarke went to his aid.  Clarke himself was injured.  Billy lost his life.  The five names I have mentioned of Billy Kedian, Morgan, Spellman, Carr and Clarke have all been cited for military medals for gallantry and damn me to hell but we still have not got medals.  We talk here about Jadotville.  We talk about the saving of Sergeant Major John "Twenty" O'Connor.  We talk about Billy Kedian.  Not one bloody medal has been issued.</p> <p>Every chance there is for a photo opportunity, our Minister and our Taoiseach head off and talk about the great service of our men in the Lebanon.  This is not good enough.  It goes back to the Congo, as the Cathaoirleach knows.  Our men and women leave this country to keep people safe in peacekeeping.  Many of them have lost their lives.  Many UN peacekeepers indeed from the ambassador's country have lost their lives in an effort to bring peace to the world.  A lot of people wonder what the hell a medal means and think it is just a bit of tin.  It is the only bit of recognition we have for a brave soldier.  We give every Chief of Staff a distinguished service medal for doing his job.  Not one of the soldiers of Jadotville, 34 of them, received a medal.  Not one of the guys who saved "Twenty" O'Connor, four of them, received a medal.  Indeed one of them was a Swede who saved "Twenty" O'Connor.  Not one of the five I mentioned today has received a medal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

At the end of 2020, the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications Networks clearly called on the Government to bring about "the re-establishment of a State Airports Authority, encompassing Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports, to lead the recovery in a balanced way that will benefit [the entire country]".  The difficulty with all the chaos we saw at the weekend is that the Government clearly has a responsibility for it.  Some 18 months after that all-party recommendation and almost two years after the Sinn F&eacute;in motion, there has been absolutely no action from either the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, or the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I can categorically state that neither Minister is interested in a regional rebalance and they are not listening.</p> <p>The evidence for that comes from a Commencement matter tabled this morning.  In fairness, my Limerick colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, tabled a Commencement matter in respect of regional balance and the development of air traffic routes.  The scripted answer she received does not have one word in respect of the need to rebalance.  Having challenged the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in this Chamber, I know they both have a policy of ignoring the question.  </p> <p>This issue is of importance to the Deputy Leader in the context of Ireland West Airport, Knock, and to colleagues from Cork in the context of Cork Airport.  There is a fundamental problem, which is that 90% of aeroplanes that leave this country do so from Dublin Airport.  That is why a rapid recovery in airport traffic leads to chaos such as ensued at the weekend.  It could have been avoided if these Ministers had taken the time to listen to any member of the transport committee in the past 18 months but, of course, they did not do so.  They ignored the questions and now we see the chaos that has ensued.  I am asking for a debate on the matter because I think Members on the Government side need to recognise that their Ministers are not listening and are not interested.  The evidence for that is clear from the Commencement matter dealt with earlier.</p> <p>In the few seconds I have left, I raise the fact that last week the Passport Office turned down the passport application of a man with throat cancer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It turned down the application after a week of lobbying, because it was not satisfied that the letter we produced as evidence that the poor man was extremely sick was not recent enough.  Having gone back and forth for five days, I cannot begin to tell the Deputy Leader how exasperated I am.  There is something fundamentally wrong in the Passport Office.  This Government continues to frustrate.  Where is the accountability for this?  We all know it has been failing.  People are hurting.  They are not getting their passports and they are not able to travel.  I found the experience completely deflating last week because there is a human being at the back of that, as there is for all of us.  We all know it is not good enough.  I ask for a debate on the matter.</p></speech>

I will have been in the House two years on 27 June.  For the two years I have been here, I have called numerous times for action on Traveller mental health.  The National Traveller Mental Health Network has also been calling for action on Traveller mental health.  I will have to go through these figures again.  I ask the Deputy Leader to bear in mind that they are not just statistics.  These are people within our Irish Travelling community.  One in 11 deaths in the Travelling community is caused by suicide.  It is 7% higher for Traveller men and 6% higher for Traveller women than people in the general population.  In the two years I have been here, numerous people within my community have died by suicide.</p> <p>With regard to the levels of internalised and externalised oppression that come with being a member of the Travelling community, we are treated worse than second-class citizens within Irish society.  Over the past two years, I have called on the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to meet with the National Traveller Mental Health Network.  I  have also tabled a Commencement matter very recently on it.  Unfortunately, I have no straight answers from the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  We are looking for a stand-alone national Traveller mental health strategy to deal with the Traveller mental health crisis in our community.</p> <p>Every Senator in this House has a role to play in protecting the Travelling community from dying by suicide.  The starting point to that is the Government, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and the Minister for Health coming together, meeting us half way and doing what they said they would do nearly three years ago, which was to implement a national Traveller mental health strategy.  That is nowhere to be seen.  I feel I have been a broken record for the past two years.  Unfortunately, I will keep carrying one message because that is what I was appointed to do and my community wants me to keep delivering this message.</p> <p>Will Senators stand with me, collectively, to write a letter to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and ask that the Taoiseach replies to the community, as he did the last day?  The community, however, was not very fond of the answer it got.  I ask that we are replied to in a respectable manner and that we see action after today's protest.  If there is any way we can come together to make some kind of action happen for our community, we would very much appreciate it.</p></speech>

There is a very interesting public discourse taking place on Molesworth Street.  I have experience of this issue from my time in local government and I fully support it.  By the way, I did not see any poster.</p> <p>I raise with the Leader the leaving and junior certificate examinations because we are now in the exam season.  I hope the plans made by the State Examinations Commission, SEC, will bear fruit because regardless of how much of the evaluation process is done in-school, a major part of the examinations will always be a written test to be evaluated by external examiners.  In recent years, the problem that has arisen, one which the pandemic covered over, has been a consistent shortage of qualified teachers taking up offers of employment as examination markers or correctors, whatever the term is.  It is easy to see why.  This is extremely difficult work.  I speak from experience.  Markers have to put in very long hours at the height of the summer holidays when they should be with their family.  In my time the remuneration was appalling but I am glad it has improved significantly, in some cases by 30% or 40%, although it is, of course, taxed.</p> <p>I am making an appeal today because there is intrinsic value to both schools and teachers in having teachers involved in the marking system.  It brings a wisdom and an understanding, which is of huge advantage to the teacher in his or her work and the pupils who will get an extra or inside sense of what it is about.  Many students do not give a good account of themselves in written examinations for many reasons.  Teachers who have gone through the system and have marked papers can bring back to their schools that extra sense that can give their pupils an edge.  I am calling for teachers and schools to take up the challenge.  Marking examination papers may not be hugely satisfying financially but it is a very rewarding experience overall. </p></speech>

Everyone was shocked and horrified that 1,000 people missed their flights from the airport last Sunday.  I echo the calls for an immediate recalibration of flights to have them moved from Dublin Airport to Cork Airport and, in particular, Shannon Airport, which has a state-of-the-art security system far ahead of that in place in Dublin Airport and can cope with volume.  They can also be moved to Irish West Airport at Knock, where appropriate.  We need that immediately.  The last thing this country needs is to have this happen again.  It is doing serious damage from a product perspective and from the perspective of Ireland being welcome.  People talk.  More than 1,000 people have been discommoded and whether they get their money back is not the point.  Some of them could not get hotel rooms in Dublin because of the shortage of hotel rooms.  This issue needs to be sorted.  Dublin Airport Authority need not expect the Minister to go out and solve the queues for it.  It is the State agency that has delegated responsibility to resolve this and it needs to do so urgently.</p> <p>I agree with Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan's analysis regarding the leaving certificate.  One issue with the leaving certificate needs to be addressed urgently, namely, the lack of access to examination papers for people with print disabilities and vision impairments.  I welcome Eithne Walsh from F&eacute;ach, the organisation that represents parents of visually impaired children and young people who are going through school.  It is not acceptable that the papers for the leaving certificate are not available in a digital form in order that people can use modern technology to access them.  We are an outlier in Europe on this matter.</p> <p>We need a date for when the leaving certificate results will be issued.  At a minimum, we need a date on which a date will be announced.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is totally unfair.</p></speech>

However, I would like to raise the issue of the Government cost of documents.  At the time of a cost-of-living crisis, we should be looking at any and all areas where we can ease financial burden where people may be experiencing it.</p> <p>The one fact that stands out when it comes to cost of Government documents is that they are not a discretionary expenditure.  When it comes to groceries, people might be able to choose a different brand.  When it comes to energy, perhaps a few euros can be shaved off a bill by switching provider.  However, there is only place to buy a passport and a driving licence.  It is &euro;20 a pop plus &euro;1.50 postage for a birth certificate, marriage certificate or a death certificate.  It sounds like a threat of a loan shark: &ldquo;You get married, pay me.  You have a kid, pay me.  You die, pay me.&rdquo;  Learning to drive is a real kicker too.  The theory test is &euro;45 and the provisional licence is &euro;35.  Government-mandated 12 lessons are &euro;545.  The driving test is &euro;85 and a driving licence is &euro;55.  It is &euro;765 before spending a cent on insurance, petrol or, indeed, the car itself.  It is &euro;75 for a passport and &euro;100 if you want the card too, and an extra &euro;5 for postage if you prefer not to do it online.</p> <p>The bottom line is there many expenses the Government cannot affect, yet there are also expenses that only the Government can affect.  Often, these are the ones that people have no choice but to pay.  Perhaps we could look at those prices and see if the Exchequer could allow the people some breathing room when it comes to these mandatory expenses.</p> <p>I thank Councillor Vincent Jackson for bringing this issue to my attention.  I was happy to raise it here today in the Seanad for him.</p></speech>

As the Leader knows, I tabled a Commencement matter about it previously, so I second his call for having a debate sooner rather than later and having the Minister in.</p> <p>Yesterday was a very sad day.  Former councillor and former Member of this House, Mary Jackman of Limerick, passed away.  She served two terms in the Seanad.  She was the first female cathaoirleach of Limerick County Council back in 1999.  Certainly, many people who would have served with her would have known what a live wire she was and how committed and dedicated she was to the people who elected her.  I pay sympathy to her husband, Nick, her daughter, Nicola, and her sister, Ursula, as well as the extended Furlong and Jackman families.  Certainly, she touched the lives of so many people.</p> <p>There has been reduced services at University Hospital Limerick, UHL, yet again, in terms of procedures and admissions.  It is not just at UHL.  It is also in St. John&rsquo;s and Nenagh.  Somebody in the hospital put out a notice apologising to people for the fact their procedures had to be cancelled due to the high numbers on trolleys.  I understand there are close to 90 people on trolleys in the hospital at present.  I wrote to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, asking when the independent review will take place and when we will know about it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have had no response to date.</p><p>It just beggars belief at this stage what is going on at University Hospital Limerick.

People are now afraid to go to the hospital, which is really not acceptable.  Will the Deputy Leader check with the Minister's office to see if she can get an answer to our questions?  At this stage I just do not know where to go any more for an answer.  This is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

I attended a public meeting last night in Bellurgan in County Louth attended by over 40 parents of children attending Bellurgan National School.  Some people may say this is too much of a parochial issue to bring up in the Seanad but I do so specifically because after more than ten years, people in the Bellurgan community cannot get a basic necessity like traffic calming measures outside the primary school.</p><p>Parents are not allowing their children to walk to school and they must drive their kids there because the building is on a regional road with such a high volume of traffic going past every day.  It is the only school on the entire Cooley Peninsula that does not have any form of traffic calming measures outside it.  I raise this in the Seanad today because after more than ten years of this matter being raised, we are still in the crux because Louth County Council is refusing to put in anything of real substance that would reduce the speed on the regional road.  It has put in traffic measures like signage etc. but we need a physical deterrent in the form of ramps or something like that.</p><p>I raise this today because there should be some sort of policy originating from the Department of Education providing guidance to schools and local authorities on the type of traffic calming measures which can be put in place outside schools.  It should not be an <i>&agrave;</i><b><i></i></b><i>la carte</i>option whereby some schools in communities have traffic calming measures while others do not.  The important aspect of Bellurgan National School is it has an autism spectrum disorder unit as well, which means there are vulnerable children in the school who may not have spatial awareness or awareness of danger posed to them right outside their front door.</p><p>I would really appreciate a debate in this House around traffic safety in particular outside our schools in rural communities like Bellurgan in County Louth.  It is a debate that has been overlooked in recent times because there is a different approach in different local authorities.  There is also a different approach in different communities or areas.  We need a wide-scale approach right across the country for traffic calming measures outside primary schools, and that is a debate I would really welcome with the Minister at some stage.</p></speech>

I attended the Traveller protest outside with many of our colleagues and it is time we stop fobbing off members of the Traveller community with committees and reports.  I served on the committee examining key issues affecting the Traveller community in a previous parliamentary term but we must get the party leaders around the table to start delivering for Travellers in this country.</p> <p>The tourism industry seems to be in chaos between hotel prices and the lack of taxis in this city, along with delays at Dublin Airport and the Passport Office.  Many of these matters could have been foreseen by the Government and with foresight and planning could have been avoided.  This city in particular does not seem to be functioning properly.  There are streams of people walking out of town on foot trying to hail taxis to get home at weekends and in most cases there are empty seats in cabs passing by, which is another ridiculous element.</p> <p>The report of the night-time economy task force called for the extension of eight new bus routes with 24-hour operation in Dublin.  There are currently three routes that function for 24 hours per day in addition to Nitelink.  Most people are probably not aware of them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a need for a step change in policy regarding the night-time economy when it comes to transport if we want people to change their habits and view the bus as an option after a night out.  In the presentations made to, and submissions received by, the night-time economy task force, the importance of more extensive late-night public transport as an essential support for workers and for patrons was consistently raised.  Ultimately, and although we all know this, I am reluctant to say it, I cannot imagine the city is a good place to visit now.  It is extremely expensive for visitors and for residents.  Equally, in many cases, the reward is dysfunction.  It does not represent good value for money.  Some elements of the industry, certainly, seem to be on the make.  We should rightly ask if the reduced VAT rate of 9% is being passed on to consumers.  In many cases, I do not think it is.  </p></speech>

The outrage stems from people having lost out on their holidays and missed flights.  These could have been events they had planned for a long time.  We must address the staffing issue at Dublin Airport.  A terrible attempt has been made to place the blame for these issues over the weekend on staff absences.  I saw reports stating there were 17 absences and that this led to the problems experienced in the airport.  I do not buy that explanation.</p> <p>In 2019, approximately 33 million passengers went through Dublin Airport without major incidents or delays.  Fast forward to 2022, and the numbers of passengers using the airport are at approximately 95% of the 2019 figures, yet these massive backlogs are being experienced.  The DAA, in its wisdom, introduced a redundancy package in 2020 that saw 300 experienced members of the airport security unit leave.  It is because of that loss that we are now dealing with these issues.  Those being recruited to posts are being taken on at a pay rate of &euro;14.14 an hour, yet they are expected to take on enormous responsibility for the security of the airport.  These newly recruited staff are also expected to come in under a variety of contracts.  This includes the flexi contract, under which people are expected to come in at different hours and to different parts of the airport. </p> <p>We must, therefore, ask serious questions of the DAA and, equally, of the Government.  It is not good enough for the Government to blame the DAA or pass the buck on to someone else.  The Government appointed the members of the authority to effectively run the airport.  The DAA has failed to provide an adequate service.  To be frank, as we are coming into one of the biggest weekends of travel in the year, it is unclear how these issues are going to be resolved any time soon.  We must see better pay for the staff concerned and more comprehensive and better contracts.  Ultimately, we must investigate how we lost those experienced officers in 2020 and whether some of them could be brought back into these roles.</p> <p>While we are all talking about travelling and the situation at Dublin Airport, it is important to say as well that we have a major staffing crisis in the health sector.  This is the silent recruitment and staffing crisis.  All of us in this Chamber have our stories of people being allocated home support hours and then finding they cannot be fulfilled.  As well as that, people are waiting three years and longer for a diagnosis from the new children's disability network teams.  I would like, therefore, a debate on the issue of recruitment in the health sector with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, because this is the hidden crisis.  Images of the scenes in Dublin Airport have been on our screens and we have also heard about the problems on the radio and read about them in the newspapers.  It is the hidden recruitment crisis in the HSE and the wider health service that I do not believe is getting sufficient attention.  We are all engaging with those people who talk to us about this in our own areas and, therefore, I would like the Minister for Health to come to the House to give a detailed explanation of what it is he is doing to address this staff recruitment crisis.</p></speech>

There were more than 400 people in the Raheen Woods Hotel in Athenry for a meeting to assess the rural social scheme, RSS, and of the T&uacute;s scheme.  Many points were raised, one of which was that it is becoming more difficult and challenging for people to get onto the schemes.  This is something that has to be raised.  We have been talking about it with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and with the Department of Social Protection, but we have to look at how these programmes are attractive for people who are unemployed.</p> <p>We need to look at things like the time it takes for people to become eligible to be on these programmes.  It is not enough that there is such a long waiting time before people can go onto these programmes.  We heard many examples last night of people who have done these programmes, be they T&uacute;s or RSS, who have then gone back to education to do a degree, a certificate or a diploma.  These programmes are very good at re-engaging people who may have been out of the workforce for a while, or giving them the confidence to get back in, perhaps take on a new career or do something different.</p> <p>One of the examples we heard last night was of someone working with the Brothers of Charity, which is a phenomenal charity based in the west, but in particular we have many residential units in Ballinasloe.  The person started working there, was doing administrative work but started then to think about developing a social caring role.  This person was able to develop a new career out of this.</p> <p>There are many positive benefits but we need to look at the challenges.  There are so many people going back to work and we have a higher percentage and number of people coming back to work than we had pre-Covid-19.  We still have people on our live register and we need to look at how to make it attractive for those people to start doing programmes like RSS and T&uacute;s.  RSS is linked to farm assist and affords farmers an alternative form of income.</p></speech>

Senator Kyne kicked off by speaking about the scenes we all witnessed in Dublin Airport, the very significant queues and those who missed their flights.  Other Members raised similar issues around the airport, namely, Senators Gavan, Sherlock, Conway and Maria Byrne.  I am happy to report that the Leader of the House boarded a plane this morning from Terminal 1 and, in her own tweet, said that she arrived at the airport at 4.20 a.m. and was through to the gate at 5.45 a.m. for her 6.50 a.m. flight.  It seems things have improved today and it is good to acknowledge that.  I can imagine that, for staff morale, it was difficult to watch one&rsquo;s workplace receiving such negativity, even though it is understandable that people were annoyed.</p> <p>It is also worth acknowledging that other international airports such as Heathrow and Schiphol in Amsterdam are experiencing similar problems, so we are not alone in that regard.  This is also to acknowledge that we can do a great deal better and it is welcome that Dublin Airport is refunding passengers and acknowledging that it has to compensate people for loss.  That does not compensate for the stress involved, particularly if you are there with an elderly person or with young children and are not able to get through to your flight.</p> <p>Certainly there are questions to be asked, as Senator Sherlock said, around why we are struggling to attract staff.  We had two years where, effectively, we had no air travel.  The airports completely closed operations to a certain extent, they have to build back up and it has not been that easy.  There is a longer lead-in time to vet staff because of the place in which they are working and the additional responsibilities which staff working in that space have to protect that gateway to the country, as referred to by Senator Sherlock.</p> <p>I also take on board what the other Senators have said, such as Senators Gavan, Conway and Maria Byrne around rebalancing and the fact we have other international airports like Knock, Cork and Shannon that could be doing a great deal more through the scheduling of flights out of those airports to try to rebalance across the regions.  There is a commitment from Government to do that and I know that my own local Ireland West Airport Knock is back thriving again and is a very significant resource to the region.  Many people use this airport not just for holidays but for getting out to work every week.  People fly out and fly back in again.  It is important to support the regional airports.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke this about twice completing the Stockholm marathon - well done on that.  I would not even attempt one, never mind two.</p></speech>

He has requested at debate around technology and the digital euro which is coming down the line.  It is unlikely we will get a chance to have this debate before recess with the amount of legislation coming through the House.  Certainly when we get into the autumn session it would be a good debate to schedule.  We will make this request.</p> <p>I commend Wexford County Council for launching its second age-friendly strategy with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  It is very welcome to see.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke very passionately about the five soldiers in the 85th Infantry Battalion who are still waiting for their medals.  Private Billy Kedian, Lieutenant Morgan, Sergeant Spellman and Privates Carr and Clarke.  I concur with all of the Senator's remarks and I thank him for putting it on the record of the House.  We hope to see this matter resolved without further delay.</p> <p>Senator Paul Gavan spoke about Shannon Airport and rebalancing.  I have dealt with this.  He also spoke about the Passport Office.  Almost every Member of the House has spoken about the passport service in recent times.  It is a disaster zone for certain passports, mainly first-time passports for children.  I do not know what to say about the man who has throat cancer.  It is an appalling story.  I hope he gets sorted with the document he is entitled to get.</p></speech>

It is very unfortunate this has happened.  All public representatives are trying our best to assist people.  The Passport Office has increased its staffing by 50% but it is still not enough.  The blockage seems to be where paperwork is involved.  It is not digital applications.  If people are sending post in any form, for example, for children's first passports, there is a significant blockage.  We have requested the Department and the Passport Office to try to improve the service for people.  It is taking a very long time.  Families and individuals are missing out on holidays.  It is not a good service we are giving at the moment.</p> <p>Senator Flynn spoke very passionately, as she always does, about the Traveller community.  She spoke about those who have lost their lives to suicide and the much awaited national Traveller mental health strategy.  Many of us walked past the demonstration outside the gates of Leinster House on Kildare Street.  I wish them well.  It is a very colourful and positive demonstration.  I encourage Members to get out.  Senator Flynn has rejoined the demonstration.  She let me know she would be leaving for it.</p> <p>Senator O'Sullivan spoke about the leaving certificate and junior certificate exams.  He encouraged as many teachers as possible to come on board to assist in marking exams because of the added benefits that they know their students and their capabilities.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about the airports in Dublin, Shannon and Cork and the need to rebalance.  Once again he raised the very important issue of moving towards digital leaving certificate papers to facilitate those students who might have additional needs.  It seems we are a bit behind the curve on that front.  The Senator continues to raise the issue.</p> <p>Senator Keogan spoke about the cost of documents.  She made a valid point that it is quite costly, particularly to get a driver licence.  There is a long way to go to get to that point.  The Government is looking at cost-of-living measures.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, spoke at the weekend about the work happening in that Department.  All Departments are looking at anywhere a payment or cost is prescribed by the Government to reduce them across the board.  This is being looked at.  I am sure the Senator is aware the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, has announced that leaving certificate fees for this year are to be waived.  The Government is doing everything it can to try to reduce the cost burden on families and individuals.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the sad passing of former councillor and Senator, Mary Jackman, from Limerick.  She was the first female mayor of Limerick.  We send our condolences to the Jackman and Furlong families on the passing of Mary.</p> <p>As she has often done, Senator Maria Byrne also raised the issue of University Hospital Limerick.  I am sorry I do not have any further information.  We know there will be an independent review but I cannot answer as to why the hospital appears to be an outlier.  There are consistent problems with patients on trolleys and overcrowding.  I cannot imagine how difficult it is for staff and patients.  There is clearly a very big problem in the hospital because other hospitals have issues but not on the scale we see in Limerick.  There is clearly a very specific issue in that hospital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Warfield spoke in support of the comments on the Traveller community made by Senator Flynn.  He spoke about the tourism industry.  He also spoke about the difficulty in getting taxis in the city, which is something that I can attest to.  I think that we all have had trouble getting a taxi in the last while.  There seem to be no taxis at certain times of the day and night.  Taxi drivers do not seem to use apps or perhaps turned off their link to apps because it seems to be easier to hail a taxi and pay by cash.  Recently I heard a conversation on radio with a journalist on the difficulties in getting taxis and her name escapes me.  I know that she is an Australian woman who works as a fact checker for <i>The Journal.  </i>She made a point about women's safety in that if a woman cannot get a taxi home then one will think twice about going out at night because getting home is a real problem.  We definitely need to look at this issue.  Again, because of the last couple of years where there was a very limited night-time economy a lot of taxi people may have left the service.  In addition, the country is only really open since February, even though it feels like we have been open for a lot longer, and we are still building back up these services.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that the cost of hotels is extortionate in the capital city.  I urge hoteliers to reflect on the prices they charge people because not only will they put people off travelling from somewhere in the country to the capital and deter tourists from coming here but people will remember the extortionate prices charged by some but not all hoteliers, in particular in the capital city.</p></speech>

There must be a two-way street and people must acknowledge that significant supports were provided during these difficult years.</p></speech>

The latter is an ongoing problem.  We have found it very difficult to recruit staff at all levels of the health service and recruitment takes an inordinate amount of time.  Many posts have been provided for by the Government and there is funding to pay staff yet we struggle to entice staff to work in the health service.  Clearly, the problem is not just due to salaries and we must work on conditions such as long hours.  Recently junior doctors have spoken out about their difficulties in working 24 and 36 hours straight without a break.  Therefore, we must do a lot of work on the conditions of work but the solution is like a chicken and egg scenario.  One must recruit staff to make conditions better for all staff and provide more cover yet without recruiting staff it is very hard to address that issue.</p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke about the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s schemes.  These are hugely important schemes for towns and villages across the country.  I agree with her that we should make it much easier to get people into those schemes because a limit has been placed on when one can join and how long one can remain on the schemes.  We can address these issues because many people would love to work on these schemes and they are valuable to local communities.  Numerous little jobs around towns and villages would never get done only for these schemes.  The Senator is right that these schemes can be a really good way of re-activating people and getting them back into the workplace or education.  These schemes are a good way to get people back out and about, which should be our priority.  The Government is working hard on getting people back into work.  Again, we are close to full employment.  There will always be an element of people on the live register for other reasons because they are unable to work, which is completely understandable.  For anyone who can and would like to get back into the workplace or education these schemes could be one of the avenues to do so.</p></speech>

I am pleased to bring forward Government amendments providing that board members shall have certain expertise, two members shall be nominated by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and one member shall be nominated by each of my colleagues, the Ministers for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We also propose that a member be nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Two members shall be appointed on the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service and three members by the registration body.  The effect of these amendments is to strengthen the independence of the board.  The board will be completely independent of the registration body.</p> <p>I welcome the amendments brought forward and the Government amendments I have tabled reflect the discussions we have had with Members on both sides of the House.</p></speech>

If he is not going to accept any of the amendments, I would like him to state that.</p> <p>I had a group from the Amalgamated Plumbing and Heating Contractors of Ireland in the House.  It represents 60% of the industry.  There are 3,500 small-to-medium contractors in the mechanical building services sector.  They have raised concerns regarding the Bill.  The mechanical building services sector is recognised as a separate specialised area.  The minimum qualifications are QQI level 6.  The new Bill adds an extra layer of regulation and administration.  Gas installers are already regulated by the RGI.  Oil boiler installations are regulated by OFTEC.  The Bill proposes a new regulator for plumbing, namely, the construction industry register Ireland.  There are far too many regulatory bodies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What we need is a stronger regulatory body.  This proposal would remove cowboys from the industry.  It would reduce the level of unnecessary bureaucracy.  It would enhance the sector to deliver on the climate action target and the retrofit plan for the Government.  I request the Minister to include that provision if he can.  Certainly, the mechanical services have also asked that he would do so.</p></speech>

I also thank the sector for its engagement on this important legislation to put the regulation of the providers of building works and building control on a statutory footing, which is what we need.  I do not envisage this will be an extra layer of regulation and I will explain why.</p> <p>I will not be accepting these amendments.  They seek, as the Senator said, to provide an exemption from registration for anyone who provides mechanical building services.  They also seek to require a report to be prepared on how mechanical building services can be exempted from the Act.  The building regulations apply to the installation of building services.  Therefore, they will be subject to the Act.  That is important.  As opposed to creating another of regulation, as the Senator rightly said, it will take those who are operating in the grey economy and those who are not properly qualified out of contracts that are provided and it will let people know who the qualified contractors are.</p> <p>Having listened to those in the sector, I advise the Senator the Bill specifically exempts those who provide electrical works performed by a registered electrical contractor and gas works performed by a registered gas installer.  For the work that has already been undertaken, it will specifically exempt those.  As I said, they are already registered with the Register of Electrical Contractors of Ireland, RECI, or the Register of Gas Installers of Ireland, RGII, and nothing will change in that space for that specific work they are doing.  It will not require another registration if they are only doing those elements of work, but where they are carrying out other building works, they must fall under this new regime.  I think it will be advantageous for them.  I thank the Senator and the sector for their engagement on that.  This legislation will not provide another layer of regulation for contractors.  If anything, it will provide real security for the many thousands of really good contractors and tilt the balance in their favour when they are operating in the field against other contractors who may be operating in the grey economy.</p></speech>

The construction industry register is currently located on a voluntary basis in the head office of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF.  Criteria for appointing the registration body under this Bill is essentially designed so that it can be the CIF.  We do not believe, as I said on previous Stages, that it is appropriate for a register of this kind to be located in the main industry lobby group for the construction sector.  This is about ensuring there is public confidence in the industry.  It makes no sense for this to be located in the head office of the CIF.  It is a conflict of interest.  We propose an alternative: that it be located within the national building control office, which was created following the issues at Priory Hall.  Its job is to try to improve standards in building control across local authorities.  It also contributes towards better data and, therefore, it is much better placed to be the registration authority.  Given everything we have seen, from mica to pyrite to Priory Hall and flat complexes in Dublin, people have to have confidence.  Given there is a lobby group going to do this register, it would be appropriate to amend that to locate it within the national building control office.</p></speech>

We support Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment, particularly as Sinn F&eacute;in designates and specifies the national building control office.  This was also raised in the D&aacute;il.  It is a very dangerous precedent effectively to have a lobby group serve as regulator under this legislation.  We see today from FOI requests that were released to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that the CIF had a huge input into the drafting of this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister that in setting up statutory building control to ensure the lobby group would not have responsibility for the register.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have seen things such as what happened in 2016, for example, where the Construction Industry Federation promised that if we reduced minimum standards, it would increase supply, which did not happen.

I just want to explain why.  Amendment No. 8 would seek to disqualify a trade union from being appointed as the registration body.  Amendment No. 10 would seek to provide that the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office, NBCO, will be appointed the registration body.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the Bill should not name the body that is appointed as the registration body.  There is no body specifically mentioned in the Bill.  Where a body is appointed and is not performing the functions required, another entity may be appointed to perform the functions of the registration body under the Bill, without any amendment being required to primary legislation.</p> <p>In the previous amendments on the construction of the board as well, we have made some changes.  This will be completely independent, and rightly so.  We need to get this register onto a statutory footing now.  There are very good contractors out there who are competing against a small number in the grey economy and they require a level playing pitch.  We cannot delay this.  </p> <p>I envisage that the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, will be appointed as the registration body.  It is a registered trade union.  It is preferable that a body with experience and expertise in the construction industry performs this function, similar to how the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland and the Society of Chartered Surveys Ireland operate statutory registers for architects and surveyors, respectively.  There is no question we have many legacy issues that I am dealing with and I will agree with Senators Moynihan and Warfield on this.  I see that the quality of the work that is being done now when I visit the many sites across the country is exceptional.</p> <p>There are a number of safeguards in place to ensure and maintain the independence of this registration body.  The body will have delegated responsibility for the day-to-day maintenance of the register within the confines of the specific and limited parameters set out in this Bill.  The board of the registration body will be completely independent.  The independence of the body will be maintained through following measures, and it is important these are important these are put on the record of the Seanad: all powers of the registration body will be prescribed by legislation; all competency requirements for registration will be recommended by the board and prescribed by the Minister; the board will make decisions in relation to all sanctions, including removal from the register; removal from the register must be confirmed by the High Court; all prosecutions under the Act will be taken by the board or the Director of Public Prosecutions; all members of the appeals committee will be independent from the board and the registration body; and the Bill allows the functions of the registration body to be transferred if the body is not performing the functions appropriately. </p> <p>In response to Senator Moynihan&rsquo;s comment on Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, any contact between the Department and the CIF was to ensure that the industry was able to review the Bill from a practical operational perspective and offer practical suggestions.  The policies of the Bill were not subject to change following the consultation.  I never met with them either.  This is about its practical operation.  Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan might want to put a slant on it and that is fine.  I am used to that.  I am more than happy with the robust structures that we put in place here.  We need to get this register on a statutory basis before the summer recess.  Therefore, I am opposing both amendments.</p></speech>

To this day, we are still looking at a register that is located within the industry.  If the Minister envisages that will be the Construction Industry Federation and the Bill is designed in such a way that it will be the Construction Industry Federation, it is ironic that we cannot prescribe in legislation who it will be.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In this case it is that it would be the national building control office.

Section 9 allows the Minister to appoint a person to carry out periodic inspections, reviews and audits in relation to the performance of the registration body and also to furnish a report.  The person, in this instance, is likely to be a professional body or professional auditing body and, therefore, it is not appropriate that the person be appointed through the Public Appointments Service.  All appointments will be made in line with public procurement procedures.</p></speech>

I welcome the amendments on this section regarding the appointment of the appeals committee.  Similar amendments were tabled when the Bill was progressing through the D&aacute;il.  At that stage, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, undertook to review the section and to bring forward amendments.  I am pleased to table these amendments, which provide that all ordinary members of the appeals committee shall be recruited through the Public Appointments Service.</p></speech>

It is an important change.  The previous iteration would have excluded anything in the past, whereas we are now capturing that in the previous ten years.  People may have been convicted under the Building Control Act in the previous ten years and it is right and proper for the public to know that.  That is why we are introducing this in the first place.  It is only right that we are able to go back ten years.  I am sure the provision can be kept under review in future.</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator that failure to comply with building regulations is very serious.  However, it is a matter for the building control authorities.

For example, if a registered provider is messing and a complaint is made to the registration authority, the provider can perhaps be sanctioned or struck off the register, but that is no good for redress.  There should be compensation for the remediation of works.  We wanted this section to go further.  Obviously, our amendment has been ruled out of order, so I will not speak to it.  We would a provision to be inserted dealing with remediation or providing for compensation for the remediation of building defects caused by a registered provider.  If a consumer who gets work done finds that something goes wrong and then checks the register and finds that the registered provider was not registered to do the work, it is not great if the registered provider is just struck off the list.  There should be some provision for compensation as well.</p></speech>

The register is a register of competence.  Where there are issues with regard to a provider who is struck off the register because their work is substandard, the homeowner, in that instance, will be able to lodge a complaint on the building control side and will also have recourse via insurance.  Obviously, we are dealing with other significant matters relating to apartment defects, which I intend to bring forward soon, once I receive the report.  It is a big issue in our cities predominantly, but not exclusively.  We are also advancing the scheme on defective concrete blocks.  I intend to have that legislation passed in advance of the summer recess.</p></speech>

They bring into effect the commitment, and the Government's commitment, under Housing for All to remove disincentives against rental or vacant properties by participating in the fair deal scheme in a way that is targeted, equitable, evidence-based and provides for appropriate safeguards for vulnerable older people.</p> <p>Amendment No. 54 provides for the change to the assessment methodology within the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act.  It enables eligible rental income to be assessed at 40% rather than the current 80%, which is a very significant change.  This supports the Government's policy intention, which as I said is to incentivise the rental of homes owned by participants in this scheme that otherwise may remain vacant.  Subsections 1 and 2 relate to Part 1(a) and 2 of the Schedule to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, which sets out the new relevant steps.  This will be reviewed after three or six months after we see how the scheme operates at the 40% level.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 49 and 50 are consequential amendments to make necessary changes to the definition of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, which relate to rental income.</p> <p>Amendment No. 51 creates a requirement for the HSE to report annually on the impact of the policy change.  The amendment sets out the specific items and pieces of information that the report should cover.  The report will be submitted to the Minister for Health.  This will ensure that the Government obtains an accurate picture of the ongoing impact of the policy measure.  Similar provisions have been put in place with previous changes in the nursing homes support scheme.</p> <p>Separate from the annual report established by the last amendment, amendment No. 52 sets out a requirement for a review of the scheme to be carried out after the policy change has been in operation for six months so that will be the end of this year.  The review will be submitted to the Minister not later than three months at the end of that six-month period and will be laid before the Oireachtas.</p> <p>Amendment No. 53 allows the Government, based on that review, to further lower the rate at which rental income is assessed for the purpose of the nursing homes support scheme.  The amendment also gives the power to the Government, on receipt of the review required by amendment No. 52, to request a further review to be made.</p> <p>These are significant changes that we hope will free up vacant properties where people are participating in the fair deal scheme.</p></speech>

I understand and appreciate the concerns in some quarters that these provisions encourage the movement of people into nursing homes.  We need to look at them in the reverse and see the benefit of these homes, which are vacant in the case where a family member is already in a nursing home, being brought back into productive use for housing purposes.</p> <p>I believe that the legislation does not go far enough with the 40% level.  There is probably an acknowledgement of that within the framing of this legislation in saying that there is going to be a review after six months.  I anticipate that the review will recommend further reducing the rate of 40% of assessed income because we need to incentivise people.  It is a great burden on families to get a loved one's home into a particular state to be able to rent it out.  I mean there are valuables in that house that have belonged to family members for generations.  To clear a house when somebody is in a nursing home brings a final realisation that he or she will not be moving back into his or her home, which is a step that many families are not ready to take.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Families are certainly not ready to take that step when the income is being used to pay for the fair deal scheme in the first instance.  It is welcome that we are moving to a rate of 40%.  We need to go further in reducing the assessed income to encourage more properties to come back into circulation for individuals and families.  That is what we are all about in Government.  I believe we have not gone far enough at this time but I believe we will move a little further on it by the end of the year.</p></speech>

The amendments proposed to be made to the Affordable Housing Act are of a purely technical nature.  They do not represent any policy departure from the Government's stated intentions under Housing For All.  As colleague will know, the Affordable Housing Act passed in the Seanad without a division, and passed in the D&aacute;il by 101 votes to eight.  These specific amendments are technical in nature.</p> <p>Amendment Nos. 57 to 60, inclusive, all amend Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act.  I will speak to these in advance of amendment No. 56.  As members will be aware, Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Act sets out the legislative basis for the local authority affordable purchase scheme, which I am glad to say is under way and the regulations are published, under which local authorities will make homes available to eligible buyers at prices that are significantly below the market value of the home and derived from the buyer's mortgage-funded purchasing power.  In return, the local authority will take a percentage equity interest in the value of the home equivalent to the discount from an open market value at the time of purchase.</p> <p>As enacted, section 13 of the Affordable Housing Act defines how this equity share interest held by the local authority is to be secured and provides that it may be recorded by the Property Registration Authority.  Again, this is a technical amendment.  The power of the Property Registration Authority to enter inhibitions in the Land Registry is not new.  As can be seen from the language proposed in amendment No. 58, it is a for the avoidance of doubt.  Amendments Nos. 57, 59 and 60 are the only consequential amendments.  They remove mentions of a burden in the Land Registry and providing for the entry of an inhibition instead, without changing any other aspects of the local authority affordable purchase scheme.</p> <p>On amendment No. 56 and Part 4 of the Affordable Housing Act, this amendment inserts a new section 41A into Part 4.  It makes no changes to the existing section 41 in Part 4, which already provides that the Minister may invest public funds in a special purpose vehicle which will assist with the purchase of new homes in the private market by taking a percentage equity share in the value of the purchased homes.  On the advice of the Attorney General and following engagement with the Property Registration Authority, it was decided that it would be preferable to give an explicit statutory basis for two points of the first home scheme, specifically concerning registration and conveyancing.  Subsections (1) and (2) of the new section 41A do for the first home scheme exactly what amendment No. 57 does for the local authority affordable purchase scheme.  The rest of the new section 41A inserted by amendment No. 56 sets out, to avoid any misunderstandings, how sale and conveyance would work for a home that was purchased under the first home scheme.</p> <p>Taken together, these technical amendments to Parts 2 and 4 of the Affordable Housing Act strengthen and improve the security of the equity share interests, provide a clear statutory basis for what is already addressed by contractual relationships, and seek to avoid any misunderstandings with the new shared equity model.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Given their nature and purpose and specifically the improvement they will make to the affordable purchase elements of the Affordable Housing Act, I thank the Senators for their indulgence with this.</p></speech>

Will the Minister comment on the date for the commencement of the shared equity scheme?  We are hoping that it will be in place for July.  Will he confirm that is the case?  In my area in County Waterford, 119 homes have been approved by the Minister under the affordable purchase scheme on three sites in Waterford city.  I welcome that.  We need to see more of those in the coming months and years.  Work is already under way on two of those three sites.  We will see families in those homes within 12 to 18 months with an equity stake being taken by the State to assist young families in getting a foot on the property ladder.  That is a very welcome addition to the property market in Ireland.  I appreciate the frustration of people who have found it difficult to bridge the gap between the maximum mortgage they can get and the cost of a market unit.  We are introducing the two schemes to assist those very people to get a foot on the ladder.  It can also be combined with the help to buy scheme which provides 10% support towards a deposit.  There are many measures the benefit of which people will start to see very shortly.  As politicians we are acutely aware of the frustration that exists.  If we could have these homes delivered more quickly, we would, but in my own county I am glad to say that those 119 homes are well under way.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

Provision of affordable homes is crucially important.  There are boots on the ground on nine schemes at the moment.  We will deliver homes this year.  These amendments are of a technical nature.

The Government proposes in subsection (12A) the substitution of &ldquo;an application in respect of the following development shall be deemed not to have required, and not to require, a determination as to whether an environmental impact assessment is required&rdquo; for the current wording, which is that &ldquo;if an application for permission had been made in respect of the following development before it was commenced, the application shall be deemed not to have required a determination referred to at subsection (12)(b)&rdquo;.</p><p>My concern is that, at the moment, there is within the principal Act a specification that a planning authority should be refusing to consider an application to retain unauthorised development of land, where the authority decides that if an application for permission had been made in respect of the development concerned before it was commenced, that application would have required that either an environmental impact assessment or a determination as to whether an environmental impact assessment was required, or that an appropriate assessment or a determination as to whether an appropriate assessment was required.  Effectively, at the moment, one cannot give this kind of retrospective permission in situations where there would have been a requirement for a determination on an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment, or, indeed, an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment.</p><p>The concern is that the proposed changes would mean one was implying they were deemed not to have required an assessment.  My amendment would effectively remove the change.  However, the Government could also bring a more moderate change, for example, that one should not be giving retrospective consent where, if a determination had been conducted, it would have been found to require an environmental impact assessment.  Effectively, my amendment would remove the provision.  I put it to the Minister that we certainly should not have a situation where, if a determination had been carried out, it would have been found to have an environmental impact assessment as a requirement.  There certainly should not be a situation where such a project would be getting substitute consent or be eligible for substitute consent.</p><p>This goes to the core of what we will be discussing today, which is that there are reasons we have these processes in terms of the process and in terms of determining whether or not an environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment is required and then, not in many cases but in some cases, in situations where it will be determined that they are required.  What we certainly should not have is a situation where the mechanisms outlined in this Bill effectively provide a way around that process.  That is the concern at the core of my amendment.  Effectively, I am opposing the proposed language being inserted in this section 3(b) by the Government.</p></speech>

It would effectively allow a drafting inconsistency in subsection 12A of section 34 of the principal Act, which would not reflect the amendment to section 37(12) of the principal Act.  Section 3(b) is actually a technical drafting amendment to amend section 34(12A) of the principal Act.  The amendments in paragraph (b) reflect the related amendments at section 34(12), which amendments, in turn, have been introduced by section 3(a) of this Bill.  The Senator has not sought to amend the main amendments to section 34(12) introduced by section 3(a) of the Bill.</p> <p>For information, these amendments to section 3(a) are technical drafting amendments that have reformed section 34(12A) and (12)(b) of the principal Act on the basis that section 34(12)(a) already requires the planning authority to consider both whether a mandatory above-threshold environmental impact assessment, EIA, is required and to make a screening determination in the case of sub-threshold EIA development.  Following this, section 34(12)(b), which prohibits planning authorities from considering retention applications for developments that would have required a determination as to whether an EIA is, indeed, to be carried out, that is, where a sub-threshold EIA development is screened in to require an EIA, is being deleted as it is superfluous.  A screening of the EIA is a prerequisite for section 34(12A) to apply.  I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

That is why I had not sought to remove section 3(a) and section 3(b).  Perhaps the Minister will confirm if it is the case that the mechanisms in respect of substitute consent will not be applied in regard to the unauthorised development of land where an EIA or appropriate assessment is required, or is determined to be required.  If he could confirm that, it would allow me to withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

As the Minister has described it, the legislation does allow that one would not be able to give substitute consent in situations where either an EIA or an appropriate assessment might be required.  I want to be very clear on that.  However, there is still a concern in regard to situations where a determination might have been required.  I am trying to figure out how the determination as to whether an EIA or appropriate assessment is needed happens in that situation.  However, I take at face value the Minister's claim that this is potentially technical and can be addressed technically.  I will withdraw the amendment at this time.</p></speech>

Basically, what happens next in that instance?  It would be appropriate that in situations where there is a refusal of an application for substitute consent, the board would also indicate what are the appropriate actions, whether that be the removal of a development or the cessation of activity in respect of a development, such as in the context of quarries and so forth.  After a refusal, what comes next?  According to European law, refusal of applications for substitute consent should be the norm, given that substitute consent under the EU signal can only be granted in exceptional circumstances.  The very nature of it means grants of substitute consent should be exceptional.  It might be expected that it would be the norm for such applications to be refused.  In those circumstances, it is important we start sending a signal in respect of what follows a refusal.</p></speech>

It seeks to amend section 5 of the Bill by inserting a new paragraph to the effect that "the Board shall indicate to the applicant what further actions may be required in light of such a refusal".  I must oppose the amendment, which appears to have been misplaced in terms of its proposed insertion into the Bill as neither section 5 of the Bill as proposed by the Government nor section 37L of the principal Act contain any provisions relating to a refusal.  Refusals in respect of an application under section 37L for permission are addressed under section 37N of the principal Act, but it is not clear to me whether the amendment was intended for inclusion in section 37N instead.  If that is the case, that could be considered on Report Stage.</p></speech>

In effect, the amendment should be inserted at line 27.  It seems to have been placed incorrectly.  Effectively, the issue that is being addressed in section 4 is the issuing of refusals, so that is the section where the amendment would properly lie.  Nonetheless, it would still be useful at this point, in order that we can go forward as constructively as possible in respect of Report Stage, for the Minister to indicate his perspective on the inclusion of requirements with a refusal.  The correct placing of the amendment should be on line 27, following the issuing of a refusal.  As regards the substantive issue, to facilitate effective discussion on an amendment on this issue on Report Stage, I would appreciate it if the Minister were to indicate his perspective on the inclusion of consequent actions along with the issuing of a refusal.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight certain issues in this regard.  A major concern relates to section 5(a), which introduces a new subsection that would, in effect, allow a person applying for substitute consent in respect of the development of land that the person has undertaken without appropriate permissions to apply at the same time for a new and different development of the land.  As the land is the substitute of an application for substitute consent, the person, in effect, is being allowed to apply for a new unrelated development on the site and, indeed, development of land adjoining the land in question.  This is significant because what the Minister is doing through that paragraph is providing a fast-track for persons to send their applications for planning directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, bypassing the normal and proper planning processes.  It acts as a reward.  It is not simply that a development that was not given proper permission in the first place may be allowed to be retained, but that a person will be able to go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of new developments.  This is significant and concerning because it absolutely guts the planning process.</p><p>It creates a direct conflict with previous rulings of the European court in respect of the idea that substitute consent should be exceptional.  I refer to the ruling relating to a decision of the Irish High Court in a substitute of consent case.  In the context of the limits on member states, paragraphs 57 and 58 of the ruling in case C-215/06, the Commission <i>v</i>. Ireland, which is the original Derrybrien case, state:</p> <blockquote> 	While Community law cannot preclude the applicable national rules from allowing, in certain cases, the regularisation of operations or measures which are unlawful ... such a possibility should be subject to the conditions that it does not offer the persons concerned the opportunity to circumvent the Community rules or to dispense with applying them, and that it should remain the exception.<br /><br />A system of regularisation, such as that in force in Ireland [or the new one proposed here], ...[must not] have the effect of encouraging developers to forgo ascertaining whether intended projects satisfy the criteria. </blockquote> <p>It is clear that the Minister should not be encouraging or rewarding those who do not engage in proper processes.  In effect, this paragraph rewards that practice.  One would build something, apply for substitute consent and, along with that substitute consent, stick in what else one would like on that site and on an adjoining site.  This is in a context where these signals are being sent direct to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is losing approximately 80% of the cases, and those cases, in terms of judicial reviews, relate to proper process.  There are significant issues at the moment in respect of conflict of interest and review of the operation of the board.  Through this paragraph, the Minister is stating there is a fast track and that a person who did something improperly in the past will now get to skip the normal application to a local authority, the normal processes in respect of public consultation and the other normal processes and simply go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is the danger here.  That directly conflicts with the rulings stating that there should not be any effect of encouraging developments.  The paragraph creates a perverse incentive.  That is extremely dangerous and would lead to poor-quality developments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It creates a very real danger that at the minimum there would be a perception of an inappropriate dynamic between An Bord Plean&aacute;la and developers whereby they are in conversations that others, such as local authorities and the public, are no longer part of.  This is a serious concern.<br/><br/>Other parts of section 5 also raise issues.  I am afraid I will have to dwell on many substantive points because they are in the section.  Section 5(f) inserts a new provision into section 37L.  This provides:</p><blockquote>	(a) subsection (5), as substituted by section 5 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2022, applies, and<br /><br />(b) the applicant for substitute consent informs the Board by notice in writing prior to it making its decision in respect of the application for substitute consent, in this subsection referred to as the 'first application', that he or she intends to submit an application for permission under subsection (1), as substituted by that section 5, in this subsection referred to as the 'second application' </blockquote><p>This would allow for prior consultation between the developer and the board.  There is concern about the dynamic this creates.  Prior to the process there can be a conversation between developers and An Bord Plean&aacute;la on what might happen.  The reason this matters is because overall the thrust of the Bill is removing some of the mechanisms and safeguards.  While the substitute consent route was imperfect, at least it had some element of balance.<br/><br/>Previously if people wanted substitute consent they would either apply for the right to seek substitute consent and be subject to some form of scrutiny, or a local authority would give notice that substitute consent should be sought for a development.  Now the power is shifting incredibly heavily into the hands of the developers.  The local authority, as we will come to in later sections, will no longer have the right to demand that people seek substitute consent.  Instead it will be directly up to the developer to decide to seek substitute consent.  The conversation will be solely between the developer and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Developers will also get to have a conversation prior to the process when they can decide whether they want to seek substitute consent.  If developers have a conversation with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and realise they might not get substitute consent in respect of a development there is no mechanism for the State or a local authority to insist that they apply.  People can have a conversation to see whether they are likely to get substitute consent and then decide whether to go ahead.  This goes against the dynamic of it being the exception rather than the rule.  It goes against proper process.  These are the mechanisms for the first and second applications.<br/><br/>I also seek to delete section 5(g).  It relates to the question of quarries in particular.  One of the concerns that I will raise again on Report Stage is the question of whether quarrying should be allowed to continue when a substitute consent application is under way.  I will come back to quarries in more detail when I will have an opportunity to do so later.  We know this is one of the forms of development that is happening.  We do not want to create dynamics whereby while an application for substitute consent is under way people can intensify their extraction in a &quot;last chance saloon&quot; approach with no limits.  Certainly there should not be continued activity in a development that does not have proper planning in a situation where substitute consent has not yet been granted.<br/><br/>I have other issues regarding section 5 that I want to highlight for Report Stage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I mentioned the continued extraction in quarrying.  I should also note that the idea people would be able to apply for a new provision for quarrying on adjoining land at a time when initial quarrying has not been authorised is a real concern.<br/><br/>I oppose section 5 because it effectively gives developers with unlawful developments a key power.  They can write to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to require it to delay deciding on an undecided application for substitute consent already before the board.  This delay would be to allow the owner of an unlawful development to prepare an application for a new development to be considered alongside the substitute consent.  The competent authority should be addressing these issues with speed and priority.  The priority with an unlawful development should be to get it addressed immediately.  The issue I have mentioned with regard to making new applications is a concern with regard to creating a bypass.  It is also a concern because developers are being given powers to delay a decision in respect of substitute consent.  This is a decision as to whether an unlawful development should continue, or unlawful extraction in the case of quarries, pending that developer making another application for a new development.  Effectively, we are giving and transferring a significant amount of power to developers in this section.  We are giving to developers who have committed unlawful developments powers that other developers do not have.  People are getting a whole pile of powers that somebody else, who may be going through the proper process, applying in the normal way and doing everything right, will not have.  This is wrong.  It is straight-up wrong.<br/><br/>We in Ireland really have to get to grips with our planning.  We have been told throughout that the problem is we have a planning process.  The problem is we have not been applying the planning laws.  We got pulled up in Europe on forestry because we did not apply the proper scrutiny.  Then we had the forest appeals process and that was a problem so we gutted it.  Again and again we try to remove blocks in the planning process rather than doing things right.  Instead of pushing people and developers to do things right and, if anything, giving greater reward to those who apply the proper environmental standards, go through the proper processes, do things right and get things right from the beginning, we are constantly problem-solving for those who do things wrong.  Then we have a situation where An Bord Plean&aacute;la gives them the permission they want.  It is difficult and expensive to challenge a bad decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but in the very few cases where people are able to challenge, the board loses many of them because it is shown not to have been doing the process right.  It feels like this is yet another reward and yet another attempt to short-circuit proper process and give it retrospective <i>imprimatur</i>through legislation rather than investing in getting things right from the beginning.</p></speech>

I believe that answers Senator McDowell's point.</p><p>The Government's proposal in the section is to expand the potential for simultaneous applications to all development types beyond the existing provisions that currently only apply to certain types of quarry developments.  That is not an incentive and is considered reasonable.  This is because it is envisaged that in the very rare circumstances indeed of substitute consent arising, it would most likely be sought when a developer who is proposing a new development that is not been either consented or indeed constructed in the normal way, discovers that to progress a new development on-site, a pre-existing unauthorised development needs to be regularised first.  That is what this is about.  In this regard, it is important to note that it is a material consideration of the board whether exceptional circumstances exist in a substitute consent proposal.  Without this, incidentally, a substitute consent application must simply be refused.  That is what will happen whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised, as well as the additional material considerations as to whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted, or has previously carried out unauthorised development.  The risk of exceptional circumstance not being deemed to exist and the application, therefore, being refused substitute consent is apparent if the applicant themselves cannot adequately demonstrate their own bona fides that they could have reasonably had a belief their development was not unauthorised.  </p><p>It will also be misleading to the members of the public because we want a transparent planning system if an application for substitute consent was progressed, having been effectively triggered by a new development proposal on the same or on an adjoining site, and if the new development proposal was not available for consideration by the public at the same time but instead had to be considered in a separate planning application that can only be applied for years later, and which later application had to be considered by a planning authority instead of by the board who carried out the initial substitute consent assessment. </p><p>The ability to run substitute consent applications and related future-facing development applications at the same time will also be a benefit to the board's independent assessment process, as the parallel assessment approach will allow the board to be able to holistically assess proposals on the same or adjoining sites at the same time these proposals are inherently related to each other.</p><p>The Government's proposed amendments to section 37L of the principal Act will not change the fact that such applications for future development cannot be decided by the board until the substitute consent application, including, as I have mentioned, the consideration of whether the exceptional circumstance criteria are actually met, has been decided upon.  The board will be required to decide upon the application for future development at the same time or as soon as possible after the decision on the application for substitute consent.  </p><p>Any perceived benefits or incentives to a future-facing application of being able to apply directly to the board, instead of having to separately apply to the relevant planning authority first, will be outweighed by the inherent vulnerabilities and significant potential financial exposure if the related substitute consent application is actually refused.  In such substitute consent cases that are refused, the relevant planning authority will be statutorily obliged to initiate enforcement proceedings against unauthorised developments to seek remediation of the site.</p><p>Furthermore, the future-facing planning application on the same or adjoining site may also be refused as a result of a refusal of substitute consent if, for example, it relies on any elements of the refused substitute consent proposal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In other words, the legislative proposal which expands the provision to allow parallel substitute consent on planning applications for developments other than quarries does not provide an incentive to developers to use the provision instead of normal future-facing planning applications, noting the significant constraints and vulnerabilities for the developer attached to progressing a substitute consent proposal.  Seeking out substitute consent to facilitate a simultaneous future planning application directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la would simply not be a rational or financially practical approach for developers to consider, as opposed to simply applying for a planning permission requiring an environmental impact assessment, EIA, or appropriate assessment, AA, in advance of the development being built in the normal way and given the expenditure of significant capital costs on a project and the resultant risks of a refusal of substitute consent that would arise.  </p><p>As such, the Government considers the proposal in section 5, including the transitional provisions, to be eminently reasonable.  I hope I have addressed a number of the points raised by Senator Higgins.  I have answered Senator McDowell directly.  This is an eminently sensible approach and does not provide an incentive in any way, shape or form.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#GGG00200"><p>I disagree.  This provision does provide an incentive because the disincentive in the legislation is the requirement to seek substitute consent but that applies in any event.  If I have a site I want to build on and I have built something on it for which I do not have permission, there is then the question of seeking substitute consent.</p> <p>What is very interesting is that this reveals the idea, another flaw in the Bill, that basically the decision on whether to apply for substitute consent becomes a discretionary one on the part of the developer.  As the Minister said, if I had a site on which I wished to build or an adjoining site to an existing site, at the moment, if I was applying through the normal process for planning permission, the local authority could require me to first seek substitute consent as part of a process.  It should not be the case that it is only when someone goes directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la - this is a problem the Bill is setting up - where developers decide whether to apply for substitute consent, they can then attach a brand-new development to it, thereby skipping a major stage in the planning process, namely, the local authorities.  That is a big prize.</p> <p>The alternative, as currently exists, is that someone thinking of building on an unlawful development must first seek permission or substitute consent for the work that has been done or a local authority will require that person to seek substitute consent.  All of the risks associated with applying for substitute consent already apply under the current system and they are rightly dealt with prior to a person going ahead with a new application to build something entirely new, bearing in mind that it is not just on the site in question but on an adjoining site.</p> <p>The proposal therefore provides for a better and more incentivised situation than having someone simply apply to seek substitute consent and then go through the planning process in the normal way.  This is a fast track and there is no way to describe it as anything other than that.  The developer can go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and skip the local authority stage, for example, if they wanted to start digging in a quarry and had effectively done something requiring an earlier consent.</p> <p>This does not necessarily apply to related development but any other future-facing development someone may seek to have on a site.  There is no level at which that is not a reward.  If I have an application for something on a site and I do not have an unlawful development on that site, I will go through the full planning process, whereas someone who has an unlawful development can jump straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is what is happening.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That person would deal with the substitute consent application and the fact he or she had an unlawful development and then get in the queue behind somebody who does not have an unlawful development and is simply making an application.  In the current situation, people with an unlawful development rightly have some paperwork to sort out before putting in a planning application and are behind people in the queue who are lawful in their actions.  With this Bill, they are ahead.  That is directly in contravention of the ruling and the definition which said developers should not be encouraged in this way and such a dynamic and incentive should not be created.</p><p>The Minister talks about high-stakes gambling.  He is creating a danger with the determination where a desirable future development is considered alongside the substitute consent from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There will be pressure, and unless substitute consent is given for the wrong thing, then a good proposal on an adjoining site will be bundled together with it.  A dynamic is created.  The Minister talked about the stakes being raised for the developer.  The stakes will actually be raised for the planning system.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la decides a development is unlawful and does not give it retrospective permission, then it is jeopardising this new future project on the site next door.  This is a wrongful shift in the power dynamics, scrutiny and planning in Ireland.  There have been many such shifts but this is possibly the most egregious yet.</p></speech>

We either have faith in our planning system and the independence of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to do its job or we do not.  I have faith.  I am not happy with the delays in An Bord Plean&aacute;la and think one would have to be bonkers to want to take a route such as the one suggested, given the lengthy delays, which we are trying to address.  The Senator suggested An Bord Plean&aacute;la will not adjudicate on something on its merits because it will feel pressure to do something else.  That is a very unfair statement.</p></speech>

I think people who find themselves in a position where they are looking for substitute consent, for whatever reason, are not in a situation which any rational person would like to be in to start with, bearing in mind what I consider to be the overblown decision of the Commission on Ireland.  For example, people might be carrying out what appeared to be an exempt development, such as making a roadway on a farm.  It could then appear it was too near to a pond used by the natterjack toad or such and somebody might point out that under the European directives, a natural habitats environmental impact assessment should be done but has not been done.  If someone is contemplating applying for substitute consent from An Bord Plean&aacute;la before it is decided, or has already done so, it seems to be perfectly rational to ask, if the road is rerouted 100 yd away from the natterjack toad, if An Bord Plean&aacute;la will look at that instead of having the uphill battle of arguing about whether the natterjack toad would be affected by the track the person is building on the farm.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not see Senator Higgins's dark scenario here.  It seems to bring some degree of flexibility and proportionality to a tricky situation for many people.  Some of these substitute consent applications will concern activities with significant economic effects on jobs.  Businesses may have to close and so on and people lose their jobs.  Imagine if the Derrybrien wind farm was a factory.  If there is a proportional way around a situation, we should try to encourage that rather than use a battering ram approach to the planning Acts to satisfy people who take a purist approach on these things.  I am with the Minister on this matter.</p></speech>

The issue is that a stage would be skipped.  The question of the two issues being bundled is not one that I raised.  The Minister raised the fact that having the two applications combined creates a different dynamic.  It is not about each thing being considered on its merits.  The fact is that a substitute consent application is considered at the same time as a new planning application.  I have no problem with An Bord Plean&aacute;la considering planning applications after they have gone through the proper process, which happens all the time.  I note that it is not simply about a road and another nearby road.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this.  The legislation does not require that the development be related, such that a road could be rerouted.  It could be a question of having a quarry and wanting to build an unrelated factory on an adjoining site.  As I understand it, the requirement is simply that it be on related or adjoining land rather than having a related purpose.  That is a key difference.  One can have substitute consent for one thing that allows one to then go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la about something different.  I think that is relevant.</p> <p>I know people would like to bypass the local authorities, but I also know that many issues are rightly identified during the local authority process.  Using the Derrybrien wind farm as an example, there is a reason that we have faith in the planning system.  If we have faith in the planning system, why skip a stage of it?  Why skip the stage of the planning system where local authorities are involved?  If we have faith in the planning system, why not realise that there is value in the multiple stages?  It results in better projects that have been quizzed and which have been pushed to meet standards.  They did not make terrible mistakes which result in us paying fines or having to do messy mop-up operations.  There is a reason for having a multi-stage planning process.  I have faith in it, but I do not have faith in the idea of short-circuiting it, because we are more likely to make mistakes and to see planning for projects go through which then requires retrospective fixing.  I do not believe that those with an unlawful development on their site should have a more advantageous situation-----</p></speech>

However, the new planning application provides them with a different, advantageous route to that planning permission compared with somebody who does not have an unlawful development, which is wrong.</p></speech>

It would be worth considering even just the point on related development because it is different if it is a matter of a related development that someone might say "I have done this, could I change this and do it this way?".</p> <p>Could the Minister confirm that it is not required to be a related development but it can be a different development in terms of that land that is not related to the current process which does not have appropriate planning?</p></speech>

I refer particularly to the issue around where a decision to impose a condition that arises is materially different in respect of the terms and conditions from a recommendation report of the person assigned to report on the application for permission on behalf of the board.  That is a positive measure but I may look to further strengthen these provisions.  I am aware that we have had a considerable number of cases and cases being highlighted in situations whereby in respect, for example, of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, we have had inspector's reports that do not seem to have been reflected in the decisions.  It is not necessarily intrinsically against that paragraph but I may look to add further strengthening in respect of that issue.  The more information we can have, the better.</p></speech>

It would be useful to understand exactly what the problem is at the moment with the system we have.  We already have a system for applying for substitute consent.  Section 5 expands it and mainly seems to be an expansion to allow for simultaneous new applications.  It would be useful for us to have reports on a few issues.  This is where the regulations may come in.  These may be issues that should be addressed through the regulations.  It would be useful to know what kinds and what level of applications for substitute consent are happening currently; if there was a change in either the nature or volume of applications for substitute consent that may emerge after the passing of the Bill; the number of applications deemed to be successful and not successful; and the number of applications for substitute consent that might be accompanied by additional new applications for planning permission.  I mention the current situation because it would be very useful for us to have a baseline.  It would also be appropriate that within the regulations or such regulations as the Minister might make, he or she would specify the identification of patterns in respect of how these new powers are being used, what their impact is.  This is because of that duty to ensure that we have not created, as I believe we will, an incentive in respect of developers and developments.  One of the ways we need to be looking to the impact and ensuring that we main the principle of this being an exception rather than a new rule or new form of rule or, indeed, a new route towards planning that will have to be by monitoring.  I will table amendments to the section on Report Stage seeking that within the regulations the Minister may set, there will be significant monitoring requirements and perhaps, while being appropriately careful in respect of data protection of individual cases, mechanisms that allow for the identification of concerns or patterns.</p></speech>

The caveat is that the exceptional circumstances should be subject to the criteria set out in section 177D(1B)(2), which outlines that in considering whether exceptional circumstances exist, the board should have regard to whether regularisation of the development would circumvent the purpose and objectives of the EIA or the habitats directive; and whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised.  This would be important in situations where persons may have multiple applications.  The board should further have regard to whether the ability to carry out an assessment of the environmental impacts of the development for the purposes of the EIA or appropriate assessment, and to provide for public participation have been substantially impaired, the actual or likely significant effect on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site resulting from the carrying out or continuation of the development, and the extent to which significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site can be remediated.  Again, it goes back to the question of what comes next, even in a situation of refusal.  The board shall further have regard to whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted or has previously carried out an unauthorised development.  That is absolutely crucial so that we do not have a situation whereby if someone carries out one unauthorised development, they get substitute consent and an additional planning permission thrown on the side and can then do it again.  The board shall also have regard to such other matters as it may consider relevant.</p><p>I also note that the question of exceptional circumstances in the Bill has not been subject to public consultation, unless I am unaware of a public consultation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This comes under the remit of environmental decision making because the issuing of substitute consent and the decision about how to proceed in a situation where proper environmental screening was not conducted is a decision with environmental implications so, again, the definition of exceptional circumstances should itself have been subject to public scrutiny and debate.  Could the Minister indicate what steps have been taken to determine whether the definition of exceptionality proposed in the legislation complies with the definition envisaged in the ECJ ruling?  I strongly believe there are concerns relating to that provision of the ECJ ruling that there should not be the creation of an encouragement or incentive to developers through the provisions of this Bill.  I would like to ask the Minister how that is part of the ruling on exceptionality, how that is being addressed and what remedial steps might be taken if it does emerge that there is an encouragement effect.  This comes back to the question of monitoring the impact.  </p><p>Amendment No. 8 would also seek to insert a caveat into section 12 that would provide that while exceptional circumstances should other than in section 177K(2A)(b) be construed in accordance with section 177K(1J), the definition should also reflect the obligation to ensure there is no creation of a precedent or incentivisation with regard to applying for leave to substitute consent with exceptional circumstances.  Again, this is trying to ensure that those paragraphs of the ECJ ruling that made it explicitly clear that should be nothing that encourages or incentivises developers in any way are applied.  This is not about being against developers.  I am all for developers going through the normal routes and putting forward developments.  We all want different developments to happen.  The amendment is about ensuring that there is nothing that would incentivise or encourage developers to go this route or that could be construed as in any directly or indirectly incentivising or rewarding unlawful development.  Again, I am asking that this be made explicit in the Bill.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#NNN00200"><p>I will respond to both amendments.  We had a long discussion around section 5 and I reject any notion that there is an incentivisation within this.  What we are doing is bringing forward a process for either regularisation through a proper transparent process or if that fails, enforcement.  That is what it would lead to.  Amendment No. 7 seeks to amend section 12 of the Bill by inserting a reference in the definition of exceptional circumstances to the criteria set out in section 177D(2) of the principal Act.</p> <p>I cannot accept the proposed amendment given that section 177D is being repealed as section 21 of the Bill and the exceptional circumstances criteria from the section the Senator is trying to amend - section 177D(2) - are being moved wholesale to section 177K to a new subsection (1J) as inserted by section 16 of the Bill.  It is important to note that all of the text relating to exceptional circumstances criteria previously contained in the section the Senator is attempting to amend, which is section 177D(2), will be retained in a new location - section 177K.  </p> <p>The definition of exceptional circumstances in section 177A of the principal Act has been amended by section 12 of this Bill on technical drafting grounds to clarify that there is a separate unrelated use of the phrase "exceptional circumstances" in section 177K(2A)(b) that was introduced by the European Union (Planning and Development) (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2018 relating to a decision by the board as to whether an environmental impact assessment was required as opposed to relating to the criteria applied by the board under section 177K(1A)(a) whether substitute consent can be granted or not.  The technical clarification is considered to be both necessary and reasonable.  </p> <p>In amendment No. 8, the Senator seeks to amend section 12 of the Bill by inserting a reference in the definition of exceptional circumstances to a requirement to "also reflect the obligation to ensure that there is no creation of a precedent or incentivisation".  Again, I cannot accept the proposed amendment as the insertion of "creation of a precedent or incentivisation" is superfluous in that every single substitute consent application case that comes before the board would be considered on its own merits with regard to the exceptionality criteria that were formerly located in section 177D and that are now moved to section 177K.  It is important that this is understood because as no two development proposals are identical, no precedent can be set by the board in its decisions that would have to be followed by the board in future consent applications.  I cannot accept the proposed amendment as the insertion of a reference to incentivisation is also superfluous.  I have previously set out on amendment No. 2 that the legislative proposal to allow parallel substitute consent and planning applications does not in any way, shape or form provide an incentive to developers to use substitute consent application provision instead of normal future-facing planning applications noting the significant constraints and vulnerabilities that there would be for any developer that will be attached to progressing a substitute consent proposal, including potential liability to planning enforcement if the substitute application is refused, which would require the demolition of any unauthorised development and the remediation of the site fully and rightly at a cost to the developer.  </p></speech>

However, I continue to disagree regarding the question of incentivisation.  The Minister outlined that there is a risk in applying for substitute consent and said that is the main caveat.  The concern is that at the moment, a local authority can require a developer to seek a substitute consent but the Bill as set out basically leaves that decision about whether to apply for substitute consent to the discretion of a developer, which is not appropriate in itself.  Regarding the additional difficulty that has been suggested by the Minister and the fact that the developer has to take the risk by applying, the fact that there is discretion as to whether or not to apply is something granted by the Bill itself.  Previously, a local authority could tell a developer to seek substitute consent for this unauthorised development and the developer would have to seek that consent and would then be able to apply for new planning permission.  Again, this is the key point.  It is not a matter of planning permission versus planning permission and seeking substitute consent.  Under the current scenario, there is a requirement for somebody with an unlawful development to apply for substitute consent.  The developer can then apply for planning permission.  Under the Bill, the developer is able to choose whether to apply for substitute consent and apply directly for planning permission.  It is an incentive.</p> <p>I really appreciate the clarification in terms of precedent.  It is something that needs to be monitored very closely in terms of what decisions are made.  However, I will bring forward a new version of this amendment that removes the reference to precedent and simply deals with our substantive difference, which is the fear of incentivisation.  I will withdraw the amendment and bring forward a new version on Report Stage.  </p></speech>

Amendment No. 188 proposes to amend section 139N(5), which currently provides that the commission will from time to time review the online safety code, by inserting the provision that the review would happen at least every three years.  Earlier in the Bill, it is provided that the commission should respond to societal and technological change.  The Minister will be aware that I had identified emerging environmental considerations there.  Societal and technological change is moving apace.  It would be consistent with the stated intention in the Bill that the commission would be responsive to societal and technological change in the rapidly-evolving online safety space if the online safety codes were reviewed at least every three years.</p><p>Amendment No. 189 simply provides that the commission would make a report on the review of the online safety codes available on a website.  This is to ensure the process around the review of the codes is as open and transparent as possible and people will be able to see if the issues that they are encountering are being reflected in a review by the commission.</p></speech>

I cannot accept amendment No. 188 because, as a matter of principle, I cannot accept amendments that would unduly limit the discretion of the comisi&uacute;n in the creation and maintenance of regulatory codes.  However, the proposal in amendment No. 189 is a good one and while I reject the amendment today, I am considering the matter for Report Stage.</p></speech>

I understand there may be objection to what I propose be done with this information.  I have said it &quot;shall be deposited with the Commission and the Minister and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas&quot;.  It is around the principle of ensuring that we have data in the case of those large online service providers.  I am open to discussion on the question of where that information is lodged.</p></speech>

The designation of online services for regulation and the application of different online safety codes to them is based on assessments of risk.

I do not see that it would be desirable or practical to lay such information before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendment.</p></speech>

This is a significant and substantial amendment to the legislation.  We are happy to work with the Minister on the wording.  The amendment seeks to ensure there is a change in culture within social media companies.  While we are very much in favour of looking at a redress mechanism or dealing with the problems of online harm, redress arises after the online harm has taken place.  This amendment seeks to ensure that individuals in the social media companies take responsibility for online harms.</p><p>We know that very heavy fines can be levied by an coimisi&uacute;n on those who are guilty of causing online harm or breaching codes.  The difficulty, as we have seen with data privacy breaches and so on, is that those companies will tend to write off those large fines as business costs.  Indeed, we have even seen in the past few days that Meta is making allowances within its budgets for likely fines as a result of data breaches.  We want to ensure there is a change in culture.  We believe the only way we will see a change in culture is by making individual directors of the companies responsible.</p><p>This provision would not be applied in a very light way.  It would apply where the company is made aware of problems with its algorithms or allows its algorithms to perpetuate online harms.  The principle we want to apply is the same one that applies in health and safety, environmental, anti-bribery and white-collar crime legislation and even legislation the House discussed last week.  It is about making individual directors responsible.  The Minister will know that when it comes to health and safety or environmental legislation, we can slap big fines on companies, but many companies pay attention when they know that one or more of their directors may be held personally responsible for their company's actions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have not tabled the amendment because we want to see social media bosses walking away in shackles.  That is not the case at all.  We do not wish to see anybody facing that.  What we do want to see, however, is a change in culture.  When it comes to measuring risk, somebody within a company should take responsibility and know his or her job is on the line as a result of this and that it is not just about a fine for the company.  Therefore, we believe these measures are proportionate.</p><p>I totally understand that the legislation provides that if a person fails to co-operate with a direction of the commission, he or she could face criminal offences in those circumstances.  That is welcome.  What the amendment deals with is where whistleblowers or others within a company make clear to a director of the company that, as a result of the design of the algorithm or practice that is about to be rolled out on the social media platform, there is potential for online harms as specified within the legislation.  The wording of the amendment is based on provisions in the Health and Safety Act.  It is the exact same provision that would apply there.  The person who is responsible for health and safety has to measure the risk.  Therefore, if we are going to take online safety seriously, persons have to be held responsible.</p><p>The fear we have is that if it is simply a question of large fines, the companies in question will write that off.  Unfortunately, there are certain social media companies that, frankly, in terms of the culture within the company, take online safety about as seriously as the US National Rifle Association takes gun safety.  They sort of say they are committed to it, but the evidence is not there on the ground.  We believe that by making sure a person takes responsibility for it, we will see a change in culture within the company.  We are quite happy to consider amendments to the wording and so on.  As I stated, the amendment is based on wording in the Health and Safety Act.  We believe that, as a principle of this legislation, if we are going to take this seriously, somebody has to be held responsible.</p></speech>

As Senator Byrne outlined, the essence of the amendment relates to trying to find a balance as to what is going to be taken as strength.  I have consistently made the point that when we had engagement at committee and off site, there was not that level of respect from companies in general in this sphere towards the State and its laws.  There was a sop.  There was not due regard.  Senator Byrne is correct.</p> <p>I refer to the findings this week of Helen Dixon, the Data Protection Commissioner, in respect of breaches by Meta in the context of Instagram and the money, totalling some three quarters of a billion euro, that was being put aside to deal with these potential breaches.  That is the kind of money these companies can put aside to deal with breaches.  Indeed, they can add to that.  We are dealing with companies such as the one that has revenue in excess of &euro;40 billion in this country, a rise of &euro;6 billion on the previous trading year, and can put aside three quarters of a billion euro to deal with breaches.</p> <p>When Frances Haugen, a whistleblower, appeared before the Oireachtas committee in February, she outlined to us that it was made clear, and actually reported to company directors, that the algorithms devised in the context of several elections across Europe were driving aggression and hate.  The algorithms were driving engagement and, hence, revenue, so nothing was done.  That was the point.  The issue was outlined and the company was made aware of it but no action was taken.  Why was no action taken?  Because the net result was an increase in engagement on the platform and, hence, an increase in awareness for the advertising platforms and an increase in revenue.  Our own data regulator is pointing out the transgressions, with breaches in terms of the processing of the data of children in the context of the operation by children of business accounts and so forth.  We are well aware of the breaches that exist at present.  I praise the Data Protection Commissioner and those others who are currently charged with dealing with this issue.  I am sure the Minister will do likewise.  The companies do not care, however.  As I stated, it is a business cost.  If a company has revenue of &euro;40.6 billion and can put aside three quarters of a billion euro to deal with the fines this State may lay down, where is the sense of fear?</p> <p>When this amendment was tabled several weeks ago, however, by God, there was fear.  I refer to the reaction in terms of letters that were written and the furore that was created.  There was an attempt to portray the State as not being a friendly and welcoming place for these companies.  The threat we have seen companies make previously was rolled out.  It is nearly a case that if we do not worship at the companies' altar, they will be gone.  They will find somewhere else.</p> <p>The protection of the citizens of this State and their rights is what is at play here.  It goes back to the earlier amendments we tabled in the context of the right to privacy not being superseded by anything else.  It is a very important point of debate in the context of how we value the protection of people in this country and what level of protection we are going to introduce.  As I stated, the fines for breaches may seem eye-watering to us, but if a company can put aside three quarters of a billion euro to deal with such fines, that is a different ball game altogether.</p> <p>When we engaged with the eSafety Commissioner in Australia, she outlined clearly to us that by laying down the law from the outset in a strong and meaningful way, the level of engagement from these companies was fulsome.  They knew she meant business and that it was in their interests to play ball from the outset rather than being found in breach.</p> <p>The reaction that has emanated since the amendment was tabled is quite interesting.  We have very strong legislation as things stand.  The amendment would strengthen it further.  I hope we can work collectively and positively with the Minister in respect of this amendment.</p></speech>

These are excellent amendments.  Senator Cassells is right.  The reaction to the amendments is a sign that they are powerful amendments that would make a difference to the efficacy of the Bill.  I remember being in America just before the first dotcom crash, at an event in Denver where there were people in cowboy hats telling people to ride the light on the first go of the dotcom boom.  There has been a culture of rewarding risk taking.  There is a culture where risk is rewarded, whereas responsibility is not.  Of course, the individuals who are taking risks are doing so with the safety of other people in the context of potentially dangerous impacts and online harms that might be caused.  There is quite a lot of reward, however.  If the individual manages to find a new loophole or try something out and get away with it, he or she may be rewarded within that company or brought into another company and rewarded there because he or she has been shown to be willing to take risky decisions and gamble and push the limits of what might be acceptable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why it is really important that companies do not just absorb this within their business, as if the public were almost a testing ground for how much they can get away with.  It is as if we are letting the Irish public be part of a research and development process to see how much harm they can push or how much they can try.  It is important that it is not absorbed within business costs in terms of fines.  It is very important that the individuals making those decisions are held responsible, as part of moving towards a culture of responsibility in online service providers.</p><p>The previous excellent amendment from those Senators around having a named person responsible for online safety is almost the flip side of it.  If we have someone who is responsible for online safety and then also some of these amendments, we have some level of culpability for those who make irresponsible decisions.  If that person moves to another company, that record is there that he or she has been identified.  We might be going after a company but the individual who made those decisions might have been rewarded with a prime position in another company.  It is really important that we identify those who have made irresponsible decisions and have outsourced risk to the public.  I support the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#TTT00200"><p>I thank the Senators for their amendment.  We agree that it is important that the Bill contains robust and proportionate powers of investigation and enforcement sufficient to ensure compliance with the online safety codes issued by an coimisi&uacute;n.  As the Senators will be aware, the Bill as initiated already provides for significant administrative financial sanctions in respect of a contravention under the Bill and for the liability of a director or manager of a designated online service for a specified criminal offence in situations where a contravention continues following the decision of an coimisi&uacute;n.  Section 139Y of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 46 of the Bill, defines failure to comply with an online safety code as a contravention under the Act.</p> <p>It is important to note that a contravention is not in itself a criminal offence under the Act.  The Bill sets out a clear process for investigation of a contravention which begins with the appointment of an authorised officer to carry out an investigation and make a report to an coimisi&uacute;n.  The Bill provides significant powers to authorised officers, including powers of search and seizure.  Following their investigation of a contravention, an authorised officer must prepare a report to present to an coimisi&uacute;n for its decision.  On receipt of the report, an coimisi&uacute;n shall, on the balance of probabilities, decide whether or not a contravention has been committed by a provider of a designated online service and whether to impose administrative financial sanction.  It may impose administrative financial sanctions of up to &euro;20 million, or 10% of the turnover.  Given the scale of some of the designated online services which will be regulated by an coimisi&uacute;n, a sanction of 10% of turnover may run into the hundreds of millions of euro.</p> <p>If a provider of a designated online service continues to commit a contravention following a decision of an coimisi&uacute;n, section 139ZT of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 46 of the Bill, provides that an coimisi&uacute;n may issue a notice requiring the provider to put an end to the contravention.  If the provider fails to comply with such a notice, a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the provider can be held liable for the criminal offence of failing to comply with a notice by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to put an end to a contravention.  The criminal offence is a category 1 offence under the Bill, which is set out in section 139ZZ of the Act, as amended, as an offence for which a person is liable (a) on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or (b) on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both.</p> <p>The provision is tightly drawn and limited to circumstances in which the facts underlying the offence and indeed secondary liability in respect of it are provable in practical terms.  This is very important and the legitimacy of the regulatory framework and the legislation will hinge in many respects on its operability.  I want to emphasise that the provision for secondary criminal liability in the Bill was arrived at following extensive consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences.</p> <p>The amendment brought forward by the Senators is intended to set out a new offence which would apply when a designated online service has failed to comply with an online safety code in the first instance and for associated criminal liability.  I absolutely understand the point the Senators are making regarding the dissuasive effects of applying criminal sanctions in the first instance of a failure to comply with an online safety code, rather than following a failure to comply with a notice issued by an coimisi&uacute;n.  However, I am advised that the dissuasion sought could only occur if the offence was provable in practical terms to the legal standard of "beyond reasonable doubt".  This is achievable in the circumstances in which the Bill provides for secondary criminal liability but I am advised that there are doubts as to whether that would be the case in the circumstances described by the Senators.</p> <p>In addition, the intention of the Senators here would provide a legislative choice to an coimisi&uacute;n where it has determined a contravention has occurred to either pursue the imposition of an administrative financial sanction, or prosecute or pursue the prosecution of a provider of a designated online service for an offence tied to that contravention and potentially a secondary prosecution against a senior manager.  Where such a legislative choice exists, the question arises as to how an coimisi&uacute;n would choose between these courses of action, particularly as they have different legal standards of proof attached to them.  This creates a decision point which would be subject to judicial review and in respect of which it would be difficult for an coimisi&uacute;n to defend its choosing either course of action.  A mischievous actor could easily make an argument that an coimisi&uacute;n is only pursuing an administrative financial sanction because it does not have sufficient proof to pursue a criminal case and that an coimisi&uacute;n is denying the provider due process on that basis.  I have no intention of introducing such an opportunity into this Bill.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I am afraid I have to respectfully dispute the Minister's assertion that this would be a matter of choice.  There is not a barrier, as I read the legislation, that would prevent an coimisi&uacute;n from pursuing its standard case and expecting somebody to be able to co-operate with its direction and codes or, if there is a failure to comply with the codes, from taking action on foot of that or if it discovers evidence that there has been what we would call a criminal breach in terms of adhering to deal with some of the online harms.</p><p>I draw a parallel with environmental legislation.  If a factory was polluting a river and the EPA investigated and an order was made against the factory, if the factory continued to pollute, the EPA could take action against the factory.  If the EPA subsequently discovered that the director of that company was told that a course of action was going to lead to the pollution of the river and the director decided to go ahead, does the Minister honestly believe the director of the company should get away with that?  </p><p>This is what we want to happen with the social media companies.  If a social media company makes a decision and the commission investigates and discovers the code is being breached, and gives the company an order, the company may comply with the order or it may not.  There might be a need for a follow-on order.  An coimisi&uacute;n can take action in those circumstances.  However, if it discovers that the director of the social media company took a deliberate decision to allow an algorithm to roll out simply because it could make a lot more money, even though the director knew it was in breach of the codes, that means the individual is not responsible.  Criminal prosecutions are always difficult but it is not impossible.  It is about trying to ensure that within the company, somebody takes responsibility for what happens.  All the evidence is there.  There have been numerous whistleblowers.  I refer to the excellent book, <i>An Ugly Truth</i>by Sheera Frenkl and Cecelia Kang, two <i>New York Times</i>journalists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They talk about how Facebook was aware of a series of evidence about Russian interference in the American elections and genocide in Myanmar, yet it failed to take action.  This is not a case of discovering something and it being brought to the attention of the social media platform.  A director of the company, the person in charge of the design or algorithm, or the person named as being responsible for online safety, allowed the creation or perpetuation of an algorithm or platform that allows for online harm.  We all want this Bill and the commission to succeed, but there are the same challenges that we have seen with data protection, which is not taken sufficiently seriously by certain companies, which worries me.  In two or three years, when the commission is up and running, we want directors in companies to tell engineers, when designing an algorithm that the company is about to roll out, to ensure that it does not allow the creation of online harms.  If the only fear is that the company might be fined, that will not be a priority.  If people can roll out an algorithm that makes &euro;1 billon and the risk is 10% of that, they will not be worried because it is a profit of &euro;900 million, but if somebody is held personally responsible, then action can be taken.</p><p>I do not doubt that proving a criminal case is difficult, but the same arguments have been rolled out by pharmaceutical companies which were responsible for the opioid crisis in the USA and by tobacco companies, historically.  We have to ensure that people will take responsibility and be held to account.  We have had good engagement with the Minister's officials.  We are happy to discuss this further but we have to ensure that the companies take responsibility.  As Senator Cassells said, we have been debating this for over a year.  Many of the social media platforms engage in correspondence.  As soon as we put forward this suggestion, every single Government Minister got a letter expressing concern about what we were proposing.  Pressure was applied to Senators due to the potential impact of this.  This would mean that companies would finally take online safety seriously.  They are not afraid of huge fines, but there is fear when somebody will be held responsible.</p><p>We all want to solve this problem but until somebody in the company takes the responsibility seriously and there is a change in culture, we will not see a change.  I support the individual complaints mechanism but I do not believe it will work unless we have company change.  We are happy to engage earlier but I ask the Minister for the opportunity to sit down with her officials to discuss this between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

It represents the first steps to regulate user-generated online content.  In establishing a whole new regulatory framework and regulator to enforce it, Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n, the Bill lays a foundation that we can build on.  There will be changes to the regulatory framework, driven by initiatives taken at EU level, for example, not least through the recently agreed EU digital services Act, which does not take the approach proposed by the Senator.  It is important that the regulatory framework that we are establishing as a foundation stone is effective and that any provisions we include are applicable in practice by Coimisi&uacute;n na Me&aacute;n.  It is important in that context that consideration is given to the investigation and enforcement regime set out in the Bill so that it can be done in practice.</p> <p>I meant to refer to the comparisons between the provisions for secondary criminal liability in this Bill and other legislation, such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, as amended.  The offences set out in that Act for secondary criminal liability attach focus to failures by persons to comply with the provisions of that Act, including failures to discharge clearly identified duties or non-compliance with requirements to prepare plans.  Such provisions would have more in common with the existing provision in the Bill which attaches criminal liability to the failure to comply with a notice to end a contravention issued by the coimisi&uacute;n, given that the facts of compliance or non-compliance would be relatively clear, which is an important consideration when the matter must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.  As I said earlier, my advice is that the dissuasion the Senator seeks could only occur if the offence was provable, in practical terms, to the legal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt.  This is achievable in circumstances in which the Bill provides for secondary criminal liability.  I am advised that there are doubts as to whether that would be the case in the circumstances the Senator describes.</p> <p>It is vital that those who contravene the regulatory provisions can be sanctioned appropriately and effectively, up to and including criminal sanctions.  We agree on that.  The approach we have taken followed extensive engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences.  I have outlined the sanctions of &euro;20 million or up to 10% of the turnover for non-compliance.  The coimisi&uacute;n may issue a notice to end that non-compliance.  Failure to comply can lead to an offence for which officers may be found liable.  My advice is that this is just not workable and that what we have in the Bill, after extensive engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences, is what is workable, which is why it is in the Bill.  I am sure there will be engagement with officials on other amendments.  I have committed to that between now and Report Stage.  I am sure this will arise in the engagement.</p> <p>I am being straight with the Senator that I will not commit, because my advice as it stands is that this is not workable.  That does not stop the Senator from engaging further with the officials.  I am happy for that to take place, because I know it will happen with other amendments the Senator has tabled.  I am not committing to anything.  It would not be fair for me to say I will bring something in on Report Stage.  Engagement will happen.  My advice, as it stands, is that what we have provided for in the Bill is workable and the amendment is not.</p></speech>

It would be useful if some of the advice could be made available to us.  I do not know what is possible.  It would be good to discuss that advice with officials and see if there is a way around this.  From some of the discussions we have had, amendments along these lines will be possible.  Rather than getting into legal debate on the floor, since we have had useful engagement with the Minister's officials, Senator Cassells and I are in agreement that we would meet the officials again to discuss this further and try to ensure that we can achieve the maximum sanction possible.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the criminal sanction for refusal to comply with an order and that is where it kicks in.  It comes back to the question of patterns, for example, if the same persons are in charge when there are multiple breaches, either in the same company or in different companies.  There may be a breach involving an individual who is caught then complies before the criminal sanction comes in, then commits another similar breach.  What happens when persons in roles of responsibility commit multiple different breaches either in one company or another?  This is all about dissuading that kind of practice.  I urge the Minister to engage on how those can be identified.  Otherwise, there are many rewards for individuals committing breaches.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have at the moment a culture whereby the financial rewards that have been outlined are potentially immense and the penalties are only financial penalties, except if someone refuses to comply with an order.  Again, there is the potential incentive to try out multiple slightly different breaches and each time someone complies with an order and avoids the criminal sanctions is a danger.  What we do not want is that we have the public experimented on, effectively.  In that regard, there is potential for strengthening the Bill and this should be looked at.</p></speech>

It is the principle that records of consultations should be kept and, again, that there would be a record of why certain persons were consulted with.  We have heard of the level of direct engagement and lobbying that happens in some of these matters.  That is why it is appropriate that there would be records of consultations.  I know the Minister will disagree with the point in respect of the records of consultations being deposited with the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas given we have discussed similar amendments previously.  However, while I am very flexible on those matters, I strongly feel that the principle that the records of consultations should be kept is important.</p></speech>

However, as I said previously, as a public body, the comisi&uacute;n will be subject to appropriate transparency and accountability requirements, including to the Oireachtas joint committee.

There are very significant environmental implications in respect of online activity and there are a number of choices.  There is an increasing realisation that we will need a dovetailing of regulation of online activities and environmental regulations.  Often, when we are debating issues such as data centres, for example, people will say that we have to be able to watch programmes and they ask about family photographs and so on, but, of course, the detail is that different kinds of activities carry a different impact.  For example, although I forget the number of transatlantic jumbo jet flights involved in the training of algorithms, it is very important that the commission is able to incentivise that there would be best practice around transparency in terms of, say, the provision of lower carbon impact options, awareness of the fact different choices may have different environmental impacts and, in regard to the architecture underlying an online service, the environmental implications of different choices, practices and regulations on the environmental impact of that architecture.  This is just to suggest that this is one of the areas where it would be appropriate for the commission to consult with persons who can give expertise in this area.  As I understand it, given the very small size of the commission itself, it may not have that expertise internally.</p></speech>

What is an appropriate age?  There was a recommendation from the Oireachtas joint committee to have a minimum age for social media accounts and put the responsibility on social media companies to have a minimum age for children setting up accounts.  At present, it is obvious that children aged nine and ten have social media accounts.  We have to put the responsibility on the companies.  When we spoke to Frances Haugen, we put this comment to her and she was in agreement that we need to set a minimum age.  We met just today with the Children's Rights Alliance's, which is also in favour of this.  It is an opportunity for us to be a world leader.</p> <p>I want to put it on record and I may discuss it with the Minister&rsquo;s officials with regard to perhaps putting something forward on Report Stage.  I understand she cannot comment on it at this stage as it is not an amendment, but I want to put it on the record.  I think that is the right way to go.  We need to set a minimum age and we need to put the responsibility on the social media companies to make sure that our children are protected and they are not online or have accounts at an inappropriate age.  The Bill does not set out what that age is.</p></speech>

I reserve the right to bring in other areas.  It is a section that could be very useful in addressing areas where there may be a reluctance to have a kind of activity fully designated.  I come at this in a different way in some of the later sections.  When we are trying to designate certain kinds of things as harmful - and there are certain things that while there may be debate or a desire to leave discretion to the commission as to whether they may be designated as harmful - we can be very clear they are not age-appropriate.  Again, that comes into the question not just of the kind of content but also the kind of targeting.  It comes back to that core question I mentioned earlier.  We can give an example such as eating disorders, which is an area where there has been some concern around targeting of products.  It is basically the idea of the profiling of persons who are younger and the targeting of advertising content towards them, including advertising content that may be based on a particular vulnerability, including a psychological or physical vulnerability, of that younger person.  There would be a kind of double layer of the exploitation of vulnerability and the exploitation of vulnerability in respect of a younger person.</p> <p>Again, some of the issues we have tried to address in general, such as gambling, could perhaps be addressed at least in respect of age in order that we send a very clear signal that people should not be targeting minors with advertisements and materials that may cause them harm.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would allow us to be more specific if the Minister ends up not being inclined to widen the provisions on harmful content.

The text of the Bill, which reads, &quot;Online content by which a person applies force to the body of another, or causes another to believe on reasonable grounds that he or she is likely immediately to be subjected to such force&quot;, is very unclear.  This could mean dance, martial arts or anything.  It was only from further examination that it became clear the intention is for this to be about how the way online content is presented has an impact.  This addresses situations such as the use of flashing images, which could provoke a risk of seizure or could have a negative physical impact on the viewer at home.  As it is worded, it can be read as meaning the online content.  It is unclear.</p><p>We suggest two ways to amend this.  One is for the Bill to state: &quot;online content presented in a manner&quot;.  It is about the way in which the content is presented applies force through flashing images or other unsuitable measures.  Another potential way would be to give an example.  This would retain the Bill's language and add: &quot;(including the sending of flashing images to people with photo-sensitive epilepsy with intent to induce a seizure)&quot;.  I was trying to give an example of it.  A number of people who read it were unclear as to what was meant.  I appreciate the intent and I am agreeable to the intent of the Minister but I wonder whether the language might be made a little bit clearer.  I have suggested two ways and I am open to any other way she suggests.</p></speech>

I understand that the intention of amendments Nos. 194a and 194b is to ensure that the use of "force" does not unintentionally exclude the non-contact application of such, for example, through online content.  I am satisfied that this is not the case, as "force", which is defined in section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, includes, for example, the application of light.  As I consider the effect of these amendments to be provided for in the Bill, I will not accept it.</p></speech>

The Minister addressed the issue of the concern about exclusion but did not address my concern in respect of inadvertent inclusion.  The framing seems to be quite wide.  We are relying on the word &quot;by&quot; versus &quot;in&quot;.  Is it sufficient that we say it is &quot;by&quot; the content the force is applied and not &quot;in&quot; the content?  Is this sufficiently distinct or clear?  The Minister has addressed my concern to an extent.  She has made clear what she expects to be included.  I am still worried that we are really relying on the word &quot;by&quot; instead of &quot;in&quot;.  Does this make it clear it is not the content <i>per se</i>but the manner of the presentation of the content?  I am happy to leave the issue and come back to it but I am concerned there might be a potentially wide interpretation.  Perhaps this is something we could look at.  Are there potential inadvertently wide interpretations of this phrase?  Is the Minister confident there is not a risk of this?</p></speech>

My point is not with regard to it not being covered.  My concern is that there might be a danger of it being interpreted as referring to looking at an image of something happening.  I want to be clear this provision is not to do with the content.  It is not that a video of somebody applying force is wrong.  It is limited to the video itself applying force to a viewer.  Does the Minister know what I mean?  It is not the content internal to the video.  The concern raised with me was whether there would be a risk that there would be an interpretation of applying force to somebody's body if there is content that shows force being applied to a person.  Is there a danger of this inadvertently getting caught under this umbrella?  This is meant to be about the effect of the video itself on the viewer.  I am asking whether the Minister is confident there is no risk of this overinterpretation.</p></speech>

These are very wide in the Bill and there may need to be better caveats.  Amendment No. 196 would insert the word &quot;reasonably&quot; after the word &quot;may&quot; in the preamble to the activities that authorised officers may take in respect of utilising their powers.  This would ensure an authorised officer would not utilise powers under the legislation in a manner that might be excessive or unreasonable.  It is an additional safeguard.</p><p>Amendment No. 197 proposes to insert &quot;reasonably considers necessary&quot; with regard to an authorised officer.  It proposes to delete the provision in section 139ZC that an authorised officer may remove from any place and retain any relevant material or relevant equipment for such period as the authorised officer reasonably considers necessary.  It replaces it with a provision that the authorised officer can remove and retain relevant material or equipment for a period not exceeding eight weeks without the review of the superior officer.  This strikes a better balance between the powers of authorised officers, appropriate accountability and civil liberties.  It would mean we avoid a scenario whereby we may have the indefinite seizure of property, potentially leading to the inoperability or non-continuation of the work of an online provider.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That might potentially lead to the inoperability or non-continuation of the work of an online provider, for example.</p><p>Amendment No. 198 would delete the provision in section 139ZC that basically indicates an authorised officer may be accompanied by a garda and effectively states such an officer must be accompanied by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This relates to the execution of warrants without the presence of garda&iacute; or any other persons to ensure a warrant is being lawfully executed, which creates a danger that warrants may not be executed in accordance with the provision of the warrant.  The powers being given here are very significant and it is why I am trying to ensure we do not have any risk or even a perceived risk whereby quite a lot would be left solely to the discretion of an authorised officer without appropriate safeguards and accountability mechanisms.</p><p>Effectively, these are all accountability mechanisms and if material is retained for longer than eight weeks, the person in question should be speaking with a superior officer about why that needs to be done.  If a warrant is being exercised that will allow an officer to seize and search for materials, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be present.  I presume that will not happen every day and although it is something that needs to be there as a power, it is really important that it be carried out properly.  Those are the key provisions.</p></speech>

The circumstances in which an authorised officer may use his or her powers are set down comprehensively in section 139ZC and are, among other things, subject to considerations of reasonableness.</p> <p>On amendment No. 197, section 139ZC clearly provides that an authorised officer cannot keep material or equipment obtained in the course of an investigation in perpetuity and that, during the course of an investigation, may keep such materials or equipment for a period deemed reasonably necessary.  This discretion is proper and sufficiently drawn to mitigate against unnecessary retention of equipment and materials.  I do not believe that requiring an authorised officer's supervisor to statutorily review this matter every eight weeks is proportionate.  It would be an unnecessary administrative burden, especially during lengthy investigations.</p> <p>Amendment No. 198 is not substantially different to the present provision in the Bill enabling an authorised officer to be accompanied by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and anyone the officer considers appropriate.  Accordingly, I am not accepting these amendments.</p></speech>

There is a very large discretionary power being given to the authorised officer for as long as he or she reasonably believes necessary.  There must be some form of time limit.  I am not necessarily suggesting this should be every eight weeks but I am saying if it is longer than eight weeks, the process would be subject to review.  I am open to the period in question but we do not want a case where, effectively, authorised officers may target an online provider and seize materials over a long period.  It may be such a period that it would effectively affect the potential continuity of a service provider.</p> <p>Again, I say this not in the context of expecting terrible and draconian actions from authorised officers within the State but in looking to best practice elsewhere.  There are cases whereby materials and equipment have been seized in other countries in a way that could have a detrimental effect on civil liberties and civil society participation in some cases.  That is why I believe it is best practice to have a check on the issuing of warrants.  If a warrant is being used, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be present.  We disagree on amendments Nos. 197 and 198, which is fine.</p></speech>

Under these sections, we know materials or equipment can be seized in order to review whether they are relevant.  Where material or equipment obtained in the course of an investigation in the exercise of powers is subsequently found not to be relevant to the investigation, it should be returned to the provider at the earliest possible opportunity.  This is to ensure that where there is a case where large amounts of equipment are being seized, including hard drives and computers, and it is found not to be relevant to an investigation, it would be returned at the earliest point.  These are the tools of the service provider and we should not have a case where a very wide sweep of material is seized and remains impounded when only a very small amount is relevant.

This could preclude access to justice for persons who may be adversely affected by the potential actions of an authorised officer.</p><p>I remind the Minister that the legislation covers interpersonal communications and cloud storage.

In many cases, we are seeking to have regulation strengthened, but we must ensure there is a balance.  That is why the rights-based issue in the context of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, is important.  It is so that we avoid leaving things to free market regulation and also avoid having inappropriate levels of power or pressure asserted by a state.  I refer to the phrasing of the section, such as any "claims howsoever arising in respect of the exercise of those powers".  I refer to undue force being implied, damage being done to equipment or materials, or, for example, persons choosing to take and seize a large amount of equipment.  If a person abuses those powers, that is significant.</p><p>The good faith mechanism is a difficult one to prove.  It is a high bar.  That is why amendment No. 201, which is an alternative to amendment No. 200, makes provision should the Minister wish to keep the indemnity clause in this context.  Again, I think the clause is too widely framed.  It refers to any claims, howsoever arising.  I say that in the context of the UK and the kind of indemnity provisions it has been giving to those who have acted completely improperly in respect of Northern Ireland.  I refer to the spy cops legislation in the UK.  There have been several examples of significant impunity for those who may be authorised officers in different contexts than in other states in the context of what they might do.  We need to avoid anything that creates a culture of potentially undue care or a perception of impunity or immunity for those who are acting on behalf of the State.</p><p>Amendment No. 201 provides that, in the case that there is still a desire to insert the indemnity, the indemnity would only be provided to an authorised officer in respect of "a first or second action or claim arising in respect of that officers exercise of these powers" but that authorised officers who are subject to a third or further action or claim would not be indemnified to the same degree.  This may apply to situations where an authorised officer becomes a hard enforcer, there is a pattern of multiple complaints against him or her or there are authorised officers against whom claims are made because of how they have carried out their duties or because there is a perception they are using, for example, unduly coercive methods or unduly exploiting the very substantial powers that are being given to them under the Bill.  The concern basically relates to the number of claims that will be taken against an authorised officer before the State stops indemnifying him or her against actions.  Again, this relates to trying to ensure we do not inadvertently create a provision within the Bill that contributes to a culture of irresponsibility for authorised officers rather than one of responsibility.</p></speech>

In this regard, the proposed deletion of the relevant provision by amendment No. 200 is not something I can accept.  What the provision does is to squarely place the legal responsibility for the actions of an authorised officer on coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n, except where the officer acts in bad faith.  It is right and proper that complaints in respect of the actions of a person engaged by an coimisi&uacute;n to carry out an investigation should first and foremost be directed at an coimisi&uacute;n.  Otherwise, a bad actor could stymie investigations simply by threatening legal action against the investigator as an individual.</p> <p>As regards amendment No. 201, it is difficult to understand why the exercise of such an important legal provision should be subject solely to the quantity of claims against an authorised officer.  One can easily imagine a mischievous actor making several separate claims to exceed the threshold in order to be able to bring a claim directly against the authorised officer.  Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendments.</p></speech>

There are ranges of mischievous actors.  My concern is that I do not see provisions in the Bill in respect of the coimisi&uacute;n and how there will be an assertion in respect of good faith, what the mechanisms will be in that regard and what are the consequences for authorised officers who are the subject of multiple complaints.  If the Minister is insistent on preserving the indemnity clause, I reserve the right to bring forward other amendments that seek to tackle directly the issue of the exploitation of power by an authorised officer not being checked, notwithstanding the indemnity.</p> <p>I do accept the point that an coimisi&uacute;n should be ultimately responsible but I believe there also need to be mechanisms that ensure there will be no exploitation of power by an authorised officer.  I am worried that the indemnity may create such a circumstance.  I do not see a countervailing mechanism whereby there will be an investigation of good faith automatically.  If, for example, there is a third complaint against an authorised officer, will there be an investigation on that good faith?  Will good faith still apply if multiple people are complaining about how an authorised officer is acting?  Will there be consequences in respect of where good faith is not identified?</p> <p>I accept that the Minister does not want to move with those indemnity clauses and I get that they are standard but I am very conscious of the substantial powers that are being given to authorised officers under the Bill and that is why I want some form of safeguard.  I accept that the Minister is not minded to accept these safeguards but I will reserve the right to engage and seek other safeguards on Report Stage, perhaps focusing on the question of good faith and its assertion or investigation, as well as the question of consequences for authorised officers who are found by an coimisi&uacute;n to have behaved improperly.</p></speech>

At the moment, the Bill refers to it being done as soon as practicable.  I am suggesting that it be done within eight months.  This is to ensure that investigations are expedient rather than drawn out or excessively lengthy.  I put in &quot;not less than eight months&quot; but I just want to ensure we are not waiting indefinitely for reports.</p><p>Amendment No. 203 is important.  The Minister will recall our earlier discussion in respect of fairness, efficiency and effectiveness.  The amendment provides that as well as having regard to the need for fairness and efficiency, the commission would have regard to necessity and proportionality.  I know that necessity and proportionality are mentioned elsewhere in the legislation but this amendment tries to ensure it is cemented in this space in terms of these actions of an authorised officer.</p></speech>

The wording of the Bill at present is: "As soon as is practicable after the completion of an investigation, the authorised officer shall prepare a draft report of the investigation."  In my view, this is sufficient to ensure the draft report will be prepared within a reasonable time, depending on the nature of the investigation, whether it is within weeks or months.</p> <p>As regards amendment No. 203, I believe the section as currently worded, particularly the reference to fairness, covers matters of necessity and proportionality that may arise in respect of rules relating to the conduct of investigations.  In this regard, I note that an coimisi&uacute;n and its officers will be subject to the extensive provisions in this Part on how investigations may be carried out, and that there are more than sufficient principles and policies in this respect.  Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendments. </p></speech>

Naming necessity and proportionality, two of the core principles in the Data Protection Act, would be an appropriate signal to the officers carrying out their work. </p><p>I appreciate the Minister's point on the eight-month timeframe.  I appreciate that providing a specific time might be too rigorous.  The term "as soon as practicable" is a little vague.  I will withdraw that amendment and I may use another word in a different amendment.  However, amendment No. 203 is important and I ask the Minister to consider carefully the implications of the powers under this Bill and the question of clearly signalling necessity and proportionality because I do not agree they are covered by the phrase "fairness".</p></speech>

Considering some of the decisions of the commission will relate to areas where online harm is determined to be taking place, it is important that during the judicial review period the commission's decision would stand, for example, if the commission made a decision on the removal of material considered to be causing online harm.  This is the precautionary principle.  The avoidance of harm should take precedence during the period of consideration.</p></speech>

This comes from something I have pushed for a very long time, namely, that a portion of fines under GDPR should be reserved to be used to give people an understanding of their data rights and to give them the skills and abilities to assert their rights and to be in control of their engagement with online actors and the protection of their personal data.  This would be in tune with the spirit of the directive, which is around shifting the balance back to individuals.</p><p>The issue is particularly acute in this context because Ireland has extraordinarily low levels of digital literacy.  We have one of the lowest levels of digital literacy in the EU.  That seems counter-intuitive considering the large numbers of large online actors and service providers but EU research has found that over 45% of persons in Ireland lack basic digital skills.  That is an extremely high figure in the EU.  Given that the fines will be for those who have broken codes, created online harm and breached the guidance in some ways, it would be appropriate to have a portion of the revenue go towards empowering and supporting the persons who are the victims of inappropriate online action.  It cannot be linked directly but raising the general level of digital empowerment would be a constructive use of the fines.  I urge the Minister to consider this proposal.  I raised other slightly different issues related to protecting personal data but this proposal is more about media literacy and online empowerment.  Something could be done in that area.  It is partly about shifting the culture and power dynamic in a constructive way.  It would be a very good use of some of those fines.</p></speech>

Hypothecating the moneys, as the Senator suggests, would be counter to this policy.  In addition, it would appear to create an incentive for coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to attempt to impose more or higher financial penalties than warranted in order to increase its own operating budget since it will have a function in promoting media literacy.  Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

When we have bad online practices, such as those we have been discussing, one of the aspects that is taken advantage of is a lack of media literacy, online skills and awareness of people's rights, and what is or is not appropriate in respect of targeting.  Again, I refer to empowering people concerning their digital skills.  We have principles in law here sometimes where those most impacted in a particular situation benefit.  I refer to people experiencing online harms in this context.  Those with a high level of digital skills may know to turn off every possible privacy-endangering function, to say "No" to options and to go through the privacy policies and to deselect everything possible.  The people with those skills are less likely to be harmed than people who have not been supported to develop the same level of skills.  Therefore, enabling people to learn these types of skills would ensure less impact in this regard.  Again, however, I accept we are not going to progress this aspect now.  I will come back to this issue.  In general, I am concerned that Ireland is pushing ahead strongly on the digital space without properly empowering a large proportion of our citizens.</p></speech>

This paragraph would specify that &quot;where the content appears to the Commission to fall within the category of age-inappropriate online content&quot; the provider can be required &quot;to restrict access to the content&quot;.  The Bill as it stands contains a provision which specifies that the commission may issue a content limitation notice in respect of harmful content.  To this, I am trying to add that the commission should also be able to issue a content limitation notice in situations where there are concerns regarding age-inappropriate content.</p></speech>

This would be in cases where the content appears to an coimisi&uacute;n to fall within the definition of "age-inappropriate content" in section 44, by inserting section 139D into the 2009 Act.  In this regard, it is important to note that the content limitation notice provisions in section 46, inserting sections 139ZV to 139ZY into the 2009 Act, are limited in application to "harmful online content" and not to "age-inappropriate online content".  This is to limit the potential involvement of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n in matters regarding individual pieces of content to only that content expressly deemed harmful under the Bill.  The definition of "age-inappropriate online content" does not constitute a category of "harmful online content" under the legislation, but rather stands separately and is intended to inform the creation of online safety guidance materials and advisory notices.  Section 44 is inserting sections 139R to 139T into the 2009 Act rather than online safety codes and, as such, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

This is why what I am seeking to provide here, in the context of a possible situation where age-inappropriate content is inappropriately being made available to those aged below an appropriate age, is that during an investigation it should be possible to issue a limitation notice to prevent age-inappropriate content being made available or delivered to those of an inappropriate age.  This is what I am trying to get at with this amendment.  If we have decided that where there is harmful content an coimisi&uacute;n should be able to order that such material would be limited and not be made available, then if we also have other situations where there is delivery of harmful content to minors and children, an coimisi&uacute;n should equally be able to indicate that that is happening.</p> <p>This is an amendment the Minister should consider.  I refer to the possibility of situations arising where inappropriate content is being targeted at children.  The Minister is aware that I intend to try to strengthen the section on age-inappropriate content later on Report Stage and this is why I might not press it now.  If this age-inappropriate section is strengthened, it could then be a mechanism that would deal with many of the concerns raised by the public.  It should also be possible to strengthen the powers of the commission concerning where such content is being targeted.  For example, and this is the last one I will give, one of the explicit concerns raised with me is the question of educational online videos.  Families have all used these because they were teaching children at home and they effectively have content directly targeted towards children.  Basically, we have online educational materials that families are using and then the profiles of those families, including those of the children, have been used as the basis for targeting commercial materials that are inappropriate for children.  In that context, this is what I am trying to get at with my amendment.  I wish to be clear this is what I am trying to get at with this amendment, in case it might help.</p></speech>

Hopefully, we will get out by 9 p.m.  This is a major amendment for us in respect of the content levy.  It is concerned with setting a date for its introduction and setting a percentage for that levy that will be not less than 3% and not more than 5% of revenues.  The funds raised would go towards independent Irish productions.  Ultimately, this is about providing certainty to the sector.</p> <p>I had the pleasure of studying film and television production in Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology for my third-level education.  Galway being the place it is, home to TG4 and a UNESCO City of Film, it was always driven home to us the struggle and the campaign that was required to create TG4.  I refer to the work that went into establishing the film tax credit in section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and all the supports required for film-making in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I refer to how Ireland pulled out all the stops for film-making, for example, for "Braveheart" with the Defence Forces, and the campaign to create Bord Scann&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann - the Irish Film Board - originally.  This content levy is a moment similar to those initiatives.  An Indecon report highlighted the fact we could possibly be looking at &euro;24 million, not in Exchequer funding but in a different funding stream, coming in support of Irish independent productions.  The other thing we always learned in college was that it was important for Irish people to be able to see themselves and their stories on screen, and this is what this is about.</p><p>This Bill is an opportunity to introduce new funding at no cost to the Exchequer.  It would simply keep funding that currently leaves the country to international corporations and use it instead to fund the creation of original Irish content, create employment in Ireland and allow for the development of Irish stories for Irish audiences.  This is becoming more important as new streaming services arrive and more content is available across people's screens, making it harder for people to find stories that resonate with their experiences and their nationhood.</p><p>The opportunities and the benefit, some of which I have mentioned, are as follows: the creation of an additional funding source for original Irish content; the creation of the conditions to allow Irish production companies to compete further on the international market by giving opportunities for new audiences to see Irish stories; the development of original intellectual property, which has become a cornerstone of international content creation and would allow Irish producers to license their product to other countries and build up scale in the international market; regional development, because at the heart of independent production in Ireland are SMEs working in the regions and a content levy fund investment in these producers is an investment in regional development; and screen tourism, because new investment would bring new employment to the sector, with high-end television drama, in particular, requiring hundreds of cast and crew over a prolonged shoot, and the high-quality content created would offer another opportunity to showcase Ireland as a compelling tourist destination.  We have seen that.  I need not tell anyone here the importance of film in that regard.</p><p>All members of the committee will be aware that key recommendations relating to the content levy included identifying the party responsible for the content levy, the percentage value of the levy, that specific provisions in the Bill be made in that regard, that providers be liable to pay the levy as well, and the ability of Irish independent producers to solely access the fund.  These have all received cross-party support at the Oireachtas joint committee.</p><p>The longer we delay the levy, which is the reason we have put a commencement date on this amendment, the longer money will leave Irish consumers and go to the international streaming services with no guarantee of original Irish content, the outcome of which is Irish people paying for streaming services that have a small minority of Irish content to view on them.</p><p>I also want to address a piece about intellectual property, IP.  The importance of copyright protection for the cultural economy and creative economy cannot be underestimated.  This area of law must be updated so that creators can earn a fair income from their work.  Copyright is the principal tool by which creators can generate a sustainable income and wealth, and to protect their share of the value they create.</p><p>I will await the Minister's response on that.  I suppose I could sit down and we could deal with amendment No. 208.  I am sure other Senators want to come in.</p></speech>

When we dealt with Screen Producers Ireland, they were direct in making their case to us.  It comes down to us asking ourselves, not only in this Chamber but as a society, whether we care what content we see on our screens and whether we are quite happy to see a plethora of it, given that we have a growing number of platforms, television stations and imported trash on our screens.  It is true.  Is that what we are entering?  It is quite worrying.  It goes back to something the Minister and I have discussed previously in terms of promoting domestic sport, such as the League of Ireland, in this country.  People in RT&Eacute; will tell the Minister that we can stick up a film from the 1980s and perhaps get better traction than putting money behind showing domestic sport.</p> <p>Going back to original content, when we met with Screen Producers Ireland, they pointed out that the Olsberg report had estimated the gross value added of film, television and animation production in Ireland was &euro;692 million in 2016 with full-time equivalent employment of nearly 12,000 jobs.  In the intervening six years, the number of people employed in that sector has grown but the costs associated with that sector have equally grown.  A case was made strenuously, and supported by RT&Eacute;, TG4 and Virgin Media, by the way, for the introduction of the levy so that it could be harnessed.  My party has called for it, from 3% but not more than 5% of the revenues from these subscribers, to ensure that fund is there to support that.</p> <p>The issue we are debating here is the timeframe for the introduction.  We were calling for that within one year.  We were not looking to state, as it is outlined in the Bill at present, "an order imposing a levy on the media" may be made.  We were looking for a timeframe so that we would have certainty with respect to that.  That is what we have come down to and on which we would like to engage with the Minister.</p> <p>If the Minister can address the additional amendment, No. 210, on how the levy should be calculated in terms of the amount of the subscriptions collected from audiences etc., and the amount paid by advertisers, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.578" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#BBBB00800"><p>I have a number of small amendments in this grouping.  To be honest, the most fundamental and most important amendments have been put by the members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, Senators Cassells and Warfield.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They reflect the views of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media and those amendments are fundamentally in tune with the mandate from the AV directive.  <br/><br/>I talked at the beginning of this debate about there being a core EU principle, that of <i>exception culturelle</i>, and a very clear mandate from the AV directive in line with that which is that cultural content cannot be solely left to the market and the role of the state is not simply to regulate a market in this regard but that it is, in fact, the right and duty of a state, and indeed of the European Union as a whole, to seek to promote cultural diversity and the idea of different voices being raised and reflected.  This, again, is not a market incentive for European works, or whatever, but it is a public duty to promote cultural participation and different and diverse voices, and that culture serves crucial social and cultural functions.  These provisions are not then simply a nice add-in to the commercial regulation of a sector but the provisions within the AV directive that allow for European works to be promoted are core to the origins of the EU directive itself.  It is the protection, the function but also the promotion and participation mandate.  That is why it is very appropriate that Senators Cassells's and Warfield's amendments tried to ensure, not simply that it is provided that there may be European work schemes, and so forth, which is there in the Bill, but to seek to put flesh on that and to give a hard signal that it is going to be given weighting and import.  <br/><br/>Some of their amendments also speak to the importance of ensuring that there are, for example, independent media providers in that space and are given a clear amount of that space.  That, again, is around ensuring that there are diverse voices and issues expressed.  Their amendments talk to the need for this to be a substantive area, be it 3% to 5% or more, of expenditure.  My amendments are a whole series of little ones and are around that diversity piece, along with a few others.<br/><br/>I will go through them quite quickly now.  I will not be moving my amendment No. 211 when it comes up because I do not believe it is correctly placed and we have already discussed that issue, which is of the danger the other content levy and this content levy and how they might be interpreted in respect of each other.  I will put that aside and will not go into that for now.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 216 seeks to amend section 159F by adding that the funds under the European work scheme supporting new audiovisual work would recognise the diverse experiences of the people of the island of Ireland.  We know that people's experiences are very different.  Today there was a very powerful protest outside the Oireachtas around Traveller mental health.  We also know and the Seanad group I am a member of has put forward legislation that Traveller culture and history is very important.  That has been quite a different experience of life in Ireland.<br/><br/>There are also things we have seen in the literary space such as Oein De Bhaird&uacute;in's collections on folklore and Rosaleen McDonagh's play <i>Walls and Windows</i>.  There is a rich depth of Traveller culture in Ireland which has not often been recognised and reflected.  Very often Travellers have had the experience where they are covered in the media usually around discussing the problems, difficulties or obstacles they may be facing rather than their cultural representation.  That is an example of why diversity is something important to remember.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 217 seeks to ensure that the scheme would not only support audiovisual works engaging with the experiences of persons of Irish ancestry living abroad but those of Irish origin or ancestry living abroad.  For example, this would apply if one has lived in Ireland for a number of years and has now moved to another country, regardless of whether one's parents were Irish.  That is important because Irish ancestry has tied it to a kind of genetic connection rather than one which is of Irish origin.  If, for example, people grow up here for 20 years and then moves abroad, they may well be able to make an important contribution on the Irish experience even if they have moved abroad.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 218 is important in respect of biodiversity, environmental sustainability and climate change.  It is because we know that we are in this climate change crisis and one of sustainability around materials, resources and all of that, but biodiversity is something a little bit different from sustainability.  Biodiversity is a very important subject matter.  If someone wanted to pick something that was place-based and about our country, the network of ecological biodiversity, which is different again from environmental sustainability, but the ecology, species, plants in our country and that biodiversity piece is something that is very valuable.  It is something a little different from just climate change and environmental sustainability as it is adding something different.  It would be appropriate to insert that in amendment No. 218.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 219 seeks to delete the word &quot;including&quot; because the way this is worded in the Bill at the moment is that equality, diversity and inclusion are made as subsections or subsets of human rights.  Human rights are, in fact, reflected in our human rights and equality legislation, that is, it is not human rights &quot;including&quot; equality but is human rights &quot;and&quot; equality.  The importance of this is because while equality relates to human rights, equality is wider than simply human rights as there are many equality provisions which go wider than just the scope of fundamental human rights.  It would be appropriate then to have human rights, equality, diversity and inclusion rather than human rights &quot;including&quot; equality, diversity and inclusion.  Making it a subset is out of line with other legislation and is inconsistent with many provisions, including the provisions of our Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 220 would add a new paragraph which describes audiovisual works which might be supported by the scheme.  I seek in that to include works which support literacy.  It is different to having Irish language content but is also to have works which promote literacy in the Irish language or in Irish Sign Language and in programming.  I previously mentioned in respect of Irish Sign Language that the Seanad and the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, indeed, played a very key role in securing official recognition of Irish Sign Language.  In delivering on that recognition we should be supporting programmes which feature or engage with Irish Sign Language.<br/><br/>On Irish language literacy, the scheme could play a very important role in fostering better engagement through the language in the audiovisual programming which would be mentioned.  <br/><br/>I perhaps reserve the right to mention that there may be other languages which may not be covered.  I have focused here on the Irish language and on Irish Sign Language because they have official recognition but Cant, which is a Traveller language, is another example.  Perhaps that may come under the cultural or a diversity provision rather than under other provisions.  I have an example here of Irish language content which is not Irish language literacy content but language content.  We are seeing in the film &quot;Arracht&quot; and in &quot;An Cail&iacute;n Ci&uacute;in&quot; some very exceptional content which has been developed in that area and which are of an international standard.  It would be very important that this work scheme supports that kind of content which is exceptional.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 221, and my apologies but this is our last clump, unfortunately, has a great deal in it.  This amendment adds the provision that the scheme will again support new audiovisual works which promote digital empowerment and data protection awareness. I have spoken about this at length and the Minister is aware of my concern and of the fact that we have a very low levels of digital skills here.  In fact the 2020 EU Digital Economy and Society Index said that 45% of people in Ireland lack basic online and digital skills where one can perform basic functions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Amendment No. 222 seeks to provide that the scheme would support works and research, assessments of need, feasibility studies or pilot projects in relation to programming and measures reflected in paragraph (c).  It basically states that it would also support capacity building for the delivery of such artistic works.  This is important if we think of under-represented and under-reflected communities, perspectives or voices in Ireland.  It would allow for building the capacity to produce materials appropriate to this kind of sphere.  It simply strengthens that provision.  </p><p>Amendment No. 225 provides that in preparing a scheme, the commission would seek to ensure understanding and enjoyment of new audiovisual programmes by people with a disability.  Again, the principle of participation applies.  It is not just the enjoyment of programming but participation in the production of such materials.  We have already discussed this issue at length.  The Minister will recall that amendments from across the House proposed to reflect the evolving understanding of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the principles of cultural participation, not only cultural consumption but participation in the creation of materials. </p><p>Amendment No. 226 again refers to the need to support cultural and social participation for users of the Irish language and Irish Sign Language.</p><p>Amendment No. 227 provides that, in preparing a scheme, the commission would have regard to the need to support the development of new audiovisual programmes of interest to children and young people under the age of 25.  It states that having regard to the need to support the development, it would also encourage development.  I seek to go a little further because while the legislation recognises some markets or areas that exist, this is one area that could be strengthened.</p><p>That was a long set.  My amendments are all small and aimed at tweaking the Bill.  I support the more substantive amendments from Senator Warfield and Senators Cassells and Byrne, as they probably go to the core of the matter, the hard fact of how much money gets designated to this area and how it is apportioned.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 210 is similar to the previous amendment on the levy.  It will provide additional clarity and certainty around who will pay the levy, when it will be paid, etc., to ensure that all those who should be paying the levy will be included by being more specific about the way we calculate it.  I specifically mention advertising to ensure that companies are paying for advertising that targets Irish audiences.  Obviously, there are channels that carry Irish ads.</p> <p>Amendment No. 212 provides additional certainty and ensures that it is a duty of the commission to introduce such a levy, rather than it being a choice.  Amendment No. 214 is to ensure that one scheme, rather than several schemes, are established.  Amendment No. 223 relates to intellectual property, IP, protection.  Currently, a production can be filmed in Ireland by a streaming giant which will own the rights in the United States for the production and all additional profits.  Producers and creators should have rights to their work, including spin-offs, additional seasons and so on.  This amendment will also allow the media commission to co-partner with other State agencies.  Amendment No. 224 is a technical amendment.  Sin &eacute;.</p></speech>

It is important that we add a date.  Whether it is feasible to set a date of 1 January 2023 or 12 months from now, I do not know.  The latter might be more feasible because we do not know when the Bill will be enacted.  We have a long way to go yet before that happens but we are getting there.</p> <p>One point the joint committee took from its meetings with the various media companies, including Virgin, TG4 and RT&Eacute;, was the pressing need for significant investment in Irish programming.  That has to happen.  Many of the subscription and advertising services are gaining huge revenue from households across the country, creating a loss for the likes of RT&Eacute; that are producing programming here.  The sooner we bring in this legislation, the better.  As I said, in our discussions with Screen Producers Ireland and the various companies producing programming in Ireland, the joint committee heard that this legislation needs to be implemented.  It is important that we provide a fixed date, not later than 12 months from now, by which it will be implemented to ensure we get proper home-produced programming.  We value this programming but it has been under-resourced in recent times because these other companies are making significant profits off us.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that this is an important issue for the Irish audiovisual sector and it is one on which my officials have engaged extensively with the sector.</p> <p>By way of background, Article 13(2) of the audiovisual media services directive gives member states the option to levy media service providers under their jurisdiction or which are not under their jurisdiction but are targeting audiences in their territories.  The proceeds of such a levy must be used to fund the production of European works.  Section 53 exercises this option by providing for the imposition of a content production levy on media service providers to fund a content production scheme to support the production of European works, which of course includes Irish works.  The section further provides that funds raised by the levy can be used to support the production of new audiovisual programmes across a number of areas, including Irish culture and language, climate change, and equality, diversity and inclusion.</p> <p>Both the levy and the associated scheme will be administered by coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n.  The section also provides that a minimum of 25% of funds raised by the content production levy shall be for the production of programmes in the Irish language.  As Senators will be aware, there are a range of public funding measures in place to support the production of audiovisual works in the State, including through the section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland, the sound and vision scheme operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and through our public service broadcasters, TG4 and RT&Eacute;, which are funded through the Exchequer and television licence fee, respectively.  In 2020, these supports collectively amounted to over &euro;198 million.  The content production levy will provide the means to provide further support to the audiovisual sector, which has been an Irish success story.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 provide that an order imposing a levy on the media service providers shall be not less than 3% but not more than 5% of their revenues from subscribers and-or advertising revenues.  It is my view that it is not appropriate to set out a percentage for the levy in primary legislation, given the need to carry out further research into the risks and benefits of such a measure.  Setting a specified rate in legislation is inflexible, as it would prevent an coimisi&uacute;n from varying the rate following any research it may carry out or subject to changing circumstances.</p> <p>It is important to note that any levy system will have to abide by the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination under EU law.  Accordingly, any levy will be imposed equally on all audiovisual media services targeting the Irish market, both those based outside Ireland and Irish media service providers, such as RT&Eacute; and Virgin Media Television, will also be subject to this levy.  In addition, Irish services and services based elsewhere in the European Union would be eligible to apply to the content production fund established as a result of the levy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Furthermore, it should be noted that any levy will only apply to income earned within the State.  For example, if a provider such as Netflix earns 2% of its overall EU revenues in the State, the levy can only apply to that 2% of its overall revenues.  These factors could significantly constrain the overall positive impact on the potential level of additional funding for Irish content.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 also provide for the inclusion of timelines requiring the content production levy to be commenced by a specified period.  I intend to commence the provisions of the Bill giving effect to content production levy after coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n has carried out independent research into the viability of such a levy in an Irish context.  It is important that a thorough examination of these issues is undertaken in order to avoid any unintended consequences arising from the introduction of a levy.  It is intended that an examination of the content production levy will be among an coimisi&uacute;n&rsquo;s priorities on establishment.  I expect that an coimisi&uacute;n will carry out a programme of stakeholder engagement on the matter and will subsequently report to me with its recommendations.  For the reasons I have set out, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 208 and 209.</p><p>Amendment No. 210 provides that the content production levy shall be calculated on the amount of the subscriptions collected from audiences in the State, and on the amount paid to media service providers by advertisers for advertisements targeting audiences in the State.  The amendment also proposes that the levy order should have effect for a minimum period of five years.  Similar to amendments Nos. 209 and 210, I do not intend to accept this amendment as I believe specific details regarding the calculation of the levy should only be decided following a thorough examination of the content levy.  Setting out such detail in primary legislation would constrain the options available to an coimisi&uacute;n in making a levy order.</p><p>Amendment No. 212 provides that a content production scheme or schemes shall be made as soon as possible after 1 January 2023.  Amendment No. 213 serves a similar purpose by obliging an coimisi&uacute;n to implement a content production scheme as soon as possible after establishment.  Given I do not intend to commence the content production levy until the necessary research has been undertaken to inform the levy design I cannot accept amendments Nos. 212 and 213.  Amendment No. 214 is a consequential amendment to the previous amendment and I therefore do not intend to accept it.</p><p>I understand the intention of amendment No. 211 arises from a concern that sections 21 and 22 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by the Bill, which relate to the industry levy imposed for the purposes of funding the operational costs of an coimisi&uacute;n, may adversely impact the operation of the content production levy and cause confusion as to which levy is being referred to.  Section 159E(8) provides that the terms "levy" and "levy order" should be construed in relation to sections 159E and 159F only.  Section 21(12) provides that the terms "levy order" and "levy period" used in sections 21 and 22 should be construed in relation to those sections only.  I am advised that this ensures a clear delineation between the levy set out in sections 21 and 22 and that set out in section 159E.  Accordingly, I am not accepting amendment No. 211.</p><p>Amendment No. 215 sets out additional detail in terms of the nature of programmes to be funded under a scheme, and specifies that drama, films, animation and factual programmes can be funded under a scheme.  In addition, it sets out that a scheme should specifically fund works by Irish creative talent.  The amendment also sets out that a scheme can provide development funding to support the production of audiovisual works.  First, the additional detail included in the paragraph (c) of the amendment regarding the types of programming to be funded appears to achieve the same policy intent as the current wording of the section.  The wording of section 159F(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 53 of the Bill, provides that a scheme can fund the production of audiovisual programmes.  As this wording already captures all types of audiovisual content, including drama, films, animation and factual programmes, I am therefore of the view that it is unnecessary to include any specific detail in this element of the provision.</p><p>Paragraph (b) of this amendment proposes that a content production scheme would specifically support works which relate specifically to the works of Irish creative talent.  On the fact of it, the intrinsic quality of works of Irish creative talent would be appear to be that such works are produced by Irish citizens.  This would imply that persons of Irish nationality would be given preference in any funding provided through a content production scheme.  While I am of course strongly in favour of doing all we can to support Irish creatives, this element would run contrary to European Union law on non-discrimination as it would appear to place Irish nationals at an advantage over nationals or residents of other member states. </p><p>Paragraph (d) of this amendment adds a clarification that a content production scheme may make provision for development funding for programmes funded under this section.  While I am of the view that the existing provision in the Bill as currently drafted already provides for this, I acknowledge that there is scope to add further clarity regarding development funding.  Accordingly, I have asked my officials to consider the matter further with a view to bringing forward an amendment.  At this point, I would signal that my intention is to address any amendments to the content production levy and scheme on D&aacute;il Committee Stage rather than in this House, to allow for meaningful engagement with stakeholders on this issue.  Accordingly, while I cannot accept amendment No. 215, I hope to address some of the concerns raised by the amendment.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 216 to 221, inclusive, seek to amend the language applying to the kind of audiovisual programmes which may be funded by a content production scheme with a view to further specifying the scope of content which may be supported.  Amendment No. 216 adds the term "diverse" before the reference to "experiences of the people of the island of Ireland" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F.  I understand the intention of the amendment.  However, I believe that the term "experiences of the people of the island of Ireland" necessarily carries with it the recognition that such experiences shall be diverse, given the existing diversity among our people.  I do not therefore intend to accept the amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 217 amends the term "people of Irish ancestry living abroad" to "people of Irish origin or ancestry living abroad" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F.  I understand the intention of the amendment but believe that the term "Irish ancestry" already incorporates people of Irish origin living abroad.  The term "ancestry" is not intended refer to ethnic origin in a way that implies racial connotations.  Instead, the term is intended to refer to origin, at some point, on our island in all its diversity, both past and present.  I do not therefore intend to accept the amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 218 adds the term "biodiversity" to "environmental sustainability and climate change" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F.  I recognise the intention of the amendment.  I am open to amendment on this and intend to return to the matter on Report Stage. </p><p>Amendment No. 219 deletes the term "including" in the phrase "human rights, including equality, diversity and inclusion" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F.  I understand the question here is whether the phrasing implies that equality, diversity and inclusion should be considered under the rubric of the overarching idea of human rights or whether they should be considered separate concepts.  I think this may be a philosophical question which will not have a substantive impact on the kind of audiovisual programmes which may be supported by a content production scheme.  For that reason, I intend to reject the amendment.   </p><p>Amendment No. 220 inserts a provision specifying that new audiovisual programmes may, through a content production scheme, support literacy in the Irish language, or support literacy in Irish Sign Language.  In terms of literacy in the Irish language I believe that this may be covered by the reference to the Irish language in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F.  As regards literacy in Irish Sign Language, I will further consider whether the references to the types of audiovisual programmes referenced in subsection (2) would encompass programmes relating to literacy in ISL and return to the House on Report Stage. </p><p>Amendment No. 221 would specify that new audiovisual programmes in relation to digital empowerment and data protection awareness may, through a content production scheme, be funded.  I believe that the references to science and education in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F would already allow such programmes to be funded.  Therefore, I do not accept the amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 222 would specify that support under a content production scheme may be given in relation to capacity building.  I believe the intention of the amendment is already captured by paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of section 159F which provides that support under the scheme may be given in respect of research, assessments of need, feasibility studies or pilot projects.  The insertion of the term "capacity building" would be too expansive.  The purpose of a content production scheme is to fund new audiovisual programmes.  The term "capacity building" implies that a content production scheme could be used, for example, in skills development.  I believe that skills development in the sector is more appropriately progressed by Screen Ireland through Screen Skills Ireland, which is Ireland&rsquo;s screen industry training resource.  As such, I am not accepting the amendment.  However, as I indicated in my response to amendment No. 215, I can see the merit in inserting a reference to development funding in paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of section 159F.  This reference is not as capacious as "capacity building" but may capture the intent of amendment No. 222. </p><p>Amendment No. 223 provides that a content production scheme shall dedicate not less than 80% of the funding available under each scheme to audiovisual works that are developed or produced by independent production companies, as described in, and which qualify as an independent programme under section 116(12) of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The amendment further seeks to provide for a fair and equitable balance in relation to the allocation of rights ownership in those works funded by a scheme under this section.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The amendment also provides that a funding scheme under the section could be managed by an coimisi&uacute;n in co-partnership with another agency or that its management may be delegated by an coimisi&uacute;n to another agency on such terms and conditions as an coimisi&uacute;n shall prescribe.</p><p>In regard to the proposal to dedicate at least 80% of funding from a scheme to independent productions, I can see the merit in specifying that the Bill contains an explicit acknowledgement that the independent productions can benefit from funding through a scheme made under the section and I have, therefore, asked my officials to examine this matter further with a view to bringing forward a Government amendment in the context of D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  In particular I will ask them to examine an appropriate definitions of "independent programmes" and "independent production company", and the appropriate percentage.  </p><p>The issue of rights ownership is a complex issue that cuts across the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Given the need for further extensive policy analysis and consultation in the matter to ascertain the implications of providing for this in legislation and the fact that this issue is not provided for in the AVMSD, I will ask my officials to further examine the issue.</p><p>Regarding the proposal that a funding scheme under the section could be in co-partnership with another State agency or that the management of a scheme could be delegated entirely to another State agency, I do not see the value in this portion of the proposed amendment.  I am confident that an coimisi&uacute;n will effectively manage the funding scheme, should it be introduced, given it will operate as both a media development agency and a regulatory body.  My Department is currently working with the Public Appointments Service to launch an executive search for the commissioner and executive chairperson posts.  This will include a media development commissioner who will take responsibility for the funding and development of the wider media sector.  Given an coimisi&uacute;n will be responsible for the content production levy, it is appropriate that it is also the body responsible for the implementation of content production schemes and I expect that the media development commissioner will work closely with Screen Ireland with a view to maximising the potential of content production schemes.  Given the complexity of the proposed amendment, I intend to ask my officials to carry out further consultation and analysis with a view to returning to some of these matters on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  </p><p>Amendment No. 224 is a consequential amendment following on from amendment No. 223 and, therefore, I do not accept it.  </p><p>Amendment No. 225 provides that an coimisi&uacute;n, in preparing a content production scheme, shall have regard for the need to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in new audiovisual programmes funded by schemes made under this section.  I recognise the intention of the amendment, and I would be concerned that specifying that any one group should be prioritised for participation would imply that other groups, such as an ethnic minority, would not be prioritised.  I wish to give this matter further consideration on Report Stage. </p><p>Amendment No. 226 provides that an coimisi&uacute;n, in preparing a content production scheme, shall have regard for the need to support cultural and social participation, access to programming for the use of the Irish language and Irish Sign Language.  Similar to amendment No. 220, I believe that some of the proposed amendments may be encompassed under section 159F(2)(a).  However, as with amendment No. 220, I will give further consideration to the amendment in the context of Report Stage.  </p><p>Amendment No. 227 provides that an coimisi&uacute;n, in preparing schemes under this section, shall have regard for the need to support the development of community broadcasters.  The Bill as initiated sets out that an coimisi&uacute;n shall encourage the development of community broadcasters and, therefore, I do not see a substantive distinction between the terms "support" and "encourage".  Accordingly I proposed to reject the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-31a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022053100002#FFFF00200"><p>I thank the Minister for a very comprehensive response and for being open, whether on Report Stage here or on D&aacute;il Committee Stage.  It really does not matter, as we are all here for the common good to progress and strengthen the Bill and to make it workable.  Whether it is in this House or in the D&aacute;il, at the end of the day it will not matter that much.  I heard an indication of openness to amendment No. 223 relating to independent production companies.  I also heard an openness to amendment No. 215, which is about Irish culture and language and those works.  That is very welcome.  The Minister referred to the content levy and not prescribing a percentage in legislation.  I often think about the statutory requirement that RT&Eacute; has for a minimum spend on independent productions.  That is written into the Broadcasting Act 2009.  It has value of approximately &euro;40 million.  It is a comparison for where we in legislation prescribe that a certain amount be spent on a certain thing.  Independent production companies are an obvious parallel, and &euro;40 million is a significant amount.  The difference is that it is public money that is prescribed to RT&Eacute;.  I see parallels in the fact that we have statutory rules around that spend from RT&Eacute; and independent production companies.  We should also have that statutory obligation in this legislation.  I am in disagreement about prescribing when it should start and about the percentage.  Some flexibility for the media commission to set the percentage levy is important but I am in disagreement about whether we should put it in this Bill.  We need to have confidence.  It comes back to what I spoke about at the start.  We move mountains in this country for film and we have a great reputation around the world.  There seem to be tax breaks everywhere for film so the tax break alone does not bring productions here.  It is a great location.  We give access to our UNESCO heritage sites such as Sceilg Mhich&iacute;l.  The Minister's increased investment in Screen Ireland has been commendable as was the work for decades on the part of the Irish Film Board, which is now Screen Ireland.  We need to be confident in our offer and we should not be afraid of this levy.  We should not be afraid of providing for it in legislation.  I will probably press amendment No. 208.</p></speech>

Ancestry covers, for example, people who may be second or third generation Irish and that is fine.  It is good that is covered.  Origin also covers persons who may only have spent a period of time in Ireland.  I do not agree that ancestry covers those things.  I urge the Minister to check this because the question on human rights is not actually a philosophical question;  it is a legal and legislative question.  By framing it in this way where there is an inclusion, the Minister is out of line with the human rights and equality legislation and with other legislation where human rights and equality, rather than human rights, including equality, is the norm in terms of what is used.  I do not want this legislation to be inconsistent with other legislation in that regard.  It is not really a philosophical question; it is a legislative drafting question and it is important that we endeavour to be consistent with other areas.</p> <p>Whether amendment No. 208 is accepted and whether specific percentages are included as set out by Senator Warfield, there is an opportunity in this legislation to set a very ambitious measure and choose to say that there will be a percentage.  This is the positive ask.  It is not simply like responsibility.  This is a huge opportunity that we should seize.  I do not know about the capping but we should seize the opportunity to say that there will at least be a minimum.  We should not apologise for doing that.  We should not delegate it solely to the commission as to whether this will be done.  We should say that this is a chance for a massive leap forward.  If we do not do it, and other countries put in percentages in respect of the levies for producing works, we will have lost that space.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=31"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This directive is being transposed across Europe.  The countries that seize this moment in terms of interesting content being produced are going to benefit.  We have a risk, as was mentioned.  Our tax measures have been copied all over the world.

Just to make sure I understand the point, there is not a dispute here on the issue of the content levy.  I understand the Minister is saying it is the issue of how much would be collectible by the State and how much would be applicable here.  I take on board what the Minister is saying about ensuring that we have a scheme that works to the maximum for this country.  I would like to discuss that further.  The Minister picked a random figure of 2% in respect of Netflix and its overall income earned here, what that 2% is in terms of pounds, shillings and pence in this country and what that 5% of the 2% would be and how it would be applicable.  I would like to discuss this further with the representative bodies.  On amendments Nos. 208, 209, 213 and 214 and in respect of amendment No. 215, the Minister indicated her willingness to look at this further.</p></speech>
