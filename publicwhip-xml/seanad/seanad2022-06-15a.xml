    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#A00500"><p>I thank the Minister for coming here today to discuss this all-important topic.  I met recently with representatives from Young Carers Ireland.  This is an issue that certainly impedes them.  They are on social welfare and alongside their carer's payment, they are allowed to work 18.5 hours per week and study part-time.  They are not entitled to the SUSI grant on the other side, however.  They carry out very beneficial work in terms of caring, perhaps for vulnerable parents or siblings.  To listen to them, it is certainly something that really impacts them.</p> <p>Then, on the other hand, a widow with a young family got in touch with me.  I know the same family spoke to the Minister when I hosted an online meeting to do with further education a couple of months ago.  In this case, it is a young family in which the mother is widowed.  The child in question is studying for a masters degree but because this person has mental health issues and autism, it has been suggested by the university that while this student is highly intelligent, a part-time course would suit them better.  This student equally is not entitled to the SUSI grant.  There is also the fact that, we will say, the student is not working either because all their time is given to study and achieving because this person is a very high achiever and wants to do well.  This student is not working and yet cannot avail of the SUSI grant.  The parent who is supporting this student is only working part-time.  These are really just two examples as to what young people are facing in terms of SUSI.</p> <p>I really believe that the SUSI grant should be reformed and I think it is something that maybe the Minister also supports in terms of changes that need to be made.  If Covid-19 taught us anything, it is that so many people had to move to online.  Speaking to both the young carers and this other family, certainly, they found it more difficult because they were online and then had no support with the pressure of having to pay their college fees.  The young carers were literally using what they were getting in terms of caring to pay for their college course, and that is not right either.  It is something about which I feel really strongly.  There are many more people in this situation.  I am just using these two examples to highlight the plight of what people are going through and the pressures they are under.</p> <p>It is pressure enough when people are studying and have examinations coming up and especially if they are doing a masters degree or PhD.  There is an awful lot of pressure and time commitment and then they have the pressure of knowing they must come up with their fees for college and different payments that are due at the other side.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#A00600"><p>I thank my colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, very much for raising this important matter and, indeed, for her ongoing interest and work in the whole area of further and higher education.</p> <p>I enjoyed our recent visit to County Limerick and we are going to make progress on many issues, including the library in Mary Immaculate College.  I look forward to coming back on that.  I also enjoyed attending her online meeting during which I had a chance to engage with students and parents, including the family she mentioned with regard to the need to reform SUSI.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are going to reform SUSI because we commissioned under the programme for Government a full review of the SUSI student grants scheme.  That review has now been published.  That was done after I brought it to Government and on the same day we published the sustainable funding model for higher education, so the Senator's raising this important matter is timely.</p><p>I launched the review of the student grants scheme on 4 May.  I am committed to implementing the recommendations in the context of the annual Estimates process.  The review raised, as the Senator rightly said, the issue of flexible learning.  It cited something we all know to be true but it is good to have it backed up by the report, namely, that many individuals, particularly perhaps those from lower-income backgrounds, disadvantaged groups, or those with a disability may find it more accessible to access their education in a part-time manner.  This might also apply to a mature student or somebody looking to reskill or upskill while holding down a job.  It is true that at the moment you cannot access the SUSI student grant scheme for part-time education.  It is a finding of the review that we need to make it available for part-time students and this is something we will now work to progress.  I need to be honest that there is a little bit of work to do around this.  What defines part-time?  We need to be quite clear on that in setting out the criteria.  In addition to that, we will also be bringing the new national access plan to Government, probably at the end of this month.  This plan will look at how we can ensure more students from a whole variety of backgrounds, including students with a disability, can access education.  Again, that will be an opportunity for us to consider it in that context.</p><p>To be helpful, I want to refer to three things that might be of assistance because the Senator referenced the issue of young carers.  If I can take that issue even more broadly, she mentioned that these people might be working for a period of time and perhaps because of that they do not qualify for SUSI.  We had a debate in this House very recently on the need to increase the income disregard.  A student is allowed earn &euro;4,500 and have it not counted towards their income for the purpose of SUSI.  That is too low.  It is particularly so in the context of the cost-of-living crisis and inflation.  I am happy to inform the Senator and the House that I intend to seek Government approval to increase that limit in the first instance.  That will be step 1.  Step 2 is that I would also like to see that limit be allowed apply during term time as well.  That would definitely benefit the young carers she references.</p><p>The Senator mentioned a student with autism.  While I am committed to ensuring we reform SUSI, I am conscious this is happening in real time for people and the supports available today are two schemes that provide financial assistance to part-time students.  One is the fund for students with disability.  This is open, as I said, to part-time students up to level 10, or doctoral level, and can provide funding to support and accommodate a student with assistive technology, personal assistance, academic or learning support or transport support.  That is one fund available.  The second is the student assistance fund.  As a Government, we put &euro;18.5 million into that.  That is also available for students in part-time education, including masters students.  That can be used to assist people with financial difficulties while attending third level.  It can be used for rent, childcare costs, transport costs, books and class materials, food, etc.  There is a list of criteria.  I say that to outline what could be of immediate assistance, while fully accepting we need to reform SUSI, that we will do so and that part-time is a big part of this as is the income disregard.</p></speech>

Since he came to the Department, it is an area he has a keen interest in.  I thank him and his staff for the work they are doing in this area.  I welcome the fact he is going to reform it.  Returning to the situation with young carers, it is unfortunate.  I am aware they will be able to increase their amount money or that the Minister will be bringing forward a proposal on the amount they can earn but the fact it is part-time is the key point here.  Whether it is the student with a disability or a young carer it is about the fact it is part-time.  That is where we need to put our focus.  I believe the Minister will focus on that whole part-time aspect.  I look forward to working with him on it and thank him for highlighting the two schemes currently available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#B00300"><p>I thank the Senator and assure her I will work closely with her on this.  I highlight the two schemes in existence not to suggest they are perfect or an alternative to reform but just to put that information out there for anyone following this debate as avenues that might be of assistance to a student with disability or students more generally in terms of the student assistance fund, because they are available to part-time students.  However, I take the point.  More and more, we are going to see people of all ages wanting to access education in a flexible, agile way.  The Senator quite correctly referenced the Covid pandemic in the context of how we saw people then accessing education in hybrid manner online.  Beyond students with a disability and young carers, there is going to be a huge need from mature students and people going back to education.  We cannot on the one hand say go back and do part-time education as it is a great way to do it and on the other hand have Government schemes that do not support it.  Thus, this is a huge body of work we are committed to doing.  It is a policy priority for me and my Department.  The pace at which we can introduce it is a matter for the normal Estimates process but I will keep in very close contact with the Senator on it.</p></speech>

To broaden it out, there are concerns in Galway city and west Galway and I ask if the Minister, Deputy Harris, could confirm that the introduction of the new Garda operating model in the Galway division will not result in the closure or downgrading of any Garda station in Galway city.  The Minister will be aware that Mill Street, Salthill and Oranmore are in this region currently.  The previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Flanagan, commented that the new operating model would result in significantly more sergeants and inspectors on the ground.  Recently, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said the new operating model "... will see us deliver a more responsive, more efficient and better service to local communities" and "will mean increased numbers of Garda&iacute; working on the frontline".  How will this be apparent as the new model is introduced in the Galway division?  Under the new model, the Garda has committed to ensuring superintendents will be in locations throughout a division and not all located in divisional headquarters.  Will the Minister provide clarity on which stations the superintendents will be located in within the Galway division?</p> <p>Furthermore, as he will be aware, under the new operating model, each division is to have a number of superintendents in charge of community engagement.  How many such superintendents will there be in the Galway division and can the Minister provide clarity on the geographic areas that will be covered by each of the community engagements teams?  I am aware the Minister might not have all the detail with him this morning but I thank him for his time.  If he could liaise with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and get back to me by email that would be appreciated.</p> <p>Before the changes are made at divisional level, I understand a change will come in on 4 September.  The change impact assessments were to be conducted at a local level to ascertain what needs to be done to enable implementation of the new Garda model.  Has this been completed within the Galway division and can the impact of the assessment be made known?  A number of questions have arisen in Galway and we are all well aware garda&iacute; on the ground are vital.  I await the Minister's response.</p></speech>

I interject to say we have already merged with Wexford and he is right to raise certain issues today because there is still a bit of work to be done on the amalgamations, specifically that of the divisions of Wicklow and Wexford.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Acting Chairman (Senator Pat Casey):</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The jury is still out on how that is working out on the ground so the Senator is right to raise the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#C00200"><p>I thank the Acting Chairperson and it is great to see Wicklow so well represented here.  I thank Senator Crowe for reminding all of us of that fact and for raising what is an important matter.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, sends her sincere apologies and asked me to provide the Senator with this update.  I will also undertake to follow up and provide the Minister, Deputy McEntee, with the transcript of this debate and to provide the Senator with the detail that he has understandably sought.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, will come back to the Senator on that issue.</p> <p>As Senator Crowe is aware, one of the core principles identified by the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be structured and managed to support front-line policing.  As recommended by the commission and endorsed by the Government, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently in the process of transitioning to a new and modern operating model.  The new operating model structures require a change from the existing geographic model to a new functional-focused model.  Specifically, this means the operating model will result in the enlargement of Garda divisions, reducing the existing number of divisions from 28 to 19.  The Senator will be aware that Galway will remain as a stand-alone Garda division.</p> <p>Each of the 19 divisions will be made up of four functional areas as follows: community engagement; crime; performance assurance; and business services.  Each of the functional areas will be led by a superintendent, with the exception of business services, which is led by an assistant principal.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is engaged in implementing the business services functional area across all of its divisions.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is advised that the Galway division is among the first Garda divisions selected to fully implement and align to the operating model.  All services will be managed and co-ordinated at divisional level as opposed to district level.  All Garda stations will be aligned to the community engagement functional areas.  Garda members and staff will continue to be geographically dispersed across the division.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is also informed that the Galway division has already fully established the business services functional area, led by an assistant principal.  This has led to a reduction in the administration activities held by operational Garda members and superintendents as recommended by the commission, which can only be good news for policing.  The following community engagement functional areas have been approved for the Galway division, each of which will be headed by a superintendent: Galway city; Galway county west; and Galway county east.</p> <p>Each community engagement superintendent will be responsible for: community engagement; crime prevention; incident investigation; victim support; incident response; general visibility; engagement policing; and community policing activities.  The continuing phased roll-out of the new Garda operating model will greatly benefit the Garda organisation, supporting the redeployment of garda&iacute; from non-core duties to front-line policing across the country.  It will create larger divisions with more resources, increased Garda visibility in communities, a wider range of locally delivered policing services, and a strong focus on community policing.  The model will also facilitate more effective streamlining of administrative processes and reduce bureaucracy.  On the specifics on Galway above and beyond what I have been provided with here, we will get that information in writing for Senator Crowe.</p></speech>

I welcome the information on the four different areas and that an assistant principal will be appointed to the business services area.  I take it that will lead to more garda&iacute; on the ground because there will be civilian staff across that section.  That is welcome and it is a road we need to travel further down because, no more than any other city or county, there is a huge shortage of garda&iacute; all over the country and particularly in Galway city, even though we have increased the numbers.</p> <p>I am concerned about Galway county west and the geographical division therein.  I say that because I understand that they will link Clifden and Oughterard with the Oranmore and Athenry district.  As the Minister will know, it is 70 or 80 miles from Connemara over to Athenry and I would question the workings of that.  That needs to be thought through and more detail is needed on it.  I would be concerned about that and the message needs to be about visibility within the community and boots on the ground.  I am concerned about Salthill Garda station and a superintendent not being there.  What I mean by that is that over 35,000 people in the Connemara area would all be linked in to Galway county west as far as I understand the redivision, and the superintendent would be in the Oranmore region.  That raises a concern for me.</p></speech>

The Government, which we both support and are members of, continues to prioritise unprecedented resource allocation to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is about making sure the operating model ensures that those resources deliver in the best possible way for communities.  The Garda budget provided by the Government is over &euro;2 billion for the current year, and as the Senator will be aware, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na registered strong interest in its latest recruitment competition earlier this year, with over 10,000 applications received.  Additionally and importantly, over 800 Garda members have been redeployed in recent years from administrative duties to front-line policing roles, where their expertise can be utilised fully in line with the commission's recommendations.</p> <p>The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of policing priorities and crime trends to ensure their optimum use.  The Minister has also informed me, so I can inform the Senator, that there are no plans to change the staffing or resource levels of Salthill Garda station or to change its opening hours from the current 24 hours.</p></speech>

It seems to be that he is always here answering and responding to me but I am delighted he is here.  I understand that the Minister cannot be here and I wish him well.</p><p>This Commencement matter relates to nodes and in preparation for this commentary on nodes I decided to look at a number of county development plans this morning.  Strange as it might seem and not knowing that the Minister of State was coming in, I pulled Kilkenny County Council so it is appropriate that the Minister of State is here as the Deputy for Kilkenny.  I will quote the Kilkenny County Council development plan and I want to praise Kilkenny County Council as it is one of the leading councils on nodes.  Section 4.7 of the Kilkenny county development plan on rural nodes policy talks about the potential for smaller towns and villages and the settlement hierarchy of rural nodes.  It defines what a rural node is and talks about the key objectives for rural nodes in rural communities, particularly in Kilkenny, the Minister of State's constituency.  Objective 4J is as follows: &quot;To develop a programme for &lsquo;new homes in small towns and villages&rsquo; in conjunction with, public infrastructure agencies such as Irish Water and local communities for the provision of serviced sites with appropriate infrastructure to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages&quot;.  That is what we might like to call small nodes when it comes to the hierarchy and I quite like the word &quot;node&quot;.  It goes on to state: &quot;It is an objective of the Council to facilitate and assist Irish Water&quot; in this and it talks about examples of this work going on in Mullinavat, Paulstown, Bennettsbridge, Inistioge, Piltown, Fiddown and Kells.  What a coincidence that we should be talking about Kilkenny and I acknowledge the enormous work the county council has done there.</p><p>This issue originally came about because it was suggested that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who cannot be with us today, made an announcement.  The headline in <i>The Meath Chronicle</i>was: &quot;The Minister says funds available for development of rural 'nodes' &quot;.  In response to that a number of councillors came out and asked where the money is.  This article was published on Saturday, 21 May 2022, and the county manager for Meath said he knew nothing about it or about any money and that there were 50 rural nodes possibilities within the county but that the council had no funding.</p><p>I will not go on and talk about the further detail in the article where things were attributed as being said by the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, other than to say it raises a critical issue about rural housing and communities and how we can support local authorities to develop rural communities.  We need to keep these areas alive.  We have schools, infrastructure, churches and sports clubs in rural Ireland and people want to live in rural communities.  We must provide homes for people in rural communities, especially where there is an older generation of people who are heavily relying on a son, daughter or member of family who may wish to build a new home close to them.</p><p>We have to move on.  We have been waiting for a more detailed response to the Flemish decree which deals with rural housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Successive Governments have suggested they would introduce a rural housing policy in response to the findings of the Flemish decree and we are still awaiting them.  The Minister of State might be able to advise the Seanad and myself where we are at regarding a follow-up in terms of rural housing policy, being particularly mindful of the Flemish decree and its recommendations, findings and deliberations.  I would like to know where the money is.  I accept and welcome the development of rural nodes.  I look forward to encouraging and seeing the Government encourage more people to build new homes in rural parts of the country that are sustainable and appropriate to their setting.  I would be more interested in hearing where funding is that has been committed to these rural nodes.</p></speech>

I am not sure what school they are in but they all very welcome to the Seanad Chamber.  It is fantastic to have schools visit these Houses.</p> <p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his question and for citing the example of Kilkenny.  He is correct.  It is a very good example but we always do things well in Kilkenny, as he would know well.  Rural nodes are the lowest tier in the settlement hierarchy and comprise a cluster of developments where public wastewater and-or public water infrastructure is currently not provided.  These nodes contain important services, including schools and community facilities supporting the surrounding rural area.  Rural nodes are designated for small-scale limited development at a sustainable scale for immediate local need, including one-off housing for persons who comply with the local need criteria, local services, small-scale employment and community facilities.  The Senator may be aware the development of rural nodes is subject to proper planning considerations and the environmental carrying capacity of an area.  </p> <p>Consideration of planning applications for development within such nodes will have regard to the role and form of the node within the wider rural area with particular care being taken that these settlements do not compete with the designated larger and smaller serviced villages in the services they provide or the role and function they play within the rural area.</p> <p>As part of Housing for all, the Government is committed to developing Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, towns, which will provide funding for local authorities to provide serviced sites with appropriate infrastructure to attract people to build their own homes and live in small towns and villages.  It is expected that this fund will be announced shortly.  In tandem with this, Irish Water is providing funding for the servicing of many towns and villages, and further funding initiatives are available through the Department of Rural and Community Development.  In particular, further rounds of funding under the rural regeneration and development fund are scheduled for later this year and early in 2023.  Under this fund, applicants need to provide a comprehensive business case as part of any application.  Any application relating to a rural node to be located in a town or village would need to provide clear evidence of the need and level of demand in an area and the growth potential which the project will meet.  I am satisfied that through these range of schemes there are potential sources of funding for the sustainable development of rural locations.</p> <p>I agree with what the Senator said.  There are many across the country, particularly in the west, that are in rural decline.  Very vibrant communities live in some of the rural locations he outlined in County Kilkenny.  They are being allowed to expand in line with the carrying capacity of waterways, water infrastructure and local infrastructure.  Our local authority has done very well in ensuring these communities can remain vibrant through funding schemes such as the town and village renewal scheme and other schemes to help support them and keep rural schools, rural post offices etc. open.  The challenge is to strike a balance to ensure we get capacity in our towns for them to grow to a level where public transport and walking and cycling routes to school are viable for communities.  However, we must also be strategic in addressing rural areas whose populations are is decline and that will be evident shortly from the census figures.  Local authorities need to be strategic in trying to ensure we can repopulate those areas and keep those communities vibrant.  We need people living in rural Ireland.  That is something to which the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has been deeply committed throughout his tenure as the Minister of State with responsibility for planning and local government.  </p> <p>In summary, there is no doubt it is a significant challenge.  It is not always enticing for people to live in rural areas.  It requires a significant level of commitment to be become part of a local community, part of a local GAA club or to send one's children to the local schools.  That is important but it is also important we have a suite of policies at our level and at local government level to support rural communities to grow and to prosper.</p></speech>

The final paragraph of the reply, which was prepared on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, states " I am satisfied &hellip; through a range of schemes, there are potential sources of funding&rdquo;.  That is not an answer to my question.  He is satisfied but I need to be satisfied, as do we all.  I asked this question because rural councillors throughout the country have said there have been promises of financial support for rural nodes, but where is the funding?  The reply indicates there will be other phases of funding from 2022 to 2023, but when will we have that?  I respectfully ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, if possible, to request an official in the Department to forward a supplementary response indicating a timeline for these funding sources.  Who is administering them?  Can we inform the local authorities and planning authorities of what is happening?  What is the plan?  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, clearly knows something more, at least I hope he does, given the reply states he is satisfied in this regard.  Perhaps he could furnish us with a schedule of the funding he has identified, secured, discussed and told people about in order that we can get that into the public domain.  I sincerely thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for coming to the house today.</p></speech>

We see it as being vitally important that small-scale water and wastewater treatment plants are upgraded to meet the needs of local rural areas.  The funding is directed through local authorities.  They are responsible for the local road infrastructure, lighting etc. in these rural nodes we are discussing.  That prioritisation falls back on to local elected members, who have an important role to play in ensuring funding is distributed equally in their urban areas and counties to enable rural areas to survive.  From that perspective, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, is saying he wants to enable this within development plans to ensure they reflect the rural node principles but also that we ensure we give capacity to our regional towns, smaller towns and villages such as some of the places the Senator mentioned in County Kilkenny.  The funding streams come down to local level and how local authorities prioritise the funding and support for local infrastructure and services.  These areas have to be serviced by many other agencies, as well as local authorities.  We will come back to the Senator with a response if he is seeking more detail on those specific funding streams.</p></speech>

I think this is the first time I addressed him since he was elevated to ministerial office.  I am delighted he is here, and I understand the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is unwell with Covid-19 and I wish him well, but it is deeply regrettable the junior Minister at his Department is not here to take this issue.</p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware of the fact that four brave crew members of the contracted helicopter search and rescue service lost their lives when Rescue 116 crashed at Black Rock, County Mayo, in 2017.  He will no doubt be further aware that all four were flying with inaccurate charts, faulty satellite locators and must have been suffering from fatigue due to the demanding 24-hour shift work rosters under which they were operating.  Among other things, the Air Accident Investigation Unit report pointed out dysfunctional oversight of search and rescue and alleged safety management failures by the Irish Coast Guard and CHC Ireland, the air crew's employer.  </p> <p>The Air Accident Investigation Unit, on its website, published on 5 November 2021 some 44 safety recommendations and it advised that in all 44 cases, it is still awaiting a response.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Like me, I am sure the Minister of State would want to ensure that those who put their lives in peril to serve in what must be the greatest calling, that is, to save human life, should have their safety and working conditions at the highest level of priority for Ministers and their Departments.  Some 22 of the recommendations advert specifically to CHC Ireland, the operator.  In addition to that, most worrying is the fact that the Air Accident Investigation Unit points out that neither the Irish Coast Guard nor the Department of Transport have any aviation expertise within their staff.  The AAIU also points to the 24-hour shift cycle and refers to fatigue and risk management.  I believe that the crew of Rescue 116 had been operating for some 16 or 17 hours before being called out.  Again, the AAIU refers to the poor level of lighting in the cockpit.</p><p>It is no secret that for two and a half years I have been speaking on this issue and on the reckless behaviour that is taking place in search and rescue.  I know that one of the helicopters is situated in the Minister of State's constituency and that he has a close affinity with the people who work in that area.  It is great that we do.  However, these people need more than our congratulations.  We need to know that the Department has staff who are capable of overseeing the contract.  Right now, the contract for search and rescue is being overseen by a company that is a single operator.  It does not inspire confidence.</p><p>I brought with me today the recommendations of the Air Accident Investigation Unit.  It is no secret that this report took years to get published.  The report contains 44 recommendations and months later, the AAIU has said there has been no response to them.  Some of the recommendations are simple, administrative matters that need to happen.  If the operator is still operating a 24-hour shift roster, why is that the case?  On 1 June an instruction came out from the Irish Aviation Authority restricting flying rosters to 12 hours.  If a 24-hour roster is still in place, why is that the case?  It needs to stop.  I can see the Acting Chairman is about to hit the bell so I will take my seat for a moment.</p></speech>

As the Senator outlines, the final report by the Air Accident Investigation Unit into the Rescue 116 accident at Blackrock, County Mayo, on 14 March 2017 was published on 5 November 2021.  The report contains 42 safety recommendations, of which 14 were addressed to the Minister for Transport, in the form of individual transmittal letters.</p> <p>At the time of the publication of the report the Minister for Transport fully accepted the recommendations addressed to him.  The Irish Aviation Authority also reviewed and fully accepted the recommendations addressed to it as the national aviation regulator, many of which have already been implemented or are proceeding to full implementation.  It is a matter for the Irish Aviation Authority to respond independently to the findings addressed to it.</p> <p>The Minister for Transport was required to acknowledge receipt of each transmittal letter and inform the AAIU of the actions taken or under consideration and, where appropriate, of the time necessary for their completion and where no action is taken, why this is so.  The deadline for this was 3 February this year and the responses were sent to the AAIU on 1 February.  The regulations require the AAIU to engage with the addressees of the safety recommendations and any requests for clarification from the AAIU to the Department have been received, considered and dealt with.  The Department remains open to any further requests for clarification the AAIU may have.</p> <p>The responses will be made public on the AAIU website via the associated published investigation report, and in the European safety recommendation information system.  This is expected to happen shortly.  It should be noted that the Department of Transport did not wait for the publication of the final report in order to implement changes on foot of lessons learned following the accident.  Since March 2017, and specifically following receipt of the draft final report in September 2019, the Department, and in particular the Irish Coast Guard, have undertaken a significant programme of change across key areas to take account of issues raised and recommendations addressed to the Minister for Transport.</p> <p>On foot of the interim report of the Air Accident Investigation Unit, the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport commissioned an independent review of oversight arrangements for search and rescue aviation operations in Ireland.  Following publication of the independent review, known as the AQE report, in September 2018, the then Minister committed to implementing its 12 recommendations.  As the Senator is aware, the Department of Transport is conducting a formal procurement process for a new Coast Guard aviation service following a detailed appraisal and business case prepared in accordance with the public spending code.  The process began in December of last year with the release on eTenders of a pre-qualification questionnaire, PQQ, and response document for candidates to complete.  The PQQ set out certain criteria to determine which operators would have the capacity to perform the contract.</p> <p>Following this, an amendment was issued to the PQQ which specified the number and location of search and rescue, SAR, bases to reflect the existing configuration, namely, four bases at Dublin, Shannon, Sligo and Waterford.  The amendment ensured the delivery of wider Government policies concerning balanced and even distribution of State services and investment, in particular the needs of island and rural communities.  The PQQ stage of the procurement process concluded last month and both successful and unsuccessful candidates were notified of the outcome of the PQQ evaluation.  The procurement process is now moving into the second stage, that is, the request for tenders.</p></speech>

Within days of the PQQ to which the Minister of State adverted in his reply being issued, it had to be extended because of the change from three bases to four bases.  We are about to move to the tender stage, yet the PQQ at the time did not take account of the new regulation set down by the Irish Aviation Authority, changing from 24-hour shifts to 12-hour shifts.  This will significantly impact the payroll costs of the organisation that is contracted to the next SAR service.</p> <p>The bottom line on this is that it fired out a 415 page submission by the Irish Air Corps to provide SAR with a three-page piece of junk that offers no technological, empirical or statistical evidence to support its conclusions.  I am deeply concerned that we are moving to the next contract without any expertise within the Department that is leading out or its sub-unit, the Irish Coast Guard.  This is recklessness.  I have made my position clear in many emails that have been circulated to all Members of this House.</p> <p>I do not want to hammer the Minister of State, as it is not his area of responsibility.  I very much appreciate the fact that he came here to take this Commencement matter today, but I will not let this matter go.  Lives are being put at risk.  A total of &euro;400 million of public money is about to be wasted.</p></speech>

The provision of an effective maritime search and rescue service is critical to Ireland as an island nation with a strong maritime sector, which depends on the reliability and professionalism of the Irish Coast Guard and all its component parts, including the Coast Guard aviation service, to offer a service which we all agree can deploy at a moment's notice to rescue people in distress and bring them to a place of safety.</p> <p>As noted earlier, since receipt of the draft final report in September 2019, the Department of Transport has undertaken a significant programme of change across key sectors to take account of the issues raised and recommendations made at that time.  As Senator Craughwell correctly says, the measures fall under six broad categories.  The Minister for Transport assures me that he is confident these measures will strengthen the safe conduct of search and rescue operations.  I will bring the observations raised by the Senator to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

I will outline the facts from letters I received.  Cork University Hospital, CUH, is the south-west region's centre for neurology but is short of neurology nurse specialists.  Patients are unnecessarily waiting longer for diagnosis and treatment.  Based on the catchment area, national and international guidelines recommend that there should be 20 neurology nurse specialists, but there are only four in Cork.  This is a disgrace.</p> <p>I have already confessed that I suffer from a neurological ailment.  God forbid if somebody in west Cork or south Kerry, a long way from the CUH, had a seizure or difficulty and got to CUH to find he or she is waiting on a trolley because of the lack of neurological specialist nurses.  It is a disgrace.  In Dublin, you have several hospitals you can fall back on, like St. James's, Beaumont, Mater private and others, but the south west is being neglected.  It is a life-threatening situation when there is a neurological emergency.</p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to reflect on this.  If there were 16 neurological nurse specialists in the CUH for this region, I probably would not complain.  However, four is one fifth or 20% of what national and international guidelines suggest.  I will hand over to Senator Buttimer, who is far closer to CUH than I am and who is probably more knowledgeable than me about this issue.</p></speech>

He is living the experience and has made two pertinent points about care and access to care.  This is about quality of life for people and about access to service.  There is a critical gap in the care of those with a neurological condition.</p><p>The theme of the campaign is &quot;Patients Deserve Better&quot;, which highlights the need for 100 specialist neurologists in nursing and is also about the four we have in Cork and the 16 needed to provide, as Senator O'Donovan said, essential care to people with neurological conditions.  One example involves a gentleman I know, Declan Groeger, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, MS, and who says:</p> <blockquote> 	There is one neurological nurse in CUH for epilepsy, one for stroke and there are two nurses for every other neurological patient.  The two nurses I deal with are excellent but they are not MS specialists. </blockquote> <p>We need to ensure critical care is given for MS, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and other rare neurological conditions.  We are highlighting the gap in the provision of services.  We accept that much work is being done, we commend all of those doing the work and we understand that there is an issue with recruitment.  However, just four nurses in Cork University hospital is a shortfall that we hope will be addressed as part of the HSE development plan for the Cork-Kerry region.</p><p>We had a briefing on community care last Monday with the HSE.  This matter does not fall under community care but under hospital services.  I support the neurological association of Ireland.  Deputy Colm Burke is having a briefing today in the audiovisual room on this matter and the issue of provision of neurological care.  It is about making sure we put in place extra nurses.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work and role played by neurological nurse specialists in the care of patients.  They play an important role in triaging, assessing, and providing ongoing support to neurological patients.  This in turn builds capacity within neurological services and allows for more timely access to efficient, equitable and quality care.</p> <p>I am advised that the HSE's national clinical programme for neurology, in conjunction with the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI, completed an all-Ireland survey of neurological services in 2020.  This survey confirmed that all neurological centres have access to a designated clinical nurse specialist and-or advanced nurse practitioner, recognising the value that skilled and highly trained nursing staff add to neurological services.  The HSE has advised that plans will be developed to incrementally increase the overall number of nurse specialists.</p> <p>The national clinical programme for neurology continues to engage regularly with patient organisations and the NAI to establish ways to promote neurology nurse specialists.  It is focusing its current work streams and initiatives around nurse-led clinics, nurse liaison services and outreach programs.  Examples of this include the headache and epilepsy outreach programmes, both of which are funded under the Sl&aacute;intecare innovation fund.  These programmes reconfigure the management of these conditions, enabling clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners to lead and co-ordinate the care of these conditions in the community.  This reduces reliance on consultant neurologists and tertiary services, in turn allowing more timely access to services and improving the overall quality of care.</p> <p>The HSE has advised that all funded neurology nurse specialist posts in CUH are filled.  There are currently five specialist nurses working within neurology services at the hospital.  In  addition, a candidate advanced nurse practitioner for epilepsy is going through the HSE recruitment process.</p> <p>In 2021, the South/South West Hospital Group sought and received approval for two additional consultant neurologist posts to improve services at CUH.  The consultant applications advisory committee recently approved these posts and recruitment is progressing to fill them.  A second consultant neurophysiologist was recently appointed in CUH.  An initiative to convene after-hours outpatient department clinics to address the issue of those obliged to wait a long time is also under discussion.</p> <p>The Government is committed to improving patient services and having patient-centred care in Cork and across the country. That commitment is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding that is being targeted across the health service in recent budgets and again in budget 2022.  I am assured that the South/South West Hospital Group remains committed to the development of neurology services within the group, and to improving these services for patients of the south and south-west region.</p></speech>

He is basically the messenger.  It reminds me of somebody in a football game who is 20 points to four down at half-time.

I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  It is inadequate in terms of the development of a tier 1 hospital that is the primary hospital for the southern region.  The issue of neurology is gaining a cohort of people every day.</p> <p>We need a joined-up approach.  This is about continuum of care and allowing people to go out from hospital knowing that if they need someone, there will be someone there for them on their return.  Senator O'Donovan and I will keep up the battle in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to improving services in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  The development of these services provides an opportunity to make significant changes to the quality of life of our citizens.  The South/South West Hospital Group remains committed to the development of neurology services within the group.  There are currently five specialist nurses working in neurology services at CUH, and two additional consultants are being recruited.  The national clinical programme for neurology is focused on ways in which improvements can be made that will benefit patients.  This includes the promotion of neurology nurse specialists through nurse-led clinics, nurse liaison services and outreach programmes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition, the headache programme and epilepsy outreach programme, both funded under the Sl&aacute;intecare innovation fund, aim to reconfigure the management of these conditions by enabling clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners to lead and co-ordinate the care of these conditions in the community.

There was also knowledge at that point about how we could work collectively to address this as a global health crisis.  There was the C-TAP proposal, which was a technology pool to share not just vaccines but medicines, treatments, know-how and diagnostics in a practical way to ensure we got treatment and vaccines to everybody as quickly as possible.  South Africa and India proposed that we should use the mechanisms that were there for exactly this kind of health emergency to waive the intellectual property, IP, on vaccines and their know-how and lift the TRIPS mechanisms.  Despite that proposal being made, in the 18 months since then, there has been a succession of delays, disinegenuous arguments and WTO meeting after WTO meeting that have not addressed this issue.  That is even though the public and parliamentarians know this is the way to go.  The European Parliament, the committees and the Seanad have called for a TRIPS waiver but shamefully, our T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment went to the meeting between the African Union and the EU and said he did not want people to take advantage of this to damage innovation and intellectual property.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#G00400"><p>The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard from Oxfam Ireland and M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res on this matter.  The good news is that we wrote to the T&aacute;naiste on an all-party basis and said he needed to come out in full support of a TRIPS waiver for Covid-19 vaccines.  However, the disgraceful fact of the matter is that he has done quite the opposite.  The EU is now supporting the so-called Quad proposal.  I will briefly explain why that is not sufficient to deal with the crisis.  Today, just 12% of people in Africa have received two vaccines, as opposed to 81% in Europe.  There is still a very real crisis there.  The Quad proposal applies primarily to patents and not other IP rights, such as trade secrets, which are also vital for vaccines.  It falls far short of the broad package of measures envisaged by the TRIPS waiver.  While often presented as a waiver, it does not waive IP rights.  Instead, it primarily makes modifications to existing TRIPS compulsory licensing mechanisms.  The Quad proposal also introduces various additional requirements for compulsory licences that TRIPS requires.  For example, it requires a list of all patents relevant to the vaccine before a compulsory licence is issued.  This could prove exceptionally difficult in practice.  The proposal only applies to eligible members, which are defined narrowly, limiting who can use it.  Put simply, the Quad proposal is not a workable or effective solution.</p></speech>

It is a step backwards.  It is &quot;not a workable or effective solution&quot;, according to Professor Aisling McMahon from Maynooth University.  The people of the global south are the most affected by the vaccine apartheid.  At the WTO ministerial conference, the Indian minister for commerce said:</p> <blockquote> 	... what we are getting is completely half-baked and it will not allow us to make any vaccines.  They have no intentions of allowing therapeutics and diagnostics and if at all they try to say that we are the cause for its collapse, I think we should unanimously speak to the world and tell them that no, ideally we want a holistic solution including therapeutic and diagnostics... </blockquote> <p>It would be unacceptable for Ireland to be pushing an agreement that, amidst grave Covid vaccine inequities, has the potential to make the situation worse.  Will the T&aacute;naiste heed the call of the Irish public, the Seanad and the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the European Parliament and support a full TRIPS waiver?</p></speech>

I have listened carefully and agree with many of the points raised by the Senators.  As they are aware, the WTO ministerial conference is ongoing and concludes today in Geneva.  This is the major decision-making forum for the WTO and the intention is that the intellectual property aspects can be agreed as part of the broader WTO trade-related response to the pandemic.  A draft ministerial decision on the TRIPS agreement is under intense discussion by ministers with the aim of finding a solution that will be acceptable to all WTO members.  This draft decision offers the most promising path towards achieving a meaningful outcome that will contribute to ensuring access to safe and effective vaccines across the globe.  The decision provides for a waiver and clarification of some of the flexibilities within the TRIPS agreement.  If agreed, the proposal will address the concerns of South Africa and developing countries and will allow them to immediately authorise the manufacture, import and export of Covid-19 vaccines without the consent of the patent owners.  At the same time, the solution maintains a functioning intellectual property framework, which is crucial to incentivise the investment and research that is necessary for the development of new vaccines and medicines.</p> <p>The EU believes the proposal represents the most promising path toward achieving a meaningful outcome among all WTO members.  As a member of the EU, Ireland will continue to engage constructively with the European Commission and other member states on the EU position on the discussions at the ministerial conference.  It is also important to highlight that there are now sufficient vaccines for everybody in the world, including for booster campaigns.  Vaccine supply currently exceeds demand.  Vaccine producers have highlighted that the demand for vaccines has declined significantly.  In late February, the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention called for a pause in vaccine donations to Africa until the end of the year, noting that supply was no longer the main challenge.  Rather, logistics, infrastructure, and vaccine hesitancy are the main barriers.</p></speech>

The fact that these countries have not been able to have public heath vaccine programmes has been a key obstacle and they have not been able to have public health programmes on an organised basis because they have not had a reliable supply of vaccines.  I reject the Minister of State's suggestion profoundly.  I note there is some progress being made but the problem is that we are still stalling for months.  This time last year, we were hearing about an EU proposal that did not work, which just moved around the pieces in the existing TRIPS agreement.  Flexibility is not the same as a waiver.  I am very concerned that it looks like diagnostics and therapeutics, which are the crucial other part for those who have suffered from Covid-19 due to the neglect of the global north, are still being put on the long finger.  We need to do more and better.  Is Ireland taking the side of those seeking to strengthen these proposals in the negotiations, or is it joining the voices seeking to weaken them?</p></speech>

It is shameful.  People in the Minister of State's own party voted against the stance the T&aacute;naiste is taking.  Please tell us the Government can and will do better.</p></speech>

I firmly believe, as does the Government, that no one is safe until everybody is safe.  As vaccine production is no longer the issue, the international community is now focused on the need to rapidly build capacity in low-income countries including with regard to healthcare workers, cold chain logistics, infrastructure to properly move and store vaccines and syringe supply, so the demand for vaccines will increase in line with supply and vaccines can be administered on the necessary scale to meet the World Health Organization's 70% vaccination target by mid-2022.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On the IP aspects of the trade-related responses to the pandemic, the compromise proposal on the table will facilitate the production of vaccines that are key for regions such as Africa and will allow those regions to create a self-sufficient pharmaceutical production base while preserving the incentives for innovation and investment that are key for responding to new diseases.

It is a month in which members of the LGBT community and our supporters, friends, allies and families celebrate and advocate on behalf of our community.  It is about building an equal, inclusive and tolerant society where all members of society can play a part and, as Abraham Maslow said, can reach their full potential.  I express my disappointment at the decision of RT&Eacute; and Dublin Pride to part ways.  I understand the decision taken by Dublin Pride and I seek a debate in Pride month on matters of equality, diversity and inclusivity.  Our national broadcaster has a duty to be just that: a national broadcaster.  I understand the nature of "Liveline".  Many of us in this Chamber will know we have been the subject of much conversation on that programme at times.  It is important in any discourse on any radio station to remember that language and words matter.  It is not only about what we say; it is also about how we say it and what is implied and meant by the inflections of what we say.  That is why it is important that the decision taken by Dublin Pride and the response of RT&Eacute; are reflected upon.</p> <p>We have come a long way as a society but we in this House, as legislators and leaders, have a critical role to play in bringing people with us.  This is Pride month.  Many people thought when the country passed marriage equality, the roof was put on the house.  That is sadly not the case.  I applaud many Members of this House for their support and advocacy.  I applaud the Cathaoirleach, along with the Ceann Comhairle, for the roles these Houses have played in making changes that allow for the raising of the Pride flag and for the friendship group of Members of the Parliament.  We also have a parliamentary network of staff and Members.  I ask RT&Eacute; and Dublin Pride to sit down and work out a means to re-engage in this important month.  This month is not only about us as Members.  It is about our families, friends and supporters.  Pride is important and for as long as we encounter the events of this week and the movement of members of the far right in America to disturb and cause trouble at a Pride event, we will always need Pride.  I invite all Members of this House to support the Pride events in Dublin next week.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.</p></speech>

It would be welcome if the Leader could facilitate a debate on the issue.  As we have come out of the pandemic, this is our first Pride month in almost three years during which we can get together and celebrate.  In the Dublin Central constituency, we will be celebrating Pride.</p><p>The same constituency will tomorrow be celebrating one of the country's most famous literary sons, namely, James Joyce.  He may have been born on the south side but he had the good sense to move to the north side.  He spent an awful lot of time in my neck of the woods.  He lived on Claude Road and St. Peter's Road.  He went to school in O'Connell School on the North Circular Road and Belvedere College on Great Denmark Street before he emigrated and wrote his masterpiece, of which we are all very proud.  It will be celebrated tomorrow not just in Dublin but all around the world.  I congratulate the organisers of the 2022 Bloomsday festival.  I do not know if any of my colleagues have had the chance to engage in the festival or to experience any of the wonderful events involved.  There is a programme of literature, art, culture and music.  It is a joy to celebrate and we should all do so and commend all of those involved.</p><p>I also commend the organisers of the Stoneybatter festival, which will take place in Dublin Central this weekend.  Stoneybatter is one of the oldest villages in our city.  A village with cobblestones and cattle markets, Stoneybatter features in <i>Ulysses</i>, as does Arbour Hill.  In particular, the City Arms Hotel on Prussia Street features.

If they have not had enough excitement and entertainment there, they need to come on Sunday to Mountjoy Square, which is the most perfect of Georgian squares in Dublin city.  This Sunday will be Super Soul Sunday in Mountjoy Square and gospel choirs from all over the city will come to lift the square with their gospel singing.  It is free of charge from 12 noon to 6.30 p.m.  I invite everybody in the city, or anywhere, to come to Dublin Central this weekend to enjoy and celebrate the strong, vibrant and diverse community that is Dublin Central and that makes us all so proud of it. </p></speech>

Of course, travel featured on many of their lists.  It has always been said that the time to do it is when we are young, but I was shocked by how many were planning for their travel to be permanent.  Emigration was a consistently common thread across many of these people's plans.  One person stated that loads of their mates were in America already and that person would probably end up there.  Another said her friend had moved to Samoa where he now has his own house for the price of a student room in Dublin.  It is no newsflash that we are losing many of our young professionals to emigration but every time I come face to face with it, there is something so bleak about the reality that, almost exclusively on account of their housing prospects, young Irishmen and Irishwomen see no future for themselves in their own country.</p> <p>It always makes me think, do we not have a duty to these people?  To whom is our allegiance?  Is it to the Exchequer, to multinational companies and to faceless overseas trusts generating percentage point profits for people who will never set foot in this country, or is it to our own, the ordinary people of Ireland?  They are not seeking inflated real estate portfolios or passive income investments but a roof over their heads and the opportunity to make a life for themselves just as we were all able to do.  Ireland is a country of extraordinary wealth.  We boast Europe's second largest GDP per capita and the Government spends a staggering &euro;80 billion every year on running the place, yet the basic need of Irish citizens is made unattainable.</p> <p>Perhaps the phrase "Irish homes for Irish people" sounds a little alt-right to some people, as if meeting the needs of our own country is now extremism, but it is working well for the Danish.  Foreigners who have not been resident in Denmark for a period of five years or more may only purchase real estate property if they obtain permission from the Danish Ministry of Justice, which is granted on a case-by-case basis.  This rule also applies to companies, associations, public or private institutions, foundations and foreign public authorities.  It is very simple.  In Denmark, houses are for living in and not for generating profits.  If people are local, they can buy.  If not, they must become locals first or show they will become so in the next few years.  It is not that there are no other people in the queue for Danish houses.  It is just that the Danes come first and are put there by their own Government.</p> <p>I do not expect an about-turn on housing policy in this country.  Perhaps this is some food for thought.  We ought to examine how a Danish-style system might work in Ireland. </p></speech>

It was greatly encouraging to see the level of engagement from academic experts, voluntary organisations and public servants about how best we can protect, restore and enhance our biodiversity.  In his keynote address to the conference, the Taoiseach spoke of a growing realisation that our fortunes as a species and society are inseparable from the fortunes of our natural world.  The Taoiseach also commented that biodiversity loss, "will only be successfully tackled as an all-of-government and all-of-society project".</p> <p>Approximately two thirds of the land of Ireland is farmland.  It is critical our farmers play a central role in that all-of-society conversation on how we can reverse biodiversity loss.  The Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss is a key part of that conversation.  It is vital that members of the public partaking in that assembly hear from farming voices.  The simple reality is if we are to turn the tide on the biodiversity crisis, we will only be able to do so with the help of our farmers, who need to be in the room contributing to the conversation on how best we can do that.</p> <p>We know that biodiversity does not recognise borders or field boundaries, land parcels or herd numbers.  That is why it is essential to embrace farming practices that support biodiversity across the whole farm.  A whole-farm approach should not confine biodiversity to a small strip or corner of a field.  Nor should we do down the road of a split within agriculture whereby one cohort of farmers farms exclusively for nature and another exclusively for food production.  They must go hand in hand.  Adopting practices that allow biodiversity to flourish across our countryside, across all fields and on all farms, is the direction of travel we must take.  I know from the farms I visit, in Laois-Offaly, the constituency in which I live, and further afield, that the vast majority of farmers want to get involved and play their part in our whole-of-society response to biodiversity loss by farming with nature and not against it.</p> <p>It takes a lot of time and energy to work against nature.  As an organic farmer, that is something I have been able to reflect upon in the context of my own farm.  Organic farming means working with nature.  After nearly ten years of farming organically, I can see the difference in my soil quality and how abundantly our grass grows.  I can see the increase in the number and variety of insects and birds on my farm.  Again, while we know the benefits for biodiversity that go with organic farming, we simply cannot afford a twin-track approach with only certain cohorts of farmers incentivised to farm for nature.  If we are to tackle the biodiversity crisis, we will have to bring all farmers with us as we make the shift to an agricultural model that works for biodiversity instead of against it.</p></speech>

We had a meeting in Limerick the other night, which was packed to the rafters and was attended by Dr. Lorcan Sirr.  He also attended the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis a couple of years ago and is not a member of any political party.  He made a couple of very salient points, namely, that first-time buyers are being completely squeezed in the marketplace, with a 30% reduction in Dublin, because this Government continues to follow the Fine Gael policy of tax breaks for institutional investors and vulture funds, and the build-to-rent market is squeezing out people.  Dr. Sirr also made the point that we are just not doing enough to build local authority homes.  Shockingly, not one home was built last year in the Taoiseach's constituency and, even more shocking, in the constituency of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, not one local authority home was built last year.  This is the reality.</p> <p>The heart-breaking stories we heard at that public meeting would chill Members in terms of the level of despair people are feeling.  We are on the wrong track and the wrong road.  Two years in, this Government is failing on housing and the debacle over the Land Development Agency is just the latest example.  We proposed almost 100 amendments to give that agency the powers it needed and they were all rejected by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael people in this Chamber.  It is time for an urgent debate on housing, which we are calling for.</p> <p>The second issue is even more serious.  Yesterday, I attended with others the meeting organised by D&oacute;chas on what is happening in the Horn of Africa.  I will give the House a couple of statistics.  One person is dying from hunger every 48 seconds at present.  Some 61% of people living in south Sudan do not have enough to eat and 350,000 children could die in Somalia in the coming months.  This is the stark reality of another famine.  We saw this happen ten years ago and we thought it would never happen again.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is happening again.  Of course, it is being compounded by the war in Ukraine.</p><p>D&oacute;chas very clearly asked for a significant increase in overseas development aid, ODA, funding.  It asked for &euro;233 million.  I hope that, on an all-party basis, we can agree and passionately argue with Government for that funding to be included in this year's budget.  We have to see justice for these people.  It was truly shocking to watch videos from ten years ago and hear former President Mary Robinson talk about how there is no dignity in seeing a mother watch her child die.  We are back there now.  It was encouraging to see people from number of parties present at the event yesterday.  I ask that we all work as hard as we can to ensure that there is a significant increase in the allowance for ODA in this year's budget to tackle this crisis.  We must also use our seat on the UN Security Council to engage with other countries to ensure that we do not face another disaster.  We lost 250,000 people in 2011.  The world cannot let that happen again.</p></speech>

I thought I would be standing up here during Pride month, as an out member of the LGBT community, to wish people a happy Pride and to list all of the things that we still have to do.  I expected to put on my glad rags and head to the Pride march, which is a standard thing that we do as members of the community every year.  I did not expect to be standing up to speak on the back of what has happened over the past week and the rhetoric that has been posted online, and in the context of our national broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, having its partnership with Dublin Pride severed for "the recent unacceptable triggering and extremely harmful anti-trans discussions that have been given a platform on Joe Duffy's Liveline on RT&Eacute; Radio 1", and for stoking "the flames of anti-trans rhetoric".  I know that Dublin Pride, like many in our community, has spent a long time working to increase positive representation of LGBTQ+ people on TV, radio and online.  Some of the events of the past week have set us back immeasurably.  It is most unfortunate, particularly for the trans community.</p> <p>Perhaps as an antidote to that, I might take a moment to reflect on how this week I went to the launch of Trans Equality Together, a coalition between the Trans Equality Network Ireland, TENI, BeLonG To, LGBT Ireland and a plethora of organisations and allies that have come together seeking to support the trans community and looking for equality for the community in areas such as healthcare, housing, well-being, socioeconomic status and all of the other things that need to be done beyond popping the roof on the house of marriage equality and gender recognition legislation, as Senator Buttimer put it.  I do not wish to take away from the extremely significant impact that both of those pieces of legislation had, but there is still a lot more work to do for that community.</p> <p>Tiernan Arnup, a member of AMACH! LGBT is on record as stating: "Trans people do not exist separately to the rest of the country.  We are woven into the fabric of it."  I do not want to use the word "discussion" to refer to recent events because it creates a politeness that is not deserved.  The broadcast that was aired for three days running meant that our community had to listen to people saying that they were not debating the existence of trans people or their lives.  They were debating their existence because they were saying that trans people do not exist in the way that they do exist.  That is debating people's existence and their lives.  It is unacceptable that our national broadcaster allowed that to go out on air, unfettered and, quite frankly, unchallenged.  Some serious claims were made during the broadcast and really damaging characterisations were made of our community, our trans friends and trans families.  It is not acceptable or good enough hat that community has to listen to that during Pride month.  It is a disservice to our national public broadcasting that it was allowed on air.  I want to stand up today in solidarity with our community, during this Pride month.  I hope that everyone in this House will stand in solidarity with our community.  As Senator Buttimer said, I ask people to join in us Dublin Pride.  Members can march with whatever group that they want to march.  We will all be there with our different groups.  We must show extreme solidarity at this moment in time with the trans community.  It is very marginalised and has been so let down by the State.  It has also been let down by our national broadcaster and that is not acceptable.</p></speech>

I do not claim to be a constitutional expert, but there is a clear delineation of powers and responsibilities between these three components.  To put it in layman's terms, ours is first and foremost a parliamentary democracy and political power resides in Leinster House.  The Government of the day is responsible for drawing up a budget and implementing its programme in a manner that best benefits the entire community.  The Government is held to account by the Opposition and has to answer to the people at regular intervals of not more than five years.  The Constitution provides a far more limited role for the President.  Many presidential powers may only be exercised on the advice of Government.  The President has functions in the summoning or dissolving the D&aacute;il, signing legislation into law, appointing judges or referring Bills to the Supreme Court.  The President also acts as supreme commander of the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

I suggest that we ask the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to come to the House to discuss the matter.  It concerns the tariff for electricity that is being exported by ordinary private individuals.  They are not getting paid.  The Minister said that such a tariff would be introduced in May or June.  There does not seem to be any sign of the tariff being paid to ordinary people.  Many people, both contractors and private individuals, have contacted me about the issue.  All other sectors are being paid a tariff.  The majority of solar and wind farms receive a tariff based on how much energy they can produce.  The banks give loans based on the amount of energy they can produce.  I do not see why homeowners should not be properly and adequately paid for the excess energy that they produce.  A tariff would act as an incentive because it would then be in homeowners' own interests to limit the amount of electricity that they are using to put more into the grid.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the poor level of broadband service provision on Main Street, Castlebar.  I am sure the Deputy Leader is aware of the issue.  A number of businesses have contacted me about it.  As the Deputy Leader will be aware, there are market leaders, including Vaughan Shoes and Stauntons Pharmacy, and many other businesses based on the street.  Quite a lot of business is done online.  It is very important that these businesses have good broadband service provision.  In some cases, the broadband speed is only 15 Mbps, when it can be up to 1,000 Mbps.  It is important that the issue be addressed.  I know of one business in the centre of Castlebar that has been waiting a month to get a broadband connection.  These businesses will have to move out of the centre and into the rural part of the town if this issue is not addressed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask that the Deputy Leader bring to the attention of the Minister the poor levels of service, particularly with Eir, with which there are great problems.

In an article by Sorcha Pollak in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 13 June 2022 entitled &quot;Five Ukrainian soldiers with 'significant trauma-related injuries' airlifted to Dublin&quot;, a statement from a Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson was included.  That spokesperson said Ireland was &quot;not politically or morally neutral in the face of Russia's appalling attack against Ukraine&quot;.  The article continues:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;Ireland has a long-standing policy of military neutrality, meaning that we do not participate in military alliances or mutual defence arrangements,&quot; he told The Irish Times.  However, the treatment of injured Ukrainian combatants in Ireland reflects the State's &quot;continuing commitment to work closely with our EU partners to provide humanitarian and other assistance to the people of Ukraine.&quot; </blockquote> <p>In making this statement, the Department has reiterated a falsehood that is directly in contravention of its own stated position on foreign policy.  Let me once again refer to Ireland's only White Paper on foreign policy, which was published by the Department of Foreign Affairs not in 1922 or between 1939 and 1945, during the Second World War, but in 1995.  Perhaps those in the Department have forgotten about it and perhaps it is time to remind them.  Paragraph 4.5 of chapter 4 of Challenges and Opportunities Abroad: Ireland's White Paper on Foreign Policy, which is the section on international security, states:</p> <blockquote> 	In the strict sense of international law and practice, neutrality and its attendant rights and duties do not exist in peacetime; they arise only during a state of war.  Neutrality represents an attitude of impartiality adopted by a state towards the participants in a conflict and recognised as such by the belligerents.  Such an attitude creates certain rights and duties between the neutral state and the belligerents which commence at the outbreak of war and end with its cessation. </blockquote> <p>Has Ireland's position changed since this White Paper was published?  If so, who changed it and where in the Oireachtas was it discussed?  What is this nonsense about political or moral neutrality and where does it come from?  Where can I find either position defined in international law?  The statement refers to military neutrality and states that we do not participate in military alliances.  Two points need to be made here.  The first is that neutrality and military non-alignment are polar opposites.  As a nation, are we neutral or non-aligned?  If we are truly militarily non-aligned, why have we not joined the other 120 non-aligned countries in the world?</p><p>It is time for an informed national debate on Ireland's status.  It is time for an honest debate.  I call on the Cathaoirleach, someone who has led on many things, including the debate we had here yesterday, to bring such a debate to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, the place where it must start.  At the beginning of the term of this Seanad, when we were elected in 2020, I asked for a debate on neutrality.  I ask for it again today.  The citizens of this country deserve no less than an honest, clear and informed debate to allow a national discussion on Ireland's future military status to commence.  We constantly hear this nonsense about political or moral neutrality and military non-alignment.  <i>The Irish Times</i>ran a poll about people's attitude to neutrality.  The people of Ireland do not know what is required of the State to be truly neutral or truly militarily non-aligned.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to work with the Leader to bring experts to this House who will debate with its Members what it truly means for Ireland to be neutral or militarily non-aligned.  Let us inform the debate before a citizens' assembly is put in place so that people are not talking about something that has not really been debated since the foundation of the State.</p></speech>

The first involves a word of warning to businesses.  Chambers of commerce are promoting companies seeking contracts with businesses in respect of health and safety coverage.  However, when you read the small print, you see that there is no cooling-off period to allow people to pull out of those contracts.  I just offer a word of warning people and advise them to look at these contracts.  Something needs to be inserted into consumer legislation to ensure this is not allowed because a significant number of businesses have been left facing significant costs after signing up for long contracts and not getting what it says on the tin.</p> <p>My second point relates to petrol forecourts throughout the country.  People might not be aware of this but Revenue has taken over the licensing of petrol stations.  It has written to every station in the country regarding dangerous substances licences.  Hundreds of stations around the country are going to close because they are not in a position to comply with this new provision.  We will see the local stations in many communities closing.  We are looking at increases in energy prices and are encouraging people to stay off the road but we will now see closures and many communities will be left without a local forecourt, green diesel will not be available for the farming community and kerosene will not be available for people's heating systems in the winter.  We will actually force people to travel further on the roads.</p> <p>It will also result in significant losses for small businesses throughout the country.  The owners have an asset that will become redundant.  They will lose footfall to their businesses and will face significant costs to rehabilitate their tanks.  I seek for this provision to be delayed for one year in order to allow these businesses to trade.  Some sort of compensation package needs to be provided for those businesses that have to close or to incur significant costs to comply with this provision.  This matter has not really been in the public domain and the reason I am putting it out there is because I am one of those business owners.  We face a significant loss of earnings and the loss of an asset that is worth tens of thousands to us.  We also have to go to the expense of dealing with our underground tanks but will get no compensation for it.  As I have said, a significant number of businesses around the country are going to close and communities will be left without access to fuel, including kerosene for heating and green diesel for rural farming communities.</p></speech>

We had a very good engagement with the new chair of the board, Conal Henry.  What is being done in Shannon is very impressive.  The new security features, including new scanners, that have been installed during the Covid pandemic have made a great difference.  Despite this, 87% of the aviation traffic in and out of this country goes through Dublin Airport.  The Minister has acknowledged that we need a new aviation policy.  I propose that we have a debate with the Minister in the Seanad on such a policy because I believe there is a lot of expertise in the area of transport and aviation in this Chamber and that such a debate would be useful.  I propose that we have that debate on the matter.</p></speech>

It has a number of very valid issues and concerns, including the need to tackle the chronic underfunding of primary schools.  Primary schools receive a standard capitation grant of &euro;183.  This is in contrast to the grant of &euro;316 paid to post-primary schools.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is a concern as they have a large number of day-to-day running costs they need to cover.  With the costs associated with inflation and the costs of products rising, this puts more pressure on the scarce resources within our schools.  We know the huge importance that capitation plays in the funding of primary schools.  I ask that the Minister would come to the House to make a statement on capitation grants and on the inflation costs in the delivery of services within our schools and on the school building programme.  It is a serious concern at the moment across all sectors in relation to construction as well.  I look forward to that debate in the future.</p></speech>

Senator Buttimer started this morning by speaking about this month being Pride month and the Senator referred specifically to the recent controversy around Dublin Pride and RT&Eacute;.  I share the Senator's concern that Pride has pulled away from RT&Eacute;.  It is regrettable that this parting of ways has happened.  I would certainly hope that both parties can get around the table to try to find a way forward.  That particular debate was quite tense at times with lots of different viewpoints articulated.  It is regrettable the Dublin Pride felt it did not want to continue in that partnership.  Hopefully they can get back to working together in the interests of promoting positive LGBTQI+ conversations and issues.</p> <p>The Senator requested a debate around equality, diversity and inclusivity.  I have made that request to the Leader's office and we will try to get that organised if we can for this month.  I am aware that Senator Hoey has asked for the same debate.  That request has gone in.</p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick also spoke about Pride celebrations and drew our attention to the Bloomsday Festival and the upcoming Stoneybatter Festival.  The Senator has encouraged all Senators to try to attend or participate in those festivals to support those local areas.</p> <p>Senator Keogan spoke this morning about immigration and young people, particularly in the context of the housing issue.  The Senator asked that we would look at a Danish-style housing model as a potential solution.  I would say to the Senator that we have a very ambitious housing plan in the State, with a record &euro;20 billion investment to build 300,000 homes in the next four years.  It will be a record level of investment in house building.  I appreciate that there are difficulties and challenges.  Coming out of the past two years there were periods when construction was closed down. Following the pandemic, we now have the war in Ukraine and we have supply chain issues.  All of these are contributing to the difficulties in housing provision.  No one individual or party or Government could have foreseen that these particular instances such as a pandemic or a war in Europe would have happened.  They are impacting, of course, on housing.  The numbers are, however, going in the right direction.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, spoke about her attendance at the second national biodiversity conference in Dublin Castle.  The Minister of State spoke about the need to work with farming communities and farm families.  Two thirds of the land in the State is farmland.  The Minister of State spoke about the need to farm with nature as opposed to against it.  There were some very good comments in that regard.  The Minister of State also spoke about the citizens' assembly, which is being chaired by Dr. Aoibhinn N&iacute; Sh&uacute;illeabh&aacute;in from Mayo.  It is doing fantastic work in getting the views of our citizens for how we as a country can meet this biodiversity challenge.</p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about the President's comments.  I will not stray into that issue too much, given the Cathaoirleach's direction.  There are significant housing programmes taking place in the State.  There are, of course, challenges.  There was a decade of under-building.  There have been two years when construction was not operational.  There are now issues around supply chains, costs of building materials, and labour shortages, which we are trying to do deal with.  Nobody can dispute that the level of investment in housing by this Government is unprecedented, such as never before seen in the State.  We will see those numbers start to turn.  I am aware that people are in difficulties and are facing challenges.  Of course we acknowledge that.  We are trying to turn those numbers around in the right direction.</p> <p>Senator Gavan also spoke about the famine in Somalia and the potential for 380,000 children to lose their lives.  It is shocking that in this day and age, with the abundance of food waste in every country, there would be children and parents dealing with that.  It is just horrific.  I commend D&oacute;chas on its work in highlighting this.  I urge the Government to do whatever it can to try to support with financial aid and to try to deal with that issue.  There are so many humanitarian crises, and we can get caught up in certain ones, but this crisis is as important as the next.  It is very important to highlight that.</p> <p>Senator Hoey spoke about Pride month and the need to have that inclusive conversation.  I concur with the Senator's remark.  I am aware that it has been a difficult period for people.  There has been a lot of vitriol online, on the radio and in the print media.  There is a very tense conversation taking place that is not helpful to anybody.  I would hope that these matters can be resolved, that we can move forward together, and that we can get back to what Pride month is about, which is a supportive and inclusive society.</p> <p>Senator O' Sullivan spoke around the President's comments.  I will be more general in my reply to the Senator's remarks while not focusing specifically on the recent issue.  More generally, I would agree completely with the Senator's remarks on the role of the Executive, the D&aacute;il, the Seanad, the Office of the President, and whoever holds that office at any particular time.  There are very specific roles and for very good reason.  There should be separation between those arms of the State.  The long-standing tradition to not stray into each other's territory or to criticise one another is for the benefit of society and of the State.  Questions have been raised as to whether this was maintained in recent times.</p> <p>Senator Burke spoke this morning on two issues.  I do not have a specific reply on the ESB issue the Senator has raised.  It would probably be appropriate to raise it as a Commencement Matter since it is quite a specific question.  If that is not sufficient we can, of course, look for a debate.  I am aware of the issues around broadband access and particularly in Mayo and in Castlebar, and the ongoing difficulties there.  The Senator referred to Eir, which has had long-running issues around customer service.  I had to deal with that on a personal level and I would choose to never have to deal with that again, and would look elsewhere.  The customer service has been so poor.  It is an ongoing issue for people in the town.  It is not just in Castlebar: it is also in other parts of the State.  One would believe there would be proper access to broadband in this day and age in the main street of a county town.  I have noted the Senator's comments.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the recent move by Ukrainian soldiers to get hospital treatment here in Ireland.  The Senator also specifically requested a debate on neutrality.  That debate has been secured and we are just working out a date.  That debate has been agreed to and we will have the debate on neutrality in the Chamber at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about Shannon Airport, as he often does, and he pointed once again, as he often has, to the vast majority of air traffic going in and out of Dublin Airport, and the need to rebalance this across the regions.  The Senator made the valid point that we have other airports in the State such as Cork, Shannon, and Ireland West Airport Knock, that can certainly have more capacity to assist in getting passengers in and out of the country.  It is certainly a topic to be debated and I will request that debate in the context of aviation policy, at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>Senator Kyne spoke about the INTO and its lobbying on running costs in schools.  We are all getting the feedback in every part of the country that there is a lot of pressure on schools now due to the rising costs of everything, be it insurance, energy and just keeping the doors open.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Education will engage constructively with the teachers' unions to make sure that these costs can be met in a reasonable way and to make sure that schools are not under such extensive pressure for long periods.  It will be an ongoing issue with regard to the cost of living and the cost of fuel and energy in general.  We are all feeling this across the State.  The education sector is no different.  The Minister for Education is acutely aware of that issue and challenge for students and is dealing with that.  That concludes the Order of Business.</p></speech>

Amendment Nos. 33 and 34 replace references to "next of kin" with references to "close relative" while amendment No. 36 creates the new definition of "close relative".  The effect of these amendments in Part 4 is that the qualifying relative who could request information about a deceased relevant relative would no longer just be the individual who is the next of kin of that deceased relative but rather any relative from the list of close relatives we define, namely, a mother, father, brother, sister, aunt, uncle, nephew or niece of the deceased person.  The purpose of these amendments is to avoid issues whereby the rights of relatives to request information about deceased relevant relatives becomes effectively trapped with no individual.  If the individual who is the next of kin, for example the brother, does not wish to seek information about the deceased relative the Bill in its current form precludes other relatives from seeking information.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->So if the brother is the next of kin and does not want to seek information, then a sister would be blocked from doing so under the current draft of the Bill.  We want to avoid a situation where the right to information is seated with one individual and thus trapped with that person, which creates a situation where the next of kin blocks other family members from seeking information.</p><p>Under our new proposed mechanism, a qualifying relative is any close relative of the deceased person, and he or she would not need to wait for the next-of-kin status to pass to him or her before seeking information.  We believe that this is right and proportionate and that it would vindicate the rights of close relatives to information about deceased relevant relatives.</p><p>Amendment No. 35 attempts a similar approach to that taken in amendments Nos. 33, 34 and 36.  It leaves the next-of-kin mechanism intact whereby only next of kin can request information about a deceased relevant relative.  Only the next of kin is defined as the qualifying relative.  The amendment expands the definition of "next of kin" to include multiple family members at once, namely, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces.  It would ensure that any of these family members would qualify as a relative and have the right to seek information about the deceased relevant relative.  The purpose of this amendment is to avoid issues where the rights of relatives to request information about a deceased relevant relative effectively becomes trapped with one individual.  If the individual who is the next of kin, for example, a brother, does not wish to seek information about the deceased relative, then the Bill, in its current form, precludes other relatives from doing so.  If the brother is the next of kin and he does not want to seek information, then a sister would also be blocked from doing so.  Under our new proposed mechanism, via amendment No. 35, the next of kin would become any close relative of the deceased person so one family could not block others from accessing information.  We believe that this is right and proportionate.</p><p>We anticipate that there may be legal issues with designating multiple family members as the next of kin at the same time, which is why we have proposed an alternative mechanism.  Amendments Nos. 33, 34 and 36 would create a new definition of "close relative" whereby all close relatives would become qualifying relatives, thus avoiding legal problems.  We are altering the definition of "next of kin".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#S00200"><p>Senator Ruane has outlined the details of each amendment.  I will make an overall point.  I feel strongly about these amendments because they are about the idea of what family and relationships mean, which is something that we have discussed at length.  Ireland, as part of its evolution in this area, is trying to move away from a very patriarchal and hierarchical version of the family that descends towards the kinds of moments and glimmers we have had in the context of things like the Child and Family Relationships Act, which recognises that relationships are not simply a hierarchy and a cascade but that, in fact, a child has different relationships.  There are different relationships with siblings, aunts and uncles, etc.</p> <p>The problem with the Bill is that the version of next of kin outlined and the requirements in respect of those who are deceased mean that it is only where a parent is deceased that a sibling can access materials relating to a relevant person.  In circumstances where a sibling is alive, an aunt, uncle or cousin may not be able to engage.  It should not be a requirement that these other people have to be deceased in order for somebody who cares and who wants to connect to the information of someone who is related to them to be able to seek it directly.  It should not be the case that if a parent is alive but is not exercising his or her next-of-kin powers in terms of these capacities, a sibling cannot do so.  All of that is due to the definition of "next of kin", particularly in the context of access to information under the legislation, which is a leftover from the hierarchy to which I refer.  The provision almost denies the next generation from knowing and accessing information and understanding the experiences of someone related to them.</p> <p>This is an example of an unnecessary set of barriers.  Senator Ruane outlined the different ways whereby we could proceed by changing the definition of "next of kin" or adding to the framing of the concept.  The term "next of kin" has meaning in other legislation, which is it is difficult to redefine.  That is why we also tried to insert measures that simply deal with the question of widening who might have the scope.  Why should there be a barrier in place in this regard?  By its very nature, the legislation acknowledges that, for example, a sibling relationship may be sufficient for a person to access information.  Why should a person's ability to access such information as a sibling be conditional on whether a parent has chosen to exercise his or her powers in that regard?  In the Child and Family Relationships Act, it is acknowledged that there is a network of relationships and of care.  In the context of that legislation, even if the relevant person is not there any more, for those who want to understand their relationships, it is about acknowledging them in that way.</p> <p>I wanted to speak on this issue because this is one of the examples whereby an old way of thinking keeps trying to re-embed itself.  In thinking in a new, transformative, empowering and caring way about family and relationships, we need to catch that everywhere we can and be as generous as we can at every opportunity.</p></speech>

It provides for access to records for the family of those children who died in a mother and baby home or county home institution.  The necessity for these provisions featured in the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations.  They were not in the original draft Schedule to the Bill, but we listened to what was said during the pre-legislative process by the groups and individuals who made representations on this point.  As a result of that, Part 4 was introduced.</p> <p>I am not in a position to accept the amendments from Senators Higgins and Ruane, primarily because we feel they lack a specificity that legislation requires.  Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 seek to include the term "relative" rather than "next of kin".  The term "next of kin", as used in section 26(2), specifies clearly who those people are and provides for, as we said, parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews.  This section has been carefully drafted in accordance with advice from the Office of the Attorney General.</p> <p>The hierarchy of next of kin set out in section 26, which amendments Nos. 35 and 36 seek to remove, is a data protection safety for the deceased child because while rights are attenuated, they do not completely vanish and cannot be completely disregarded.  It is also a data protection safeguard for parents whose personal data is included in the categories of information for release.  It is necessary for parents to be deceased prior to the information being released to a sibling.  I am satisfied that this section will allow those family members with questions to gain access to records while respecting data protection rights.</p> <p>The Bill is significantly informed by data protection law.  It is also informed by the principle that information concerning the identity of a parent does constitute personal data pertaining to relevant persons, and this has to allow for the balance to be tipped significantly towards identity.</p> <p>It is important to remember that Part 4 is not about the identity rights of adopted people.  It is about providing information to others about family members whom they lost.  It serves a really important but separate purpose in ensuring access to records for the family of a deceased child.  The issue in question is different from the identity rights issue that we sought to vindicate in terms of the balancing test and other discussions that we have had on that point.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Obviously, a deceased person is not protected in that respect under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  I am struggling to understand the Minister's response to the effect that the balance is being tipped.  However, a balance is being created in favour of, say, parents over siblings with respect to next of kin.  Why is it necessary to balance that hierarchy of parents over siblings in terms of access, or am I understanding that wrong?</p></speech>

With respect to the parent of that child, there is personal information and shared identify information in terms of the release of the information about the child.  That is why the parent is first in the hierarchy in the release of that information.  If the parent is deceased, it is open to a sibling to apply for that information.  If the parent is alive and wishes to receive the information, the parent can receive the information and can, if he or she so chooses, disseminate it within the family.  While the parent is alive, he or she has an ability under this provision not to seek the release of that information but it is not a permanent barrier.

Tracing will be carried out to locate individuals for the purposes of contact or the sharing of information.  The tracing service is available to persons over the age of 18 years.  An application for a tracing service can be made by a relevant person and by categories of relatives set out in sections 32(6) and (7).  An adoptive parent of an adopted child can also seek a trace where the adoptive parent is seeking to locate a person for the purposes of requesting further information regarding the person or providing information relevant to the person.</p> <p>I cannot support this amendment as I am confident Part 5 on tracing provides fully for the policy intention that a relevant person can trace a relative to facilitate contact or to request information and that a relative can trace a relative person for contact or to request or share information regarding the relevant person.  </p> <p>I understand that with this amendment the Senator is seeking to expand the legal base for a trace by a relative to allow a trace to also be facilitated where a relative believes the relevant person has information on them.  Section 32(2)(b)(ii) allows a relative to trace to request further information regarding the relevant person or provide information relevant to the relevant person.  </p> <p>Having consulted with the bodies which currently provide a tracing service, I am satisfied the Bill, as drafted, is fit for purpose and provides clearly and specifically for the reasons a person can trace.  Furthermore, we must be mindful that tracing is a resource-intensive task and any expansion of the function of the service may have unintended consequences for the effective operation of the service.  However, I hope I can offer the Senator some reassurance.  The Bill will not prevent the sharing of records, as is aim of her amendment.  I understand once people are facilitated to make contact and build a relationship they very often share records, mementos etc. with each other following the development of that relationship.</p></speech>

On Committee Stage, our amendments, which would have required a public information campaign to be held in line with the Government's commitment to the use of plain English, were ruled out of order.i</p> <p>Amendment No. 40 provides the Minister shall ensure any public information campaign conducted under this section is conducted in a manner consistent with the State's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  These amendments are to ensure the public information campaign is held in an accessible manner and that any future public information campaign also complies with the State's obligation under the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

It was regrettable an amendment simply stating a campaign should be in plain English, given it is Government official policy that its communications would be in plain English, was ruled as being a cost to the State.  This is a wider issue which people will be aware I have been raising.  The idea of having an information campaign that people would understand was regarded as being an unacceptable cost on the State.  That is an example of an over-reach in terms of the interpretation of a cost to the State.  It goes with another amendment, which unfortunately was ruled out of order.  The Minister will be aware of the amendment.  These proposals could have saved the State money.  These amendments sought to give the Minister the power to remove immunity from certain organisations, which he might have added as being relevant bodies.  For example, I refer to those organisations in subsection (3), including those the Minister may add.  He could, by regulation, remove immunity from such organisations.  That is something that would have saved the State money.  It is amazing it was chosen to be interpreted as a cost to the State.  I wanted to highlight that.  It is a slightly wider issue but it is an example of constructive proposals designed to ensure the State does not end up giving indirect immunity or indemnity to people to whom it should not and which attempted to ensure public information is communicated in a proper way in plain English that is accessible to everybody, including some of those whose educational opportunities may have been curtailed by the very fact of their experience in engaging with these institutions.  It is regrettable that was ruled out of order.  We found another way to bring the point in.  I do not doubt the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to a communication campaign in that regard.  I know he wants to reach out widely but I wanted to give an opportunity and a mandate for that.  The Minister might engage with those points.</p></speech>

While I cannot accept amendments Nos. 38 and 40, I hope I can provide the Senators with some reassurance in terms of the work we are doing to ensure that the public information campaign is designed in as user-friendly a manner as possible.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has already engaged with the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, on making sure the material produced as part of the campaign is accessible and easily understood and, in addition, that the materials produced are shared with the stakeholder reference group for feedback, as I have mentioned on a number of occasions, including regarding the language, terminology and message used.</p> <p>Complementarily to our engagement with the stakeholder reference group, my officials have engaged with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure similar input is sought from stakeholders residing outside the State, recognising that many of the people who are the targets of this campaign and who, we hope, will seek to use it are living outside Ireland.  I will speak more about that when I bring forward the next amendment.</p> <p>Once this legislation is passed, we hope to have the public information campaign begin in July.  The material will be available online and in hard copy and will be shared across a broad range of media and communication channels in response to the broad age demographic of persons affected by the provisions.  The campaign will run from July to October, with the possibility of extending it if necessary.  It will include a door drop to every household in the State of an information booklet outlining the key provisions of the legislation and letting people know their rights under it, recognising the very wide range of people across the State who are impacted by the issues surrounding adoption, mother and baby homes, county homes and other institutions, and acknowledging the secretive nature of these matters for a long period.  The information campaign will also utilise television, radio and print media channels.  As I mentioned, the Department of Foreign Affairs will assist with disseminating the information campaign internationally, including identifying media channels, utilising embassy networks and engaging with Irish abroad groups, as appropriate.</p> <p>Regarding the amendments, I confirm that the relevant bodies are working with NALA to ensure plain English and accessible format are secured for the information campaign.</p></speech>

During pre-legislative scrutiny, the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth explicitly recommended that the Bill be amended to provide a statutory right of access to the administrative records, wherever they are held, of all adoption agencies, institutions, State bodies and others involved in forced family separation for natural and birth mothers, survivors, adopted people and others placed in care.

I assure the Senators that the Bill does not restrict in any way a person's right to apply for his or her information through the alternative route of a subject access request.  We do restrict GDPR rights in a very limited way in the legislation, as set out in section 68.  It is a requirement under the GDPR to set out clearly the articles that are limited.  Section 68 states that Articles 12, 14, 18 and 21 are affected.  The restrictions are limited and are introduced only to ensure the full operation of the legislation and, most importantly, the full release of all information in every circumstance.  The central nub of what we are trying to achieve with this legislation is that there should be no reason that an adopted person's information would be refused.  That is why we have to limit the GDPR rights of other parties, particularly those of parents, in certain circumstances.</p> <p>Section 68 clearly states which articles of the GDPR are impacted.  Article 15 is not listed.  There is no need for these amendments because there is no limitation on Article 15.  There is full provision for subject access requests and this legislation does not impact on that in any way.</p></speech>

An amendment specifying that counselling support should be provided within a specific timeframe was not accepted on Committee Stage.  This version of the amendment does not specify a period within with counselling should be arranged other than to say it should be arranged immediately.</p><p>Recent reports have highlighted that many people wait well over three months to receive counselling from the HSE.  It is important that such delays are not allowed to become common in this vital service for parents and relevant persons.  We know it can take individuals a long time to arrive at a point at which they are ready and open to talk to a counsellor.  We must ensure that when a person arrives at that point, he or she is not subject to inordinate delays.  While the amendment falls short of setting out a specific timeframe, it would provide applicants with confidence that when they ask for help, it will be provided.</p><p>Amendment No. 45 seeks a report containing details on the provision of counselling services to parents and relevant persons under section 69.  We are all aware of the appalling delays of many months, and far longer in many cases, experienced by those seeking counselling.  Our amendment on Committee Stage, which would have ensured that counselling is delivered within three months of being sought by relevant persons, was rejected.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Amendment No. 45, much like the previous one, is a compromise amendment which asks that, at the very least, a report is compiled on the counselling provision so delays in accessing counselling can be identified and action on potential delays can be incentivised.  The Bill in its current form does not compel authorities to deliver counselling in an expedient manner and this needs to change in the final version of the Bill.</p></speech>

Counselling provisions, as currently drafted within the legislation, allow for the broad spectrum of counselling support to be provided as required and requested by a person, and also allow for more urgent cases to be prioritised.  As I flagged on Committee Stage, the National Counselling Service separately provides services to survivors of mother and baby and county home institutions as a priority group and, additionally, my Department has allocated significant additional resources to both Tusla and the Adoption Authority of Ireland for fulfilling their obligations under this legislation, including the provision of counselling support.  Tusla already has a positive and successful relationship with Barnardos to provide counselling to persons to whom this legislation is relevant.  The experience is there and preparations are already under way to ensure services will be ready on enactment.  In addition, the ministerial guidelines will include an appendix on the spectrum of counselling and supports available to the different cohorts of people affected by this legislation.</p> <p>Counselling for relevant people is provided for under this legislation but even in advance of this legislation being enacted, there is a counselling service available right now for anybody who was in a mother and baby or county home institution, the National Counselling Service.  It is a service that is free of charge and survivors of these institutions are prioritised in terms of receiving the counselling.  I ask all Senators to continue to amplify that message because it is important that people who were in institutions understand there is that support available to them right now, even in advance of this Bill being passed.</p> <p>I cannot accept amendment No. 45 as I believe it is already provided for in this legislation.  The provision of counselling services under section 69 will form part of the review of the legislation provided for under section 70.  Section 70 provides for a review to be commenced by two years post-enactment and all sections, other than Parts 8 and 9, fall within the scope of that process.  I brought in amendments in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann based on commitments made on Committee Stage to reduce the timeframe for this review from four years to two years, and it was agreed by all parties at that time that two years was an acceptable time to allow for a meaningful review to take place.  We have to allow the legislation to operate for a period of time so we can detect if there are issues or problems which can then be solved.  Two years gives us that good balance between giving it a two-year period to operate but also making sure we are responding quickly to any problems that will emerge.</p> <p>In our next discussion today, I am bringing forward an amendment that will provide more detail on section 70, including that the report done on the legislation will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope this will address the Senators&rsquo; amendment in this regard.</p></speech>

A key part of bringing forward any legislation is to provide for a review of the legislation to ensure it operates as intended, is sufficient and is robust.  On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, I brought an amendment to reduce the timeframe for review to two years.  This amendment now seeks to provide further clarity on the composition of the review in terms of confirming it will include consultation with relevant persons and other persons affected by this legislation, as appropriate.  This amendment also guarantees the review will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>I thank Senator Victor Boyhan for his proposal.  I believe this amendment supports his aim to ensure the implementation of this legislation into the future is monitored with a view to improvement, where necessary.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister and acknowledge that since he became Minister he engaged extensively with the people whose births were illegally registered.  That is important and should be acknowledged.  In early May, he offered in this House a very sincere apology on behalf of the Government, which I wish to acknowledge.  I said then that it was not for me to accept an apology on behalf of anybody else but on behalf of myself, I accept that apology because it ws sincere.  I acknowledge the work the Minister has done.</p> <p>I thank Professor Conor O'Mahony for his independent review of the illegal birth registrations and his 17 recommendations.  In regard to his recommendation that a State inquiry into illegal adoptions should be established, we know that such an inquiry would be sensitive, complex and challenging but very important nonetheless.  I urge the Minister and the Government to pursue that inquiry.  I make that ask on the public record today.  It was after all one of Professor Conor O'Mahony's strong recommendations.  That is the wish of the survivors, the families and the advocates.</p> <p>I thank the Minister's officials.  One of the officials had a word with me today as I came in today.  I was talking about the Minister, in terms of the amendments, and she said we had collaboration on this.  The Minister has excellent public servants and I acknowledge that commentary.  I also acknowledge that we have all had collaboration, including victims, survivors, advocates and politicians in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  I thank the official for the prompt and for saying that because it is true.  It is important that it is acknowledged.</p> <p>Another of the 17 recommendations was that we establish a truth commission.  I hope the Minister will continue to work on that proposal and work out some scheme.</p> <p>Although I said some weeks ago that I would find it difficult to vote for this Information and Tracing Bill 2022, the reason I did was that the Minister, as a politician, led from the front and he assured me and others.  I made the decision for myself in the House today.  Everyone else speaks for and votes for themselves.  I am going away today feeling that we have the best legislation we could possibly have achieved that it will provide unredacted access to birth and early life information for people affected by illegal birth registrations, for adopted people and for anyone who seeks further information on his or her origins and for that I thank the Minister.</p> <p>This is only one part of a suite of important legislation.  We will have issues around the Institutional Burials Bill 2022, redress and many aspects of how this State cared, or failed to care, for its minors.  There are many other issues and reports on the Minister's desk.  I am happy in the knowledge that he is working through them.  There will be difficulties and setbacks but did anyone ever think - I had long discussions with the Minister's predecessor, Katherine Zappone - that we would reach a time when these two Houses would agree very significant legislation that he has charted through these Houses?  It was not always easy.  When dealing with emotions, people's past and that sense of wanting to belong, it touches on a raw nerve and open up old hurts and disappointments and sometimes an uncertainty about who one is, where one is going and to whom did one belong.  That is a journey that each and every one of us must make - all of us - in life.</p> <p>I thank the Minister genuinely and sincerely for navigating this important and fundamental legislation.  The option today was to do nothing or to go with this.  Yes, it will need to be tweaked but that can happen.  I thank the Minister for his stewardship of this legislation.</p></speech>

As he said, this is a significant moment.  We are one stage away from passing this legislation and finally and conclusively dealing with the wrongful denial of people's identity rights over many decades in this State.  In this legislation, we have finally found a way to provide a right for each person to full and unredacted access to all of his or her information.  For decades now, this has been striven for.  That right is nothing less than people who were adopted, who were subject to illegal birth registration or who were boarded out deserve.  This Bill today represents a very significant part of the redress that the Irish State is making for its failure towards children and women over decades since the foundation of our State.</p> <p>I thank all the Senators for their engagement.  The Bill we are passing today is a stronger and better Bill than that which I brought into this House in May.  That improvement is because of the input, engagement and passion of Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>In particular, I thank the Senators who are members of the Oireachtas joint committee and who have been engaged with this process for a very long time.  I join Senator Boyhan in thanking my officials for their fantastic work and the wider members of my team.</p> <p>Finally, I thank every adopted person, everyone who was subject to an illegal birth registration or everyone who was boarded out who has engaged in the process of developing this legislation but more particularly everyone who has engaged directly with me since I took this particular office.  I hope this law and the processes that flow from it will give each and every one of those persons the answers they have sought for such a long time.</p></speech>

The Bill has completed its passage through the D&aacute;il, and I am keen to have it enacted before the summer recess.</p> <p>This Bill creates a new workers' right in Ireland.  For the first time, employees will be entitled to statutory sick pay from their employers.  It is one of five new workers' rights I am establishing this year.  The other four include, first, the establishment of a new public holiday, which from next year will be at the start of February to mark Imbolc or St. Brigid's Day.  The ministerial order for this has been signed.  The second is the right to request remote working, which is undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny and I anxiously await the report from the committee in that regard.  The third is for better protection for workplace tips and gratuities, which has completed Second Stage in the Seanad and will be on Committee Stage in the next few weeks.  The fourth is a new Covid-19-related lay-off payment for people who were laid off during the pandemic who were subsequently made redundant.  This has been legislated for and the payment scheme was commenced in April.  Separately, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, is legislating for a right to request flexible working for parents and carers. </p> <p>Introducing statutory sick leave is part of the pandemic dividend.  It is about developing a more inclusive economy, as well as a more competitive one, and fairer society.  It is about making work pay.  The pandemic exposed once again the vulnerable position of many people, especially in the private sector, when it comes to missing work due to illness or injury.  No one should feel they have to go work when they are sick because they will lose all of their income if they do.  It is bad for them, and it is bad for public health.  Sick workers may infect colleagues, clients and customers and they are more likely to make a mistake, leading to harm to themselves and to others.</p> <p>This is a progressive Bill.  It will improve the rights of workers.  The events of the last two years have shown how necessary this legislation is.  Ireland is one of the few advanced economies in Europe not to have a mandatory sick pay scheme.  Cyprus and Portugal are the only other EU member states that do not have employer-funded sick pay or State financial supports similar to Ireland's illness benefit scheme.  The United States, Japan and South Korea do not have such a provision either.  However, it is part of President Biden's agenda in the United States, if he can get it through Congress.  Canada, under Prime Minister Trudeau, is taking steps to introduce employer-funded sick leave at national level.  The scheme I am proposing compares favourably with the sick pay scheme in Northern Ireland and Britain, which pays only &pound;96.35 weekly.  I would strongly encourage Sinn F&eacute;in Senators to put this right in Northern Ireland, should they return to Government there later in the year. </p> <p>Many employers, we think approximately half of them, do provide sick pay, but low-paid workers are the least likely to be covered.  We now need to provide that security, that safety net, for all workers, regardless of their job or whether they are in the public sector or the private sector.  The Bill ensures that paid sick leave will be available to all workers.  It covers both full-time and part-time workers alike.  The Bill will lessen the inequality between the public and private sectors.  Nearly all public servants have access to paid sick leave through the public service sick leave scheme.  It will reduce inequality between better-paid and lower-paid workers in the private sector, because better-paid workers tend to have access to sick pay, or simply to be able to afford to take time off when ill, whereas lower-paid workers do not.  Coverage in the private sector, and particularly among the lowest paid workers, is much lower.  This is particularly true for workers in retail and hospitality, where employees often work directly with the public, and the chance of spreading infectious diseases is therefore greater.</p> <p>Statutory sick pay should be seen as the latest in a series of actions that have improved social protections for workers and the self-employed over the past five years.  These include the introduction of paternity benefit, parental leave benefit, enhanced maternity benefit, treatment benefit and the extension of social insurance benefits to the self-employed, including jobseekers.  As a starting point, this scheme will cover the three waiting days before eligibility for illness benefit from the State kicks in.  Where an employee has an extended period of illness, the scheme will operate seamlessly with the existing illness benefit system.  Once the employee has exhausted their entitlement to paid sick leave, they will move onto illness benefit.  If eligible, that can last for up to two years if needed. </p> <p>The four-year plan takes account of the current economic climate and the existing financial pressures on businesses, particularly small businesses and those in the Border region.  The number of days will increase incrementally.  It is our firm intention that the employer will eventually cover the cost of ten sick days per year, effectively two working weeks, from the fourth year of operation, after which illness benefit from the State kicks in.  I would intend for illness benefit to be improved, because savings from this measure will arise from the social insurance fund.  </p> <p>Closing the gap of current waiting days before being able to access illness benefit will help to reduce the number of sick employees presenting for work.  Illness benefit is payable from day four and runs up to one year and, in some cases, for two years, as I mentioned earlier.  I acknowledge that many businesses are facing additional costs because of Putin's invasion of Ukraine, as well as the aftermath of Covid-19 and Brexit and the disruption both have wrought.  Business owners, in particular small employers, tell me that a lot is coming at them at the moment, including higher labour costs, input costs, energy costs, as well as higher costs from Government.  Those costs include the additional public holiday, for which I signed the order and from auto-enrolment, which I advanced when I was Minister for Social Protection.  I do hear that, I do get that and I do care.  That is why we need be fair to employees and employers, particularly SMEs.  Therefore, the cost is going to be shared between employers, employees and the Government.  It will be phased in and there will be proper controls.</p> <p>The scheme has been designed based on consultation with employee and employer representatives.  Prior to seeking Cabinet approval for the draft of the Bill, my officials undertook a full public consultation that sought the views of relevant stakeholders and the public on key policy questions around the design of the scheme.  In addition to the public consultation, my officials also undertook an international review to get a better understanding of how sick leave schemes operate internationally.   </p> <p>I have been clear about what regulations under this legislation will provide for in order to make it predictable for employees and employers alike.  Regarding rates, statutory sick pay will initially be paid at 70% of regular earnings, up to &euro;110 per day, from the first day of illness.  We are setting a cap to give employers certainty around the costs involved at the outset.  It will rise, however, as earnings rise.  The regulatory impact assessment illustrates that a scenario in which everyone took the full three days of sick leave in year one would increase payroll costs by 0.8%.  That assumes that everyone took the three days.  When this scheme has been fully introduced, the maximum additional payroll cost will be 2.7% annually.  That is not a small figure and not a negligible increase in cost.  However, it is not dissimilar to a typical pay increase in any year.  It is important that we bear this point in mind in assessing the cost to employers.  A minimum rate entitlement will also be set to ensure that all workers and, particularly, part-time workers receive a reasonable level of financial compensation.</p> <p>I will now provide a brief explanation of the various sections of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 are standard provisions setting out the Short Title and commencement, and necessary definitions.  Section 3 gives the Minister the power to make regulations for matters referred to in the Bill and requires the Minister to lay those regulations before the Oireachtas.  Section 4 provides for expenses incurred in relation to the Bill to be refunded out of monies provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 5 sets out an employee's entitlement to statutory sick leave and the conditions an employee must satisfy to qualify for paid sick leave.</p> <p>In the first instance, an employee will be entitled to three paid sick leave days in a calendar year.  This may seem modest, but it is set at that level to ensure excessive costs are not imposed on employers, particularly small employers, at the outset.  It will increase incrementally over time.  Absences may be consecutive or non-consecutive.  Regarding eligibility an employee will be required to have worked for their employer for a period of 13 weeks before they become eligible to avail of paid sick leave under the Bill.  There was significant debate around the length of service requirement as the Bill passed through the D&aacute;il and amendments were made based on these discussions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The length of service requirement is linked to the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973.  This means an employee will not have to qualify again for sick leave merely because he or she is temporarily laid off, such as, for instance, employees who are laid off over the summer period.  We are well aware that this would be a significant issue in some sectors, in particular for workers in schools, cr&egrave;ches and childcare settings, many of whom work on a term-time pattern.  Where an employee is laid off, that does not constitute a break in service.  His or her service is continuous for the purpose of the Bill.  </p><p>We think it is reasonable that an employee should have worked for an employer for some time and have established an employee-employer relationship in order to qualify for paid sick leave.  For example, if an employer takes somebody on to work in a shop or restaurant for a few weeks in the summer, it would not be fair if that employee took ten days' sick leave at the start and only worked for a week or two after that.  This is not an unusual provision.  For example, in the case of parental leave, a parent must have completed one year's service with the employer before he or she can take parental leave.  It is important to allow sufficient time to establish an employee-employer relationship.</p><p>I want to ensure that it is not the case that there will be a reset for every service interruption by an employee.  The D&aacute;il amended the Bill to provide extra clarity that each period of service will be cumulative.  This means an employee resuming service with an employer on a new contract after a break will be entitled to statutory sick pay as soon as his or her total service amounts to 13 weeks.  If he or she was entitled to sick pay when their previous service ended, he or she will be entitled to sick pay from day one when he or she resumes work.</p><p>Any day taken as sick leave under the Bill will require a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner.  I believe it would be unreasonable to introduce a legal obligation for employers to pay for sick leave without the need for a worker to produce evidence for this in the form of a medical certificate.  That would not be sick leave; it would be a different form of leave.  Of course, employers do not need to insist on this or can provide uncertified sick days if they so choose.  The requirement for a medical certificate for paid sick leave is a fair and necessary provision and is not an unusual requirement.  Employees are currently required to provide medical certificates to access the State illness benefit scheme and it is a requirement in many sectoral and company level sick pay arrangements.  If the State requires people to produce a medical certificate before receiving State illness benefit, it is not unreasonable that we should allow employers to require the same.</p><p>Section 6 provides that the number of sick leave days under the Bill may be increased by ministerial order, and the matters the Minister may wish to consider in doing so.  I accepted an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il from Deputy Paul Murphy that removed the power to reduce the number of statutory sick leave days by ministerial order.  It has always been my intention that the number of days provided for would increase over time and there are no plans to reduce the number of sick leave days.  It will now require primary legislation to reduce the number provided for.  Given the close links between statutory sick leave and illness benefit, and the need to ensure alignment between the two schemes, section 6 provides for consultation with the Minister for Social Protection in advance of any increase in sick leave days.</p><p>Section 7 provides for the setting of the rate of payment in respect of sick leave by ministerial order.  As I have already stated, the intention is to introduce sick pay at a rate of 70% of regular earnings up to &euro;110 per day.  A minimum entitlement will also be set.  I know some stakeholders believe that the rate of payment and earnings cap should be set in out the Bill, but I do not agree.  Doing so by ministerial order allows greater flexibility.  It will allow the rate to be revised as necessary and future-proofs the Bill.  We have all seen concerns recently around inflation and the rising cost of living.  Allowing the rate of payment to be amended by ministerial order gives us the ability to respond quickly to changing circumstances, and increase the rate as median earnings rise.</p><p>Section 8 provides that nothing in the Bill will prevent the inclusion of more favourable provisions in regard to sick leave in a contract of employment.  As is always the case with any workers' rights legislation, this legislation sets out the minimum standard, the floor, that an employer must provide.  It will not prevent employers having superior sick pay schemes to that which is required by law.  Many already do, and I encourage those that can afford to, to do so.</p><p>Section 9 provides that obligations under the Bill will not apply where an employer provides his or her employee with a sick pay scheme that confers benefits over the course of a reference period set out in the scheme that are more favourable.  This section has been designed with flexibility in mind.  We know that a lot of companies in the private sector already offer their employees paid sick leave as part of their contract of employment.  Overall, these schemes offer more generous terms and it is not our intention that they will be undermined by the Bill.</p><p>For businesses which genuinely cannot afford to pay we have included, under section 10, an inability to pay provision.  This allows the Labour Court to grant an exemption to a business from its obligations under this Bill for a period of not less than three months and not more than 12 months.  There is a similar provision in the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  It will only be granted where there is a real risk to business sustainability.</p><p>Section 11 provides that the rights of an employee will not be affected by exercising his or her right to sick leave under this Bill and that sick leave may not be recorded as any other form of leave.  If somebody is sick for a day or two, or more, he or she does not lose any annual, maternity or any other leave to which he or she may be entitled.  It also provides that where an employee is on probation, an employer may suspend the probation period while the employee is on sick leave.</p><p>Section 12 provides that an employee cannot be penalised for exercising their right to sick leave under the Bill.</p><p>Sections 13 to 15, inclusive, deal with enforcement and compliance issues and provide for the relevant amendments to be made to the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  This enables and authorises the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to carry out inspections and to take complaints regarding compliance with the Bill.  As with other statutory employment rights, where an individual believes he or she is being deprived of rights to which he or she is entitled under the Bill, he or she will be able to refer a complaint to the WRC.  There the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication, leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches of the provisions of the Bill.  The maximum penalty that can be awarded for a breach of the legislation is four weeks' remuneration.  This was a judgment call.  We are trying to get the balance right and we believe the penalty being double the offence is proportionate.  That is the thinking behind it.  When the Bill is fully enacted, employees will have the right to two weeks of paid sick leave.  If they are refused that unfairly, they will get two weeks' pay and up to four weeks additional pay as a penalty.</p><p>I know some will think the Bill goes too far, and others that it does not go far enough.  That is inevitable.  We have worked to strike a fair and reasonable balance, giving new protections to employees but also predictability to employers.  Ultimately, this Bill means that workers will not have to attend work while sick though economic necessity.  It will be one of the positive legacies to emerge from the pandemic.  It is a step forward for workers' rights and equality.  I look forward to listening to Senators' views and working with them all to progress this important legislation through the Seanad as quickly as possible</p></speech>

At the end of his contribution, he said some people will think we have not gone far enough and other will say we have gone too far.  What everyone agrees on is that this Bill is needed.  As a committee, we had countless discussions while working through the Bill and each member had different proposals and ideas.  It is good that we are now at this stage.  </p> <p>I note in the Minister's contribution he referred to concerns for businesses.  A lot of work has been done in his Department over the past number of years in terms of workers' rights and important things have been brought through which he has outlined, including remote working, workplace tips and the national public holiday.  These all benefit employees.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, the provisions also benefit employers and give certainty.  I acknowledge that a report by the Local Jobs Alliance has been produced on sick pay because it has concerns about costs to small businesses but we can assure the alliance that there is to be a phase-in period of four years.  This is to support small businesses and recognise that the change is trickier for them than for big businesses.  </p><p>People will welcome this measure.  It gives those on a lower income more reassurance.  We all know people who go to work when sick when they should not.  They might go to work on the Tuesday and Wednesday but not on the Friday.  However, for financial reasons they have to go to work.  This measure gives them the certainty that they do not have to do so if they cannot.  It is good for businesses as well.</p><p>From the Minister's contribution, I noted what was he is doing in his Department.  Importantly, he spoke about the living wage and the four-year period in which to abolish the minimum wage in favour of a living wage by 2026.  The relevant legislation will be really important.  The minimum wage is &euro;10.50.  If we were to introduce the living wage, it would be &euro;12.17.  We are not a million miles away from it at the moment, so it is realistic that it can be introduced at the level in question.  Obviously, in 2026 the living wage will be at a different level based on the average income.  It is another important element.  The Bill will be broadly welcomed on our side.  Some of the concerns that others have raised at meetings of the committee and that will probably be raised today are genuine but we all agree it is important to introduce the legislation.</p><p>The wording of a point the T&aacute;naiste made is important.  He said he acknowledged that many businesses are facing additional costs because of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  We often say the rise in business costs is because of the war in Ukraine.  It is not; it is because of someone else's war that is happening in Ukraine.  That is really important to point out.  We had a delegation here yesterday that recognised that businesses and employers are suffering because of costs.  The report out today focuses on the fact that employers' costs have risen dramatically over recent years.  Putin's war has an impact, but it is important that we phrase things correctly when speaking about it.  I recognise that employers are worried about costs.  It is because of this worry that the new measure is to be phased in over four years.  I welcome the Bill and thank the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.180" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#KK00200"><p>I welcome the T&aacute;naiste to the Seanad.  As Minister, he has championed so many policies.  His commitment today concerns statutory sick leave.  This is about his commitment to achieving his goals for workers' rights.  It really shows how Fine Gael's policies are ensuring rights for those on all wages, especially those on the minimum wage.  We know that more than half of all businesses provide sick leave.  The remainder are more than likely in low-pay sectors.  Therefore, it is crucial that this Bill deliver for those in these sectors.</p> <p>As the T&aacute;naiste mentioned in his introduction, Covid showed how important it is that people who are sick can take time off work.  We also noted how women in the low-pay sector were greatly affected.  Many working in retail and hospitality, including as cleaners, suffered.  There was no equality.  What the Minister is doing is bringing in equal rights for workers in all sectors.  That is crucial.</p> <p>I really appreciate that there has been consultation.  The Minister has mentioned that the costs will be shared between employers and employees.  The consultation process is crucial.  The Minister also stated that his Department has engaged in a peer review to determine the approach in various countries across the world.  He stated we are now joining the ranks of so many in the European Union to deliver proper workers' rights, particularly when it comes to accessing sick leave.</p> <p>As the T&aacute;naiste said, this legislation is a safety net for people.  Is there a way to review the impact of the legislation, perhaps in a year or two?  I realise the T&aacute;naiste said that, within four years, we will have a period of up to ten days.  That would be phenomenal.  Currently, the period is three days.  Taking into account the pressures on the business sector, could we, maybe in a few years' time, ascertain the impact of the legislation, particularly on men and women in those sectors that are considered to have low pay?  I am talking about people working in manufacturing and warehousing and those in abattoirs.  There are many areas where people could not take sick leave, which had a huge impact.  Well done to the T&aacute;naiste for introducing this legislation and for the work we are seeing on workers' rights.  Again, this is about ensuring equality for people.</p></speech>

I believe this is the first time I have addressed him in this House since he was elected, which was a long time ago.  To go back to that dreadful St. Patrick's Day when he addressed us all from Washington or New York at the start of Covid, I was amazed at how quickly he responded to requests from Independents like me who were not party affiliated in any way.  Over the period of Covid, I had to make contact with the T&aacute;naiste on a few occasions.  On the matter of class K PRSI, which dates from when he was Minister for Social Protection, he listened and made a change.  That is his hallmark, as far as I am concerned.  I do not often have to call on the T&aacute;naiste but when I do, he responds quickly.  I thank him for that.</p> <p>There is no doubt but that Covid has brought about a huge amount of change to the way we do our business and treat employees.  The world has moved on.  There are many debates and discussions about the right to work from home and the various other things the T&aacute;naiste addressed while here.  No doubt these will be thrashed out over time, hopefully to the benefit of workers.  I was rather surprised that it took a Fine Gael Minister to start to change workers' rights as quickly as they have changed in recent times.  For that, I compliment the Minister.</p> <p>As my colleague Senator Ahearn said, there are questions of concern to very small businesses.  I had a discussion today with representatives of the Local Jobs Alliance.  We were discussing small retailers with two or three employees and how sick leave might impact them.  We spoke about small men's shops with one or two employees and how sick pay might represent a substantial cost to such organisations.  A small supermarket under any one of the brand names might have two or three employees whereas a shop with the same brand two miles down the road might have 20 employees and comprise quite a substantial organisation.  In trying to alleviate some of the problems created by sick pay for some of the very small employers, there is a considerable challenge for the Minister, and for Senators in producing amendments, in establishing where "small" and "weak" start and stop.  A shop with three employees could have a turnover of &euro;500,000 per year whereas another shop with three employees could have a turnover of &euro;50,000 per year.  There is no doubt that this will cause problems.  The Minister adverted to this, as did my colleague Senator Ahearn.  I am sure we will have some debate on that.</p> <p>However, I believe this is a really positive step.  It is a great idea.  For far too long, employees, particularly the lower paid, were thrown to the wolves.  There has been a misconception down through the years that public sector workers have got some sort of golden contract of employment whereby they are well looked after.  In my 25 years as a member of the Teacher's Union of Ireland and as its president towards the end, the exploitation of public sector workers was rampant.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We changed from appointing teachers to offering hours.  We finished up in a situation where the supervisors who work on community employment schemes, which are fantastic schemes that offer a huge amount to their communities, are treated appallingly and have no pension rights.  I know that work is being done in that area.  A similar point can be made with regard to pension systems for former members of the Defence Forces.  This impacts lower ranked people, some of whom work in these Houses.  They leave after 25 or 35 years of service, and up to 40 years of service in some cases, with a pension but the moment they take on any public sector employment they start to lose that pension.  Whether we like it or not, pension abatement is theft of a pension.  I believe it is unconstitutional.  The only reason we get away with it is because those unfortunates who are hit by it can never afford to go to the High Court to fight their case.  That is something we might do.  Maybe at some stage the T&aacute;naiste and I will sit down and have a discussion on that to see whether we can find a way around it.</p><p>Overall, I congratulate the T&aacute;naiste for bringing forward legislation that will benefit the workers of this country.  I am sure that between us, we will propose a few amendments as this legislation passes through the House.  Today is a good day and I hope this legislation passes quickly.  I thank the T&aacute;naiste for bringing the legislation to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1646" speakername="Ollie Crowe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#LL00200"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for his time before the House.  Like other colleagues, I welcome this legislation.  Every worker deserves the right to be paid sick leave.  Workers have that facility already in the vast majority of countries across Europe and it is time that Ireland joins that list.</p><p>Covid-19 made clear the very precarious position of many workers, particularly in lower paid roles and in the private sector.  As I am sure the T&aacute;naiste and all Members of the House have done, I have spoken to many people who must go to work even when they are very sick because they cannot afford not to do so.  In my opinion, that is not acceptable.  We must move away from a culture that tolerates such a situation and this legislation is the first significant step to do so.</p><p>Research suggests that around 50% of workers have sick leave pay at present.  Obviously there is a significant difference between public and private sectors in this regard.  It is a <i>de facto</i>standard across the public service but coverage is much lower in the private sector.</p><p>I want to raise some concerns about the impact this legislation will have on businesses, particularly SMEs which are the backbone of the Irish economy.  I recognise that the legislation will be brought in on a phased basis so SMEs will have time to adjust over the coming years.  The costs have been capped to ensure the burden is limited.  Having said that, the legislation will still have a significant impact on businesses with customer-facing staff, particularly in the hospitality and retail sectors which already face challenging circumstances as we look to rebound from Covid.  It is probable that SMEs in these sectors will have to deal with a multiple number of staff missing work due to a contagious disease such as flu.  Replacing staff at short notice will prove very difficult.  First, as we are all aware, there are significant staff shortages in these sectors currently.  Second, the provision will be very expensive for businesses.  I expect that businesses in the hospitality sector looking to replace staff at short notice to work on a Friday or Saturday night, or on a Sunday, will have to offer to pay them at a time and a half, or at a double-time rate, in addition to paying the employee who is out on sick leave.  This means businesses will incur significant additional costs and expenses.</p><p>I recognise that section 10 of the legislation includes an inability to pay provision.  One could identify that as being a relief for businesses that are under pressure but it may come too late for some businesses.  The reality is that many SMEs do not have the capacity or knowledge to make use of the provision.  I would say that the majority of SMEs will not even know that the provision exists.</p><p>Like other Members, I have been contacted by a number of people representing SMEs who have expressed real concern about the additional costs that their businesses will face under this Bill.  They are good honest and decent people who want to do right by their staff, but between Covid-19 and inflationary and supply-chain issues many of them are already under significant pressure.  I know from my own experience that the longer an employee works for and with a business, the better the relationship, and the business will thrive as a result.  I have experienced that at first hand.  I know what it is like to have a good understanding between an employer and employee.  As the years build, respect grows, the employee works better and as a result the business thrives.  Therefore, it is in everybody's interest to get this right.</p><p>There has been a suggestion that this legislation will add between 1% and 2% to the payroll bill.  My opinion is that 1% or 2% may sound like a small amount but for many SMEs, particularly those in the hospitality sector such as bars, restaurants and shops that employ seven or eight staff, that has potential to mean many thousands of euro a year.  Representatives of SMEs have told me that this is money that they simply do not have in the current climate.</p><p>As I have stated and as other Senators have stated, we all believe that workers should have sick leave.  We must move forward with the legislation but we need to ensure we do not risk the viability of SMEs across various sectors.  I respectfully suggest that we enhance the supports given to SMEs as we move this proposal forward.  A tax rebate would be a fairer way and may make sense as a method of doing this.  I would be grateful to hear the views of the T&aacute;naiste on that aspect.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill and has campaigned for statutory sick pay for several years.  Indeed, today is very important day as it recognises the work of trade unions, which have campaigned tirelessly in this regard.  It has been a sad fact that Ireland has lagged decades behind the rest of Europe when it comes to the provision of sick pay so the Bill is welcome.</p> <p>I acknowledge what was said by Senator Ahearn.  The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment had a lot of good debates on this matter.  Members of the committee had different points of view but all of us wanted to support the general thrust of the Bill.  It is just a question of different perspectives in terms of where we think it hits the right note.  In that regard, I suspect that Sinn F&eacute;in will table a couple of amendments on Committee Stage.</p> <p>Sick pay is an issue that is very personal to me because in my work as a trade union official, particularly with low-paid workers, I found that no matter how sick they were they turned up to work because they desperately needed money.  I am thinking of contract cleaners in particular.  They were probably low-paid people with no sick pay provision and it was a real hardship.  The lack of sick pay was something that many foreign nationals, in particular, could not understand because in many of their countries, poor and all as they were, sick pay was in place whereas it was not in place here.  It is important to recognise and welcome the Bill in that context.</p> <p>I wish to raise some points with the T&aacute;naiste.  There was a concern about the 13-week period.  I recognise that it was a welcome amendment to cover people during the summer period.  It is important to get that aspect right so that people who are laid off during the summer do not have to start from zero.</p> <p>The joint committee had a big debate on certification.  To be clear, Sinn F&eacute;in believes that certification is important in order to defend the integrity of the Bill.  We are not saying that one does not need certificates.  The difficulty is the reality of the healthcare system.  If any of us phone our GPs today to ask for an appointment, we will have to wait.  Certainly, I would have to wait a week or maybe ten days.  There is also a cost element involved.  I am conscious that with Sl&aacute;intecare, all of us have signed up to the idea that there should be free GP care.  Sinn F&eacute;in would make the following key point: while we wait for free GP care to be achieved, we would have thought that it would be reasonable to introduce a rebate scheme so that workers are not penalised for having to see a doctor and get a certificate.  That is a reasonable point because all of us know the pressure that the GP system is under at the moment.  We know we have a particular challenge in terms of the number of GPs.  It just seems very problematic.  If we do not put some kind of rebate system in place, many workers may choose to turn up at work sick rather than incur the cost of having to go to a GP.  I was shocked to find out recently that the cost of a GP appointment in Dublin can be as high as &euro;70, which is no small amount of money.  That is a matter we need to revisit on Committee Stage.  Sinn F&eacute;in is still concerned with the 13-week period.  We may want to take a further look at that but I acknowledge the amendment that was made in that context.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste referenced some other points about workers' rights.  I would like to pick up on a couple of them in the context of the broader issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->First, I hope we will see the tips Bill come back before the summer recess.  We had a constructive engagement in this House on it several weeks ago.  In particular, I hope the service charge issue is dealt with sufficiently.  I know the Department has received many direct comments from workers and trade unions in respect of their experience in that regard.  It is important that we get that Bill right.  The likelihood is that it will not be revisited afterwards.  Getting that service charge element dealt with properly so that workers are not exploited is a very important point to take on board.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste also referred to the living wage.  I welcome any moves towards a living wage.  It is an unfortunate fact that, right now, the gap between the minimum wage and the living wage is broader than it has ever been in recent years.  My concern in respect of the T&aacute;naiste's plans for the living wage is that he seems to be saying that the definition of a living wage put forward by the living wage technical group is not the right definition.  I have not heard arguments as to why it is not the right definition.  The difference is that, right now, a living wage is &euro;12.90 an hour according to the living wage technical group, while the T&aacute;naiste stated that, according to his calculations, the living wage should be &euro;12.17 an hour.  I am deeply uncomfortable about very well-paid politicians telling low-paid workers that they do not need &euro;12.90 an hour and they will manage on &euro;12.17.  Let us be frank.  With the cost-of-living crisis we are going through, no worker can earn enough money on either of those rates.  I am not comfortable with that.  We need a further conversation on why the living wage technical group rate, which has been accepted for many years, is now apparently not going to be accepted by the Government.  It looks like a way to skimp on paying people a proper living wage.  I have always maintained that people who work for a living should be able to earn a living.  Unfortunately, for far too many people at the moment, that is not the case.  I look forward to a further debate in that regard.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in does welcome the Bill.  I look forward to constructive debates today and on Committee Stage and to seeing the onward progress of the Bill.</p></speech>

I am delighted that we finally have the opportunity to debate the Bill.  By the time it is enacted, it will probably be two years since the Labour Party put forward its legislation in the D&aacute;il.  Although we have obviously been impatient, we nonetheless herald the Bill as important legislation.  Particular credit must be paid to the work of Patricia King, Laura Bambrick and others at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as well as to SIPTU, which spent so much of the summer of 2020 highlighting the appalling lack of sick pay for low-paid workers, particularly those working in the red meat sector.  One in ten workers in the red meat sector and one in six workers in the childcare sector have sick pay.  As all present are aware, Ireland is one of a small number of EU member states that does not have statutory sick pay.</p> <p>Before I speak on the detail, it is important to pay tribute to all those who were sick and out of pocket during the pandemic, notwithstanding that the Covid illness benefit was made available.  I was thinking this morning of the boner in a meat factory who described to me in vivid detail the pressure he or she was under to continue going to work every day notwithstanding that there were men in the factory who clearly had Covid.  I was thinking also of the single parent childcare worker who was absolutely terrified of being a close contact or getting Covid, yet, when she was a close contact, she did the right thing and stayed at home notwithstanding that she was very much out of pocket.  It is important to state that the enhanced illness benefit was available, but that &euro;350 was only 47% of median earnings and, for the lowest paid, it meant a severe hit on their pockets.</p> <p>The Bill is important but, as the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged, it is far from what we believe should be in place.  We in the Labour Party are certainly in the camp that believes the Bill should go much further.  Section 5 sets down a minimum wait period of 13 weeks.  Like Senator Gavan, I acknowledge the amendment that was inserted to cover those who do not work during summer, but I still believe there is an issue for seasonal workers who work during summer or the spring and summer months.  They are not necessarily captured by that amendment and will still have to start the 13 weeks when they commence employment in the spring or summer period.  Section 5 provides for three statutory days.  Of course, we have heard the T&aacute;naiste's plan to increase that to ten days but I still have not heard a justification as to why we cannot hardwire this into the legislation.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to wanting flexibility, and ministerial regulation offering that greater flexibility, but there is no reason a simple amendment to this legislation could not be moved.  Ultimately, this is about trust.  We have to be able to trust that the Government will make good on those ten days.  I was struck yesterday in the context of the commitment on the living wage legislation that it is for a year beyond the lifetime of the Government.  We need a clear timetable with regard to those ten days.</p> <p>The other issue relating to trust is that of the costs employers keep telling us they will have to take on because of this new provision in legislation.  In the course of pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, we on the enterprise, trade and employment committee heard employers speak about the costs but when we asked them about the replacement needs and the costs associated with the replacement, we got vague answers.  I absolutely accept that in retail and hospitality there will be costs.  The other side of it, however, is that, as Senator Crowe mentioned, there are significant labour shortages in the sector at the moment so it does not necessarily follow that employers will be able to pull people in at short notice when a member of staff goes sick.</p> <p>There being three days sick pay entitlement does not mean that all workers will take up that entitlement.  I believe there was an assumption in the regulatory impact assessment that workers would take up the full entitlement per year.  Most of us in this room were employees before entering political life.  Did any of us take the full entitlement to sick pay?  I think most of us would say we did not.  That is true of most working people in this country. </p> <p>Section 7 assures that the Minister will issue regulations at a future date on the rate of payment.  The T&aacute;naiste in his speech referred to a rate of 70% in that regard.  We in the Labour Party believe it needs to be at the full rate of payment because, ultimately, why should people be punished when they are out sick?  I think in particular of minimum wage workers who, under this legislation, will have to go to a doctor from day one of being ill, yet will earn less in a day than the cost of going to the doctor.  A minimum wage worker will earn &euro;57 on a full day's rate, yet we know that the average cost of going to a GP is at least &euro;60, if not more.</p> <p>That brings me to the issue in respect of medical certification.  As has been stated, in an ideal world we would have timely and affordable access to a GP, or access at no cost, indeed, but that is not the reality in this country.  The pre-legislative scrutiny was interesting in this regard as it illuminated the thinking in the Department in respect of the costs of going to a GP.  It was asserted that 2 million people have medical cards and, in some ways, it is not really an issue for lower-paid workers to access a GP.  The reality is that, as we know from wave 5 of the Healthy Ireland survey, just 14.6% of those in employment and aged between 18 and 64 hold a medical card, while just 3.6% hold a GP visit card.  It was disappointing that the Department would throw such generalised figures about in respect of what it perceives to be the ease of accessing a GP.  My colleagues and I know from speaking to households and families day in, day out that they have to think twice about the cost of going to a doctor.  As Senator Gavan stated, they are waiting a significant period before doing so.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment put forward a really good recommendation on a cross-party basis that some form of rebate be put in place, particularly for low-paid workers, and I am disappointed that recommendation has not found its way into the legislation. </p> <p>In conclusion, notwithstanding our serious concerns in respect of the extent of the Bill, it is obviously important legislation.  Sick pay will be the main legacy of the pandemic to workers.  It does say something that the introduction of sick pay commands cross-party support.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Workers on the lowest incomes, who depend on every single cent of what they earn, will be at a loss when they are out sick.

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and thank him for all the work he has done in his brief, including the introduction of a new public holiday, provision for remote working, legislation on the treatment of tips and gratuities, supports for workers during the Covid lay-off period and now the introduction of statutory sick pay.  I am a former member of the Retail Grocery Dairy &amp;amp; Allied Trades Association, RGDATA, the Convenience Stores &amp;amp; Newsagents Association, CSNA, and the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI.  While I am no longer involved in those organisations, it is important to state that I was involved in the past.  I have received the report on small businesses.  I welcome that report and the engagement in this regard by the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p>It is the right thing to do to introduce statutory sick pay, especially for people on lower pay.  I welcome that it is being introduced on a gradual basis.  Many small businesses have gone through a very tough time, as the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged in his opening statement.  Senator Crowe noted that they are seeking a rebate scheme, which I ask the T&aacute;naiste to consider.  For small niche businesses, in particular, there are increasing costs, including in regard to the minimum wage.  Businesses have faced a lot of cost increases in recent times.  The cost of everything to do with running a business has risen.  I acknowledge that the Government has done much for small businesses and certainly helped to keep them afloat during the Covid crisis and in the context of what is happening with the war in Ukraine.  The latter is an unprecedented situation that is not of the Government's making.  However, I urge the T&aacute;naiste to look at some sort of rebate scheme for smaller businesses.  While I know it is difficult to give to one and not to the other, there are many large businesses that are thriving, while smaller businesses have really felt the pain.</p></speech>

It is extremely important because we really were an outlier in Europe in regard to sick pay.  I fully understand the challenges and difficulties smaller businesses face.  I welcome the provision for a gradual introduction of the statutory scheme and the sharing of costs between businesses and the State.  The Government has a responsibility to legislate for sick pay because people do get ill and, when they do, they deserve some latitude and some little bit of compensation.</p> <p>This Bill, the remote working proposals that are going through at the moment, what is being done in the legislation on tips and gratuities and what has been recommended by the Low Pay Commission regarding a living wage are all important provisions.  They are small, incremental steps.  None of them on its own will resolve the challenge of getting workers into businesses, for example, in the hospitality industry.  None of them will make a wealthy person out of a worker.  Combined, however, they will create an environment in which people feel appreciated and that they will be properly remunerated for the work they do.</p> <p>The introduction of a minimum wage many years ago was the right thing to do.  At that time, it represented 60% of the median wage.  Even though it has been increased many times, including on eight occasions since 2011, it no longer represents the median wage, as it should, and it is not proportionate.  What is being proposed in terms of a living wage is important.</p> <p>As I said, there is a staffing crisis, particularly in the hospitality, retail, food and drink industries.  Something must be done about it.  We are not unique as a country in facing these challenges, which are reflected right across the western world.  However, we can be unique in terms of our responses.  There are actions the T&aacute;naiste can take in his Department and I know he has done work on some of them already.  One of the actions that can be taken is speeding up the granting of work permits.  That is critical because, let us face it, many of the workers in the restaurant and hotel industries are people who come from abroad and may require work permits.  We can speed up the process of granting those permits.</p> <p>We also can loosen up the arrangements to allow people who are here for educational purposes to do more work.  Currently, there is a limit on the amount of work they can do.  Something can be done in this regard.</p></speech>

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and I welcome the legislation.  I pay tribute to him for driving forward significant changes for workers throughout the country, which is extremely welcome.  It is also welcome that there will be a gradual introduction of statutory sick pay over a number of years, building up to an entitlement of ten days.  However, I am concerned that this provision will put a lot of stresses on many businesses, particularly in the retail and hospitality sectors.  I have a small business and I know from personal experience the effect the change will have.  This is especially the case for businesses in the services industry, with employers having to cover approximately 70% of the costs when an employee is out sick and, in addition, 100% of the cost of a replacement employee.  We must be cognisant of that.</p> <p>I support the calls by Senator Maria Byrne and the CSNA for a rebate scheme.  I am strongly of the view that such a scheme needs to be put in place.  Businesses are struggling and there are very tight margins, particularly in retail.  Where there are significant increased costs, they must be spread across the rest of the business.  There already have been significant increases in the cost of energy and businesses are prepared to accept further such increases, but they need help.  In the retail sector, in particular, there are certain areas of the business on which those increases cannot be imposed.  If a retailer is a national lottery agent, for instance, there is a set margin.  Cigarettes can make up a significant part of a retailer's sales but, under the Finance Acts, it is not possible to put anything on top of the recommended retail price of tobacco.  Any increases will have to be spread across bread, milk and other basic goods.  This will have the knock-on effect of increasing the cost of living for people.</p> <p>I strongly urge that consideration be given to putting a rebate scheme in place.  As I said, there is a severe knock-on impact on business, particularly smaller retail businesses and the hospitality sector.  Nevertheless, I welcome the T&aacute;naiste's comments and the proposed introduction of a living wage.  That is needed.  Employers want to, and will, support the introduction of statutory sick pay, but they want help as well.</p></speech>

It is very welcome.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is only right that workers are well looked after.  Employees must be kept happy because then they will do more work and the better the return one will get.  As previous speakers said, however, there is going to be a knock-on impact from the cost of this scheme.  Somebody has to pay for it.  It must be paid for.  It will either be the case that small businesses will close or there will be a major increase in costs.  This is because the money must be found somewhere.  This is a cost to employers.  I met many of them and they are wondering why they are paying PAYE and PRSI.  Why not pay a little bit more and cover the cost of those sick days?  I say that because, in some cases, this could have a devastating effect on some small businesses.  As Senator Carrigy said, it will have implications for small businesses especially.  If some scheme was put in place to help them, that would be beneficial.</p><p>It was mentioned that there are only two countries that do not have such a scheme, but how many countries have a state-sponsored scheme?  I think some of the schemes are sponsored by states.  In how many of the countries is it just the employers that pay for the sick days?  Equally, what level of sickness is there in the private sector compared with the public sector?  Is there a difference?  Do all the employees in the public sector take their full allocation of sick days?  I ask this because I have often heard people say they have a couple of sick days left and must take them.  We have all heard that, and we will probably hear more of it as things go on.  What was the level in this regard before the pandemic?  The T&aacute;naiste said the events of the last two years have shown how necessary it is to put this legislation in place.  This is true.  We saw this in the meat industry in particular.  Have we, though, carried out any analysis of the level of sickness at work prior to these events?  Was any analysis done on that aspect?</p><p>I welcome this legislation and thank the T&aacute;naiste for what he is doing for workers.  It is only right that workers are well looked after.  I again refer to there being some sort of a scheme in this context for small employers and the self-employed.  Otherwise, some of them are going to go out of business and costs are going to go way up.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be able to discuss this Bill with him.  I welcome this legislation coming to the House.  As was mentioned by my colleague, Senator Crowe, Fianna F&aacute;il will, of course, be supporting this Bill.  It is an important one because it gives all workers in Ireland the right to paid sick leave for the first time.  This is something I firmly support.  It is long overdue.  Workers and their families deserve and need access to a level of paid sick leave.  It is a fundamental right of workers and I am pleased my party can play its part in delivering this provision.</p> <p>Many of us in this House and in the Lower House have been aware of the precarious conditions of many workers, especially those who are low paid and in the private sector.  It is fair to say that the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the great disparities in terms and conditions between workers.  Undoubtedly, this Bill seeks to advance the cause of workers and attempts to equalise entitlements in respect of sick leave.  No one should ever feel pressured to go to work when unwell because of not being able to afford not to for fear of ending up in a situation where mortgage, rent or utility bill payments could be missed.  I know of a case of one lady who had cancerous cells found during a routine breast check.  Luckily, that cancer was caught early and the cancerous tissue was removed through surgery.  That lady is now waiting for her radiotherapy sessions to begin.  She was, however, scared, shocked and emotionally distraught and, unfortunately, had to go back to work two weeks after her surgery because her employer refused to pay her sick pay.  It is not right for that to be the case two weeks after serious and invasive surgery.  She simply could not afford to recover from cancer.  It is wrong that this lady was forced to work straight through radiotherapy sessions regardless of the impact.  This is wrong in the Ireland of 2022 and that is why this Bill is so important.  People need to know that illness, and especially serious illness, will not financially ruin them and their families.  </p> <p>We are one of the few advanced economies in Europe without a mandatory sick leave entitlement.  Under current arrangements, sick leave is provided to about half of all employees through their terms and conditions.  This situation cannot be allowed to continue where a mere 50% of workers are covered.  As members of Government parties, we must continue to advocate on behalf of workers.  There is a significant gap between workers in the public sector, almost all of whom get sick pay, and those in the private sector, where there is much less coverage.  Equalisation in terms and conditions must be a priority.  </p> <p>I am glad the scheme is being phased in to help employers to plan and to manage the additional cost, which has been capped.  The new scheme will start with three days per year once the Bill is enacted, and that will rise to five days in 2024, seven days in 2025 and ten days in 2026.  It is a significant change and one that small business owners are anxious about.  There is no doubt that many larger private sector businesses can well afford a sick pay scheme and are simply choosing to not pay it.  Equally, however, many SMEs and independent operators, even in my area of south Kildare, are concerned about this idea.  The amendments made by the Government in the D&aacute;il, however, have strengthened this legislation regarding the maximum amount the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or Labour Court can award.  This has brought the penalty for breaches more into line with protections for other types of leave.  </p> <p>The Bill is intended to support the rights and conditions of workers.  Again, from my dealings with small business owners in south Kildare, I know the response has been positive.  Businesses want to support their staff and to treat their employees well.  I have no doubt that this Bill will aid them in this regard.  It will still have an impact, however, and I would like to see some level of support being put in place to help ease the pressure on and, indeed, the anxieties of many small business owners.  I say that because this could potentially be a costly change.  We must help to ensure that it does not disproportionately impact small businesses.  We all received a report from the Local Jobs Alliance, LJA, that highlighted the challenges for the sector.  If people are sick, the employer will have to pay 70% of the cost of the sick leave, but also 100% of the cost of the replacement.  We must examine this aspect because need an equitable system.  We must bear this in mind in a context where we are talking about rural Ireland, supporting businesses and reincentivising supports for village and town centres.  </p></speech>

The Sick Leave Bill 2022 will provide a statutory sick leave pay scheme for all employees, which will be phased in over four years.  As the T&aacute;naiste pointed out, we are one of the few countries in Europe without a mandatory sick leave entitlement.  Therefore, this is a welcome catching up, if you like, to bring us into line with our European partners.  As was said, under the current arrangements, sick leave is provided for about half of all employees through the terms and conditions of their employment.  The scheme will start with three days being provided annually.  The provision will then rise to five days and subsequently to ten days of sick leave in 2026.  Sick leave will be paid by employers at a rate of 70% of employees' wages, subject to a daily maximum threshold of &euro;110.  The legislation is intended to provide the minimum level of protection to low-paid employees.  It does not, of course, prevent employers from offering better terms or trade unions from negotiating for greater provision through collective agreements.  Employees must obtain a medical certificate to avail of statutory sick leave, which I am sure will allay some of the concerns people may have regarding abuse in the system.  A cost is associated with a sick cert, so I do not think this system will be open to a great level of abuse.</p> <p>There are no employees without employers and, likewise, there are no employers without employees.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I know the T&aacute;naiste has engaged with the unions and business groups.  IBEC has been in contact and has raised a number of concerns from the employers' point of view.  These include the cost burden, a matter that others have mentioned.  This is particularly with regard to companies with no sick pay scheme.  IBEC also spoke about excessive costs being placed on employers.  It noted that the daily rate is out of line with what is available in Northern Ireland and the UK on a weekly basis.  It is &pound;95 or &pound;96 per week.  IBEC also referred to the exclusion provided for in section 9.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to comment on the engagement he has had regarding IBEC's concerns about a lack of clarity and the fact that the provision it is somewhat imprecise.</p></speech>

This is a very important day.  The Bill is of enormous importance to workers.  I welcome this.  It is about the protection of workers and showing that Fine Gael, a party of government, is the party of the worker.  The T&aacute;naiste is right that this is the fifth piece of legislation he will introduce on workers' rights.  I remind Opposition Senators that this Bill is building on legislation relating to paternity leave, parental leave benefit, enhanced maternity benefit, treatment benefit and the extension of social insurance benefits to the self-employed.  I ask those opposite to go and tell the people they speak to every day that Fine Gael is the party of the worker.  Work will pay and does pay under Fine Gael.  Senator Gavan may well smile at me but the reality is that we are the party of the worker.  We will always do the right thing for the worker in this country.  This is what government is about.  It is not about populism but making tough decisions that will benefit the worker and ensure the worker and the employer can prosper and survive in a world that is very challenging at present.</p> <p>Senators Burke, Kyne and Carrigy mentioned the issues raised with us by some of the small and medium enterprises and the concerns they have about a potential knock-on effect.  There was engagement in the consultation process.  There is concern among those in retail, the fast food industry and hospitality.  I hope their concerns can be met and that in the implementation we can develop a working schedule in respect of the Bill.</p> <p>Today is important.  It is about ensuring that work does pay and that we protect our workers.  Our economy is not about pounds, pennies and shillings.  It is about the worker and the ability to go out and perform work.  We have seen from Covid-19 that the world of work has changed.  Under this Government and that which preceded it, there has been further enhancement of the rights of and protections for workers.  This should be saluted and acknowledged in the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#PP00300"><p>I thank the Senators for their contributions, which are very welcome.  Senator Dolan asked whether we could review the impact of this in a few years' time.  This would be good practice.  We had intended to do so anyway.  The first or second year might be too soon but perhaps it could be done in the third or fourth year.  I am happy to make that commitment.</p><p>I thank Senator Craughwell for his kind remarks.  The issue of class K contributions is not fully resolved.  It has been resolved for councillors but not yet for officeholders or Oireachtas Members who still pay class K contributions but receive no benefits.  I hope we will be able to resolve it at some point in the future.</p><p>The Senator made a very valid point on pension abatement for public servants.  It is something we introduced at a time of high unemployment and we did not want teachers, doctors and nurses who took early retirement and got pensions then going back to work and continuing to get the pension while being paid to do a job that a young teacher, nurse or doctor could be doing.  We are in a very different position now.  We have a labour shortage and we would like more retired people to go back to do a bit of part-time work.  The time has come to look at this again.</p><p>Senator Crowe asked about tax.  The cost of paying sick pay is deductible as a business expense.  Where it results in reduced profit there will be a reduced tax liability.</p><p>I take the points made by Senators on the cost involved in seeing a GP.  It is true that approximately 40% of people in Ireland do not have to pay their GP, but there are still many people on low pay who do not qualify for a medical card or a doctor visit card.  The solution lies in improving eligibility in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare plan.  I hear what people said about a rebate being a good idea as an alternative.  It is a good idea.  We have a rebate system for dental expenses and optical expenses through the treatment benefit scheme.  Perhaps we could do something similar and allow people to get one or two doctor visits a year refunded through treatment benefit.  It would be a good idea.  It would have to be negotiated with GPs and they are not the easiest people to negotiate with as people know.  The current negotiations are focusing on extending free GP care to children aged six and seven.  I would be happy to have this negotiation include extending treatment benefit to allow working people who pay PRSI to have some or part of their doctor visits refunded.  It is a good idea.</p><p>I want to clarify that the proposal the living wage should be &euro;12.17 an hour this year was not calculated by me or any politician.  It was calculated by the Low Pay Commission, which is a statutory body made up of workers' representatives, business representatives and independent experts.  They are the ones who suggested 60% of medium income earnings.  The Low Pay Commission sets out why in its report, which includes research carried out by Maynooth University.  It is all there for Senators to familiarise themselves with.  The living wage technical group is a different body full of very fine people who all come from union, NGO or academic backgrounds.  Nobody in the group represents employers or runs a significant business.  I do not think it is an appropriate body to make such a determination.  It does not have a democratic mandate or a statutory basis.  It excludes business people and employers.  The Low Pay Commission is the best body to do this.</p><p>I am sure there will always be people who can set up a group and say the living wage should be something else.  They might say it should be something lower and they might call that the realistic living wage.  They might say it should be something higher and call it the real living wage, the true living wage or the decent living wage.  There will always be people who believe the living wage should be a different figure.  The Low Pay Commission is the statutory body.  It is tripartite.  It has set out the research basis for why it recommended 60% of median earnings at least initially.</p><p>With regard to the four year plan to get to ten days or two weeks' sick leave I do not want to hardwire it into the legislation.  I am asking the House to trust me on this.  We have to consider the possibility that something could go horribly wrong with our economy.  We are almost at full employment, with 2.5 million people in employment.  This is more than ever before.  What if something did go terribly wrong?  We know how quickly things changed ten or 12 years ago.  Overnight we went from a booming economy to a major crisis.  I want to be prepared if something goes wrong, even though I do not think that will be the case.</p><p>Why did we go for a 70% replacement rate?  It is because we want to share the cost, with 30% from the employee and 70% from the employer and the State kicking in with illness benefit on day four.  I acknowledge that for the employer, as some Senators have been mentioned, there can be a double cost because it is not just the cost of sick pay but also the cost of a replacement employee who may then have to be paid a premium.  There is not always a need a replacement employee but in some cases there is and there is a real cost involved.</p><p>I am open to the idea of a rebate scheme for employers.  I do not think we will have it for year one.  A this is phased in and the costs for employers rise, I would be open to the idea of a rebate scheme.  It would work as a rebate from the Social Insurance Fund.  This is funded by employers' PRSI.  Many other countries do it.  We are bringing ourselves into line with other countries by introducing sick pay.  It would make sense to bring in a rebate scheme as other countries also have.  I would point out to Senators that everything must be paid for, as they have said to me.  The average social insurance paid by employers in the average European country is 20%.  It is roughly double employers' PRSI here.  If we were to do it and provide more rebates to employers there would have to be a <i>quid pro quo</i>in terms of the contributions they make through employers' PRSI, bringing them more in line with the norm in other European countries.</p><p>I will repeat the figure I used earlier.  If everyone did take the full three days, and I do not think everyone will, the increase in the cost of labour for employers next year would be 0.8%.  In the real economy we live in now employers are giving pay increases that are many multiples of 0.8% just to get staff.  We need to see it in perspective.  I acknowledge it is an additional cost and not an irrelevant additional cost.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Leo Varadkar:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2192"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2192&amp;amp;pid=LeoVaradkar&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Conway made a very valid point that when the national minimum wage was established in 2000, it was at 60% of the median wage.  There were many more people on it, though, as a result, but it was slightly above 60% of median wage.  While the national minimum wage kept up with inflation and increased ahead of inflation since 2000, it did not keep up with average or median earnings.  That is what I want to put right over the next couple of years.</p><p>Section 9 is there to ensure that nothing prevents an employer from offering a better sick pay scheme, whether it is by decision or collective agreement.  To put it on the record of this House again, as Members will know, illness benefit will work by a person getting three days of statutory leave from his or her employer and on day 4 illness benefit from the State kicks in.  From 2024 onwards, there will be savings for the State as illness benefit kicks in later.  We intend to recycle those savings to improve illness benefit and make it more linked to people's earnings because at the moment illness benefit is very low.  I cannot remember the exact figure but it is something like &euro;200 per week and can be even less than that.  We would like to use the savings that arise from this scheme to the social insurance fund to improve illness benefit and make it a bit more linked to previous earnings than it is now.</p></speech>

There were no amendments to the legislation as it passed through the D&aacute;il.  People were generally happy with it.  I want to put that on record at this point.</p> <p>As Senators will be keenly aware, the availability of affordable insurance is vital to underpin a healthy and vibrant economy.  This is why the Government has continued to prioritise insurance reform, which is identified in the programme for Government.  We are delivering on this commitment through the action plan for insurance reform, which is a cross-departmental initiative that seeks to tackle key insurance issues head-on.  The issues range from award levels and the cost of claims to competition and fraud.</p> <p>The Bill before the House speaks to a number of insurance-related issues that have arisen since the action plan was published in December 2020.  In doing so, it represents another important step on the journey towards greater transparency and openness in our insurance market and complements the significant volume of work already achieved under the action plan.  The Bill addresses four main issues, namely, the matter of insurers deducting State supports from claim settlements, the Central Bank's new price walking ban, technical amendments to the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 and changes to the scope of the insurance temporary run-off regime set up to ensure the orderly withdrawal of certain insurers from the Irish market following the UK's departure from the EU.  Ultimately, these pro-consumer measures are about increasing transparency, clarity and legal certainty in the insurance market.</p> <p>I will give a short overview of the Bill's main provisions.  First, the Bill amends the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018 to enable the Central Bank to collect information regarding deductions by insurers from claim settlements that relate to State supports.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Building on the well-established success of the national claims information database, NCID, this enhancement aims to increase transparency around such practices, and to generate evidence for future policymakers.  In doing so, it will help apply important lessons learnt from the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Second, the Bill requires the Central Bank to submit a report to the Minister for Finance setting out the steps it has taken to address the practice of "price walking", and its views on whether further action is required.  Following a review and public consultation, the Central Bank has published new regulations to ban price walking in the motor and home insurance markets, which will be the first of its kind in the EU, from 1 July this year.  As Senators may be aware, price walking can result in consumers who stay with the same insurer for many years being subject to a loyalty penalty.  By requiring a report on the price-walking ban, the Bill will help reinforce the work of the regulator to end the loyalty penalty, and ensure timely oversight of this important new consumer protection measure.</p><p>I use the phrase "loyalty penalty" as shorthand to cover the practice that in many insurance companies the more loyal one is to a particular insurance company on the motor insurance side or the home insurance side, one is charged extra the longer one stays.  One would have thought one would get a loyalty bonus but, in fact, the insurance companies in many cases have been penalising people for staying with the same company and not seeking to renegotiate their premiums on a regular basis.</p><p>Third, the Bill makes technical amendments to the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019 to address technical and legal issues that arose following the initial enactment of this legislation.  The Bill also inserts a new provision into the Act to require the disclosure of information by insurers in relation to deductions from amounts paid in claim settlements.  In line with the enhancements we are making to the NCID, this is a further measure to ensure maximum transparency around such practices, and will mean that consumers benefit from full and complete information about any deductions from their claim settlements.</p><p>Finally, the Bill provides for technical amendments to the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015, which underpin the temporary run-off regime, TRR, for UK and Gibraltar-based insurers as a result of Brexit.  These changes will guarantee service continuity, and thus protection, for Irish policyholders by ensuring that certain firms which provide reinsurance, and firms in liquidation, can use the temporary run-off regime to run-off their existing Irish insurance contracts.  By that, I mean they might be no longer writing here but a claim could arise and it might be quite a period of time before it comes to be settled and that is why we have this run-off regime to cover those issues.</p><p>The Bill passed smoothly through the D&aacute;il, where I feel it got a broadly positive response.  Accordingly, I hope that consideration by this House can be similarly constructive.  I believe that the delivery of this Bill is timely in light of the clear desire for insurance reform, not least here in the Oireachtas, where we have had many important debates on this issue in recent times.  From my regular engagements as Minister of State, I can see that the desire and willingness for tangible change exists among all stakeholders, from consumer groups to industry bodies.  I believe that we now have to pull together and build on this momentum to deliver real, meaningful reform that will last, and lead to an improved insurance environment not just for our benefit, but for the benefit of generations to come.</p><p>This means completing remaining actions, such as reforming the duty of care, and enacting the Competition (Amendment) Bill 2022, which is currently making its way through this House.  Delivering these outstanding initiatives remains the top priority of the Cabinet sub-committee on insurance reform, which is driving this reform agenda.  However, it also involves all stakeholders playing their part to uphold and fully implement the many important reforms already delivered, notably the personal injuries guidelines, which have the potential to significantly alter the insurance environment.</p><p>Of course, the guidelines are only one of several key reforms that have been delivered in the first 18 months of the action plan.  In that time, we have seen motor insurance prices continue to fall to the point where the latest CSO data for May shows a reduction of just over 40% from peak prices in mid-2016.  It is my hope that with full buy-in from all interested parties, and the completion of some final outstanding measures, the action plan will lead to further declines in motor insurance, as well as increased availability and affordability of liability insurance.  These reforms, including the measures contained in this Bill, should contribute to building a more open, sustainable and competitive insurance environment, one which works for both policyholders and insurers.</p><p>I stress the competitive environment aspect of it.  We are a small country of 5 million people and we do not have as many insurance companies operating here as one would have in a country with 50 million, 60 million or 70 million people.  It is important that, through our work at Government level, we do all we can to encourage existing companies that are in the Irish insurance market to spread their wings into areas that they are not currently covering and also to attract new businesses to write insurance in this area as well.  In that regard, we are working closely with IDA Ireland to encourage new businesses to come to Ireland that are not currently based here.</p><p>I thank Senators for their attention today.  I emphasise the importance of progressing this Bill promptly, in the interest of consumer protection.  In order to guarantee timely insight into the effectiveness of the price-walking ban, it is vital that the Bill can be enacted in line with the implementation of this ban on 1 July.  I also believe that prompt enactment of the changes to the temporary run-off regime is imperative in order to protect policyholders from any disruption in the servicing of their contracts.  I look forward to hearing Senators' constructive views on this legislation, and listening to the debate in the Upper House here today.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

He is becoming a regular visitor.  I believe he will be back again next week.</p> <p>This is another piece of the insurance reform jigsaw that is being put in place.  It is good to see that there have been no amendments and that the D&aacute;il has more or less recognised it for what it is doing and has accepted that.  However, we still have a long way to go within the insurance sector to make additional reforms to get it to where we realistically need to get it.</p> <p>Any of us who have worked in business or who run a business always reward our loyal customers but the insurance industry behaves in the opposite manner.  The more loyal one is, the more penalised one gets for being a loyal customer.  In relation to one aspect of this, the price walking, which is probably a new terminology, it is good to see that this is included in the Bill and the Central Bank will have a role as soon as this is enacted to try to address this.</p> <p>There is a generation of people out there who are not used to shopping around, who are not used to going on the Internet to secure a better offer or who are not used to picking up the phone and spending 15 or 20 minutes trying to get a better price.  They were reared with being loyal to a brand that they trusted but that trust is no longer coming from the insurance side.  It might be coming from the customers' side but it is not coming from the insurance side.  I welcome that piece within this legislation and I look forward to seeing how it works over a period of 18 months.</p> <p>The second bit is in relation to business interruption and the impact of Covid-19.  I would know this as I have been through it.  I refer to the behaviour of the insurance companies towards their customers and how they treated their customers in what were extremely difficult and challenging times for businesses.  Not alone during that period when consumers thought they had cover for business interruption schemes, their insurance companies put up walls before them clearly stating that they did not have cover.  It took a court decision to ensure that businesses were covered for business interruption during Covid-19.  Certain sectors were covered.  Some businesses were not covered.  During that period, the Government stepped in to support those businesses to ensure they did not fail through very troubling times.  For the court to rule that a business had business interruption cover but then for insurance companies to deduct all the State supports one had got during that period was, in one sense, disgusting in terms of how the insurance businesses operated during that time.  It was either the State or the insurance cover, but not both.  I paid a premium to have a business interruption policy to cover the Covid-19 pandemic and I was entitled to claim that from the insurance but, because the Government stepped in in that intervening period, the insurance company will not pay that.  The people of this country are at a loss in terms of that money.  The insurance company is the only company that benefits out of this process.</p> <p>I am delighted to see that measure in the Bill.  I accept we cannot retrospectively go back on this, but if we had known this at the start of the pandemic and the Government had been in a position to say that business A was covered and business was not covered, the supports could have been targeted at the businesses which were not covered and the Government would not have been exposed, to the benefit of the insurance companies, in terms of the companies that were covered.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat Casey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The only ones losing out here are the people of this nation.  I welcome the report and I know that we cannot go back on it retrospectively but it is something that was identified in the pandemic that we cannot allow to happen again.  As a business owner, I am grateful to the Government for its supports during that period.  Again, it goes to the behaviour of insurance companies, how they treat individual and business customers.  Covid-19 exposed them for what they are.  If there is any decency in these companies, they should pay the State back the money the Government paid to them.  That is the least they should to do have any credibility with the public.</p></speech>

I know his commitment and dedication to the whole issue of insurance.  I agree with all that Senator Casey has said.  While some people will shop around, others do not.  I am chairperson of a community centre in Limerick.  Our insurance went up by more than &euro;10,000 this year.  We are a not-for-profit organisation in the voluntary and community sector; any moneys that are made go back into the community centre.  They are working on delivery to the community.  It is a massive increase for an organisation like that.  I welcome all the work the Minister of State and his officials have been involved in.  We are going in the right direction.  The Minister of State indicated that people are being stung for the fact that they were with the same insurance company all the time.  That is not right, either.  People should get credit for how long they stay loyal to a business.  That happens in many organisations.  It needs to be brought in to the insurance sector.  The Minister of State is committed to that.</p> <p>While some small businesses were covered during the Covid period, some were not.  If a claim comes in against a small business now, the small business is no longer in control most of the time in respect of what happens in the courts.  A settlement is made in a lot of cases.  Sometimes the business owner receives a letter telling him the matter is no longer going to court as it has been settled.  We need to look at the bigger picture.  The Minister of State is going in the right direction.  Fine Gael fully supports what he is doing and I am looking forward to working with him on delivery of this all-important legislation.  It is very protective towards businesses, and businesses deserve certainty.  </p> <p>We had a debate here earlier on sick pay for employees, that whole assurance for employees and the employers.  In this case, we need to give assurance to people in terms of insurance.  People need to be able to get affordable insurance.  I refer to the number of accidents that have been reported where people did not have insurance.  Those things need to be looked at.  We need to be able to provide insurance at a reasonable rate so that everybody will make sure to have their insurance in place.  This legislation is most important for businesses and employers.</p></speech>

However, when I read through the legislation I think there are more questions than answers with regard to how the Government is proposing to deal with the myriad insurance issues in the country at the moment.  Sections 3, 4 and 6, which form the bulk of the Bill, are effectively about data collection.  There seems to be a hope that data collection will shine a light and bring transparency into some of the insurance companies' practices.  We cannot depend on hope.  We have to ensure there is regulation in place.</p> <p>The main impetus for the Bill was the enormous outcry that insurance companies were profiting from the State payouts to firms by deducting the benefit that a company got in the ensuing insurance settlement.  At the time last year, we heard very strong commitments from Government that it would act.  Really what we are seeing in the legislation today is data collection as opposed to any outright action.</p> <p>What is most galling for me is that the Government could have acted.  I listened to Senator Casey who spoke really passionately about how insurance companies have acted and should act now in terms of paying back the benefit they have accrued from withholding the State benefit.  Those same insurers in personal injury cases have to pay the State benefit back to the State.  That is already in legislation.  The Government knew about this in 2020 but decided not to put in place any conditionality or protection of the State's interest when it was setting up these State benefits to companies.  It could have acted as it has already in respect of personal injury, yet it cast a blind eye.  It was to be expected that insurance companies would have acted like this and deducted the State payout to the businesses when making insurance settlements.</p> <p>Section 6 is the response to the appalling price walking and customer loyalty practices.  It is usually the less savvy and less able customers who are less equipped to switch around and they are being penalised for their loyalty.  The changes on 1 July are welcome but we really have to hear from the Minister today that he is going to monitor and act quickly if we do not see change in respect of premiums for those customers who do not switch.  The precedent set down and what we are seeing at the moment with regard to the judicial council guidelines experience would not give us massive hope.  The Minister of State cited figures in his own speech regarding where premiums have gone.  We have not seen the fall in premiums that insurance companies promised when they were looking for these judicial council guidelines.  I think insurance companies need to be pushed to a much greater extent by Government to make good on those commitments.</p> <p>There is a massive issue with insurance coverage in this country and gaping holes in some sectors, particularly in the community sector, water sports, community arts festivals and other businesses and activities.  I understand we are a small country and do not have the luxury of multiple insurance companies.  As a small country, then, we have to look at how we correct the market failure.  I know a number of small organisations making tiny profits, if any profit at all, that have had to shut down because they could not get a decent premium for their business.  That was even looking to the UK because there was simply no insurance company here.  It is one thing to say we are a small country and have to accept the insurance landscape as we have it.  It is a very different thing for the Government to say it is going to do something about it.  We have not heard that comprehensive response from Government but we need to hear it.  The Labour Party and other parties, including Government parties I am sure, have been putting forward proposals as to how we can resolve some of those insurance gaps.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We know there are proposals with regard to local authorities, and with regard to the State putting in place its own insurance company for community events.  We need to see comprehensive action from the Minister of State on this.  It is not good enough to put our hands up in the air and say we are a small country and we cannot do any more.</p></speech>

The problems in the insurance industry are well known to all of us.  My party and others - I am thinking particularly of my party colleague Deputy Doherty - have worked hard over the years to highlight the exceptionally high premiums and the rip-off nature of insurance in this country.  His Bill from 2021 is unfortunately being blocked by the Government.  We welcome that this Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been brought forward, primarily to address the issues of business interruption insurance in the context of Covid-19 and dual pricing.  Many businesses that were forced to close because of public health restrictions, primarily in the hospitality sector, were covered by their insurance companies, but it then transpired that insurance companies were deducting the value of State supports provided to firms during the pandemic from the value of those payouts.  Given that wage subsidy schemes, tax waivers and other State supports were essentially paid for by the taxpayer, in effect taxpayers' money has subsidised the insurance industry.  Insurance companies devised a system whereby they indirectly made a profit from State supports to struggling businesses.  The Minister of State said that the Government would respond and that insurance companies would not be let off the hook.  They did well out of the pandemic.  Despite what the Minister of State claims, they have been let off the hook.  The problem with the legislation before us is that all it does is require the gathering of information.  There is nothing here that would prevent it from happening again.  There is nothing here that would require the insurance companies to pay the State back.</p> <p>Sections 3 and 4 require the Central Bank to publish as part of the national claims information database data on any deductions from insurance claim settlements by insurance companies that relate to public moneys.  Section 8 amends the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act 2019, which will require insurers to notify their customers of any such deductions, but there is no indication of what will happen with that information.  Sections 5 and 6, in Part 3 of the Bill, address the issue of dual pricing in the insurance industry, also known as price gouging.  Again, the legislation does not do anything to end dual pricing or price walking.  It just asks for a report on something that the Central Bank has introduced independent of the Government and would probably have provided its own reports on in any case.  Therefore, this is a disappointing Bill in many respects.  We are not opposing the provisions of the Bill.  It does include several technical and necessary provisions in regard to the Consumer Insurance Contracts Act and the temporary run-off regime, but it is a disappointment that the Minister of State and the Government claim to be introducing legislation to deal with dual pricing and the behaviour of insurance companies which shamefully deducted State supports from business interruption insurance payments but have produced a Bill which does not do much to address either of those issues.</p> <p>Price gouging through dual pricing will be banned by the Central Bank, independently of the Government, on 1 July.  Outside of that, there are still major issues to be resolved in the insurance industry.  I mentioned that the Government continues to block Deputy Doherty's Bill to deal with these challenges.  It would be of more benefit to consumers if the Government got behind that Bill as it aims to push down insurance premiums for consumers across the board.  That is what is really needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#TT00300"><p>It is important to put this in the context of the broader package of reforms in the whole area of insurance over a long number of years.  It is one of a number of Bills being looked at this year that will address various issues that have arisen since the action plan on insurance was published.  It will result in the implementation of the proposed ban on price walking and other measures to address this practice and will enable the Central Bank to collect data on this through the national claims information database.</p> <p>I commend the Minister of State and, indeed, the previous Government on their reforms on the area of insurance.  When we talk about inflation and the year-on-year price increases to May across a range of sectors, we should note that there has been a 10% reduction in car insurance in the same period.  This is reflective of the work of the cost of insurance group, which was established in 2016.  This work has led to the implementation of legislation, such as the Judicial Council Bill to implement the recommendations of the Personal Injuries Commission regarding award levels, and to the reform of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The report on the cost of motor insurance was published in July 2017 and the report on the cost of employer and public liability insurance was published in 2018.  The body of work that was done in the years after the establishment of the cost of insurance working group culminated in a final report in October 2020.  A number of other pieces or actions have since been completed or are in process as well.  A body of work has been done to try to reduce the levels of insurance payouts.  That issue was to the fore a number of years ago.  This legislation is another follow-on to that as part of the action plan for insurance reform.  Other initiatives, including the reform of the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, will be concluded through legislative proposals this year.  There are also changes to the Occupiers Liability Act 1995 on waivers and notices to increase protections for consumers and businesses.</p> <p>The most important message is that this important legislation is part of an array of measures that have been put in place over a long number of years to reform the insurance market, to reduce the levels of payouts and, most importantly, to reduce the levels of premiums for consumers.  I commend the Minister of State and wish him well in advancing the other issues within the action plan.</p></speech>

They are all very helpful and positive and accept the logic of the legislation.</p> <p>A big element of this issue relates to the recovery of deducted State supports.  It has been rightly pointed out that in the Department of Social Protection, there is a scheme called the recovery of benefits and assistance scheme.  It simply means that someone who is involved in an accident and gets disability payments for a period is not paid twice when the insurance company comes to settle.  For instance, if there was a settlement of &euro;100,000 and someone had already received &euro;20,000 in State support through disability payments during that period, the person would get &euro;80,000 because they had already received &euro;20,000.  They would not get &euro;100,000 from the settlement, which was the total value of the award, with an additional &euro;20,000 on top from the State.  They would receive a total settlement of &euro;100,000 with &euro;20,000 from the State and &euro;80,000 from the insurance company.  However, the insurance company would hand the &euro;20,000 back to the State because it had saved that amount since it did not have to pay it out.  That is the principle we want to pursue here.</p> <p>This is step one.  I totally agree that if legislation like this had been in place a couple of years ago prior to Covid, which no one foresaw, we would have had a means of dealing with this area.  However, we did not have legislation and we did not see Covid coming.  I see it as a good learning experience.  We want to make sure that if anything like that happens again, we are in a position to legislate.  That is why we are gathering information because it could happen across any sector.  It could happen in respect of an environmental issue or any other payment scheme that arises down the road.  We want to have information from the Central Bank so that we can draft good legislation on this in the future.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This matter may yet well come to light as part of the quantum hearings and in the context of ongoing litigation before the courts.  The matter is still before the courts and this issue may have an impact on that.  The door is not yet fully closed on that issue.  I want to put that on public record.  Again, one could not retrospectively introduce issues in respect of to the insurance payout on a policy that has in existence maybe a year before Covid-19 came.  While I would have liked to have done so, it was not practical from a legal point of view.  That is my comment on that.</p><p>I want to also talk about a fair remark that was made, namely, that this legislation does not ban price walking.  It seeks to get a report after 12 months, and within six months of the first anniversary.  I accept that.  It is important that we take a whole-of-government approach.  It is not the job of the Department of Finance to run every aspect of the insurance industry.  The whole-of-government approach means that the Department brings forward legislation and deals with the policy in this area, because this is a regulated industry.  However, the implementation of that policy can be through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, such as in respect of business.  This is particularly the case with regard to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, which has a role in that area.  Legislation in this regard is coming before the House.  We already have legislation coming forward from the Department of Justice on the duty of care legislation.  We already had the judicial guidelines, which are now working their way through the courts.</p><p>The Department of Finance did not write the judicial guidelines, the PIAB legislation or the duty of care legislation.  Neither did it write the price walking ban, which was done by the Central Bank.  Our job is to make sure that all of these things are happening.  It is not our job to do all of those things.  However, I would see it as our role within the Department of Finance to make sure that they are all happening.  That is what in this legislation here today.</p><p>I know that I am out of time, but I want to acknowledge the work of Deputy Pearse Doherty in this area in the past.  I have acknowledged that work in the Chamber.  We are gathering information here that will be helpful to us in getting good legislation into the future, as we done in the past.  That is why we have the price walking legislation.  Over the past couple of years, the Central Bank collected the data and now we have good legislation in this area.  I want to do the same in relation to payments by the State.  Perhaps the State was too quick to pay out money to small businesses, but it was a priority to get it out quickly.  I have no apologies to make.  We could not hang around to check business's insurance policies to see if they had cover or not.  They needed help there and then.  That is one of the lessons we have learned.</p><p>I thank the Senators.  I look forward to being back here last week for Committee Stage, as well as for the final stages of the legislation.</p></speech>

<br /><br />- average full-time workers in Ireland are paying the higher rate of tax, meaning they lose more than half of any pay increase through income tax, USC and PRSI;<br /><br />- the cost of renting is too high, despite significant interventions through the implementation of Housing for All;<br /><br />- Ireland is facing a prolonged period of inflation which requires a strategic, not a piecemeal, response from week-to-week;<br /><br />- the best response from Government is to reduce costs in a structural way &ndash; to reduce people&rsquo;s bills, such as income tax, childcare, college fees, medicines, hospital charges, the GP, public and school transport;<br /><br />- the Government will never be in a position to compensate people fully for the rise in the cost of living; recalls:  	- the squeezed middle has benefitted from many universal measures in recent years,<br /><br />including:<br /><br />- increases to the standard rate cut-off point and income tax credits,<br /><br />- free GP care for all children under six years old,<br /><br />- free GP visit card for the over 70s, regardless of income,<br /><br />- reduced maximum payment under the drugs payment scheme for anyone without a medical card, now down to &euro;80,<br /><br />- the introduction and expansion of the new universal childcare subsidy and two free pre-school years,<br /><br />- the introduction of paternity benefit,<br /><br />- parents benefit, due to be extended from 5 to 7 weeks in July 2022,<br /><br />- restoration of the treatment benefit for employees and its extension to the self-employed,<br /><br />- extension of invalidity benefit and jobseekers benefit to the self-employed and the &euro;1,650 earned income tax credit for the self-employed,<br /><br />- the help-to-buy incentive, which has helped over 32,000 individuals and couples to buy their first home,<br /><br />- increases to all third-level student grants of &euro;200 per year, an increase in the qualifying threshold by &euro;1,000, and a reduction in the distance to qualify for the higher grant,<br /><br />- 20% reduction in public transport fares until the end of 2022;<br /><br />recognises:<br /><br />- the Government has already provided &euro;2.4 billion to households and families to help with the cost-of-living crisis, representing more than a typical annual budget package;<br /><br />- along with the &euro;200 energy credit and a cut to the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy from October, there is now a comprehensive range of supports available to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades, for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes, with lower energy bills;<br /><br />- further reductions in income tax took effect in January, resulting in the average two income household paying &euro;830 less in income tax and USC this year;<br /><br />- that not adjusting the standard rate cut-off point is a tax increase by stealth;<br /><br />- pension and social welfare increases took effect in January, building on the consistent rises over recent years;<br /><br />- the minimum wage has increased again this year and ranks sixth highest in Europe when adjusted for purchasing power standards;<br /><br />- the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will shortly publish proposals to introduce a statutory living wage in Ireland; calls for:  	- a cost-of-living package in Budget 2023, building on the cost-of-living package in Budget 2022, with a specific focus on the squeezed middle, to include:<br /><br />- further income tax adjustments so that the squeezed middle do not lose most of any pay increase they get in income tax, USC and PRSI,<br /><br />- pension and welfare increases,<br /><br />- reductions in the costs that are out of line with those in other EU countries, to include: <blockquote> 	(i) increasing universal childcare subsidies for all parents,<br /><br />(ii) making the recent reductions in public transport permanent,<br /><br />(iii) lowering the cost of college through reducing the student contribution and increasing eligibility for student grants,<br /><br />(iv) reducing the cost of healthcare,<br /><br />(v) increasing cost rental and affordable housing schemes; </blockquote> - a comprehensive anti-inflation strategy that deals with the issues in the round and tackles the structural issues underlying the high cost of living in Ireland.  </blockquote> <p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House for this motion on the rising cost of living in the names of Fine Gael Senators.  Ireland and the entire world is facing a cost-of-living crisis driven by inflation which is largely caused by international factors beyond our control.  None of us foresaw the pandemic and now the war which is driving up the cost of everything.</p><p>The cost of living in Ireland is high by international standards but wages are also among the highest in the EU with median gross hourly earnings one third above the EU average.  Those on the lowest wages are hit hardest by the rise in the cost of living.  The squeezed middle is paying a large proportion of income tax but earning too much to qualify for many State supports.  Average full-time workers in Ireland are paying the higher rate of tax, meaning they lose more than half of any pay increase through income tax, USC and PRSI.  The cost of renting is too high despite significant interventions through the implementation of Housing for All.</p><p>Ireland is facing a prolonged period of inflation which requires a strategic, not a piecemeal, response from week to week.  The best response from Government is to reduce costs in a structured way and to reduce people&rsquo;s bills, such as income tax, childcare, college fees, medicines, hospital charges, the GP, public and school transport.  The Government will never be in a position to compensate fully for the rise in the cost of living but we recall the squeezed middle has benefited from many universal measures in recent years and we wish to recognise that the Government has already provided &euro;2.4 billion to households and families to help with the cost-of-living crisis, representing more than a typical annual budget package, along with the &euro;200 energy credit and the cut to the public service obligation levy from October.  There is now a comprehensive range of supports available to make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills.  Further reductions in income tax have taken place.  This really is the thrust of what our motion is about.  Pension and social welfare increases came into effect in January.  However, it is about looking into the future.  Our motion calls for a cost-of-living package in budget 2023 building on the cost-of-living package in budget 2022 with a particular focus on the squeezed middle.</p><p>I hosted a meeting on childcare in Limerick last week, attended by many families both in attendance and online.  One lady I met said that the cost of childcare is like another mortgage.  In terms of the cost-of-living package for budget 2023, we need to build on what we did as a Government in budget 2022 but to include further income tax adjustments so that the squeezed middle does not lose most of any pay increase in income tax, USC and PRSI; pension and welfare increases; reductions in the costs that are out of line with those in other EU countries, to include increasing universal childcare subsidies for all parents; and making the recent reductions in public transport permanent.</p><p>I spoke to a student from University of Limerick who told me that students rarely came into the city centre in Limerick but now with the reduction in fares for 65 cent and they can go right around the city.  Students are now encouraged to come into the city because of that reduction.  Consequently they are spending money in the city which they once spent in the areas where they live.  In that respect, this needs to be looked at as a permanent reduction.</p><p>Lowering the cost of college through reducing the student contribution and increasing eligibility for student grants is something I know the Minister, Deputy Harris, who was here this morning for a Commencement matter in relation to the SUSI grant, is concerned with.  Many people do not qualify for the SUSI grant, which is causing much hardship and pressure for families.  Some students study part-time because of disabilities and do not qualify for the grant.  They are not working because they want to devote their time to their studies which puts more pressure on not only the student but on his or her family.</p><p>On reducing the cost of healthcare, much has been done by the Government in terms of the drug payment scheme, which was reduced from &euro;140 to &euro;80 for those not on a medical card.  Increasing cost rental and affordable housing schemes are necessary</p><p>We need to provide a comprehensive anti-inflation strategy that deals with the issues in the round and tackles the structural issues underlying the high cost of living in Ireland.  We need budget 2023 to be introduced to help people deal with the cost of living, especially those on the lowest incomes and the squeezed middle.</p><p>As I said, I have spoken with families about the cost of childcare.  So many people have gone back into employment.  In my region, the mid-west, the unemployment figure is just over 4% which is even lower than it was prior to the pandemic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Due to measures put in place by the Government to support businesses, a lot of people were kept in full-time employment.  The measures gave them a salary and alleviated anything to do with expected redundancies or businesses not opening.  It has been helpful in terms of supporting businesses.  We must support lower-income workers into the future with the rising costs.  The Government has done much but the cost at present of filling a tank of petrol, diesel or oil is significant.  Inflation is driving increases in the cost of deliveries.  Everything is increasing in price and being affected by not only the war but the pandemic which is still with us.  So many things happened.</p><p>I note the commitment from the Minister's Department in terms of what she did for employers and employees regarding increasing pension benefits and giving employers back their PRSI contributions.  There is also free GP care for those aged under six.  Those aged over 70 now qualify for a free GP visit card.  All of these things have helped families but the squeezed middle needs a bit more support.</p><p>Now is the right time to engage in this conversation because there will be a budget in October.  There is no point in talking about this in September.  We need to start examining these issues now, in terms of the different Departments and how we can build upon the &euro;200 credit given to families to help with energy costs.</p><p>Further reductions in income tax took effect in January.  Families got &euro;830 into their pockets but they are not seeing that increase because of the higher cost of inflation.  We had a discussion on insurance earlier on a Bill introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming.  Those costs are going up.  Rising costs are everywhere.  </p><p>Our motion calls for a cost of living package in budget 2023 to build on a cost of living package in 2022.  We would like pension and welfare increases and reductions in costs in line with those in other EU countries to include increased universal childcare subsidies for all parents.  We need to make the recent reduction in public transport fares permanent, which I have already mentioned.  We need to reduce the cost of college fees and healthcare.  The cost of healthcare has become prohibitive.  I have met people who have not been able to afford to pay for health insurance.  We need to make it accessible because our health is our wealth.</p><p>We need to address the provision of cost rental and affordable housing.  In my area, we opened 71 co-operative houses recently and another 100 social housing units are coming on stream.  Others are being built.  As a country, we need to deliver more because we have more people in employment.  People are interested in moving to different areas for jobs.  We need to deliver housing in budget 2023.  We need to help people deal with the cost of living, especially those on lower incomes and the squeezed middle, and to support people into the future.</p></speech>

I thank my colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, for setting out the motion.</p> <p>The scourge of inflation is hurting everybody in this country.  The rise in the cost of living caused by inflation is hurting families, single people, students, adults and every sector of society.  Inflation is, in the main, outside of our control.  The illegal invasion of Ukraine has set the world upside down, in particular the continent of Europe.  We have seen that across a range of areas, including energy security and concerns about energy supplies.  </p> <p>We know the importance of money in people's pockets.  Families who this time last year had certain pressures have now reached a different level.  The Government has responded and, to be fair, that is set out in the motion.  The Government has responded in budgetary and supplementary packages and in addressing issues with the duty on fuel.  When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, was before the House I asked that these things be kept under review.  They have to be kept under continuous review by the Government.  </p> <p>We need to re-examine duties on fuel because that is having an impact on everybody across the country who drives a car, in particular those in rural and regional Ireland where choices are limited and people have to use cars to go to work, school or drop off children.  There are significant costs associated with this.  As I said, the Government has responded, but need to consider the whole area of fuel.</p> <p>The squeezed middle comprises real people.  It is not a clich&eacute;; real people up and down this country are earning good money on paper but have mortgages or rent to pay and childcare costs, and inflation is using into whatever reserves or savings they might have and their budget planning is being affected.</p> <p>The Government has assisted the squeezed middle for a number of years, including increases to the cut-off to the standard rate of income tax credits, free GP care for all children aged under six, free GP visit cards for those aged over 70, regardless of income, a reduced maximum payment under the drugs payment scheme, the introduction of paternity benefit and the extension of parents' benefit from five to seven weeks in July.  These are all very positive measures that have assisted people.  </p> <p>One important area we have focused on over a number of budgets is adjusting the standard rate cut-off point for the higher rate of tax.  Some parties and individuals seem to have an aversion to what they perceive to be tax cuts and think they are bad.  Tax cuts are important.  Adjusting the standard rate of tax is very important, because if we did not adjust the level at which people start paying the higher rate of tax, then everyone would end up on a higher rate of tax.  Fine Gael and the Government have looked at this over the past number of years.  It is important that the Cabinet and Government continue that in the forthcoming budget.  </p> <p>We want a cost of living package in budget 2023 to build on what we have done in 2022.  We want further income tax adjustments in order that the squeezed middle do not lose out.  Most pay increases they are getting are going on income tax, USC and PRSI.  We want pension and welfare payment increases.  We want to examine the areas where costs are out of line with other European countries, including increasing universal childcare subsidies for all parents.  </p> <p>The reduction in fares on public transport was an excellent start and it is something we should focus on, in terms of eventually moving to having free public transport.  Lowering the cost of college through reducing the student contribution and increasing eligibility for student grants, reducing the cost of healthcare and increasing the number of cost rental and affordable housing schemes are all measures that will assist the squeezed middle in our country, that is, the people who get up early in the morning, go to work, pay their taxes and do not get the same benefits as everyone else.  That is important.  </p></speech>

It is important that people who work hard, pay their taxes and do not benefit from the benefits other receive are looked after as well.  We will continue to adjust the tax threshold to ensure that people will pay the higher rate of tax at a higher rate of income.  If we do not do that, everyone will end up paying a higher rate of tax.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government has done a lot and I know the Minister is doing a lot within her Department.  We need to continue the focus on ensuring that all sectors of society benefit because they need help.  They need assistance.  As I stated, inflation is largely outside our control due to the war in Ukraine and the impact it is having.  The Government has responded.  It needs to continue to respond to look after all sectors of society.  As I stated, the budget package in 2022 was important.  There is a need to continue that and to continuously monitor the impact of the cost of living on society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#AAA00200"><p>I thank the Fine Gael Senators for tabling this Private Members' motion.  I am responding to the motion on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Government.  The Government supports the motion on the basis that we agree with its call for a budget to help people, particularly those on the lowest incomes and the squeezed middle, deal with the cost of living.  We agree that we need to respond to inflation in a strategic way, rather than doing so piecemeal.  Budget 2023 is just over three and a half months away and this is a useful opportunity to listen to the views of Senators.  It is timely to have this important discussion now rather than the week before, or indeed the week after, the budget.</p> <p>The national economic dialogue will take place next Monday.  It will provide a forum for an open and inclusive discussion on competing priorities and economic perspectives in advance of budget 2023.  As the motion points out, countries the world over are facing significant issues in the context of the cost-of-living crisis.  Inflation is currently running at over 8% in Ireland, with nearly half of that due to higher energy prices.  This is eroding real incomes.  Although the reality is the Government will never be in a position to fully compensate people for the rise in the cost of living, we have already made significant interventions and will continue to do all we can to help people.</p> <p>The Government has demonstrated its willingness to intervene assertively in the economy when that is needed.  If one looks at what happened in the past two years during the pandemic, there was unprecedented support.  Approximately &euro;48 billion was provided through programmes such as the pandemic unemployment payment, the employment wage subsidy scheme and a range of other supports.  Those supports were designed to help workers and businesses, and they worked.  The economy has recovered far faster than anybody imagined. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-15a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022061500002#AAA00400"><p>Many commentators predicted a tsunami of redundancies and business failures but that has not happened.  Instead, we have more than two and a half million people at work - the highest level of employment in the history of the State.  At the same time, the number of people on the live register is now at its lowest level for many years.  There are a significant number of job opportunities across all sectors at the moment.  As Minister, through our Pathways to Work strategy, my Department, along with the Department of the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is focused on providing education and training supports in order that people who are currently unemployed have the skills and, most important, the confidence to take on those job opportunities.  The one thing on which everybody in this House can agree is that the best way to help a person out of poverty is to help him or her into quality employment.</p> <p>Equally, all present recognise that it is those on fixed or low incomes who are hit first when it comes to rising food or electricity costs.  That is why, last year, I introduced the largest social welfare budget package for 14 years.  It is why the Government has continued to respond swiftly as circumstances have changed, with a wide range of further measures to assist with the cost of living.  These include the &euro;200 energy credit for all households, two additional lump sum payments of &euro;125 and &euro;100 for those on fuel allowance, cutting the excise rates on petrol and diesel, cutting the VAT on gas and electricity, reducing public transport fares by 20% and extending the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  Those are just a few examples of the recent interventions by the Government to help people with rising costs.</p> <p>The motion also highlights a range of measures the State has introduced in recent years to help the squeezed middle.  These include measures such as free GP care for all children under six, a new universal childcare subsidy and the extension of invalidity benefit and jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed.  In the budget last year, we also brought in changes to income tax to help middle-income earners.  By increasing the standard rate cut-off point, any couple each of whom earn &euro;45,000 benefited by &euro;830.  As was highlighted during the public hearings of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight on the subject earlier this year, adjusting bands and credits upwards, especially in a time of high inflation, is a move to try to maintain the value of take-home pay for all taxpayers.</p> <p>As the motion notes, the price of renting continues to rise.  I acknowledge that the Government needs to do much more in the area of affordable housing.</p> <p>There is a limit to what the Government can do to offset rising energy costs.  We can take steps to reduce the burden but we cannot absorb it in its entirety.  Acting to protect households from the most severe impacts of the pandemic and from rising inflation has been both necessary and appropriate.  These interventions have come at a significant cost, however, and that cannot be ignored.  Immediately before the pandemic, our public finances were on a solid footing.  We managed to introduce universal benefits such as those to which I referred, as well as increased pension and core welfare payments.  That meant that when the pandemic hit, the Government could respond in a positive and counter-cyclical manner to limit the fall-out.</p> <p>The reality of being in government is that one has to deal with hard choices.  We cannot always do everything we want to do.  It is becoming clear to us that the era of free money is over.  Borrowing costs are rising, having risen by two percentage points since the beginning of the year.  In order to limit the exposure of the public finances to rising borrowing costs, the Government has to take account of that and target a low level of borrowing.  This underlines the valid point made in the motion that we must respond to inflation in a strategic way, not a piecemeal one.</p> <p>Almost every week, the Government responds to motions or calls in the Oireachtas for extra spending to respond to inflation and cost-of-living crisis.  Those calls are understandable but I fear what would happen if the Government actually implemented everything that is being sought.  Instead, what we need is a well thought-out cross-government and medium-term strategy to respond to inflation in a way that does not simply exacerbate the problem we are trying to fix.</p> <p>As Minister for Social Protection, my priority will be to protect the most vulnerable people in the months and years ahead.  In July, I will host my Department's pre-budget forum.  It will be an opportunity to engage with all the different stakeholders and representative groups, such as carers, disability groups, representatives of lone parents and so on.  I will be engaging with everybody and listening to all the views at that forum and that will help inform our thinking in a strategic way ahead of the budget.</p> <p>We need strategic interventions across government as part of the budget.  That means a tax and welfare package, measures to reduce the cost of childcare, and looking at other ways we can put money back in people's pockets to help make their lives a little bit easier.  Members can be assured of my commitment to do just that.</p> <p>I thank Senators for the opportunity to speak this evening and I look forward to listening to their contributions.</p></speech>

I fully agree with her on that.  However, I attend the Order of Business every day and I listen to Government Members talk about hospitals and health issues.  Indeed, I commend Senator Buttimer on suggesting, during the Order of Business debate this week, that we have a meeting prior to the budget to discuss things.

We all accept that there are issues that concern the large proportion of income tax.</p> <p>As the Minister and I know, and I do not wish to give her or the Members of this House a history lesson, that the cost of renting a home is too high and it is nigh impossible for most people to purchase a home.  Pension and social welfare payments are not sufficient to meet the costs of living.  Too many people simply cannot survive on the minimum wage and it has failed to keep pace with the cost of living.  The price of petrol and diesel is particularly having an impact on agriculture and enterprise, and we need to do something about that.  The Minister hails from a Border county so she and her constituents have particular experiences in that regard.  The price of home heating oil now forces people on some occasions to decide whether to eat or heat, and that certainly happens in the winter.  Such a situation is unacceptable.  The cost of energy prices has gone through the roof.  The cost of home rental has forced people back to couch-surfing, particularly students.  People can no longer afford to live in the city of Dublin.  Today, I spoke to people who work in Leinster House who simply cannot afford to live within a radius of 20 to 30 miles and that is the reality.  Childcare fees have gone through the roof and cost as much as another mortgage.  None of those facts are new to anybody in here and it is certainly not new to anybody in Leinster House.</p> <p>One could be forgiven for thinking that the opposite side of the House, that is, the Members supporting the coalition Government who tabled this motion - and I welcome this opportunity to debate the motion - were not in government.  They are in government and the Minister's party has been in government for a very substantial time.

As that is the reality, we must be realistic.  The coalition has been too slow to respond to the soaring fuel and food costs and we need a mini-budget.</p> <p>I wish to convey some messages.  Before the Oireachtas goes off on its long holidays, I expect a mini-budget to happen.  We need to look at VAT and excise cuts on energy and fuel.  We need to address the issues of women who could not get up this morning or yesterday morning.  One woman rang my office today to say that she rises up every hour to turn her 14-year-old who suffers from scoliosis and he has waited years for treatment.  That is the reality.  Hundreds of people have contacted our offices to complain that they cannot get support from the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.</p> <p>As the Minister will know, the Low Pay Commission made 18 recommendations concerning a progressive living wage, which is important.  The T&aacute;naiste issued a statement in the last few days saying that a living wage would be phased in over a number of years but that is too late.  Quite frankly, it is bit rich to suggest that people can wait for a few years for a living wage to be phased in when politicians in this House and in the Lower House are exceptionally well paid.</p> <p>My key message is as follows.  I urge the Minister not to forget that she is in government and that her party presided over all of these issues, so now to suggest that things will happen is wrong.  She has been in power and has not delivered for the people or on these issues so something needs to be done.  </p> <p>Finally, I hope that common sense will prevail and a mini-budget is introduced before the Houses embark on the summer recess because that is needed.  Either there is a crisis that must be tackled urgently or there is not.  I thank Fine Gael for this Private Members' time because it has given me an opportunity to voice some of the concerns of the people who struggle day in, day out without sufficient financial resources.</p></speech>

The Minister&rsquo;s party has tabled an important motion because we all know, especially in recent weeks, that the cost of living has increased.  I believe that we must go back to basics and ensure that the people on the margins are looked after, namely, the most vulnerable, who are people who have a fixed income from the State or receive pension or unemployment benefits or a disability allowance and who do not have an opportunity to see huge increases in their incomes.</p> <p>The amount of money that people spend on fuel is a huge proportion of the income that vulnerable people get from the State and, therefore, we must revise the fuel allowance.  I do not think that the fuel allowance should just be provided for a short or certain period in the year.  I believe that the fuel allowance should be available throughout the year and at different times because electricity bills are high at other times apart from Christmas time when the weather is really cold, and families must pay their electricity bills throughout the year.  The fuel allowance needs to be directed at the people on the margins who are in receipt of an income that will not increase.</p> <p>We must consider helping families as they now face extreme financial challenges.  I concur with what colleagues have said about exorbitant childcare costs as I have two children in a cr&egrave;che.  Sometimes childcare costs as much as three times one's mortgage.  People have called for core funding to be increased.  Many of us in this Chamber have called for childcare to be brought back into the education system and for the State to properly provide it to help families, and women.  I mention women because if people cannot afford to pay for childcare, then ultimately it is down to women a lot of the time to stay at home and mind their children.  It is the careers of women, therefore, that are put at risk.</p> <p>On interest rates, while I acknowledge this matter does not come under the remit of the Minister's Department, I must stress that it is very hard to change a mortgage.  Many people have a mortgage with a variable interest rate and they will be crucified financially because it is not easy to switch mortgages due to a lack of financial instruments plus the system is archaic.  Therefore, I believe that people should be provided with support to switch their mortgage and get a fixed lower interest rate because it is predicted that interest rates will increase over the next two to five years, which will have knock-on effect on mortgage repayments.</p> <p>We also must assist the people on the margins who are facing and will face massive fuel costs in the next while.  I am sure that all of us have texted pictures of our diesel bills to family members and friends declaring how much it cost to fill a fuel tank and that it cost nearly twice as much as this time last year.  The soaring fuel costs are unbelievable.  To help anyone who relies on transport for their jobs and families who do a lot of transportation we should cut VAT and excise duties in order to give some comfort to families and give a little back.    </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the Chamber and welcome this opportunity to have a conversation on the cost of living.  There are some aspects of the motion that merit discussion and consideration.  I am not sure that reducing income tax is the best way to achieve a reduction in childcare costs or medical bills.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we reduce income tax at the same time, that would be difficult because if you reduce income tax, it costs more to do that and you do not have as much money to spend on the other things you would like to do.  It is difficult to marry the two in the one budget.</p><p>At this time the focus must be on measures such as reducing the cost of childcare and dealing with the cost of fuel for families.  As Minister for Rural and Community Affairs, Deputy Humphreys will be aware that those hit hardest by the cost of fuel are those living in rural Ireland who must travel to get to work.  In my own area of Mayo, it is quite common to travel, even within the county, from Belmullet or Achill into Castlebar.  You could be talking about an hour each way to get to work.  It is quite common for people in Castlebar and Ballina to go to Sligo and Galway for work five days a week because many of these people are working in healthcare or in factories.  The cost for people to get to work in rural Ireland, which would be under the Minister's brief, is considerable and is putting those families under considerable pressure.  A particular measure targeted at those living in rural Ireland going to work faced with that challenge of fuel prices would be certainly welcome.</p><p>I note the motion says to reduce the fees for college.  I would advocate for a more targeted approach.  There are people in this country who are paying college fees and who can well afford to do so but then there are families that cannot afford college.  It is not only college fees.  It is the cost of accommodation, food, bills and everything that goes along with that.  I would much rather see a targeted approach to education where we target the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant, expand the grant, put more funding into that so that those who need assistance to get to college actually receive it and those who do not need it do not get it, because we do not have enough to do all of these things.  A targeted approach would be preferable.</p><p>The same applies with healthcare.  Previously, there were plans within the Minister's party to have universal healthcare.  We want to make sure that we have access to healthcare for everybody.  Access is not equal across the country.  There are those who cannot afford to access a doctor who are making the call on a daily basis that they cannot afford the &euro;50 or &euro;60 to go to their GP.  On the other hand, there are people who can well afford to pay and are quite happy to pay.  I favour a more targeted approach to address and focus on those members of society who are genuinely struggling with the cost of living because not everybody is struggling the same way.  Everyone is feeling it but some can afford to pay and some cannot.</p><p>I am very much in support of retaining the public transport reductions.  That was a good initiative that was brought forward.  The Green Party has been calling for that for a long time but we are all on the same page now that by reducing the cost of public transport one will reduce the number of people in their cars, reduce emissions etc.  That is a positive.</p><p>I would have considerable concern around looking to reduce taxes at a time when we cannot afford to do it and about certain measures, in terms of healthcare, childcare and education, that are not targeted at those who need them most.  Those measures merit further discussion and consideration.</p><p>As I said, the cost of living is the number one issue that we are all dealing with.  We may disagree on the best way to deal with it but we all accept that it is the burning issue, the key issue of the day and we all want to do something about it.</p></speech>

We have a motion from Fine Gael much of which, essentially, involves the party congratulating itself on the great job it has done on the cost of living before going on then to declare the additional help that we need next January.  It is June.</p> <p>There was a lady on national radio the other evening, a number of Senators may have heard her, called Tracy, who came on to tell people how she had been affected by the cost-of-living crisis, how she had gone three to four weeks without buying her shopping and how unexpected car repairs meant she was not able to buy food.  The public transport system does not get her to where she needs to go and she needs her car.  She cannot work because of a lack of affordable childcare but also because she has health issues that would hinder her employment opportunities.  Right now, she is relying on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, friends and family for help.</p> <p>Fine Gael's message this evening is the Government will talk to the people in January.  We need a mini-budget now.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling it for months.  I cannot believe that on top of missing that call and congratulating themselves on the wonderful job they are doing, they went out yesterday with this nonsense about a 30% tax rate.  They have heard the figures from my colleague here already.  The health system is in crisis.  My colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, in Limerick, knows well the crisis at first hand in University Hospital Limerick.  Maybe my colleagues in Fine Gael would like to go down to the emergency department tomorrow and canvas views for tax cuts as patients languish on trolleys for 15 hours at a time.  When we have almost 1 million people waiting on hospital waiting lists, Fine Gael's priority, how it wanted to rebrand itself, is as if to say, "Look at us, we are the tax-cutting party."  Are they so out of touch with the crisis in the public services?</p> <p>If the Minister does not want to go to University Hospital Limerick, I would invite her to go in front of the homeless action team's offices where we have no emergency accommodation whatsoever in the midst of the worst housing crisis in the history of the State created by her party.  Fine Gael talks about housing as if it is some kind of natural disaster.  "Isn't it awful", they say, "Why don't we pull on the green jersey and all try and help?"  It is not a natural disaster.  It is the result of incredibly poor policies over the past decade which have created this housing crisis.  The Minister's message this evening to the thousands of people on housing lists across the country is the Government will give them tax cuts, as if that will fix anything.</p> <p>I might invite the Minister to come to our village in Castleconnell and talk to people paying &euro;1,400 in rent each and every month.  My party has proposed a cut in their rent and a ban on rent increases to give people back money in their pockets, not next January but now, because they are hurting now because they cannot afford their bills and because the cost of diesel, already heading towards &euro;2.20 a litre, apparently will be at &euro;2.50 a litre by the summer, and yet, before the Minister goes off on holidays, the message from Fine Gael is that there is no problem here, the Government will have a budget in October and it will look at the matter in January.</p> <p>Looking at the nonsense proposal of a 30% tax rate, an economist described it to me yesterday as "fiscal incontinence".  That is what it is.  We have a fiscal window of &euro;1.5 billion and Fine Gael's proposal costs &euro;1.7 billion.  Fine Gael wants to be all things to all people but the fact of the matter is for ten years the party has failed on housing.  For ten years, it failed on healthcare.  The evidence is there in the hospital wards and in the waiting trolleys in Limerick.</p> <p>We have the lowest proportion of first-time buyers of houses in Dublin - down to 30%.  The Government is failing in so many respects in terms of public services and then the Minister talks about hard choices.  Is the hard choice to introduce tax cuts for the already well-off while we have people languishing and suffering each day?  Is the Minister that out of touch with what is happening in the country today?</p> <p>If the Government wants to make hard choices, here is a suggestion.  Why not start by scrapping the special assignee relief programme which gives millions of euro in taxpayers' money to millionaire executives in the country?  Clearly, that is a step too far.  That is a hard choice that Fine Gael will not make.</p> <p>This is all about rebranding Fine Gael back to basics.  It is the Irish Tory party or Thatcherite party that likes to promise tax cuts while it abandons public services.  The housing crisis is getting worse, month on month and year on year.  Last week, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage could not even commit to reducing the number of homeless to under 10,000 by the end of the year but, not to worry, there will be budget measures in January and tax cuts.</p> <p>Seriously, people are at the end of their tethers.  We had a housing meeting the other night full to the rafters in Limerick and heard horror stories.  One man is living basically in a space for furniture - one of those places where one puts one's furniture when one is between houses.  That is where he was.  The emergency people had nowhere to send them and the Minister wants to talk about tax cuts.</p> <p>Fine Gael has had ten years to sort out these problems.  It is no wonder that we only had six minutes from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party is nowhere to be seen.  I do not blame them.  They are clearly embarrassed to be associated with this.  They know what is going on here.  Fine Gael decides to rebranding the party as a tax-cutting party, but at whose expense?  Fine Gael has failed this country in terms of housing, in terms of homelessness, in terms of healthcare and in terms of basic fairness and justice and its members have the gall to come in and talk about tax cuts for the wealthy again.  People are seeing through this Fine Gael Government.  They are out of touch and, please God, soon they will be out of time.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Labour Party has put down an amendment to the motion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we have an opportunity to discuss this cost-of-living crisis but it is also important to contextualise it.  Last week, we heard representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, talk about the vulnerability of corporate tax revenues.  We also heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, ruling out a second budget and telling people that the cost-of-living crisis is not necessarily an urgent issue now and that they can wait until the winter.  Our Government is also targeting a surplus in the public finances for next year.  Therefore, I must ask the proposers of this motion if they really believe they can pull off tax cuts as well as the wish list of expenditure increases they are also calling for in this motion?  Do they really believe they can put an extra few euro in the pockets of middle- and higher-income earners and yet do all the other things they are seeking to do in this motion as well?  </p><p>I was struck by the pre-budget submission issued by the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises, ISME, association.  It called for a levy on incomes over &euro;100,000.  Fine Gael and this Government have resisted higher taxes not on those with middle incomes but on the high-paid for many years.  This is a measure that the Labour Party and other parties of the left have been calling for.  Now ISME is calling for it as well.  Therefore, I would like to hear the Minister's response on this point.  Certainly, however, if the Labour Party were given the choice, we would want to prioritise investment in public services.  We do not believe that the State can afford tax cuts now.  </p><p>The reality for all those on my right here is that this is not a new cost-of-living crisis.  We have a permanent cost-of-living crisis.  The sooner we see this as a permanent issue requiring permanent solutions and not once-off measures, the better.  For example, when the housing assistance payment, HAP, was introduced, it was thought that it would only last a few short years.  Now, however, the State is spending &euro;1 billion annually, and this amount is growing, because we cannot wean ourselves off the dependence on private landlords.  Let us also consider the response to energy costs.  We know from research undertaken by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, that the difference in the energy costs between a house with a building energy rating, BER, of F compared with one with a BER rating of B is &euro;3,500 annually.  We are not going to fix this situation by giving &euro;200 to people or with any miserly increases in the fuel allowance or anything else.  We must retrofit those houses so that the cost of fuelling the energy requirements of them is resolved for long into the future.  Yet the national retrofitting scheme requires households to stump up at least 20%, or more, of the cost, especially those households that do not qualify for the fuel allowance.  Therefore, the Government needs to get real about retrofitting.  It must see this as a public good.  I see no reference to retrofitting in this motion.  </p><p>We talk about the cost of childcare as well.  The Minister talked about employment being the best way out of poverty.  We have two Bills before the Houses now.  One is the Right to Flexible Work Bill 2022 and the other is legislation on work-life balance.  We know the benefit to be derived from allowing women to have flexible and remote working arrangements.  We saw this during the pandemic because the number of women in employment increased.  We saw that women were able to take up full-time work because they had those arrangements.  Yet this Government is insisting that the right to request flexible and remote work is a perk of employment and that people must be in a job for six months before they are entitled to avail of it.  What message does this send out to lone parents and to women who wish to take up employment?  It is one thing to say we want more women in employment and that we wish to reduce the number of women and families in poverty, but on the other hand the Government is not undertaking the simple measures of allowing women to take up flexible work from day one of employment.  I hand over to my colleague, Senator Wall, now.  </p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House.  The reality is that we all know that more and more families are hurting and finding it difficult to make ends meet.  They are turning to us, and other public representatives, in greater numbers to assist them in finding answers to the demands the cost of living is putting on them.  Normally, the country's favourite topic of conversation is the weather, but now that has been replaced by the cost of petrol, diesel, food and maybe even daring to book a night away.  The conversations happening in my clinics are about how families will be able to afford the costs associated with children going back to school in the autumn.  Many of these conversations are with people who themselves never thought they would enter such a clinic in their lives.  The overriding reality is that these problems exist now.  Fuel prices are hitting home now and choices are being made now about this week's shopping.  It may already be too late to make the decision about having a holiday with the children.</p> <p>I recently met representatives of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Barnardos.  Listening to them, the messages from both groups were the same.  Their services are stretched to the limit.  We need Government intervention now.  We need the mini-budget that the Labour Party has called for.  It will be too late in three and a half months' time.  This is a simple fact of life for the people I deal with day in, day out.  This is the simple fact impacting so many people now.  This situation requires Government intervention.  As has been called for by other Members, a mini-budget is needed now. </p></speech>

This is exactly what this motion is seeking to do.  It is about looking after the proposers' own.  I support it, however, because for me it is about assisting with whatever supports I can and doing whatever I can do in my power to support people.  The Minister knows we talk a lot in this House about putting money into people's pockets.  None of us are looking to do that so that people will have money in their pockets to spend on a night out or anything like that.  We are seeking to put food on people's tables.  We are aiming to support people and to enable them to have light and heating.  I stress this point.</p> <p>I genuinely believe that this Government believes it is doing everything it can in its power for the people.  For most people in political parties, though not all, this shows how disconnected they are from ordinary people on the ground.  For example, my colleague, Senator Kyne, used terms like getting up early in the morning, paying your taxes and all that old language we heard four years ago from the then Taoiseach and now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  I think that was for a party campaign.  We have moved on from then.  Ultimately, people need supports and we should be exploring having a mini-budget to help the very poor people in my communities.  I understand that type of situation is not very visible to many people in this House.  I live it and I see it.  There is a meeting this evening at 8 p.m. in Ballyfermot to discuss the cost of living.  Equally, as my colleague, Senator Chambers, also highlighted, having a car in rural Ireland is not a luxury.  It is a must-have for people to be able to get from A to B, even though many places, like Ardara, County Donegal, now have bus services.  Unfortunately, those schedules are limited in the context of allowing people to go to hospital appointments, jobs etc.  I highlight this aspect as well.</p> <p>In common with many Members, I met representatives of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, today.  The union has four simple requests for education in future.  One of them is a no-brainer and it should be brought in as part of the next budget plan.  I refer to supporting and funding schools 100% instead of 80%.  That would take a great deal of pressure off the ordinary working parent.  I support the Government's consideration of phasing out the minimum wage.  We all welcome that here.  Four years is the time being considered for this phasing out, but four years is a long time for people struggling.  We must examine this issue.  It was also noted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, that a decision has been taken in Germany to increase the minimum wage from &euro;9.82 to &euro;12 from 1 October.  Why are we not looking at these issues with the same urgency?  We seem to get many of our ideas from other European countries.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Why can we not take a leaf of the Germany's book with regard to the minimum wage?  This is important.  Something the Government is really missing is getting out and speaking to the people and knowing what is going on.  I hear people on the street saying that they went to Penneys this month with child benefit for two or three children and were out by more than &euro;300.  This is an awful lot of money.  People really have to choose between putting on the light or feeding the children.  They are genuinely struggling.  The Government could do an awful lot more if the political will were there.  We have to lose the idea of putting money into people's pockets.  We are not looking to put money into people's pockets.  What we are looking to do is put food on their tables and support them.  It is as simple as that.  What we are doing now is not working . I support Fine Gael's motion which is about supporting people.  It is a step in a positive direction but the Government is well out of touch.</p></speech>

We would swear listening to some of my colleagues on the left today that the motion seeks to divide Irish society.  I am minded by something Senator Flynn has just said about needing to look after our own.  The privilege of my career to date has been to be the Minister for Social Protection for four years, which is the role the Minister is privileged to hold today.  As a co-drafter of the motion, I know it leads with the fact we need to secure a comprehensive welfare package to ensure all of those people on the single fixed income they receive from the State are well protected from the increase in the cost of living.  I will also make no apologies for recognising that we have a squeezed middle.  If we do not recognise that they cannot afford the cost of living increases that have happened in this country in the past six to nine months, they will become the new vulnerable group because they will not be able to afford their household outgoings.  We will end up calling them the new working poor.</p> <p>I make no apologies for looking for the bands of the social services supported through subsidies to be extended to include people earning between &euro;30,000 and &euro;60,000 a year.  The subsidies I am looking to have extended by the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance include the child subsidy scheme.  We know it has a band rate of between &euro;26,000 and &euro;60,000 at present.  Those earning &euro;26,000 get a sizeable portion of their childcare fees paid.  As we go up the band to earnings of &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 and even &euro;60,000, people tell us the cumbersome access to the support grants almost negates the ability of the amount of money they get to have any impact on their childcare costs.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, spoke about the cost of education.  We want to decrease the cost of the fees in universities.  The Minister with responsibility for further and higher education said this here this morning.  More importantly we want to wider the access for SUSI grants.  People who earn a decent wage of &euro;40,000 and pay an enormous whack in tax are precluded from accessing SUSI grants.</p> <p>We want to look at the cost of healthcare.  In the most recent budget it was welcome that prescription charges were reduced from &euro;120 to &euro;80.  I believe we can go further.  We need to look at parking charges in hospitals.  I call for the 20% reduction in transport fees and costs introduced several weeks ago to be made permanent.</p> <p>This motion is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I know he has been asked by the leaders of the coalition parties to look at this.  It demands that we seriously look at introducing a 30% tax rate.  For years we have been speaking about the fact that people pay 40% at &euro;36,000, which is far too early.  This could only be called an average wage at this stage.  It is far too early to be paying 40% in tax.  I know that every year we try to protect people from any increases they might get in their salaries by widening the PRSI and USC bands but I have to say that is not good enough.  We need to seriously think about doing this over the coming years.</p> <p>I know this would not be cheap.  Introducing a 30% band at the same rate as the 40% is paid this year could cost anything up to &euro;1.5 billion per year over the coming years.  We are in the lucky position of having more people working in the State than we ever had in our history.  Those working people who go out early in the morning to work long and hard days struggle with the cost of living the same as everybody else on a fixed income.  We need to make sure they know that we value the fact that work pays better.  Right now it absolutely does not.  If we do not do something serious, such as introduce a 30% tax rate next year or in the coming years, and indicate how the roadmap would be made out, we will be at next to nothing because we have been speaking about it for far too long.</p> <p>I absolutely believe it is the responsibility of the Government to respond to the needs of its people in a sustainable and comprehensible way and this will happen through the budget.  I make a call publicly here that I made privately at our meeting earlier.  We cannot wait until October or January to recognise that petrol at &euro;2.25 a litre in my local petrol station is absolutely unsustainable even for the people the left would call wealthy.  It is not acceptable that the Government does not respond through a financial resolution.  It must be done sooner rather than later.  It is very difficult to justify that the Government's tax take on the increased petrol prices has gone through the roof while everybody is struggling.  Everybody knows that the costs of petrol, diesel and green diesel have gone through the roof.  We need to respond now.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for coming and for her responses to date.  I acknowledge the response from the Government, particularly from the Minister, with regard to the fuel allowance in recent months.  It recognises that people need help.  They need help more with regard to their energy costs.  The change to the PSO levy announced yesterday is a welcome change.  We need to see changes in the price of petrol and diesel in our forecourts and we need to see them now.</p></speech>

That is its narrative.  My only motivation in politics is to represent people and to be a voice to bring change to improve the quality of life and enhance the lives of people.  Families throughout the world are demanding action of their governments and not only here in Ireland.  I want to make a point to the oil companies.  I ask them to reduce their prices.  Our economy is recovering from Covid at one level.  We are near full employment.  Businesses cannot get people to work.  There are notices in many outlets looking for staff.  Unfortunately an illegal war in Ukraine, rising energy costs and rising food prices are having a profound impact.  I repeat my call to the oil companies to reduce their prices.  This is a time of global crisis.

I find it interesting to talk of narratives.  Let us talk about the Fine Gael narrative.  We hear Ministers and spokespeople talking about GDP, the fastest growing economy in the European Union and full employment, but the reality is that one might as well be the emperor strutting around naked because the emperor has no clothes.  We are not living in an economy; we are living in a society, and people have been struggling for years under this Fine Gael Government.  The costs of housing and childcare are not just new realities for people because they have long been a millstone around families' necks, that is, if they can even get a house or childcare place.  The pandemic and war in Ukraine have of course exacerbated the problem and caused energy and food prices to skyrocket.  Families are now choosing between heating and eating, but they were doing that a couple of years ago.  I did a survey and the respondents told me they were going down lanes to pick up sticks off the road and sleeping in the one room.  Elderly people were going to bed during the day to keep warm.  Therefore, it is not just down to the pandemic or the war in Ukraine.  Nobody is saying the Government has a magic wand or can help every single household but it could do an awful lot more.</p> <p>The energy poverty strategy lapsed in 2019.  Since I came into this House, I have repeatedly asked the Minister where the new energy poverty strategy is and about prioritising people who are struggling to heat their homes.  The truth is that energy poverty is not a priority for the Government.  We do not have the energy poverty strategy, nor do we have the data on households to determine how many are in energy poverty and what their energy expenditure is.  We have been asking for these data for two years but still do not have them.  The retrofitting scheme cannot even be assessed for its social impact because we do not have the data.  Without them, the retrofitting programme, as it stands, is a wealth transfer.</p> <p>The cost-of-living crisis we are experiencing indicates how catastrophic life has been for people after ten years of Fine Gael in government.  The list of failures, including in respect of housing, healthcare, childcare and the cost of energy, goes on and on.  It is interesting to see that, even now, it has got to the point where even the President feels he needs to say something.  He is right.  What he said yesterday was profound: a republic is about meeting its people's needs.  We have a housing disaster.  It has long since stopped being a crisis; it is a disaster.</p> <p>Budget 2021 did nothing for renters.  Not a single measure was put in place for renters to address one of the biggest crises in the country.  Sinn F&eacute;in would put one month's rent back in the pockets of hard-pressed renters and ensure no rent increases for three years.  Fine Gael says it cannot be done.  It will not even test it in the courts.  It would rather see people made homeless.</p> <p>For those lucky enough to find a place for their child, childcare is a second mortgage.  Again, we were told to bring forward proposals.  Sinn F&eacute;in has fully costed proposals that would immediately reduce the cost of childcare for hard-pressed families.  We see childcare as an essential public service.</p> <p>We have also repeatedly called for an increase in the working-age social welfare rates.  Sinn F&eacute;in called for a living wage long before any other parties were talking about it.  It also called for the establishment of a discretionary fund of &euro;15 million to assist households with utility debts, which the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Social Justice Ireland have also been calling for.  Workers and families can take no more.  An increasing number of people are falling through the cracks.  It is long beyond the point where we need the mini-budget.  We need a comprehensive package of measures.  People are desperate.  Others have said that we are hearing tonight from Fine Gael that the people will just have to wait it out until October.  Even then, the measures in the budget will not come into effect until the new year.  Rather than bringing forward a mini-budget with targeted measures and a comprehensive package to help people who are struggling today, the T&aacute;naiste is kite-flying income-tax breaks.  Tonight, Fine Gael Senators are doing the same.  We are hearing them use the same old tired dog-whistle tropes about the people who get up early in the morning.  The full cost of the measure proposed is &euro;1.7 billion, it has been said.  That exceeds the Government's planned budget package of &euro;1.5 billion for all new measures, leaving no funding available for hospital waiting lists, childcare, social welfare increases, further support regarding fuel prices, school class sizes, public transport measures and further education measures, or anything else.  Is that the Fine Gael policy?  Is the policy a grave threat to public services, with no more public services and just a tax break for some workers?  That is it.  As my colleague Senator Gavan has said, that is Thatcherism 101.</p> <p>Every single public service in this country is creaking at the seams.  The war in Ukraine has brought this into clear focus because we now have refugees sleeping on the floors of hotels.  We do not have hotel rooms for tourists because we are housing our homeless and refugees in hotel rooms.  Children are living in pain and older people are cold and going hungry.  I urge my Fine Gael colleagues to rethink their approach.  All they are offering is the equivalent of a price of coffee to some workers.  Instead, they could be investing in genuine public services and targeted cost-of-living measures for those who are struggling the most.</p></speech>

In fact, Ireland and the rest of the world are facing a cost-of-living crisis.  It is driven by inflation, which is largely caused by factors beyond our control.  Sinn F&eacute;in is criticising and asking what Fine Gael has done.  It is demanding social welfare increases.  The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, made over &euro;500 million available in the last budget for social welfare increases.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a &euro;5 increase in the social welfare working-age payments and pensions.  Sinn F&eacute;in is demanding the price of home heating oil be reduced.  The Minister brought in increases of 55% in the fuel allowance up to an average of &euro;1,139 for the 2021-2022 fuel season.  Sinn F&eacute;in is demanding the minimum wage be increased.  The minimum wage has been increased, most recently by 30 cent, and this has taken it up to &euro;10.50.  Only today the T&aacute;naiste spoke about bringing it up to the living wage of over &euro;12.  As Senator Boylan just said, Sinn F&eacute;in is looking for a discretionary fund of &euro;15 million to help households with utility bills.  She should fact-check and look up that there is a scheme in place brought in by the Minister's Department of &euro;45.75 million, which is available for exceptional and urgent needs.  Households can go to their community welfare officer and look for help with their bills.  That fund is there.  The Senator must not be advising her constituents of it and maybe we will let them know about that today.  Furthermore, by decreasing taxes you increase people's take-home pay for those in the squeezed middle, who are those paying for most of the benefits Sinn F&eacute;in is looking to provide.</p><p>I support this motion.  I support Senator Doherty's proposals on petrol and diesel.  That change needs to be brought in now; we cannot wait until October.  Fine Gael, as a party in government, has looked after the people through Covid and will look after the people through this period of high costs of living.</p></speech>

This is a great debate.  We have debated this issue up and down and the Minister will hear more before the evening is out.  I am sure the Departments of the Ministers for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform are looking in at what is being debated here as well.</p> <p>What has happened over the last ten or 12 years is unprecedented.  We have had the crash, the pandemic and now the war.  This is happening not just in Ireland but right across the world.  There is a scarcity of commodities caused by various things from the war to the pandemic.  Work ceased in many places with the result that there was no production.  You can see it in semiconductors for cars.  There is scarcity of cars because there is a scarcity of semiconductors, batteries and battery parts.  That is why the price of rented cars is so high.  There is a scarcity of many things right around the world.  It is a perfect storm and in many ways, in many areas and in nearly every country in the world, everybody is suffering.</p> <p>I fully support the motion put down this evening.  It is a good motion and one that has allowed every party here debate what has happened.  Over the last number of years Governments have pumped more than &euro;50 billion into the economy.  They have done some great things.  It is unbelievable what Governments have done over the last number of years.  That is why the country is going so well at the moment.  We have full employment.  Why is this?  We have full employment because Governments have managed things well.  They have borrowed money and pumped it into various sectors and areas in the economy.  These are the taxes that are coming back that can help everybody.  Look back at what has happened over the last ten or 12 years, as I said.  Senator Gavan quoted an economist earlier on.  Those same economists said back in 2011 that we had to take money out of the economy and that we had to run down banks.  He quoted them as referring to financial incontinence.</p></speech>

That is what they said.  Now they say we should pump money into it.  Pumping the money into it has paid off when you look at what has happened.  People's salaries had been reduced.  Everything was reduced.  Social welfare was reduced.  Hospital services were reduced.  However, all of those have been expanded over the last number of years.  When you talk to people and employers they compliment Governments on what they have done and the hard decisions they had to make and will have to make.</p> <p>I agree with the motion that we need some action in certain areas that have been outlined and it should be over the next number of weeks, in particular.  Transport is very costly, as is the cost of fuel.  Those areas have been highlighted here and I have no doubt the Minister will take those on board and that the Government will act on those issues in the very near future.</p></speech>

It is interesting when we talk about widening who we are targeting with supports to people who have so-called good salaries that we are shamed for it by some people in this House.  We must focus on our ongoing fundamental responsibility to those who are suffering the most, namely, those in and at risk of poverty and people who are surviving, barely surviving or not surviving.  However, we must also look at people who are struggling now more than ever and those are not people who are well-off.  They are people on the margins and the squeezed middle.  They pay a large proportion of income tax but are earning too much to qualify for State supports and are paying hand over fist for essential services and goods.  I agree the best response from Government is to reduce costs in a structured  way to reduce burdens and bills on families.</p> <p>I want to talk about childcare and the need to increase subsidies but we must look at supply.  A short-term measure there is to look at community childcare.  The Minister is doing such great work in rural Ireland.  There is phenomenal and transformational change in rural Ireland and suburban villages could also benefit from hubs and community childcare that enables people to live and work locally and bring more people into employment.</p> <p>One thing I wish to especially focus on is that recently the Government approved legislation that will remove the existing statutory inpatient charge of &euro;80 per night for all children aged under 16 years across public hospitals.  I bring to the Minister's attention the children's urgent care centres.  These are new care centres.  There is one in Connolly Hospital.  Until recently it operated from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  It now operates Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  That is something I called for for a long time.  I have had incidents with the kids on Saturdays and Sundays when they are at matches.  For children aged up 16 years there is a levy of &euro;75 to use that urgent care centre.  I again reference the families who are on such a tight budget, are on the margins or are in the squeezed middle.  This is one of the things that can push them over the edge.  We cannot allow that to stop emergency care or urgent care for children.  We should scrap the levies at children's emergency rooms and also in those urgent care centres.</p></speech>

A Chathaoirligh Gn&iacute;omhaigh, when I came to the Seanad people told me how much better it was here than in the D&aacute;il because there was a higher quality of debate.  That has not been the case this evening and I have been very disappointed with the tone of this debate.  It has been reduced, instead of focusing on the issue in the motion, to political mud-slinging and point-scoring.</p> <p>I do not accept that the Government is out of touch.  Every one of us lives in our community, talks to our neighbours and people in our area and seeks to help them all the time.  I have the privilege as well, in my professional work, to deal with people across Dublin and the problems they have.  Nobody is as in touch as we are in terms of dealing with people and I reject the notion we are not.  As for party records, I will stand over the record of Fine Gael, its history and its record in government, especially over the last number of years, seven days a week before I stand over the record of Sinn F&eacute;in given the criminality it has defended across this island and the violence and intimidation it has wreaked in communities throughout the island.  I will not be lectured by Sinn F&eacute;in on that kind of thing.  The negativity its members project would suggest that this country is somehow a basket case when in fact if you look at the record of this Government, it has defended ordinary citizens.  We are not talking about the wealthy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are talking about people in average income brackets.

I will not apologise for saying that we should be putting in place a package of measures to ensure that those people who collectively pay the bulk of tax can continue to go to work.  We must continue to make it worth their while to go to work so they can bring home money to feed their families and pay their expenses as we all would like to do. </p></speech>

As a Government party and one that aspires to be a responsible party of Government, we have to stand over the commitments we make.  We cannot simply come here with a shopping list and say "you should do X, Y and Z" without any attempt to explain how we are actually going to pay for it or justify how it could be delivered.  When criticism was made of other speakers, they were shouted down.  Senator Gavan has intervened possibly in every speech since that happened.</p></speech>

He seems to think that the solution to the best funded health service in Europe is to put in good money after bad when in fact it is a management issue.  Of course there is legitimate criticism to be made across this country.  The difference is that Fine Gael, instead of trying to score points, is looking for solutions, trying to tweak things to make life easier for those who are working and trying to deliver for their families.  That is what this motion is about.  If the Opposition Senators looked at what is being proposed here, they would realise it is actually a compassionate attempt to make life easier for people, not the opposite.</p></speech>

We are trying to flag key issues that need to be addressed while taking into consideration the global issues we have seen, particularly in the last three years when we have seen a pandemic that has affected the world.  In Ireland we put nearly &euro;50 billion into the economy to keep it going over that period.  That gives an indication of what support the Government put in place to support our society.  We have seen a massive war that we thought we would never again see in Europe.  That has had a significant impact on commodity prices.  We have put forward this motion to try to deal with the cost-of-living issues that have arisen because of those core issues and the inflation that is taking place at the moment.  Curbing inflation is an important issue for Fine Gael and the Government.  We need to come up with logical and fair proposals that are going to benefit society.  The motion goes an awful long way to help with that.  I am disappointed by the political games being played here tonight, which are just appalling.  This is about putting forward a platform of help and support for the people of our country so they can move forward.  There are key issues.  Fuel has been mentioned, the price of which is nearly out of our control.  We need to look at those core issues and put a plan in place to deal with the fuel crisis at the pump and the fuel crisis that the agriculture sector is experiencing at the moment.  It is under exceptional pressure.</p> <p>Childcare is a massive issue for us a society and as a Government.  It is important that we put a strategic plan in place to help all our society when it comes to childcare.  I am the father of four kids and we know exactly the issues pertaining.  We have four children in primary school at the moment and it is a significant burden and cost we are bearing.  We know have to work through with the help of family and other supports.  The motion is about bringing support and help to the people and putting a platform in place such that when it comes to budget time, the measures will help our people to move forward in that struggle.  That is why the motion is so important and I support it.</p></speech>

I support the motion as it is a very serious response to a grave crisis.  It struck me when my good friend, Senator Boylan, was speaking that I thought I was listening to an extract from <i>An B&eacute;al Bocht</i>by Myles na gCopaleen in the first chunk of her speech.  To deliver the list of suggestions she had, we might need to add buttons to the calculator to get the figures all combined together.</p><p>We have a very serious set of important propositions here.  I wish to address a couple of them and commend them to the House as worthy of particular attention.  The tax cuts to assist the squeezed middle - those on low incomes from, say, &euro;20,000 to &euro;60,000 - are proposed because if people in this bracket, who are under awful pressure, get a small pay increase under Building Momentum or under the current agreements, they will end up paying income tax, USC and PRSI to the extent that they will erode their wages.  Hence the logic of the tax cuts for these people.  They are targeted at people who need them.  Welfare increases for pensioners are very important.  These are people who suffer particularly from fuel poverty and they need attention.  The idea of a lower cost of education through reducing student contributions and increasing eligibility for student grants is very important.  A lot of parents suffer here and it is about equality of opportunity.</p><p>Reducing the cost of healthcare is another commendable suggestion.  We have made massive strides in this area but much more needs to be done.  The motion is extraordinarily well crafted in that we have the increase in the cost rental and affordable housing schemes.  That is an initiative that is very badly needed.  Making the reductions in transport costs permanent is also very important.  In Virginia, County Cavan, the N3 route to Dublin is very well used.  Buses on the hour are packed.  People who use that route tell me that the reduced fare has meant so much to them.  Those are practical solutions that can be implemented.</p><p>I agree with the Leader of the House on an immediate intervention in the area of fuel.  This is an issue in the constituency I share with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I commend her on her recent initiative on access to pensions and on the carer's allowance being made available to a wider range of people.  In the area we represent, there is effectively no public transport for people who work in factories and low-paid jobs around those counties.  They do not have the rail network or buses.  They need to have cars and fuel is a major prohibition there.  It is a great motion.  I hope that it will get the unanimous and fulsome support of the House and that people will see it as a good start to solving a very difficult crisis.</p></speech>

Every single one of us in these Houses is being contacted all the time by constituents who believe the cost of a basic standard of living is becoming more and more difficult to meet.  That reality is felt right across the country.  I and no doubt the Acting Chairman are hearing it all the time in south Kildare.  The cost of living has an impact on the quality of life that somebody has in a material sense and in terms of mental health.  The stress on any family from the pressures of paying rent or paying a mortgage while also trying to ensure that the family home is heated and the family has enough food is massive.</p> <p>A recent poll showed that 72% of people understood that a lot of the increased cost of living is down to the war in Ukraine.  There is no doubt that the illegal, brutal and outrageous war waged by a tyrannical dictator has sent global energy prices and inflation rates to completely unsustainable levels which we have not seen in decades.  It is having a deeply negative impact on all of us on this island.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We certainly need to have a summit to bring stakeholders together to try to create a consensus across society about how best we can cope with these unprecedented economic developments.  We need to have a social dialogue and a prioritising of the particular spending that means most to people.  We need to develop an inclusive process to look at the causes, consequences and implications of inflation.</p><p>The fact is that no government anywhere across the globe can completely insulate its people from the realities of such an inflationary cycle, and no party in these Houses can honestly state that they would be able to do that.  It is fair to say that the Government has responded to what is another unprecedented situation.  To say otherwise is completely disingenuous.  Some &euro;2.4 billion has already been allocated in the context of measures to cushion the impact of the rising cost of living.  This is a very significant amount of money.  For people to say that the Government has not responded in any way is, as I have said, completely disingenuous.</p><p>Should we do more?  Yes.  Can we do more?  Yes, I firmly believe that we can.  We need to look at very specific areas at which we can target that funding.  Many of us would, for example, have had the opportunity to meet with representatives from the INTO earlier.  Ensuring that children have the opportunity to go to school, to be warm and to have the capacity to have a hot meal while there is very important.  We still have the voluntary contribution - which we know is not voluntary - in so many schools.  The capitation grant should be increased and the voluntary contribution should be scrapped.</p><p>The State should be providing both free school books and support in respect of the purchase of school uniforms.  Children who grow up in households where there is a toxicity of stress are very negatively impacted.  Research has shown that children who live in homes that are affected by anxiety, stress and pressure about finances and the family having enough money to support itself in a sustainable way are greatly affected.  We need to be able to put enough supports in place where we can, and that includes in the context of education.</p><p>I acknowledge that the Government increased the weekly fuel allowance rate and made an additional lump-sum payment in March, along with a special &euro;100 payment to 370,000 households that receive the fuel allowance.  This has been very important.  We should be able to do more in this regard.</p><p>I also acknowledge that there has been a 20% reduction in public transport fares and a 50% reduction in such fares for young people, which is of great importance too.  It is important that we do more in that regard, particularly in places like Kildare.  When one gets past Sallins in north Kildare, the cost of travel increases exponentially.</p><p>The fuel allowance, which was increased last October's budget, is very important.  Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal was not to increase the fuel allowance at all in the budget.  It is important to put that clearly on the record.</p><p>Inflation has increased dramatically all over the world.  The difference between some Opposition parties and the Government is that we are doing something concrete and substantial about it.</p><p>I want to raise the issue of profiteering.  There is no doubt that some operators have engaged in a level of price gouging that is adding to the impact of inflation.  I say to those businesses to remember that the State and the taxpayers&rsquo; money kept their doors open during the pandemic and to remember who will keep them open in the longer term, namely, the Irish people.</p></speech>

I know of her personal commitment to ensuring that the most vulnerable in society are cushioned as much as possible.  That has been very clearly articulated by the decisions she has made as Minister, especially in the area of the fuel allowance, which has been increased by 45% in the past year to 18 months.  That is significant.  It is true that the Government is taking in more money now in excise duty because of the increased cost of fuel, but that is funding the increase in the fuel allowance the Department of Social Protection has provided.  I have no doubt that the Minister is keeping the situation under review and that if further interventions are needed, they will be made.</p> <p>I support the motion, which is very much in tune with what people are feeling and suffering.  They are suffering because bills are going up left, right and centre.  All one has to do now is purchase a basket of shopping and one will notice that the prices have increased.  This motion will start a conversation within politics but also within Government on what needs to be done.</p> <p>This is a tripartite Government.  Fine Gael will outline its position on how it believes we can help people, the most vulnerable, the stretched middle and the people who are on the margins.  We will try our very best to influence the budget process in order to ensure that what has been articulated here this evening as a result of this excellent motion becomes a reality.  It will become a reality because we will use the budgetary process as best we can to ensure that the Fine Gael watermark, which is to help, protect and support the people who are struggling, working and supporting this country and who have made it what it is and who will make it will be in the future, is evident.</p></speech>

This Government is one for every citizen of our country.  Fine Gael is a party that is fighting for all in our society, including the most vulnerable.  The Government and our country have welcomed more than 35,000 people from Ukraine, mainly women and children.  We are a country which, through a pandemic and a lockdown, introduced unprecedented supports that were brought forward by the Leader of the House in her previous role.  Those supports have resulted in the highest ever number of people in employment in Ireland.</p> <p>I represent an area of Roscommon and east Galway that has pockets of deprivation where we have fought for DEIS funding.  Now, one in four schools, and nearly 240,000 children, will benefit from additional supports.  Families will have these extra supports through education.  The Minister&rsquo;s Department is providing hot meals to these schoolchildren.</p> <p>It is crucial that the average income in this country should be in the &euro;40,000 bracket.  It is important that we know that these people and families can live through this period of inflation.  They are no longer able to deliver for and to support their families in the way they could a number of years ago.  With so many people back at work, we are in a position to ensure that all families will benefit from the supports the Government has been able to offer.</p></speech>

I will put this in a way that the people who are in the squeezed middle have been described to me recently, namely, those who feel that they have to pay for everything and have nothing left.  They have their monthly income.  They then have their mortgage and childcare - which amounts to a second mortgage - to pay for.  As a result of what has happened in the past six months, they have the equivalent of a third mortgage to pay as a result of the increase in the cost of living.  This is not sustainable for the people I know in Tipperary.  They cannot manage, have no money left at the end of the month and they need support.  We have done this so far, and we need to do more in the next budget.</p> <p>I agree with the proposals that have been put forward on what needs to be done to tackle the cost of living and the price of fuel.  The latter is a significant issue for Tipperary.  Most importantly, and I know this as the father of a young child, childcare is a matter that can be tackled.  We can have a real impact on people's expenditure every month by taking action in respect of childcare.  The Minister is committed to making real and positive changes.  She is in Cabinet to make changes in respect of childcare.  This will impact all of those families with children who are working night and day just to repay their mortgages and pay for childcare and for diesel just to get to work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=15"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is not a situation that people want to be in.

I welcome the Minister's commitment and that of the Government in respect of the motion.  Many things have been outlined, including in respect of the cost of childcare and of fuel.  It is the squeezed middle, as well as lower paid workers, that is affected.  That is the kernel of the debate.  There has been overwhelming support for the motion and Members have made positive contributions.  It was put forward in good faith to try to help families that are really feeling the pinch.  There has been much bashing from our colleagues on the left.  I am sure that sense will prevail and that they will see that the motion is trying to deliver for the most vulnerable in society.  This is a genuine motion from the heart by all the Fine Gael Senators here tonight.  That is why we put it forward.</p> <p>As the Minister stated, now is the time to have a discussion.  It is incumbent on all Departments to come together to see what they can do to deliver for these families.  Many have referred to the Minister's Department and everything it has done to provide payments and the supports that were put in place for families especially during the pandemic.  Nobody foresaw that the war would cause all this pain.  It is not something that will disappear overnight.  There has to be a more structured solution.  The Minister said that.  We need to look at short-, medium-, and long-term responses and at key measures that will alleviate the pain of families on lower and middle incomes.  Every family and citizen deserves a degree of certainty.  The Government has done a lot.  Many things that need to happen have been highlighted.</p> <p>The motion has, more or less, majority support.  It is appreciated that the Government is willing to take it on board.  I look forward, as we all do, to working with the different Departments and making meaningful contributions or suggestions as to where we see these cuts and supports happening in the context of families.</p></speech>

and substitute the following: <br /><br />&ldquo;notes that:   	- the annual rate of inflation in Ireland has risen significantly reaching 7.8% in May, the highest in over thirty-eight years;<br /><br />- the rise in inflation is being driven by increased costs for electricity, home heating oil and gas, higher rents, housing costs and mortgage payments, and rising prices for food and fuel;<br /><br />- the National Minimum Wage only increased by 30 cent or 3% in January which is well below the current rate of inflation;<br /><br />- the &euro;5 increase in weekly social welfare rates in Budget 2022 is not enough to keep pace with rising prices resulting in a real cut in living standards for those on fixed incomes;<br /><br />- the Department of Finance reported a record tax take for 2021, with VAT alone raising &euro;3 billion more than 2020, and &euro;1 billion ahead of projections;<br /><br />- the Irish Congress of Trade Unions issued guidance in December to private sector unions that they should seek pay increases in the range of 2.5 to 4.5 % in 2022;<br /><br />- Ireland is the most expensive country in the EU for housing costs with record rents, the highest mortgage interest rates in Europe, and a chronic lack of supply that caused house prices to increase by 15.2% in the year to March 2022; recognises that:  	- the soaring costs of food, heating, fuel and housing is causing real hardship and putting more people at risk of poverty;<br /><br />- VAT is a tax on consumption which disproportionately impacts on the less well-off, and rising prices in particular on energy and fuel is resulting in a VAT windfall to the State;<br /><br />- rising prices will cost some households an additional &euro;1,300 this year on their gas and electricity bills after prices rose by over 27% in 2021, amongst the highest in the European Union, while petrol and diesel fuels rose by 33.7%, with petrol prices rising above &euro;2 per litre across the country in June 2022;<br /><br />- increased economic growth, global supply concerns, and the situation in Ukraine will influence future fuel price rises; <br /><br />- the proposed &euro;100 off energy bills is tokenistic, not enough for those who need it, and poorly targeted;<br /><br />- measures to control rents have failed with annual average increases nationally of 5.3% over the last decade, the most recent RTB report showed a 9% increase on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of 2021, while rents in Dublin are now more than 40% above pre-crisis levels;<br /><br />- the average Irish mortgage interest rate of 2.79% is more than twice the EU average of 1.31% costing households over &euro;2,000 a year with no action to date from Government to bring this down;<br /><br />- Ireland has the second highest OECD household spend on childcare costs, with couples spending an average of 24% of income and single parents spending 29% of their wages on childcare costs;<br /><br />- despite the constitutional commitment to free education parents and guardians pay significant out-of-pocket costs to send their children to school;<br /><br />- since the publication of Sl&aacute;intecare in 2017 progress on the abolition of patient charges and the rollout of free GP care is taking too long; acknowledges that:  	- the failure to act on the cost of living crisis in a whole-of-Government way will further reduce the living standards of millions of Irish people and condemn more people to poverty and homelessness;<br /><br />- the key factors impacting the rising cost of living are within the regulatory and fiscal control of Government; calls on the Government to:  	- urgently take a whole-of-Government approach to tackling the soaring cost of living;<br /><br />- introduce an immediate rent freeze and a roadmap to reduce Irish mortgage interest rates to the EU average;<br /><br />- provide an emergency energy costs relief package for households which should include a temporary time limited reduction in the VAT rate on energy and fuel up until the next Budget, and for the Minister for Finance to seek an EU derogation to allow for the long-term retention of the historic 13.5% rate on electricity and gas after such a temporary VAT cut expires;<br /><br />- introduce additional targeted supports for those in energy poverty by widening access to the fuel allowance, and commit to the introduction of a refundable carbon tax credit for low-income households to support the long-term phasing out of fossil fuels;<br /><br />- support pay increases for workers across the economy in line with the rising cost of living; <br /><br />- legislate to enhance collective and sectoral bargaining laws and frameworks to ensure that working people obtain a fairer share of the wealth they create; <br /><br />- transform the national minimum wage to a living wage;<br /><br />- provide for increases in social welfare payments linked to the rate of inflation, with a long-term commitment to bring weekly rates up to the minimum essential standard of living;<br /><br />- introduce a windfall levy on excessive profits made in the energy, transport, housing and food sectors due to rising prices;<br /><br />- take comprehensive action to make education free, introduce a universal public childcare model, bring forward the cap on childcare fees, and accelerate the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare;<br /><br />- meet any additional costs of living with Covid-19 through 2022 including the proactive provision of antigen tests and FFP2 and medical grade face masks.&rdquo;
