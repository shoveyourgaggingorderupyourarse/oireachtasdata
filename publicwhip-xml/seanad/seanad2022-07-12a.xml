It is a most important issue in south Kildare and, indeed, right around the country.  I thank the Minister of State for attending today's debate.  I have been contacted frequently by people in south Kildare who are entitled to dental services under the terms of the medical card scheme, but who cannot avail of the services due to a lack of provision in the area.  I understand the people in south Kildare are not on their own.  It is happening right across the country.  We all know the pain and difficulty that a dental problem causes, whether it is a toothache, a broken tooth or an issue with dental braces.  I have a dental problem at the moment.  I must say that my dentist has been very patient with me making appointments and changing them because of commitments in Leinster House.  Generally, dental problems are very time sensitive.  When something needs to be done, it needs to be done very quickly to help alleviate the pain that a person is experiencing.  That is simply not happening in my area.  Last month, we heard reports of dentists flooding out of the State's medical card scheme, leaving older people and those in low-income households without access to basic oral healthcare.</p> <p>The figures from the start of the year show that only 660 dentists across the country have been actively treating medical card patients.  There is a particular problem with dentists retiring.  New dentists are coming in to take over the practices and many of them decide not to support their patients who have medical cards.  It is a real problem.  The number of contracted dentists is down significantly from 1,660 in 2017.  We have lost 1,000 contracted dentists since then.  We should bear in mind that during the two years of Covid, people suffered in silence, in many cases.  Now they are trying to get the treatment they need.  The demand for dental services is the same as it was in 2017, if not increased.  At the same time, there has been a reduction in provision.  This is leading to unacceptable waiting times.  Indeed, the waiting times have no end for the patients who cannot access a dentist.  When dentists drop out of the scheme, the HSE is trying to squeeze patients back into an already-overcrowded system, leading to even longer delays.  I know that in response to a parliamentary question the Department of Health stated that the situation is regrettable and has led to difficulties.  I ask the Minister of State whether she has any insight into why dentist are leaving the scheme.  What can be done in the intervening months to see the situation improved?  I understand that in April &euro;26 million was put into the scheme.  That is certainly very welcome, but it does not seem to have alleviated the problem.</p> <p>Dental organisations have called for the current medical card scheme to be replaced with a voucher scheme.  I understand that the Irish Dental Association has highlighted that dentists want a new scheme that reflects modern dental practice.  We have to listen to them and negotiate with them.  We must ensure that a plan is put in place to allow vulnerable groups to access routine dental care in their community.  The announcement of increases in the fees of contracted dentists and the reintroduction of cleaning services under the scheme were both welcome and positive steps.  </p> <p>I wish to highlight the case of a young man with autism who I know.  His dentist has opted out of the scheme.  His mum has contacted 20 different dental practices and cannot get him into any of them.  It is wrong.  The young man has complex additional needs and relies heavily on his parents.  He is in absolute agony and his mum feels helpless in supporting him.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the plans in place to support the people in south Kildare with medical cards and an entitlement to dental care, but who cannot access that service at present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#B00100"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  I thank Senator O'Loughlin for the opportunity to address the issue of dental services for medical card holders in south Kildare.  I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.</p> <p>Dental treatment for medical card holders aged 16 and over is provided under the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS.  Services available annually have included an examination, two fillings and emergency extractions.  More complex care and a broader range of treatments for patients with special needs and high-risk patients is also provided, some of which requires prior approval. </p> <p>Both the Minister and the Government have been concerned for some time that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services.  In local health office 6, which covers Kildare and west Wicklow, the numbers of private dentists who held a contract with the HSE to provide services to medical card holders stood at 58 in December 2019.  This fell to 41 in December 2021 and the current figure is 38 dentists. </p> <p>To address this issue, the Minister secured an additional &euro;10 million in budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental healthcare for medical card holders, including the reintroduction of scale and polish, and the expansion of the oral health examination to emphasise preventative measures in line with the Healthy Ireland policy approach. </p> <p>To address the concerns of contractors about the scheme, the Minister is using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year&rsquo;s Estimate allocation of &euro;56 million to award fee increases across a number of items, including fillings.  The combination of these two measures represents an estimated additional investment of &euro;26 million in the scheme this year over and above what was spent on the scheme in 2021, which was &euro;40 million.  Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1 May.  The Minister hopes that this significant additional investment in the scheme will attract more dentists to treat medical card patients, including in south Kildare.  In the longer term, the retention of dentists within the scheme will be examined.  The Minister has been assured by the HSE that their local services on the ground will assist any persons who are still experiencing problems in accessing a service. </p> <p>The Minister is aware that contractors are looking for more substantive reform of the dental treatment services scheme in the longer term.  This concern is recognised and it is the Minister&rsquo;s intention that this is addressed in the context of the implementation of the national oral health policy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, which sets out a body of substantial reform of dental services.  Work is under way within the Department of Health to design a governance framework to oversee and facilitate root and branch reform of the provision of dental services in Ireland, including the dental treatment services scheme.  The chief dental officer in the Department is already engaging with stakeholders on this issue and I understand that she will meet representatives of the Irish Dental Association shortly.</p> <p>It is very important also to recognise the point the Senator mentioned at the end of her contribution in respect of people with additional needs and the story of that lady having to ring 20 dentists in her area.  While I would like to state she is alone and unique, she is not.  Unfortunately, the number of calls which are coming into my office replicate exactly what the Senator is saying.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is putting added investment into the sector but it does not seem to be replicated down to the delivery of service, which is a quite disappointing point.</p> <p>Any of us who have had dental pain will equate it to labour, as there is nothing quite like it, to be honest.  It is not right in this day and age that we should leave people to suffer.  The funding is there and goodwill is being extended from the Department of Health and from the Minister.  It is time now for the Irish Dental Association to engage and to reciprocate that.</p></speech>

I will be contacting my local HSE office this afternoon and I will return with to the House with its response on this.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the Department has pledged a root and branch review of the dental treatment services and to align the scheme with the national oral health policy.  This must be expedited and we need to get a timeline and to see a new approach to the provision of dental services in this country.  The Minister of State has acknowledged the concerns that exist and that this will be addressed in the context of the implementation of the national oral health policy but what does that implementation mean on the ground?  When are we going to see a difference?</p> <p>I also note the Minister of State has talked about a governance framework to oversee and facilitate this.  All of this is very good, as is the fact that the chief dental officer is meeting the stakeholders but we need timelines in this regard because people simply cannot wait.  People on low incomes who are having problems cannot wait.</p> <p>In a final point, one dentist with whom I spoke and who has patients on the medical card scheme is now being inundated with new patients.  He told me he cannot take the new patients although he is completely happy to support those patients he already has.  He said, however, that if there is pressure on somebody like him, he will have to opt out of this scheme too.  That is where the problems are in respect of the existing 38 dentists the Minister of State was talking about, which is that they cannot take new patients on.</p></speech>

The Minister has listened to colleagues across the Chamber and I can assure them that the Minister appreciates the difficulties experienced by people accessing healthcare and is providing solutions.  As I have mentioned, additional funding has been provided to resolve the current problems of access to the dental treatment services scheme.  However, the Minister and the Government recognise that the current model of provision of oral healthcare is in need of fundamental reform and that has been acknowledged.</p> <p>Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the national oral health policy provides the guiding principles aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare to transform our current oral healthcare services over the next eight years.  This, however, is far too long a time frame.  We need the here and now, that is: the short-term, medium-term and long-term measures.  With the meeting of the dental officer from the Department of Health, the HSE, in conjunction with the representative bodies, perhaps we can address the timelines the Senator has spoken to because when a person is in pain, one needs immediate action and not to be wondering about reform.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy English, is very welcome.  I wish to raise today the issue of the lack of home school community liaison co-ordinators in County Longford, and in particular, in the various towns in that county.  The scheme was set up to improve the educational outcomes of children through supporting both their parents and their guardians.</p> <p>I will give a brief outline here of the number of schools and of the number of co-ordinators in County Longford, namely, St. Joseph's National School, Longford town, St. Michael's National School, Templemichael College, a post-primary school, Scoil Eimear, a primary school, Gaelscoil an Longfoirt, Ballymahon Vocational School, Lanesboro Community College, The Sacred Heart Primary School, Granard and Ardscoil Ph&aacute;draig, Granard.  In total, our allocation for the 2022-23 year is six positions.  Some of those are actually shared positions with other schools and in the case of two schools, one is shared with a school in Cavan and the other with a school in Roscommon.  There is a total of 2,600 pupils in those schools at present.  On foot of the recent announcements on and review of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme earlier this year, a number of other schools have come in under this scheme, namely, St. Mel's College Longford, Me&aacute;n Scoil Mhuire, Longford, St. Mary's National School, Edgeworthstown and St. John's National School, Longford town.  This is an addition of another nearly 1,600 pupils into the system.</p> <p>Based on the existing figures and those numbers in the secondary and primary schools on the old list, Longford should have a total of ten full-time positions to be able to cater for those schools.  One of the schools has 534 pupils and just one such position.  Moreover, 60% of the school population is non-Irish and it has 30 different nationalities.  Among the schools in the county which are covered under DEIS, there is an absenteeism rate of between 18% and 20%.  The six home school liaison co-ordinators in place are working extremely hard.  I know them all personally.  I know the individual schools and I have met these co-ordinators but they are at a crisis point and need support.  The reality is that we need to increase the numbers we have.  We have 407 pupils in Ballymahon Vocational School, which is sharing a position with Roscommon Community College.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we do not get the necessary intervention that is needed in education and get our kids to school, what will we pay in the long run?  Education is key.  I gave the figures of 18% to 20%, which, if the Department looks at them, are probably the highest in the country.  The only way we are going to address them is by increasing the staff we have in place.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to please consider increasing the numbers for September 2022 and giving support to the home school liaison co-ordinators who are working extremely hard in the schools in County Longford to make sure we increase the number of children we have in our schools.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#C00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairperson.  As ever, it is great to be here.</p> <p>I thank Senator Carrigy for tabling this important matter for discussion today.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Foley, who is not here because she is at a Cabinet meeting.  She asked me to take this matter on her behalf.  I will certainly make sure she gets the message and also the figures and statistics the Senator presented.</p> <p>As Senator Carrigy will be aware, DEIS is the main policy instrument of the Department of Education to tackle educational disadvantage at school level, which is done through the DEIS programme.  On March 9 last, the Minister for Education announced a major expansion of the DEIS programme.  This will add an additional &euro;32 million to the Department&rsquo;s expenditure on the programme from 2023, bringing the total 2023 allocation to approximately &euro;180 million.</p> <p>One of the supports available under DEIS is access to the home school community liaison, HSCL, scheme.  The HSCL scheme seeks to establish partnership and collaboration between parents, teachers and the community in the interests of education.  The HSCL scheme aims to help parents to engage in their children&rsquo;s education and build parents' capacity so that they are enabled to support and contribute to their children&rsquo;s successful experience in the education system.</p> <p>Currently, all DEIS urban primary and DEIS post-primary schools are included in the HSCL scheme.  Under the DEIS programme, the HSCL scheme is delivered by 528 full-time HSCL co-ordinators who are teachers in these schools and assigned to HSCL duties either in individual schools or clusters of schools.  The HSCL co-ordinator posts are full-time posts.  Some of the posts are allocated on a shared basis between a number of DEIS schools in cluster groups and these posts can be shared across the two sectors both at primary and post-primary level.  This is an arrangement that happens nationally with all HSCLs and takes into account the relative disadvantage across schools.</p> <p>The Department of Education has received representations from the schools in County Longford mentioned by Senator Carrigy today and has responded accordingly.  The Department is open to making modifications to the current clusters in place if it is proven to be in the best interests of the schools involved and if all the parties are in agreement.  This could be done within the existing current cohort of HSCLs already allocated in County Longford.  As it stands, there are no further resources at present to extend the HSCL allocations such that each school would receive a full post.</p> <p>The Department is committed to supporting schools to deliver high-quality inclusive teaching and learning to students and young learners and has already indicated that it is open to engagement on the matter outlined with regard to the arrangements between individual schools.  Any further expansion of the HSCL scheme to allocate additional posts could only be considered in the context of further budgetary allocations.  The Senator made the point that they need to be allocated for September.  That is probably part of the budget negotiations that will bring us into the end of September, however.  I will certainly make that case to the Minister and the Department.  In the meantime, they could work with that cohort and come up with some arrangements in that regard.  The Senator made a strong case that Longford would need extra resources.  I will certainly make sure that message is brought back.</p></speech>

I do not think it can be a case of reconfiguring the existing cohort of staff that we have.  The reality of that would mean a reduction in the staff or the number of hours for a particular school.  Those schools were allocated those positions for a reason, which is the high absenteeism rate.  I ask the Minister of State to bring back to the Minister the request for a review of all counties to see where the absenteeism rate is at a high level and aim the resources there.  That is what needs to happen.  As I said, we have a particular difficulty with regard to getting kids into school.  In the long run, it will cost us an awful lot more money.  The Minister of State made a point about future budgetary allocations.  If we do not deal with this now, we will be spending money in other areas, be it justice or wherever, in the future.  As I said, the staff we have in place are working well and working within the resources they have to keep the figure to 18% or 20%.  That can be decreased if we get in more staff.  As I said, it will cost the State less in the long run.</p></speech>

He is absolutely right to identify that it is important that we try to tackle absenteeism and focus our resources as much as we possibly can on those who are missing school days or in difficult situations.  That said, it is fair to say that some areas of the whole programme need extra resource levels.  The Senator made that point extremely well.  I will certainly bring it back to the Minister and ask that she takes a county-by-county review of where this needs to be targeted individually.  I thank the Senator for raising this Commencement matter.  I will certainly make sure the Minister gets the massage.  She apologises that she could not be here as she is tied up at the Cabinet meeting.  The Department of Education and Tusla education support services will work with the schools involved on how the shared posts are allocated across the schools.  To be very clear to the Senator, the Department is open to engagement in this regard.  I will make sure it follows up on the matter.  The point has been well made that those extra resources are needed.</p></speech>

For what it is worth, I completely agree with Senator Carrigy.  Every single school should have a home school liaison teacher assigned.  It is one of the best schemes that has ever been brought into Irish education at both primary and post-primary level.  It really benefits the whole school community.</p></speech>

I hope I will get a very favourable answer due to the fact he is from County Meath and knows the area.</p><p>Figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, clearly show that our population has increased by almost 13% over recent years.  The development of new houses, along with the granting of planning permissions in our area and the surrounding areas, shows that another secondary school is needed.  Almost 400 Ukrainians have settled in our area over the last couple of months.  All this increase is leading to a demand for a new secondary school in our area.</p><p>Not only do we have a need for a new school, but we also have the land available to build it.  In 2005, the then Bishop of Meath tried to rezone lands owned by the community and St. Finian's Diocesan Trust.  That was the only piece of community land we had for the provision of community facilities and educational facilities.  Thankfully, I tabled a motion at the time to the effect that this land would not be rezoned,  Hence, we have 27 acres there ready to go.  The bishop kindly said that if the Department of Education wants that land for the provision of a secondary school, it is there for the Department to negotiate with the trust.  There is very good access to the site on Station Road from which cars and buses could enter.  Bus access could also come in from the business park and pedestrian access could also go in from the main street.</p><p>In 2018, the Department decided it was going to build a secondary school.  We thought we were going to get it in Duleek because the need was clearly there.  Unfortunately, it went over to the Grange Rath-Mornington area.  There was nothing we could do about it.  It was an Educate Together school.  We did not win the vote at that time.  Clearly, however, our population has increased since then.</p><p>We have 12 feeder schools, namely, Duleek Boys National School, Duleek Girls National School, Scoil Cholmcille Mount Hanover, Bellewstown National School, Cushinstown National School, St. Patrick's National School in Ardcath, Donore National School, Knockcommon National School, Kentstown National School, Rathfeigh National School, Skryne National School and Yellow Furze National School.  In addition, there is an option for children to come from Whitecross National School or even from Slane or Curragha.  The options available at this time are in Drogheda, Laytown, Navan, Ashbourne and Grange Rath.</p><p>We have talk about creating a green environment.  We are talking about giving kids the option to cycle or walk to school.  We do not have that option in Duleek.  Some of our children must leave for school and be picked up at 7.25 a.m.  Indeed, one Facebook comment read as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	Will never forget when I was going to St. Oliver's.  My bus picked me up at 7.25 and I'd be in school for 8 o'clock.  School not starting 'til 9 then finished at 3.30 and didn't get off bus till 10 to 5 coming home.  How I wish Duleek had a secondary school.  [Hopefully we will see it] before my kids have to go to secondary [school]. </blockquote> <p>Building a school within walking distance is really important if we want to cut emissions from cars and buses and give children a healthier lifestyle.  I am hoping to get a favourable answer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I spoke to the Taoiseach when he was briefing Senators in the House last year and getting a secondary school for Duleek was one of my key priorities.  There is a need for it and I hope the Minister of State will give some hope this morning that the Department will consider it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#D00200"><p>I thank Senator Keogan for the opportunity to have this conversation.  I assure the Senator that I do not want to upend the Taoiseach, as he is a higher authority than me, but I will try to give the Senator as positive a reply as possible.  It is important that we are discussing education when there are seven young students in the Visitors Gallery from County Meath.  A lot of them like cycling bicycles to school even though they are all in primary school.  It is great to have them here.  We have a teacher from St. Patrick's as well, so it is an important time to talk about education in Meath.  It is under pressure.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Foley, sends her apologies that she could not be here as she is at a Cabinet meeting.  She is very committed to making sure that schools are in the right place at the right time.  That is the issue being raised by the Senator regarding the position in Duleek, County Meath, and the need for a new school there to cater for the number of students in Duleek and the surrounding areas.  I think the Senator mentioned most of the townlands.  It shows the significance of the pressure in that growing area.  The census will record a greatly increased population in Meath East as well, which would be served by the school the Senator mentioned.</p> <p>To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, GIS, using data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, the Department gathers up-to-date information on significant new residential developments in each local authority area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.  Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets also inform the Department&rsquo;s projections of school place requirements.  The Department&rsquo;s use of GIS additionally facilitates the identification of more localised pressure points within an overall school planning area.  As in the area of Duleek, it can focus on what is happening in a small area as well.</p> <p>Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools, which happened back 2018 and 2019 in this area; or provision of a new school or schools.</p> <p>Duleek is in the Drogheda school planning area and, as the Senator is aware, based on previous demographic analysis a new-post primary school to serve the Drogheda and Laytown school planning areas, Drogheda Educate Together Secondary School, was established in 2019 and a project to provide a new school building to accommodate 1,000 pupils and four classrooms for pupils with special educational needs is in train.  The Department is also providing significant capital funding at other post-primary schools in the Drogheda school planning area, including extension projects at St. Oliver&rsquo;s Community College, Sacred Heart Secondary School, St. Mary&rsquo;s Diocesan School and St. Joseph&rsquo;s CBS.</p> <p>In respect of the Senator&rsquo;s reference to the preliminary census 2022 results, the Department has noted this information and looks forward to further elaboration from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on these in 2023, including with regard to the age profile of the population which is of relevance in respect of children of schoolgoing age.  The Department&rsquo;s most recent demographic analysis from 2021 indicates that current and planned post-primary provision in the Drogheda school planning area is sufficient to meet the projected requirement for school places.  However, a refreshed process is currently under way for 2022 and will have regard to updated information concerning school enrolments, population statistics and planned additional housing, as well as enrolment of Ukrainian children and existing capacity in schools.  The Senator mentioned that over 400 Ukrainian children have entered schools so it is important that this is captured in the data as well.  School place requirements in the Drogheda school planning area, and specifically in the Duleek area, will continue to be kept under review, informed by this updated information.</p> <p>I am familiar with the area of Duleek and the county generally, so I totally understand the pressure on the education system when it comes to numbers.  In addition, there is the movement of people into Drogheda, Navan and up to Dunshaughlin and Ashbourne, so the entire area is under pressure for school places.  The Senator is right to call for a review and for Duleek to be examined specifically.  In my view, it would make sense and I believe the figures might support that.  I am glad the Department is reviewing the figures and will have updated information on that, probably by this time next year for 2023, to inform decisions thereafter.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of development taking place in the south of the county towards Grangerath and Mornington.  There is a 1,000-pupil school being built there currently, but that will be filled with what is coming down the line due to population increases in that area.  I am specifically seeking a secondary school for my area.  The need and demand are there.  I am not sure if it will be a 1,000-pupil school, but certainly 500 to 600 children could use the school.  It is a 27-acre site and it could be a fabulous educational facility with all the auxiliary recreational supports for a good student life to be had on that site.  I will keep the Minister of State to his word with regard to the review.  I probably will be back here again towards the end of the year asking again and I will look forward to a more favourable response.</p></speech>

It is important that we constantly review these figures and track the population.  Having spent time as a Minister of State in the Department of Education, I understand the system it has.  It is quite good at analysing the data and the figures, but sometimes it can miss some local information as well.  It is important that we constantly have these debates to feed into that.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned the site being made available by the bishop.  I thank Bishop Deenihan, who we all know is very focused on education, for being co-operative and working with the local authorities, the Senator and others in the area to make sure that a site is possible.  That certainly makes it easier.  If the Department from its analysis of the census figures and the population trends, with the number of additional pupils coming from Ukraine and so forth added in, deems it necessary to have a new school, it is great to have a site ready.  It will also speed up the process to deliver the school.  We will know next year if it makes sense from a population point of view.  Naturally, as a local Senator, Senator Keogan makes the case that it would and naturally, as a Meath Deputy, I recognise the need for it as well.  It is to be hoped that the figures will show that too and we can get resources allocated to make it happen.</p></speech>

I am here on behalf of St. Luke's National School in Tyrrelstown which was hoping that it would be awarded DEIS - Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools - status in the review of DEIS.  It put a great deal of effort into the appeal.  I have to say I am scratching my head to see this school not being brought into the DEIS system, and I cannot express the disappointment the school is experiencing.</p> <p>DEIS supports schools and students with the highest level of concentrated educational disadvantage.  Part of the problem is that Tyrrelstown is not ranked as disadvantaged or very disadvantaged in Pobal's Haase and Pratschke, HP, deprivation index, but the pockets of affluence mask extreme poverty.  The experience on the ground with this school is poverty, deprivation and social challenges.  I have 15 reasons that the decision to bring the school into DEIS should have been supported.  It is a diverse, intercultural community.  It borders on Buzzardstown, Mulhuddart and Corduff, areas that are considered disadvantaged or very disadvantaged, and some of the school's population comes from those areas.  At times, the school has had over 90% of the school population requiring English as an additional language, EAL, support.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Every year, it appeals its staff allocation and the appeal is granted.  The school's note states that if it did not get EAL temporary posts each year, its three permanent teachers would have to cater to a ratio of 1:146 EAL pupils, an impossible task.  The school carried out a home survey of its 590 pupils and found that 7.9% were Roma, 3.6% were homeless, the families of 47.5% held medical cards and both parents of only 12.5% were employed.  This year, 85% of the school population required EAL support.  As for school attendance, 31 families had been referred to the educational welfare service for unexplained absences of more than 20 days, while 187 pupils missed more than 20 days this year, but the school does not have a home-school liaison officer.  It does not have a good level of parental involvement; in fact, it is very poor and the school has been trying to address that through integration projects.  More than 50% of the children who attend the school fail to do their homework each evening, which is essential for literacy and numeracy skills.</p><p>A home-school liaison officer would be transformational for the school.  It finds it very difficult to get the parents on board, in the context of the challenges the children face, with the help that is required such as speech and language therapy from Dyslexia Ireland, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Moreover, it is very sad that the school has a high number of referrals to the child protective services given, in the case of some of the families, corporal punishment can be the norm.  This is all outlined in the school's submission.  It operates a book-rental scheme and provides for children who come without lunches, and allows homeless families to use the school washing machine, tumble dryer and ovens.  This school is doing all the things a DEIS school would assist pupils to do, but it is doing so out of its own pocket.  I could also go on about assessments.  I do not understand why this school was not brought into DEIS.  It is a travesty.</p></speech>

The Minister for Education sends her apologies that she cannot make it to the debate because she is in Cavan today, but she would like to have been part of the discussion.</p><p>In March, she announced a major expansion of the DEIS programme, for the first time since 2017, which means eligible schools will now gain access to targeted supports to address educational disadvantage.  This is the largest ever single investment in the programme and it will extend DEIS status to schools serving the highest proportions of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.  From 2023, the Department of Education will spend in the region of &euro;180 million on the DEIS programme, an increase of &euro;32 million.  This announcement follows extensive work by the DEIS technical group to develop the refined DEIS identification model to identify the concentrated levels of disadvantage of schools.</p><p>Schools were identified for inclusion in the programme through the refined DEIS identification model, which is an objective, statistics-based model.  While I understand the model has not picked up the school the Senator raised, the model uses information from schools&rsquo; enrolment databases and 2016 national census data, as represented by the Pobal HP deprivation index.  The model takes into account the student cohort and the relative disadvantage within a given school.A detailed document outlining the refined DEIS identification model has been published on <i>gov.ie.  </i>The DEIS identification model takes into consideration the significant educational disadvantage experienced by Traveller and Roma learners and by students residing in direct provision or emergency homelessness accommodation, which the Senator raised in the context of this discussion.</p><p>Schools that were not satisfied with the outcome following the application of the DEIS identification model to their school enrolment data were provided with the opportunity to have that outcome reviewed.  Schools were also provided with the opportunity to update their details on the Department&rsquo;s enrolment databases, namely, the primary online database, POD, and the post-primary online database, P-POD, and St. Luke&rsquo;s National School submitted an appeal as part of this process.  There was no change, however, to the outcome of the DEIS status of the school.  The DEIS appeals process was applied fairly to all applicants using an objective data-based approach and the results are final. </p><p>I assure the Senator the Department of Education will continue to work to support all schools and students, including through the development of further supports for students experiencing educational disadvantage.  Much of the information will have been analysed but if the school believes something was missed, I will certainly convey that to the Minister in order that it can be included in the assessment.  The best option may be to engage directly with the Department in respect of additional supports that could be put in place to deal with all the other needs the Senator raised outside of the traditional DEIS model.  There are resources that could be applied in that regard.  I will certainly relay to the Minister that the Senator is concerned and the fact that, in light of the Senator&rsquo;s data, she is scratching her head as to why the school was not included under the process.  The Department spent many years developing that new model and I was a Minister of State at the Department during its early stages.  A great deal of work was put into it and it should capture all schools that deserve DEIS status.  In any event, I will bring the Senator's concerns to the Minister, who could not attend this debate.</p></speech>

I understand the next phase will explore the allocation of resources and that there will be an updated Pobal HP deprivation index in quarter 3 of 2023, but I do not understand why that could not have been done concurrently.  Missing this school means there is something wrong with the process.  How could there not be, given that the national average receiving a STen score of 1 in English is 2.3%, whereas the incidence in the school is 8%?  Moreover, the school absences also tell a story.  This school is stepping up and the staff are doing an incredible job.  They are stepping in with supports the State should provide.</p> <p>I will push for additional resources but, at the same time, the school needs a liaison officer and all the supports that come with DEIS status.  Anything less than that does not amount to equality of opportunity.</p></speech>

I would like him to outline the situation regarding bars and pubs throughout the country.  As background, over the past two decades before the Covid-19 pandemic, 1,500 pubs closed and hundreds more have followed during the pandemic.  The vast majority of the pub industry comprises independent pubs, small businesses and family-run operations.  Pubs do not merely serve their local communities but are a major factor in our tourism success, as has been reflected in all the research carried out.  Survey after survey shows that up to 80% of visitors to this country indicate the Irish pub is a major factor in choosing Ireland as a travel destination.  As we are aware, the Guinness Storehouse is the number one visitor attraction for tourists.</p> <p>As the Minister of State and Senators will appreciate, the tourism sector is vital to Ireland's economy.  Prior to the pandemic, it employed in the region of 260,000 people and was worth &euro;9.5 billion to the economy.  As I have noted consistently, the Irish pub was one of the main attractions cited by tourists who choose to holiday here and that needs to be recognised.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is in addition to the 40,000 staff directly employed by Irish pubs, many of them in small towns and villages right across the country.</p><p>I played my part, and the Government did offer substantial supports throughout Covid.  They played a significant part in ensuring the number of pubs that shut down was not even higher.  The new initiative to revitalise the night-time economy is also particularly welcome.  A pilot scheme to support rural pubs as community hubs, as part of Our Rural Future, is also a programme with considerable potential and it is proving very successful.</p><p>These measures are extremely welcome, but there is a major crisis and staff shortages.  During the pandemic, many qualified and extremely capable workers left the trade because they could not rely on it for their income in the way it was possible in other sectors that were not subject to the same level of restrictions.  Those two years of closures and restrictions had a devastating impact on staff retention.  It is estimated that one third of all staff departed the sector.  Before the pandemic, it was already challenging to retain and recruit quality chefs, bar managers and senior bar staff.  Many operators in the sector tell me it is next to impossible now.  Job offers remain open for months, with few if any applicants.</p><p>Figures from the two representative bodies of the trade, the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners Association show that staff shortages are a major issue for 90% of pubs.  Such is the scale of the problem, many pubs have been forced to close for two days in the early part of the week.  This means that in some areas of the country it is now challenging to get a booking for food on those nights.  That is creating a very negative image for tourists and it must be addressed urgently by the Government.  We must take measures in that regard.  In particular, as the Minister of State is aware, the work permit rules for non-EU workers must be examined.  The process must be simplified and prioritised.</p><p>The hospitality VAT rate of 9%, which is scheduled to increase next year, is something that also needs to be reviewed before any increase should even be considered.  Many pubs and all restaurants face spiralling costs for their food offerings.  Raising VAT from 9% could compound the threat to pubs and restaurants that support local producers in every part of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#F00200"><p>I thank Senator Crowe for raising this issue.  It is important that we have this discussion given the importance of pubs and restaurants in the hospitality sector, and all they do for this country.  The pub trade has been very much affected during the Covid-19 pandemic.  I thank all involved in both representative bodies for their work in assisting the Government.  I am conscious that Padraig Cribben has moved on as chief executive of the VFI, and John Clendennen is the new chief executive.  It is great to have those associations working closely with us to help us design supports and policies at difficult times, but also to try to get policy right in the long run.</p> <p>Senator Crowe is correct to raise the skills, talent and availability of staff.  I will come back to the matter at a later stage in the discussion because it is very important that we focus on developing the career path and opportunities within the pub trade and the wider hospitality sector.  Pubs are a vital component of the hospitality sector and there is a great opportunity for employment in every region throughout the country.</p> <p>I again thank Senator Crowe for raising this issue today.  I am providing a response on behalf of the Minister for Finance because he was not able to make it here due to a Cabinet meeting.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest data available on the number of publican licences issued across each turnover band is for the 2018-19 licensing period.  The reason for this is due to one of the supports the Government provided for the sector during the pandemic, namely, the licence fee waiver.  As the renewal fees were waived and no payment was required in 2020 or 2021, pub turnover data for these licensing periods is not available yet.</p> <p>While I do not have a breakdown by band for the publicans' licences, the total uptake of publican licences for 2021 shows that there has not been a significant decrease over the period.  Senator Crowe referred to a number of pubs.  In 2021 there were just over 200 fewer publican licences issued than in 2019, which was approximately a 3% reduction over the period.  I am conscious that might not capture all the changes in the system.  We all know there are some difficult situations.</p> <p>Details of the precise number of licences for the year can be made available to the Senator in tabular form.  These licence figures show that, despite the significant difficulties the sector faced in the context of a global pandemic, Government supports assisted in the vast majority of pubs surviving.  A number of supports specific to the sector were provided throughout the last two years.  I thank Senator Crowe for his work in designing those schemes, and for his efforts in this House.  We had the same discussions in the other House about trying to target supports at this sector.</p> <p>The Government introduced a support package of measures for vintners impacted by Covid-19 restrictions in August 2020, including a provision to waive excise duty for on-trade liquor licences on renewal in 2020 until 30 September 2021, which was subsequently extended to the end of September 2022, additional support for vintners under the tourism adaptation fund and a 40% top-up to the restart grant for all pubs and bars.  A Government decision in October 2021 provided for a waiver of court fees, and associated excise duty, in respect of applications for special exemption orders, which allow the sale and consumption of alcohol in licensed premises beyond normal trading hours by holders of on-licences.  The waiver covered a court fee of &euro;300, which goes to the Department of Justice and an excise duty of &euro;110, which is collected by the courts on behalf of Revenue and applied until the end of December 2021.  In January 2022, a further application of the waiver for special exemption orders for late licences was provided until 30 April 2022.</p> <p>At the outset of the pandemic, Revenue also put measures in place that allowed alcohol products, on which excise tax had been paid, but which was spoiled due to the closure of premises, to be returned to a tax warehouse.  The excise duty previously paid on the alcohol was refunded or remitted by agreement with the returning trader's local Revenue control officer.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, in May this year the Government extended the 9% VAT rate that currently applies to the tourism and hospitality sector for a further six months until 28 February 2023, at an estimated cost of &euro;250 million.  In addition to these support measures, it is worth noting that there has been no increase in excise on alcohol since 2014.  This means that excise as a percentage of the price of a pint as sold in the on-trade is at the lowest level in approximately 20 years.</p> <p>I recognise that the sector has come through a very difficult time and it will take time to get fully back up and running.  There are the added pressures of trying to deal with increased costs due to the war in Ukraine and delivery and supply chains.  Most people involved in the hospitality sector raise with me the issue of attracting staff.  I am willing to work with the various organisations in individual sectors - the education system, the Department of Social Protection and my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to try to bring forward solutions to the development of skills, upskilling and training but also to try to develop a long-term career to make the sector more attractive as well.  It is important that we do focus on that.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste co-chairs the hospitality forum with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport, Gaeltacht and Media, Deputy Martin, and they are focused on issues to develop the hospitality sector, provide supports and also the development of talents and skills.</p></speech>

He indicated that there are only 200 fewer licences, but as he alluded to, it is unclear as to whether that figure is accurate on the ground.  I ask him if his Department could furnish me with the details when they are available later in the year.</p> <p>In terms of the staff shortage crisis, could he advise if the Department will reduce the red tape associated with the visa process for non-EU citizens?  That is something that could be looked at.  From speaking to publicans, I know the challenges the staff shortages are causing during this crisis.  Simplifying the EU process for non-EU citizens is something that could have a real impact in terms of tackling the issue.  I am familiar with a case in Galway.  The Minister of State will be aware of the system.  All the details were provided, but even though we cannot get chefs, there was a line in the application process which stated that the job had to be advertised for a month nationally.  The person had to go back to the start of the process again, even though it was impossible to get a chef.  The permit situation is having an impact.  The Minister of State will be aware that in Galway there are certain top class bars and restaurants that have only 50%, 60% or 70% of their tables allocated because they do not have the resources in the kitchen.  That is causing an issue in a tourist city like Galway.</p></speech>

I will close by reminding the House of the importance the Government has placed on supporting business, including publicans, during the pandemic.  Most businesses recognise that too.  We want to support businesses and jobs, but we also recognise the pressures on the SME community when its trade was restricted.  We are aware of the importance of small businesses such as publicans and others in the hospitality sector right throughout the country in terms of creating jobs and helping us to keep 2.5 million people in work now and also in the future.</p> <p>As referenced earlier, there are no figures available for 2021 broken down by excise band, but I will provide them to Senator Crowe when we have the updates.  Unfortunately, given the nature of a pandemic such as the one we recently suffered, some closures were inevitable.  It is recorded as 200, but it is possibly slightly more.  I am thankful, as I am sure is the Senator, that the majority of the 7,000 plus pubs are still in operation, although some are open for fewer hours because of staffing issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Senator raised the issue of permits.  We have made major reforms in this regard and have trebled the number of staff available in the sector.  Last week, nearly 1,100 permits were processed.  In an equivalent week last year, fewer than 400 permits were processed.  The time taken to process a general permit has been reduced to 13 weeks from 22 weeks.  Critical skills permits take five weeks.  We will continue to focus on that.</p><p>We are trying to cut away much of the red tape.  We have made as many changes as we could in the Department under the existing legislation.  We have new teams and streamlined methods.  We engage clearly with people who submit applications.  By law, the job has to be advertised.  That is clear and well flagged, and I think most people now understand it.  Many people come to us who have missed that for some reason.  We try to deal with them too but under the legislation, the law has to be advertised.  Permits are not meant to be the first step to filling a job.  They are meant to be the last resort.  We try to source talent within the country, then in Europe and then we go beyond that.  The system responds and we have prioritised the hospitality sector at this time of year, as we did last year.  Hundreds of permits for chefs have been granted.  We will do more in the next couple of weeks.  New legislation will soon come to the House, in which we will introduce the flexibility that the system needs for the future.</p></speech>

The Senator raises an important area because there has been a significant focus on passports in the past four or five months, with much pressure on the system.  All online applications are processed in the same way.  This includes all applications from throughout Ireland, North or South.  Renewal applications, since citizenship has already been established, are generally processed with a turnaround time of ten working days for adult renewals and 15 working days for child or complex renewals regardless of where the application is made.  Therefore, there is no difference in processing time for renewal applications between those applicants with addresses in Northern Ireland or in the State.</p> <p>First-time applications are more complex regardless of where people are from due to increased complexity of documentation required to confirm the person's identity and entitlement to citizenship.  First-time applicants resident within the State must have their identify and consent forms witnessed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A log of such applications is maintained by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which allows for a streamlined verification process.  First-time passport applicants resident outside the State, including in Northern Ireland, can avail of a broad range of witnesses for this purpose.  The witnessing of these forms is a vital element of the identity verification process for the Passport Service, as it provides initial assurance that the person in the photograph is the same person who submitted the passport application form.  It is of great importance that we get that right.  In the case of an application for a minor, the witnessing of this form provides evidence that guardians give consent for a passport to be issued to the child.  In order to protect the rights of parents or guardians and children, it is important that forms are fully verified by the Passport Service by contacting the witness directly.  That is key.  One might be surprised at the number of applications that are received without the consent of parents.  That part of the work is taken seriously to make sure we get it right.</p> <p>First-time applications from outside the State, including Northern Ireland, can also be more complex due to the variety of documentation received from other jurisdictions.  Officers processing these applications must therefore be highly skilled and experienced.  The Passport Service takes its responsibility to protect the integrity of the Irish passport seriously.  The Irish passport has a strong international reputation due to the strength of the security features within the passport book and the robust processes involved in its issuance.  The Irish passport was recently ranked fifth in the Henley Passport Index as it provides our citizens with visa-free access to 187 countries.  Accordingly, a rigorous analysis process is in place to verify the identity and citizenship status of first-time applicants.  As a result, processing time for these applications can take a little longer.</p> <p>The Passport Service continues to see an increasing demand for passports from citizens in Northern Ireland.  A dedicated team has been deployed to focus solely on first-time applications from applicants resident in Northern Ireland with a view to significantly improving the turnaround times for these more complex applications.  In the past four weeks, the Passport Service has issued an average of almost 6,000 passports per day and considerable improvements can be seen across the system.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has made a significant investment in the Passport Service since last year to enhance customer service.  The Passport Service is confident that the increased resources that have been allocated will improve the service to all of our citizens regardless of their place of residence, whether in Ireland or overseas.</p></speech>

I begin by acknowledging the dedication and diligence of staff in the Passport Service and thanking them.  It has undoubtedly been a difficult and trying number of years for them.  There are a couple of encouraging points in the Minister of State's answer.  I welcome that a dedicated team has been set up and deployed to focus solely on first-time applications from the North.  It is necessary because there is a difficult, substantial backlog which needs to be cleared.  While I appreciate this is not the Minister of State's brief, he might relay this point to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Fine Gael colleagues tabled a motion in the Seanad on the Passport Service and the difficulties facing it.  I said to the Minister that the dedicated Oireachtas hub and helpline should be made available to MLAs and MPs in the North who deal with the same number of applications as us.  Having spoken to some of my MP colleagues last week, I understand that they still do not have access to that hub.  It would be a significant help to them in their day-to-day constituency work.  The Minister of State knows how problematic it can be.  A dedicated resource would be welcome.</p> <p>There is a different range of possible witnesses in the North, compared with members of the Garda as witnesses in the South.  I am regularly called by the Passport Service to verify that I have witnessed an application, which is fine.  I agree that we need to protect the robustness and security of passports.  Nevertheless, if someone submitting an application from Derry instead of Donegal causes a disparity and delay because of the nature of the witnesses, perhaps we need to look at how we can streamline and improve that service.  The Minister of State might take those points on board and relay them to his colleagues in Cabinet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#G00700"><p>I certainly will.  I will bring them back to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Colm Brophy.  The point the Senator raises about extra resources and access to the hub for our political colleagues is fair.  I will raise that because it would make sense for when applications are processing.  The arrangements in the South with members of the Garda as witnesses can cause difficulty with tracking witnesses too.  That area is being examined to see if we can improve and streamline it.  There has been a significant effort in the Passport Service to deal with the number of applications received over the past year.  The dedicated team to deal with applications from Northern Ireland should help too.  I will bring the issues the Senator raised back to the Minister.</p> <p>The Department of Foreign Affairs has made an unprecedented investment in the Passport Service over the past 12 months.  This investment in people and systems has had a considerable impact on the level of service being provided by the Passport Service.  More than 720,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022.  In comparison, a total of 634,000 passports were issued in the whole of 2021.  By the middle of the year, the Passport Service had already surpassed the total number of passports issued since last year.  We know the pressure it is under because all of us in both of these Houses deal with queries about passports through our offices every day and try to contact the Passport Service.  There is pressure on the whole system, but it is responding.  The increase in the number of people involved in the system is certainly helping.</p> <p>While 2021 was an unusual year, figures from 2019, which was the previous busiest year before the pandemic, show that the Passport Service is outperforming 2019 figures by almost 20%.  More than 570 staff have been assigned to the Passport Service since June 2021, with more than 200 new staff assigned since May of this year.  These recruitment efforts, coupled with the targeted deployment of staff to work on applications from Northern Ireland, will significantly impact the turnaround times for complex first-time applications, including those from our citizens resident in the North.  I hope that is of assistance to the Senator.</p></speech>

I wish to put two issues on the record.  At 3 p.m., on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I will launch the women's health policy.  It is a culmination of ten months of work by me, other female Oireachtas Members and councillors.  We have made over 103 recommendations, engaged with more than 30 organisations, conducted two national surveys and held a national conference on women's health.  A huge amount of work has gone into putting this policy document together.  The launch will take place at 3 p.m. in Buswells Hotel and I invite all colleagues to attend so they can hear some of the issues.</p> <p>One of the things that arose very strongly and clearly in our surveys, and at our conference, was that many women feel that they are not listened to, that they are not an equal or active partner in the provision of their healthcare, and that they are often disrespected or dismissed when it comes to raising genuine health concerns.  A huge amount of work has been done in the space of women's healthcare.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Health published the safe access zones legislation earlier today.  He has committed to providing free contraception to 17- to 25-year-olds, and that legislation is going through the House today.  He has also committed to publicly fund IVF treatment.  A great deal of work has been done by the Minister for Health in the area of women's healthcare.  I acknowledge his great work in that regard.</p> <p>Why is it important to have a women's health policy as opposed to just a general health policy?  We, as politicians, all know that policy informs everything we do in public life.  It is how we get things resourced, funded and committed to by Government.  I hope that other parties will follow suit.  Fianna F&aacute;il is the first party in the State to have a stand-alone policy on women's health.  This initiative will lead to greater investment and focus on all aspects of women healthcare, ranging from menstrual health to reproductive years, pregnancy, menopause and everything in between.  There are many aspects that must be dealt with.  I sincerely thank all of the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors who contributed and who worked with me on this policy over the past ten months.  I also thank all of my colleagues in Leinster House.  More importantly, I thank the citizens who engaged in our surveys and conference.  I thank all of the organisations that worked with us, met us as a group, and contributed so positively to the policy.  Everyone is more than welcome to join the launch of the policy document in the hotel across the road.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, along with all of his Cabinet colleagues, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, will seek approval at Cabinet to increase our defence spending from the current &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion by 2028, which is two years earlier than recommended by the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces.  I welcome increased spending, but we are still not on a par with other European countries.  We still spend far less. Our citizens want to see us do more to protect the State and its assets, and protect a lot of the companies, businesses and citizens who are here and who need protection for many reasons.  We are long overdue a discussion on the Defence Forces.  Perhaps we will have one in the autumn session when we get an opportunity in order that we can discuss the increased spending, where the money will be spent and the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces and the recommendations it made.</p></speech>

This is a very positive day for the Defence Forces.  I commend my colleague and friend, the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his pioneering work regarding the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces.  As Senator Chambers rightly said, there is a proposal to increase spending from &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.5 billion and to attract additional staff via a recruitment campaign, which will place Defence Forces on a steady and solid footing.  It is important, as we remember last weekend and the National Day of Commemoration, that we thank the men and women who serve in the Defence Forces.  We pay tribute to them.  It is important that we commend and congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his recommendation to Government and ensure that a debate on the Commission on the Future of the Defence Forces takes place in this House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the work done by the former Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, when he was in the Department.  I also recognise the advocacy and championing from former Senator Gabrielle McFadden in this House.  She was a very strong champion of the Defence Forces.  We should salute her and the work she did in being that voice for the Defence Forces.</p><p>It is a pity we cannot have this debate before the summer recess but it would be appropriate to have the Minister for Health come to the House for a debate on the risk Covid-19 still presents in our community and our workplaces.  Over the last number of weeks, Aer Lingus flights in particular have been decimated.  That is why it is important to have a debate on both health and transport.  I ask that we have a debate in the autumn before the budget, during the first week back.</p><p>The summer economic statement has been published and the budget has been brought forward to 27 September.  Today in the Lower House, a cynical motion is being brought forward by the main Opposition party.  This is a party that stands for only one thing - to divide and conquer.  If a general election were called today, we would have no budget and no cost-of-living measures for the people this party claims it wants to see looked after.  It would all be put to one side and put on the back burner.  Yet this Government has put &euro;2.4 billion on the table for those hard-pressed citizens we all know, represent and advocate for.  I hope that in the autumn we will have a debate on the budget and the summer economic statement and the import they will have for us as a country.</p><p>Today is a day to salute the men and women of our Defence Forces on the allocation of &euro;1.5 billion and the new recruitment campaign.  It is important that we stand with our men and women in the Defence Forces.  We salute them.</p></speech>

That is good.  It links into the conversation about the media.  The commission's remit was to examine Ireland's public service broadcasters, commercial broadcasters, print and online media platforms.  I ask the Leader that we have a debate on that some time in the next term.  The delivery and funding of public service media, including RT&Eacute;'s role and financing structures based on best international practice are among the issues the commission is expected to have addressed and made recommendations on.  There is some suggestion that there may be another subcommittee or commission to look at further work.  That was mentioned on the radio today.</p> <p>As we come to the end of this session and go into the summer recess, I am conscious of the fact that the public interest is served well by journalists.  It is important that journalism is secured, supported and sustained in its work.  Quality journalism allows viewers and listeners to be informed of their decisions and to know about government and social issues.  Print media, including national, provincial and local papers, remains a strong and reliable source of information and these publications are highly valued.  I make it my business every week, particularly on a Thursday, to go to the Library here and spend a few hours looking at the provincial press.  It is amazing.  We have all the provincial papers here in our Library.  You see things in print media that you do not quite pick up online.  It is a wonderful service and needs to be services.  One has to question why we are paying VAT on printed media.  All of us recognise the importance of our local and provincial print media so I ask that we look at that issue.  The public value all forms of media and communication.  Ultimately, members of the public engage with politics and decipher the political and social influences in a debate.  Newspapers should have a zero VAT rate in recognition of their unique role in our functioning democracy.  Irish newspapers contribute to the social, intellectual and political life of Ireland.  We recognise that and we need to support that.  They are the prime conveyers of news, views and opinions.  They perform a vital role in defending our democracy and our liberty, as well keeping a check on the abuse of power.  I am calling for a debate in the House on that matter.</p> <p>I also acknowledge and thank the political correspondents in Leinster House, who go up and down these corridors every day and communicate our messages.  I thank RT&Eacute;, our national broadcaster, independent radio, local and provincial radio, the national media and the press, our own Oireachtas press and media staff, our correspondence units, our technicians and our cameramen.  They are all critical components of communicating the message from Leinster House.  I salute them.  I hope that in time we will have an opportunity to discuss the work and recommendations of the commission.  It is an important debate and one we should have.</p></speech>

They are entirely appropriate and it is entirely within the right of the Opposition to move a motion of no confidence, not least when Government parties lose their majority.</p><p>On Saturday morning I had a fantastic visit to Davitts Gaelic Athletic Club, just off the Falls Road, to mark the celebrations for Eid.  It was the first large-scale outdoor celebration of Eid in the North.  It came off the back of the unfortunate arson attack carried out against the Belfast Multi-Cultural Association's centre in April of this year.  I was joined on that visit by the First Minister designate, Michelle O'Neill, the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Councillor Tina Black and the MP for the area, Paul Maskey.  It was great to see an event that was so welcoming, diverse, warm and positive coming from an incident of such intolerance and hatred.  I commend the organisers from the Belfast Multi-Cultural Association and Davitts Gaelic Athletic Club.  Whether at a venue like Davitts where hundreds of people could gather or in other iconic venues and locations like Croke Park, it is fantastic to see the GAA open up its facilities for celebrations of our diversity and all the richness and benefits that brings.  Long may it continue and more power to their elbow going forward.</p><p>We all know of the strength and leadership many of our Gaels show in communities across the country and in an ever-growing number of clubs around the world.  I welcome the Gaels le Ch&eacute;ile initiative.  Since May 2021, more than 12,000 Gaels have signed a letter calling on An Taoiseach to prepare for constitutional change.  That momentum is building and growing all the time.  I commend the Gaels involved with that initiative.  For any Gaels in this House who want to add their voice and their signature to that letter, they can do so by visiting <i>gaelslettertotaoiseach.ie</i>.  I encourage everyone and anyone to be part of that positive initiative and encourage An Taoiseach to lead the charge and fulfil his constitutional and, indeed, party poltiical obligations to ensure we have a positive conversation, plan and engagement on constitutional change.</p></speech>

I hope to be there at some stage.  It is good news from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence about the extra spending in defence over the next number of years.  One of the most important things is to ensure pay and conditions are looked after.  Military equipment is important but the men and women are number one.  I pay tribute to Senator Chambers because when we were in opposition we did a huge amount of work on this.  I am not taking from Senator Buttimer's comments.  We did a huge amount of work on this, led by Senator Chambers and her namesake, Deputy Jack Chambers, who was spokesman as well as Senator Chambers, then Deputy Lisa Chambers, at that time.  It is important that we give credit to every side in this matter.  I reiterate that the men and women of the Defence Forces, who have been neglected so badly for so many years, must be the number one priority in this review and this extra expenditure.</p></speech>

Galway is in an all-Ireland senior football final.  We wish the team well.  I am sure Senator Crowe will have more to say about that if he is here this morning.</p> <p>The Leader has been very involved in the issues schools are having in setting up special needs classes.  I have come across a huge problem with a school in Roscommon.  Everybody, including the experts dealing with the children, the teachers and the principal, have done everything they can to set up this class.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It appears as though the National Council for Special Education is just going against them.  I cannot understand it.  I will not mention the school but the Leader will know what I am talking about.  The Minister and others are trying, in a major effort, to get this matter sorted out.  We need to sort it out for parents, teachers and, most of all, those children who need special needs education. </p></speech>

That is how profitable a Dublin Airport car park could be.  That is how locked into car dependency our airport is and how vulnerable travellers are to airport car charges.  MetroLink is on the way.  Planning for it will be launched in September but it could take 12 years to complete.  Why are we not prioritising airport bus routes?  It will be 2024 before BusConnects reaches Dublin 15 and that is not good enough.  Direct airport routes need to be prioritised.</p> <p>The electrification and upgrade of the Dublin to Maynooth line under DART+ West is a vitally important project that will double frequency.  There are challenges that come with the potential closure of level crossings but no one is suggesting the project should not go ahead, so why does Irish Rail consistently run anti-public public consultations?  It ran two non-statutory consultations during level 2 and level 3 pandemic restrictions, with below par efforts on its part to adapt its communications and engagement in entirely different and difficult circumstances.  Another public consultation took place during the summer months last year.  It now looks like the statutory consultation through An Bord Plean&aacute;la will take place this summer when people are on their holidays.  Why is Irish Rail so afraid of the full potential of a public consultation?</p> <p>With the Cathaoirleach's indulgence, I wish a happy 12 July to those on this island who mark the day and do so respectfully.  Let us remember, however, it is not culture if it is being used to put others down-----</p></speech>

I wish the day to be celebrated in an appropriate manner.  As Senator Currie pointed out, when people celebrate culture, they should not try to denigrate the culture of others.  I have seen the posters and our national flag on the bonfires.  That is not celebrating anybody's culture.  I imagine that is the very opposite of what many people in the unionist community think is celebrating their culture.  Senator Currie is correct that they need to speak out to say that does not represent a celebration of culture as they would like to see it.  The more that happens, the more respect we will see when celebrations take place in both communities.  I thank the Senator for raising that issue this morning.</p></speech>

They are very welcome.</p> <p>It was early May when I asked the Leader for a debate with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on his plans to lessen the impact of rising inflation on the people of Ireland and his outlook on the global financial near future in terms of inflation and recession.  Two months on, the situation does not look any cheerier.  The price of Irish goods and services is 40% above the average of the 27 EU states while alcohol prices, due to taxation, are now twice the EU average.  Electricity costs are almost the highest in Europe.  The increasingly exclusive banking sector has charged souped-up premiums since 2008.  An Irish couple can expect to pay at least &euro;80,000 more than their European counterparts on a &euro;300,000 mortgage over 30 years.  Ordinary people are paying extraordinary prices for insurance, hotel rooms, petrol for the car, booking a flight and so many ordinary expenses.  As one newspaper put it, we have Scandinavian prices without the salaries that go with them.</p> <p>Precious few other European countries would stand for it.  If you tried to pull this with the French, there would be cars burning on the streets before we could say, "Let them eat cake."  As a country, we seem to have come to expect poor governance and poor treatment as the default.  While all this is going on, and ordinary people's problems remain unsolved, we are to play out a fantastical piece of political theatre in the D&aacute;il today with Sinn F&eacute;in's no-confidence motion, for which it knows it does not have the numbers.  Even if it did go through, everything will get put on hold and thrown out while the country spends its time and money on another general election, which no one outside of Sinn F&eacute;in wants.  Most people have no, or very little, confidence in the Government, but why do we not at least try to tackle some of the everyday problems of ordinary people instead of using them to try to get into power?</p> <p>Look at what is happening in the UK politically.  We need to be ready to absorb the shock waves from that, especially against the backdrop of Brexit.  Now is not the time for our political class to throw more turmoil into the mix.  Can we please just see what we can do to make life easier for all the people of Ireland?</p></speech>

This has come more to the fore with what we have seen of Russia's destructive acts in Ukraine.  As we are aware, Georgia has already felt the brunt of Russia's forces in recent years.  I strongly believe Georgia's accession should be dealt with in tandem with Ukraine's at present.  Georgia has done quite a lot of work in this area.  In 1996, it was part of the Interstate Oil and Gas Transportation to Europe, INOGATE, framework, which led to a five-year plan in 2006, so it is well along this road.  Earlier this year, hurdles, if that is the right word, came from EU quarters but in the case of Ukraine, we seem to have unblocked every block there can be to speed up the process.  I cannot see why Georgia cannot be dealt with in the same manner.</p> <p>It is a relevant time to have a Minister in the Seanad to discuss the matter.  It would be a good debate to have.  As we know, we have many good friends in Georgia.  I welcome the good work the Georgian ambassador to Ireland, H.E. George Zurabashvili, has done in this area.  I call on the Leader to see if she can get the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, or the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Brophy, to the House to discuss the current issue with us.  It is to be hoped the EU will take Georgia's application in tandem with Ukraine.  This is the right time to do it. </p></speech>

Ireland played to its full potential in having two wins in a row last Saturday and this morning.  I congratulate Keith and all involved in the team.</p> <p>It was announced yesterday that FileCloud is opening its research and development centre and European headquarters in Limerick with the creation of 50 jobs.  It is good news to see another American company coming to the mid-west and opening its European headquarters there.  It is certainly a great asset to have Shannon Airport on our doorstep.  Senator Buttimer referred to a debate around the airports.  I also sought that debate last week.  We should have an open debate.  When we come back in the autumn, perhaps the Leader could organise a debate around the better use of our regional airports and a better distribution of flights.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Limerick Going for Gold was relaunched yesterday in Limerick.

The Government has done quite a substantial amount of work to reduce the cost of public transport be that with Irish Rail, Bus &Eacute;ireann, etc.  The one area where we have not reduced costs for commuters is the cost of parking either at train stations or bus stops.  That is the next thing we should look at because from a climate perspective and a cost-of-living perspective, we must entice people away from their cars and get them on to public transport.  It makes sense for us to reduce the cost of public transport dramatically but at the same time, we are keeping the cost of parking at train stations around the country high.  I firmly believe that the Minister should suspend the cost of parking for commuters, particularly at train stations, in line with the reduction in public transport fares.  I know the Minister will not be able to ask a private company to suspend parking charges at a bus stop but we can do it at all Irish Rail stations.  This would provide an extra level of help for and be of benefit to commuters.  It does not make sense that on one hand, we are reducing the cost of public transport dramatically and encouraging people to use it while on the other hand, we are still charging the same parking charges.  I call on the Minister to suspend the cost of car parking at Irish Rail stations across the country in line with the reduction in public transport fares until the end of the year and the economic situation stabilises.</p></speech>

That can obviously be combined with the help to buy scheme, which has assisted more than 33,000 households across the country in purchasing their first home, including 830 in my constituency of Waterford.  It is obviously disappointing the Opposition opposes both schemes, which are aimed at helping people get their foot on the housing ladder.</p> <p>One of the criticisms I get when I meet people is that there is no such scheme in place to allow people to purchase second-hand homes or derelict or vacant properties and bring them into use.  While we have excellent schemes such as the repair and lease scheme, which is operating brilliantly in my constituency, that provides support to do up a property and bring it back into use for the local authority to use, there is no such scheme for individuals or owner-occupiers.  I understand there is some movement on that and a lot of work has been done across Government parties to put such a scheme in place.  I hope such a scheme can be put in place as soon as possible to provide grant support to individuals and couples to allow them to purchase a vacant or derelict property in a town or village and bring it back into productive use for their own purposes.  This will have the dual benefit of revitalising towns and villages across the country and providing much-needed homes for those individuals and couples.</p> <p>I congratulate the organisers of the Dungarvan Agricultural Show, who put on a fantastic show over the weekend that was very well-attended.  The announcement this morning by the Minister for Rural and Community Development of up to &euro;6,000 for every agricultural show in the country is a hugely welcome decision.  This involves putting funding in place to support our rural communities in putting on much-needed shows that benefit all our communities.</p></speech>

In that context, CARI spoke about the fact there are huge waiting lists for therapy arising out of child sexual abuse during the Covid period in particular.  An awful lot of work has been done nationally and in this House to address domestic violence and to bring out into the open domestic violence during Covid.  However, one thing Irish culture has yet to tackle is the conspiracy of silence over child sexual abuse within families.  I have spoken to the Leader previously about this.  This morning's report begins a discussion.  At a time when people were obliged to stay in their homes, consequently children were abused in those homes.  Now we have an extremely waiting list for therapy.  We need to address what happens in the instances of child sexual abuse.  How do families and communities deal with that?  As a counsellor, women have sat in front of me having outed a child sexual abuser in their family only to see the male members of the family buy that person a drink at the bar at family events.  The energy goes into silencing the person who has had the courage to speak out.  I ask for a debate at some point on how we frame this.  It requires delicacy and engagement but we most certainly need a debate on sexual abuse, particularly in our communities and families and how we, as a nation, need to address that, out it and shame the perpetrators and not the survivors and victims.</p></speech>

A great piece of work was done by the Department in bringing forward the changes that are coming.  It is a great day for the Reserve Defence Forces and private soldiers who will see substantial increases in their income.  It gives great hope for the future.</p> <p>There always has to be a down side and with such a large project and the negotiations that will have led to this, one or two areas need further attention.  The first is to reverse the FEMPI cut relating to the special instructors allowance for commissioned officers.  Commissioned officers have not fared well in anything that has happened in the Defence Forces in recent times.  The other one is the military service allowance.  I spoke about this last week.  A corporal can now have a greater income than a lieutenant when the lieutenant is his or her supervisor and writes his or her annual appraisals.  The equalisation of the military service allowance is something we will work for in the future.  </p> <p>In fairness to the Minister for Defence, he has delivered.  I have been hard enough on him and his predecessors down through the years but he has delivered on this one.  I see really good times ahead as we start to see the investment that is promised in infrastructure and people.  It is a good day.  I do not want to put a dampener on it but if the Leader is talking to the Minister, and I compliment him fully, perhaps at some stage before the next budget, we might get a chance to sit down and look at the military service allowance for officers and the special instructors allowance for officers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I acknowledge what Senator Chambers said about the issue of women's health and Fianna F&aacute;il's proposals in that area.  I commend Fianna F&aacute;il on its focus on that area.  I might say a bit more about that tomorrow.  However, I plead that the issue of women's health always be pursued in the way that brings the maximum number of people on board because it is too important to be made sectoral.  I sometimes worry that people of goodwill are left wondering what is being imported into the concept.  Sometimes it is things that have very little to do with women's health and, sadly, everything to do with the death of the unborn, which is a different issue completely and has to do with the health of the unborn child.  It is an important issue but I ask that we keep everybody on board and focus on the things that unite us.  As I said, the issue is too important to be made controversial in the way it sometimes is.</p> <p>The issue I wanted to raise today relates to another area that touches on young people's health and welfare.  I refer to the fact that, in criminal prosecutions, a child who commits an offence when under the age of 18 but who is charged and tried after reaching the age of majority is sentenced as an adult.  That is bizarre when you consider that the Children Act 2001 provides a range of protections for juvenile offenders that aim to prevent young people from having criminal records wherever possible.  Where these circumstances arise, the persons involved are sentenced as adults.  Delay in the system is what is causing them to be charged and tried as adults, thereby losing the protections of the Children Act.  I will quote Mr. Justice Simons who, in a High Court judgment in 2020, said that the qualifying criterion is "the age of the accused as of the date of the trial" rather than the date on which the offences were supposed to have occurred.  All that is left then is judicial discretion and the possibility of judges giving lighter sentences.  There are none of the protections of the Children Act and no sentencing guidelines in such cases.  What are the consequences of this?  We all know that having a criminal record as a child is very different from having one as an adult.  The latter is very serious and follows people throughout their lives.  There is a gap in the law, a failure that causes people to have adult criminal records they should not have.  In Britain, this issue has been addressed through guidelines backed by legislation.  </p> <p>I ask the Leader whether we could get this issue on the agenda as soon as possible.  Does she agree that the delays in prosecuting offences are having a negative impact on society, trust in the system and the welfare of young offenders, who should be given a second and even a third chance?  Should this gap in the law not be closed?  I know we are at the end of term but can we have the Minister for Justice in as soon as possible to address this matter with us?</p></speech>

The first is what is being done for the Defence Forces, which is long overdue.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has done an outstanding job in setting up the review and then acting on its recommendations and securing delivery at Cabinet, which is significant, through a substantial financial package over a number of years that will bring our Defence Forces up to standard.  I pay tribute to the work Deputy Kehoe did to keep the show on the road in very difficult circumstances when he was Minister of State for many years.</p> <p>I also agree with my colleague with regard to CL&Aacute;R funding.  The primary school in Kilfenora has submitted an excellent application for funding to build an astroturf pitch.  This is badly needed and would be a great facility not only for the school, but for the wider community of Kilfenora.  I very much hope that the Minister will look favourably on the application and provide funding for that very important facility.</p> <p>We all know that Covid has not gone away.  We were all startled at the revelations yesterday that almost 1,000 people are in hospital with Covid.  We need a reality check with regard to Covid.  We need to impose restrictions on ourselves and wear masks where we feel compromised.  I call on retail outlets and other facilities to ensure that their hand sanitiser units are filled because it has come to my attention lately that quite a lot of hand sanitiser units are empty.  They are there for a reason.  We are still in the latter days of a pandemic.  There are spikes coming.  We need to ensure that we are vigilant.  </p> <p>On the motion being taken in the other House this evening, to be quite honest, I believe it is political opportunism.  This Government has handled the pandemic very well and saved many lives.  It has also reacted as best as it possibly could to the war in Ukraine.  More than 30,000 Ukrainian people are living in Ireland, where they are catered for and housed.  The actions we are taking to manage the effects of this terrible war on the cost of living and the interventions that will be made through the budget, which has been brought forward to late September, will make a significant difference to people's lives.  I actually believe-----</p></speech>

I wish everyone a very good summer after what has been a fairly energetic and, at times, combative session.  I have to say that I believe politics is in a good place right now.  Regardless of whatever else we can say, we can say that, after the last general election, we finally have a left-right divide in politics.  That can only be a good thing.  The years when we had the names Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael alternating while the policies did not change are over.  Whatever is to come in the future will be along the left-right divide-----</p></speech>

I am really proud that the trade unions are leading this march.  I am delighted to see them leading the call for a doubling of investment in housing.  It is significant that the Economic and Social Research Institute, the Government's own think tank, pointed out last year that this Government is spending half of what it needs to in order to tackle the housing problem.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why we have 14% rent rises in Limerick.

I encourage people in Limerick to come out at 1 o'clock and join their colleagues, their brothers and sisters in the trade union movement, and join people from Sinn F&eacute;in and other progressive parties to make it clear we will not stand for this housing crisis anymore.  Of course, I wish my colleagues in the D&aacute;il well tonight with the motion of no confidence in this appalling Government.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to his bravery and resilience.  This morning, he came out with his story of how he was trafficked as a child from Somalia to the UK.  As a vulnerable child he was brought to another country and forced to work for a family.  He was not able to go to school.  He eventually went to school at about 12 years of age.  It was only by the grace of God that he was able to shine through sports.  It was because his PE teacher came forward to support him that he was able to speak and actually get help.  I am amazed at that.  I understand that the documentary on Sir Mo Farah will be aired by the BBC tomorrow.  I pay tribute to him on coming forward at this stage in his career.  As a young boy, he was seen as unkempt, he could not speak English and his parents never attended any parent-teacher meetings.  One of the articles on the BBC website states:</p> <blockquote> 	Sir Mo's PE teacher, Alan Watkinson, noticed a transformation in the young boy when he hit the athletics track.<br /><br />&quot;The only language he seemed to understand was the language of PE and sport,&quot; he says.<br /><br />Sir Mo says sport was a lifeline for him as &quot;the only thing I could do to get away from this [living situation] was to get out and run&quot;.<br /><br />He eventually confided in Mr Watkinson about his true identity, his background, and the family he was being forced to work for. </blockquote> <p>This is important because we are not immune from trafficking in Ireland.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, attended an event on human trafficking in June along with the US ambassador.  The undocumented migrant scheme will expire at the end of July.  It is crucial that we speak more about these schemes so that people feel free to speak to their teachers and the role of sport.</p></speech>

We all know that morale in our forces is low.  This historic investment and reform will bring about the change that is very much needed.  Like my colleagues, I wish that our military personnel would be adequately paid and respected.  &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann needs to be modernised and brought into its second century.  I am very proud to be part of the Government that is bringing about that change.  I congratulate the Minister for Defence on his great work on this.  We have the plan and we now need action and delivery.</p> <p>I also pay tribute to the Fianna F&aacute;il Leader in the Seanad on her work in respect of the women's health policy, and all the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors, Senators and members throughout the country who contributed to this very good document.  I am very proud to be part of that.  I thank Senator Chambers.</p> <p>I wish to speak about the so-called celebrations last night for the 11 July bonfires.  It is sickening to see the hate that continues to be portrayed.  We are almost not allowed to be offended by it because it is somehow portrayed as culture, but hate is not culture.  We need to ensure that our unionist friends - I have unionist friends - stand up to this sectarian hate.  Imagine if we stuck an effigy of the queen or a union jack on a bonfire and burned it.  We do not need to do that.  I am confident enough in my nationality and in my republicanism that we do not need to do those types of things.  It is about time that unionist leaders stood up and led their people to be strong enough and proud enough in their own identity that they do not need to burn down and denigrate other people's culture and flag.  I send a message to all our unionist friends.  When they burn the tricolour, they are burning part of themselves, because our flag represents peace between the orange and the green.</p></speech>

I thank Senator McGreehan for acknowledging the Minister for Foreign Affairs' work and the memo brought to Cabinet this morning, as others also did.  I will speak more broadly on it when I get to respond to Senator Craughwell.  Senator McGreehan's views on the events that happened last night are shared by everybody in the House.</p> <p>I read the story that Senator Dolan mentioned and listened to some of the commentary on the BBC this morning.  Many people would have had admired Mo Farah before today based on his enormous contribution in the sporting world.  We cannot but be amazed not only at his bravery but also at his tenacity to be able to do what he did arising from the circumstances that brought him to the United Kingdom and particularly in the context of some of the debates on extradition in the United Kingdom at the moment, which are as vulgar and as ugly as one could get.  His timing shows great inspiration and hopefully will allow British people to be able to follow the example he has set.</p> <p>Senator Gavan started so well, and I was so pleased.</p></speech>

Those are his words not mine.  Anyway, I thank Senator Gavan for his good wishes.</p> <p>The Defence Forces were brought up by Senator Conway who was also looking for clarity on CL&Aacute;R funding.  He is looking for a debate in September on the ongoing ill effects of Covid.  I will certainly organise that.</p> <p>The sentiments Senator Mullen raised are incredibly worthy not just of a debate but also of a political and policy response.  I do not know how to organise that for him, but I will certainly organise a debate with the Minister in September as soon as we come back.  I thank him for raising that matter.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn also spoke about the numerous towns in Tipperary that he represents very ably.  He is looking for further funding for a second scheme for community halls.  The scheme has been oversubscribed and received a welcome around the country.  He is also looking for update from the Minister on when decisions will be made on CL&Aacute;R applications.  I will try to organise that today.</p> <p>Week in and week out Senator Craughwell - along with others to a lesser extent - speaks about his pride in the Defence Forces and provides great advocacy on their behalf.  While I have not seen the memo yet, it must be a really good memo for the Senator to stand up here and welcome it.  It is a really good day for members of the Defence Forces for him to talk so positively about it.  I thank him for being so generous in providing such a positive reaction.  Other colleagues also welcomed it.  To be fair to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, an enormous body of work has been done in a relatively short period, but it was probably a long time coming.  I am really glad that the Defence Forces are receiving the news that they are.  Obviously, and as Senator Craughwell pointed out, the work is not all done.</p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney mentioned the report about CARI on our airwaves this morning.  We have had this conversation before.  I had to ring CARI on Monday on behalf of somebody.  I did not know at that point that the organisation would feature on the radio this morning.  The lady who answered the phone told me that the shortest wait time for a child who was sexually abused, either recently or in the past, and is still traumatised by it is two years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->CARI is the only agency that is providing trauma and therapy services to our children in respect of an issue that has not gone away.  There is somehow a perception in Ireland that child sexual abuse is something that used to happen years ago when we were all young and that it was hidden under the table.  By Jove, it is certainly hidden under the table today and I am calling on the Minister not just to double CARI's funding - the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, did make an increase in its funding last year -  but it should be quadrupled this year.</p></speech>

Such children should not even have to wait for weeks and I thank the Senator for raising this issue morning.  I hope I speak on behalf of all of us to look for increased funding for CARI, the sole agency in the country which provides voluntary counselling for our children who have suffered at the hands of adults.</p> <p>Senator Cummins spoke on and welcomed the home share equity scheme announced by the Government last week, which will bridge the gap between what people can afford to borrow in a mortgage and the actual price of houses.  I wish everybody well in respect of the positivity around that scheme.  He highlighted the need for a scheme where people in similar situations may be able to purchase second homes and I wish him well in pursuing that with the Minister.</p> <p>Senator McGahon spoke about the cost of living crisis for commuters.  I am very pleased that the 20% reduction in public transport prices has been extended to next year but he is completely right that encouraging people to take trains and then introducing or increasing car parking fees at the train stations makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  I support him in his calls for a suspension of car parking fees at all Irish Rail stations.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne congratulated Keith Earls and, indeed, the entire Irish rugby team, who did such a stonking job over the weekend and I know that we are all so proud of them.  They indeed made history.  She also mentioned the 50 new jobs for Limerick and for the debate which had previously been called for on our regional airports and how we use them.</p> <p>Senator Keogan spoke about a debate she has been looking for on inflation and the issues of a potential recession.  I have asked the Ministers, who obviously have been incredibly busy over the past number of months, but I expect that once we return in September, much of our schedule will be taken up with debating the budget, which will be coming early this year.  Just to let the Senator know; I will do this as soon as I can.</p> <p>Senator Davitt spoke about Georgia's accession to being an EU candidate.  I am aware, from being a member of the Committee on European Union Affairs, as is Senator Chambers, that the Georgian ambassador, H.E. George Zurabashvili, appears before the committee quite regularly and has the support of the team in the Committee on European Union Affairs to help in any way that we can to advance Georgia's application.</p> <p>Senator Currie spoke about the airport routes and their extension through BusConnects and the delay involved.  </p> <p>She also spoke about 12 July.  It is probably part of all of our natures to celebrate and accept that there is diversity and difference in our country and to allow it, as that is what makes life so interesting.  When that difference becomes as disdainful as we have seen in some cases over the past number of days, however, it is hard to be kind and to say it is just a community celebrating its culture.  I say that mindfully because there are tens of thousands of people in the unionist community who celebrate this event with such family-oriented cultural views and it really is a celebration of this.  I wish to God the very small number of people who ruin the entire reputation of the celebrations would be more mindful.  I thank Senator Currie for having raised this issue this morning because if you are celebrating your culture through division and hatred, it is not much of a celebration and is certainly not much of an example to set for the following generations thereafter.</p> <p>Senator Murphy congratulated Senator Chambers and I will discuss her achievements in a moment but he also welcomed the new funding for the Defence Forces this morning, the memo, and the changes to pay and conditions over the next number of years.  He also mentioned that he was delighted that his part of the constituency in Galway is going to be in the all-Ireland final.  I have to say that I was probably gutted and disappointed as I watched the match over the weekend, given that Dublin performed so well in the second half.  Honest to goodness, however, with Se&aacute;n O'Shea, one could not argue with the result after that point at the very end.  </p></speech>

I continue to wish them well in their endeavours.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan mentioned this morning that the Future of Media Commission report has gone to the Cabinet and he acknowledged that quality journalism, as I believe we will all agree, has to be supported, whether that is at a national or local level.  We need a debate on the report in September and a conversation around the VAT that is charged on newspapers.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer welcomed the Defence Forces announcements and how steady and solid a foundation it is for growth of that sector, with an increase in man and woman power in our Defence Forces.  He would like to thank all of the people by our actions, I suppose, which is how he wants us to be measured.  He acknowledged our good friend and colleague, Gabrielle McFadden, and her advocacy here over the years for the Defence Forces.</p> <p>Senator Chambers opened today the Order of Business debate today, not only by mentioning the Defence Forces and her advocacy on that front for the past number of years, and by welcoming the increase in its budget to &euro;1.5 billion, but invited us all to her policy, which is the launch of the Fianna F&aacute;il policy on women today.  I am very mindful of the amount of work that she has put in on its behalf and in her organisation of it, with of all her colleagues.  I welcome any scrutiny and support she can get, in being responsible for the first political party to have a female health policy.  It certainly puts in all our minds that we all should probably do the same.</p> <p>As this will be my final Order of Business debate this week, I thank colleagues for what has been an incredible year.  We have debated without much division, thankfully, but with major policy differences on issues, in a very respectful way and I believe that that is what makes the Seanad very different to the Upper House, or rather to the Lower House, my apologies.</p></speech>

It is a good day in terms of legislation, women's healthcare and the cost of living as it relates to healthcare. The Bill's core purposes have been expanded.  Originally the Bill had one aim, namely to abolish inpatient charges for children in hospitals.  That is a really important step in the right direction.  It is now being amended to encompass provisions to provide free contraception on a statutory basis in the State for the first time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are starting the scheme with women aged 17 to 25, as per our commitment in the programme for Government.</p><p>I will first focus on the initial objective of abolishing public hospital inpatient charges for children.  This legislation, when enacted, will ease the financial burden of parents and guardians when bringing their child to hospital for inpatient care.  It will help to ensure that cost is not a big consideration for families when children require access to inpatient treatment.  Currently public patients, including children, are subject to a statutory inpatient charge of &euro;80 per day, up to a maximum of 10 days, or &euro;800, in a year.  This Bill seeks to put an end to that charge for children.  It will amend the Health Act 1970 to provide a specific additional exemption from this charge for children under the age of 16.</p><p>This is an important step towards affordability, along with a lot of other things we are doing.  We have reduced the drug payment scheme.  We are looking at free GP care for six- and seven-year-olds.  The two provisions in this Bill are really important.  It is an important signal.  If parents or guardians have a child in hospital then they are already going through a very difficult time and are already under a huge amount of pressure and stress.  Having brought their child to hospital and having had their child in hospital for ten days or more, the last thing that parents then need is a bill from the hospital for &euro;800.  This legislation will put an end to that, which is very welcome.</p><p>Following a recent Government decision, a D&aacute;il Committee Stage amendment was brought forward to the Bill to provide for free contraception, starting with women aged 17 to 25.  As we discussed here previously in the Seanad, the intention is to expand that scheme.  We want this free contraception available for everybody.  We must start somewhere and the expert report we got back proposed that we start with 17- to 25-year-olds.  The scheme will be open to all women aged 17 to 25 who are ordinarily resident in Ireland.  The scheme will fully cover all of the costs associated with it including medical appointments to discuss and prescribe suitable contraception; fitting and removal of long-acting reversible contraception, LARCS, for example, implants and coils; any necessary checks for LARCS; and a wide range of prescription contraceptives currently on the reimbursement list and available to medical card holders.  It also will abolish the prescription charges for medical card holders for other medicines.  It is very wide ranging in the context of the costs it covers.  A woman can go to the doctor, have a consultation for implants for long-acting reversible contraception or for the pill or other prescribed medicines, have check-ups and get the medicines or devices, all of which costs will be covered.</p><p>I will now provide a brief explanation of the sections of the Bill.  Part 1 contains standard provisions setting out the Short Title citation and provides that the Bill shall be subject to a commencement order.</p><p>Part 2 of the Bill deals with exemptions from public inpatient charges for acute inpatient services.</p><p>Section 3 amends section 47A of the Health Act 1970 to provide that the new section 53C(9)(bb) of the Health Act 1970, which gives effect to the exemption from charges for acute inpatient services for children under the age of 16, is included for reference within section 47A of the Health Act 1970.</p><p>Section 4 amends section 53C of the Health Act 1970.  Section 53C provides that charges shall be made for acute inpatient services provided by or on behalf of the Health Service Executive.  The proposed new section 53C(9)(aa) confirms that the &euro;80 public charge is not applicable to persons who have chosen to avail of private acute inpatient services under section 55 of the Health Act, in which circumstances the more significant charges set out in Schedule 4 appropriately apply.</p><p>The proposed new section 53C9(bb) provides for the exemption from the charge for children up to the age of 16 years of age arising from acute inpatient services.  The Bill also provides that under sections 4(c) and 4(d), the existing inpatient charging exemption provisions for children will not be impacted.  The big effect of these amendments is to remove the acute public inpatient charge of &euro;80 per day for children under the age of 16 in all public hospitals.</p><p>Part 3 deals with the provision of contraception services.  Section 5 amends section 47A of the Health Act 1970 to provide that the new section 67E of the Health Act 1970, which gives effect to the free contraception scheme for women aged 17 to 25, is included for reference within section 47A of the Health Act 1970.</p><p>Section 6 inserts a new section 67E into the Health Act 1970.  This contains the main provisions for the free contraception scheme.  Within this proposed new section 67E, there are 11 subsections.  I will briefly focus on some of the main subsections.  Subsection (1) provides that the HSE will make available, without charge, access for women aged 17 to 25 to medical practitioners for the purposes of accessing prescription contraception, dispensing of prescription contraception by pharmacies and the fitting and removal of long-acting reversible contraception, and that this will be free of charge.  Subsection (2) provides that a woman can choose to access the scheme through any GP or medical practitioner who has signed up with the HSE as a scheme provider.  Subsection (3) provides that free prescription contraception will be accessed via pharmacies.  Subsection (5) provides that the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may make regulations to vary the age cohort eligible for the scheme, allowing for wider access in future, which we hope to do. </p><p>Subsection (6) provides that the age cohort cannot be extended below the age of 17 years by way of regulation.  This point came up on Committee Stage, and indeed we spent all our time in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on this point during Committee Stage.  This subsection is included in order for us to get the Bill passed.  It is not my intention that this would remain as a permanent feature in the Bill.  I have asked the Department to start preparing the amending legislation.  We received legal advice recently that we needed to put the scheme on a statutory basis.  It is important to me, and I believe to colleagues here, that this happens before the D&aacute;il rises for the summer recess.  We want the scheme in place and operational at the end of August and the start of September.  I believe the scheme should be expanded to those below the age of 17.  The only reason this subsection is here is to make this Bill, which was put together quickly, legally robust.  The Department will now be spending the time on some of the real complexities in terms of reducing the age to below 17.  I am fully committed to doing that.</p><p>Subsection (7) provides that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may set the fees to be paid to GPs and pharmacists under the scheme.</p><p>Section 7 of the Bill contains a number of consequential amendments to Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.</p><p>In summary, bearing in mind all of the positive impacts arising from the abolition of public inpatient charges for those under the age of 16, and the introduction of the contraception scheme, starting with women aged 17 to 25, I am seeking the support of Seanad &Eacute;ireann for these very important affordability measures.  I believe they are beyond just affordability measures, certainly when it comes to free contraception.  I spent some time with the Irish Family Planning Association team on Cathal Brugha Street some time ago.  That organisation was set up decades ago to respond to the negative impact on women's health at the time when contraception was banned.  It was wonderful to be up with that group to say not only is it legal, but we are making it free for the first time in the history of the State.  While it is an important affordability measure, it is also an important statement of intent that this Government, and Oireachtas, including this Seanad, are absolutely serious about and committed to a revolution in women's healthcare.  This is one important part of that work. </p></speech>

I reference in particular the exemption from hospital charges for children under 16 years of age in all public hospitals, and for persons who have chosen to avail of private, acute inpatient services.  We should not forget that there are many times when people might need to bring their child to a hospital and because of income barriers they make a choice not to do it.  That can be quite upsetting.  I come across this in my clinics quite a lot.  The sum of &euro;800 is a lot of money if one does not have it.  That worries people.  Many people will not throw caution to the wind.  I would always say that a person should go to hospital and that we will sort out the bill some way, but many parents or guardians would not throw caution to the wind and go to the hospital because they would be worried about not being able to pay a bill.  This is a very welcome move.  I know the Minister is very much committed to ensuring that children's healthcare is free where we can possibly do so.  Hospital charges have been issued to many parents.  As the Minister said, public patients, including children, are subject to the acute inpatient charge of &euro;80 per day, up to a maximum of &euro;800 in a year, so it can be a big issue, in particular if one has to bring a child to hospital on an ongoing basis.  While many hospitals and the Department are quite good in exceptional circumstances, the lack of a medical card for families can cause a financial strain.</p><p>I also welcome the amendment the Minister has introduced to provide a contraception scheme for women aged 17 to 25.  He explained that very well here today.  The important factor is that he has funded it and provided &euro;9 million to get the scheme up and running.  That is important.  We can announce many issues, but if we do not fund them, they often do not benefit the public.  This initiative is very welcome, and our party welcomes it.</p><p>I compliment the Minister and the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte, Feighan and Butler, on the good work they are doing, not alone in women's healthcare but throughout the health service.  We must remember that through all of this the Minister had to deal with Covid as well.  It is good to see progress being made here today and the measures introduced by the Minister.  It is also a very good day for women's health with the launch of our party's women's healthcare policy.  We are the first political party in Ireland to do this.  The event is taking place in Buswells Hotel at 3 p.m. today.  The Minister is quite excited about that development.</p><p>On behalf of our party, I welcome what the Minister is doing here today.  I look forward to further progress and to making my own recommendations to the Minister as we further develop a good healthcare system for people.  We must acknowledge that many issues have been delayed because of Covid, but that is not stopping the Minister, the Ministers of State or their departmental officials from coming forward with such legislative measures and changes that are absolutely necessary as we move forward with healthcare in general.</p></speech>

I also very much welcome this legislation.  It is groundbreaking and is fulfilling a clear commitment in the programme for Government.  It is the right thing to do.  It is a terrible situation when a child gets sick, and a mother or father must debate whether to bring the child to hospital for financial reasons.  I do not think too many parents do that, but no parent should ever have to do it.  The proposal contained in this Bill to eliminate inpatient hospital charges for young people under 16 years of age is very welcome.  It will help as well with the cost-of-living situation the country faces.</p> <p>I would like to see it increase to 18 years because, in most cases, young people between the ages of 16 and 18 are living at home and they are dependent on their parents.  The circumstances of a child of 15 and a half compared to a child of 16 and a half are usually not too dissimilar.  Perhaps at some future date the Minister might look at increasing the age threshold to 18.  That would be very reasonable and fair.  Perhaps there is a reason that it is 16 that I do not get.  There may be an explanation that is covered under some other heading.  It is welcome.  It is progress.  It is another incremental step in the right direction to universal healthcare for all, which is the commitment under Sl&aacute;intecare.  That must be welcomed.</p> <p>I also very much welcome that the Minister took the opportunity presented by this legislation to introduce free contraception for 17- to 25-year olds.  Again, that relates to a clear commitment in the programme for Government.  It is a deliverable.  We often hear about programmes for Government and how much has been delivered.  This is a clear deliverable.  It was agreed by the three parties and within two years of taking office the Minister has made it happen.  It is very welcome.  Again, a young woman should not be afraid to go to her GP to discuss contraception simply because she does not have the money.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#T00400"><p>When she goes to her GP, she should be able to avail of whatever he or she recommends as the best form of contraception.  Not being able to do so because she does not have the resources should not be an option.</p> <p>It is very welcome that this measure has been introduced up to the age of 25.  Perhaps we could look at increasing the age in future budgets.  The initiative is very welcome.  It is a vote of confidence in the women of Ireland.  It is creating the type of equality that we all strive for, namely, equality of access to healthcare.  It is on the back of what the Minister has done in terms of period poverty and in other areas as well.  Even during the pandemic, we were in here introducing legislation that sometimes went under the radar but made a real difference to the lives of people, in particular women on the margins.  We heard some horrendous stories about people who suffered from period poverty prior to the measures being introduced.  No citizen should have to be in that situation.  Similarly, no female should be in a situation where she cannot avail of the best form of appropriate contraception.  That is very welcome.</p> <p>While I am on my feet, I commend what has been done in terms of the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine.  I raised it on many occasions with the Minister and I pushed hard to ensure that the HPV catch-up programme would be free of charge.  It is very welcome that this has happened.  Again, it is another incremental step in support of women and creating equality.  Some people who were hesitant about their young girls getting vaccinated in first year in school, regretted it, but then they could not access the programme.  I spoke to one woman who is known to both the Minister and I, who ended up having to pay &euro;1,200 to get her three daughters vaccinated because she did not avail of the catch-up programme.  Luckily, she was in a position where she could afford it, but there were many who could not.  Numerous people contacted my office when I previously raised this issue publicly.  We were able to get back to all of them and say that hopefully by September there will be a catch-up programme in place.  I commend the Minister on that.</p> <p>We are always advocating on behalf of citizens and sometimes it can be difficult and challenging, but when things are done I will be the very first one to stand up and commend them, because we are all here to try to do the right thing.  The ultimate aim of all of us is to achieve the ambition of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is free healthcare for all.  I am pleased the Bill is not being opposed because in this House our Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, and all our other colleagues, are committed to what we are committed to, which is ensuring that we will eventually have the best healthcare service in Europe, if not in the world.</p></speech>

It is always good to have a fellow "Donnelly" in the Chamber, in particular when they are outlining welcome news such as that contained in the Bill today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am conscious of the fact that so far, through no fault of our own, it is all men who have been speaking on this legislation.  I do not think that is reflective of the Seanad, however.  Our Seanad Leader and the majority of leaders are women.  This twenty-sixth Seanad, in particular, has a proud record in advocating for and advancing women's health issues.  I am conscious of that as I rise to my feet.<br/><br/>Any measure that reduces the cost of healthcare for any citizen is, of course, to be welcomed.  I say that as someone who avails of free universal healthcare and have done all of my life.  It is a significant step forward that I hope will be followed by many more steps ahead with regard to making healthcare much more accessible and available to all citizens.  I welcome that in the first instance.<br/><br/>Like other colleagues, I will not use the entire duration of my time but I also welcome the roll-out of free contraception to women aged 17 to 25.  The Minister could perhaps keep me right on this issue, however.  I note that in a response to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, the Minister said:</p><blockquote>	Full year costings for 17-25 year-olds may be considered in the context of Estimates 2023, but no costings have been finalised to date and no funding allocations for future years agreed at this stage. Estimated costings for wider age ranges have been included in the Report of the Working Group on Contraception. </blockquote><p>Obviously, my colleague, Senator Conway, referred to the need for this to ultimately be rolled out to broader age groups.  The Minister might be able to clarify that for me more comprehensively in terms of his response on Second Stage.  My colleagues in the Lower House outlined Sinn F&eacute;in's broader approach to this legislation and, indeed, the issues contained therein.  Before I finish, I will quickly note and welcome the fact that according to today's <i>Irish Examiner</i>, we finally have legislation that will be ready to be enacted with regard to safe access zones.</p></speech>

We always said we would work with the Minister if he brought that legislation forward.  Can the Minister confirm when that legislation will come before us?  We are obviously heading into the summer recess.  Can he confirm that it will be brought and hopefully concluded before Christmas and the end of this year?  The reason I ask is because the Minister and all colleagues know these protests remain an issue.  They are still ongoing.  There is still intimidation and harassment of women trying to access healthcare and that needs to be brought to an end as soon as possible.</p> <p>In asking that, I acknowledge and commend the work of Together for Safety in advancing this issue and working so collaboratively and positively with us in Sinn F&eacute;in and, indeed, colleagues right across the Oireachtas in ensuring that our Bill passed through the Seanad.  I wish the Minister well in his efforts to bring forward that legislation.  I hope it can be brought before us as early as possible when we come back following the summer recess.</p></speech>

I commend this piece of legislation.  At a time when we are told that Government does not understand the cost of living crisis and is not in tune with the people, is it not extraordinary then that the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, brought a piece of legislation to improve access to healthcare into the House today?  As Senator Conway rightly said, it eases the financial pressure and worry of parents.  My learned colleague and friend across the Chamber stood up today and welcomed the Bill - the hypocrisy of the Opposition never ceases to amaze me.  Every day Opposition Members come in and tell us they do not understand and do not get it and that we are out of touch, yet what have we got before the House today?  Another piece of supportive scaffolding by a Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government that is supposedly out of touch.  It is extraordinary.</p><p>Today is a good day.  In advance of today, we have seen a huge march towards universal healthcare from free GP care to today's legislation on inpatient charges for children.  Of course, the Minister published the other Bill with regard to inpatient charges as well.  Senator Currie this morning during the Order of Business made reference to the issue of Dublin Airport and parking charges.  I ask that we as a Government look at the cost of car parking in our hospitals.  I know it is a revenue source for hospitals but it is something we should look at again.</p><p>The Bill today is about easing the financial burden on parents and ensuring that no parent or guardian has to make a choice about the care of his or her young child.  We all know from our families and our own lived experience of that middle-of-the-night excursion to the hospital or that after-match or mid-match trip to the hospital with a broken shoulder, leg, arm or whatever.  Today is a positive day.</p><p>I commend the Minister on his piece of work around free contraception.  It was said at the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary get-together last week that Fine Gael was perhaps critical of the Minister.  I will say on behalf of the Fine Gael Members that the idea of free access to contraceptive care is one we wholeheartedly embrace, which the Minister knows.  I am glad he is bringing that forward.  However, we should look at this in the context of Kitty Holland's piece in <i>The Irish Times</i>today about the Unplanned Pregnancy and Abortion Care, UnPAC, study from Trinity College Dublin, TCD, on women's reproductive health needs and care.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile and I will be <i>ad idem </i>on this and the issue of safe zones and the universality of access to care for women.  I hope that we can have a debate on that UnPAC report after the summer recess because no woman in this country should have to feel frightened, inadequate or worried about accessing any type of healthcare.  In the context of Roe <i>v</i>. Wade in America but more importantly here in Ireland, it is important that the chilling effect is not felt by our women.</p><p>Today, th&iacute;os staighre, the women of this Seanad and previous Members are celebrating Seanad 100.  Look at the huge progress we have made in terms of women's health and women's reproductive rights in this country.  Today is about the children and parents of Ireland, however.  It is about ensuring that access to coverage of healthcare is given, which I very much welcome.</p><p>I will also make the point that in the context of our healthcare system, when we talk to pharmacists and GPs, they speak about pressure points, whether it is SouthDoc in County Cork or the locum cover in our community pharmacies.  I hope the Government will reach out and a conversation will be had by the Department of Health and the HSE around the issues of our general practitioners and pharmacists who do tremendous work.  I thank the men and women who work at the coal face and on the front line of our community healthcare, that is, our GPs and pharmacists.  We can talk about how the quality of engagement and care and attention given in our chemists and pharmacists is extraordinary, and equally so with our general practices.  Some of us have a worry that general practice is beginning to fray at the edges.  That is not a criticism of the Minister, in case he or some of his colleagues think it is; it is not.  It is about ensuring that our primary care system is top class and continues to be top class.  Today is a great day, however.  It is a day on which we celebrate a further scaffolding of support for our children and their parents.</p></speech>

This is a really important piece of legislation, which I welcome.  As a parent and father, this issue about the cost of care for children is huge for Irish society.  There is a fear out there more than anything else.  It is the fear of what it could cost rather than what it actually will cost.  We are taking the fear out of that today, which is a really positive step.  This is part of a suite of measures that are coming into place.  I often listen to the older generation, in particular, when they talk about the reduction in the prescription fee.  Bringing that allowance down to &euro;80 a few months ago was a really significant change for the cost of living for these people as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Considering what we are now doing for the younger generation, it is a really positive step forward.  It was mentioned that we should perhaps at look at expanding this in time.  It is a great step forward.</p><p>Like all of us, I look at my children and want them to leave home.  I do not think any of us will see that happening.  If anything, I think our children will be staying at home for longer than we want them to.  The cost of removing inpatient fees for those up to the age of 18 is something that we will have to look at in time.  That is part of the way society has moved.  When our children are leaving secondary school after six years, they are nearly 19 years of age.  They are a part of our family units at a primary level until they leave school.  I think that this Bill is a great step forward.  The measures on contraception services shows how Ireland has changed.  It really has changed.  Ten or 20 years ago, such measures would not have been introduced.  Now the expectation is that services should be provided.  That shows how we have matured as a nation and a people.  I am delighted that the legislation is being passed.  It ties it all in together.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward the legislation.  I hope that it passes all Stages today and goes on to be enacted.</p></speech>

I want to acknowledge the very constructive debates we have had in the Seanad on the issue.  A Private Members' Bill on safe access to termination of pregnancy services was brought forward previously.  I acknowledge the significant work put into that Bill by the Members concerned.  At the time, I committed to bringing forward and prioritising legislation in the area.  We have done that.</p> <p>On the timeframe for delivery, the legislation will be considered by Cabinet shortly.  If Cabinet agrees, which I hope it will, I will then immediately refer it to the Joint Committee on Health for pre-legislative scrutiny.  My hope is that the committee will be able to prioritise time for that scrutiny and will be able to move through the process quickly.  Once we receive the report from the committee, we will move to finalise the Bill.  I would like to bring it to the House as quickly as possible.  I would love to get through all of that this calendar year.  It is a priority and has support on all sides of the House.  It is something that I would like to see happen.</p> <p>In terms of funding for next year, &euro;9 million in funding is being allocated this year for the provision of free contraception for 17- to 25-year-olds.  That is the cost estimate.  The full-year cost, which is provided for, is &euro;26 million.  It is a really important measure, but the figures I provided underscore just how expensive it is.  To put it in context, we estimate that the full year cost of providing free contraception just for 17- to 25-year-olds is around &euro;26 million.  The additional funding for the national maternity strategy is just &euro;9 million.  The total funding for new developments for the entire national cancer strategy is &euro;20 million.  The full cost of this measure is &euro;26 million.  It is a most important and expensive measure.  It is a mark of how seriously we are taking the issue, that we are allocating such significant funds to it.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer raised the issue of other costs, such as car parking charges at hospitals, for example.  I am aware that some hospitals have agreements in place whereby there is a mechanism for waiving the charges for patients who are in regularly or for family members who might be visiting someone who is in regularly.  However, charges are managed on a hospital-by-hospital basis.  I am very aware that there is a wide range of costs right across the board.  These include the costs relating to accessing hospitals, GPs and other community care, such as physiotherapy and speech and language therapy and all of those services, and medicines.  The goal is the provision of universal healthcare.  We are absolutely committed to achieving that.</p> <p>Universal healthcare is profoundly important and has three very simple criteria.  When people need care, they can get it quickly, it is high-quality and affordable.  Today is about the third criterion.  We are removing inpatient charges for children and the cost of contraception, starting with the 17- to 25-year-olds.  We are also looking at other costs.  Last year we secured the extension of the provision of medical cards to those with a terminal diagnosis from 12 months to 24 months.  We have reduced the drug payment scheme substantially this year.  At the start of the year, we reduced it from &euro;114 to &euro;100 a month.  It has since been reduced to &euro;80 a month.  We also plan to bring in free GP care for six- and seven-year-olds.  Across the board, we are targeting the areas of healthcare that are causing financial distress for people.  We have not got them all yet.  Obviously, it takes time.  However, I hope that my colleagues agree that this year, we are making really important progress.  We will also be looking to the budget to see what more can be done.  I think we have covered the various issues that were raised.</p></speech>

I hope that now that Senator Buttimer is in the Chair, it will confine him somewhat, but I wish to raise the issue hospital car parking charges, given that it was raised on Second Stage.  My colleague in the North, former MLA Fra McCann, bought forward legislation to ban hospital car parking charges in the North.  It was subsequently picked up by my colleague, Aisling Reilly MLA, and the legislation was passed.  It can be done.  It is a welcome piece of legislation that Sinn F&eacute;in has carried forward in the Assembly.  I encourage the Minister to direct his officials to look at that legislation, if he has not done so already, to see if something similar can be done here.  If not, perhaps it is an issue that we can pick up in the Seanad moving forward.</p></speech>

The electoral mandate is the key element here, not the recognition of a particular Minister or a governing authority.  We spoke about this in detail last week but it remains an unanswered and fundamental point.  If we say external recognition of a students' union has more weight legally, rather than an electoral mandate, that will serve to undermine the democratic frameworks both within student unions themselves and within higher education institutions.  While the current Minister engages extensively with students&rsquo; unions, future Ministers or future governments may have a very different relationship with student leaders.  We need only look to Hungary, where there has been a systematic effort over the past number of years to dismantle academic independence and repress the voices of academics and students who protested this.  We are fortunate that Ireland is not in a similar situation.  However, this legislation needs to be airtight to ensure that, regardless of who may be the Minister or what the policies of any future government are, student unions are able to represent the people who elect them.  At later points in this legislation, with regard to provisions relating to governing authorities, there is a deeply concerning lack of specification that it must be student union representatives appointed to governing authorities.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment as it clearly sets out that having an electoral mandate is what gives a student union its ability to advocate for students and their welfare.</p> <p>Amendment No. 9 seeks a report following the conclusion of the citizens' assembly on education.  The Minister would have to prepare and a lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas outlining how he or she plans to implement or reflect the recommendations of the citizens' assembly in respect of higher education with regard to amendments to the provisions of this Act and policy relating to higher education in the State more broadly.  We have spoken at length about how certain elements of this foundational legislation are somewhat pre-empting the citizen&rsquo;s assembly on education.  It would be beneficial to the operation of the Act in the future if there was a requirement to integrate and reflect the recommendations from the citizen&rsquo;s assembly within this legislation. </p> <p>Amendment No. 114 would provide that in preparing a strategic plan, the chief executive of a university must consult with representative organisations of students belonging to priority groups.  When drafting this amendment I was thinking of groups like Minc&eacute;irs Whiden in NUI Galway and the UCD LGBTQ+ Society.</p></speech>

They are important.  It is particularly important to ensure students' unions are independent and self-governing.  As my colleague has said, we do not have to look too far, even within the European Union, to see what can happen.  I cannot see any reason the Minister would object to a definition like this.</p></speech>

It is very clear that students want to make sure their organisations are representative, that people are elected onto them and that it is those bodies that represent the students at governing authorities across all our universities.  The Minister has looked very carefully at this with his team and his officials.  He is examining it and is looking at other ways within the provisions of the current Act, and potentially through the guidelines and the policies of the HEA Bill, to even further define and make clear the types of representative bodies that will be on governing authorities.</p></speech>

I referenced effective student representation specifically.  The key point is that within this legislation, there is an acknowledgement by the Minister of the role of students.  There is a challenge in ensuring we always have independent students' unions.  In outlining some of the legal difficulties, I hope the Minister can assuage some of the concerns and fears because it has happened in the past that non-elected representatives were appointed to a governing authority.  I agree with Senator Ruane, and the Minister and I have spoken about this, about the role of universities in promoting democracy and contributing to the democratic space.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When we see what has been going on in Hungary and how, unfortunately, student unions have become puppets of the state in many other countries, it is an issue.

I join with Senator Malcolm Byrne in thanking my officials for also engaging.  There has been engagement between Committee and Report Stages.  I acknowledge the good faith with which Senators have engaged and thank them for it.</p> <p>This is an issue we have been grappling with, particularly in view of the fact that the purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the role of students and student engagement, to clarify opportunities for engagement and to give the HEA teeth where any issue regarding student unions, including their funding, is unresolved.  I want to see provisions in the Bill that will enable the HEA to pursue any HEI that does not respect the independence of a student union when it comes to funding.  I have seen examples where that has not happened at times, which I am not pleased about.  The Bill will present a new opportunity for those issues to be addressed robustly, recognising the independence and autonomy of student unions.  There is no disagreement on that, although it might suit some people to suggest there is.  Rather, there is a legislative process wherein we are grappling with what can and cannot be put into a Bill and we are looking at the legal advice in that regard.  We discussed the issue at great length in the D&aacute;il.  I have also discussed it directly with the Union of Students in Ireland, and I have sought legal advice on it from the Office of the Attorney General.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept the amendment, although I will explain why that is the reality and what the amendment would do versus what some people think it would do.</p> <p>One key method of addressing student unions&rsquo; autonomy is to utilise section 143.  Students now have such a section that will provide an opportunity to enforce student autonomy, an important point.  Section 143 will provide the HEA with powers relating to policies, codes and guidelines that it has not previously had.  I will work with Senators and student unions and we do not need to wait for changes of Ministers or governments or make reference to any other European country.  As soon as we get the Bill passed, we can get absolute clarity, in guidelines, policy and codes of practice from the HEA, about the autonomy and funding independence of our student unions, and we will do that.  The challenge is that the role of student unions and many other stakeholders is limited in the Bill  to the right to be consulted.  Where student unions and other stakeholders are referenced in this Bill, it is done in the context of the right to be consulted on a variety of areas, such as planning for the provision of higher education, the preparation of strategic development plans, the equality statement of the HEI and the preparation of guidelines, codes and policies.</p> <p>As my party colleague, Senator Dolan, reminds us, there is already a definition of student unions in both the Universities Act and in the Technological Universities Act 2018, while sections 106 and 117 of the Bill will insert mirror definitions of the section 2(1) definition of a student union into the Institutes of Technology Act and the National College of Art and Design Act 1971.  The legal concern is that any change to the definition of a student union in section 2(1) of the Bill, even though I accept it is done in good faith, would put the definition out of line with the definitions in the sectoral legislation.  There are broader definitions of a student union in other sectoral legislation that will come forward with this Bill, and if we endeavour to insert a prescriptive definition of a student union into this part of the Bill, we will knock it out of line with the existing definition in the Universities Act, the Institutes of Technology Act, the National College of Art and Design Act and the Technological Universities Act.</p> <p>I read somewhere that I had stated there was legal advice I could not share with the Seanad, but that is not what the record of the Seanad will show.  On Committee Stage, I relayed to Seanad &Eacute;ireann the legal advice I had received on this.  I very much stand over that advice.  The unintended consequences of the amendment would be detrimental to student unions; that is the genuine legal advice and view I have.  Section 143 will provide us with an opportunity to copper-fasten the rules of engagement, the structures in place and student unions' independence and autonomy regarding funding.</p> <p>The amendment relating to the citizens' assembly on the future of education proposes the inclusion of a new section that would provide for the Minister to lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the implementation of any recommendations from the citizens' assembly.  I am, of course, looking forward to the establishment of the citizens' assembly and to its recommendations.  Any recommendations can be incorporated under section 33, on the strategy for tertiary education, but considering the Citizens' Assembly has not yet been established, let alone reported, it would not be appropriate to put it in primary legislation in the way the amendment endeavours to do.</p></speech>

The Minister might clear up one issue for me.  As I know from my trade union days, there is always a risk of fringe groups.  I would hope the direction the HEA would give in the establishment of a student union is that it would be all-encompassing and that special interest groups would be encompassed within the union, and I would have no difficulty with the union being set up on that basis.  Any student body that would allow a student union to be set up without a formal election would be negligent, rather than the HEA or any other organisation like that.  I am concerned we are becoming more and more micro in different facets of life in Ireland, and what we do not need in any representative body are fringe groups or splits.  There is an old saying in Ireland that the first job of every committee is to sit down and organise the split.  We want student unions that represent all interests within the college, including all micro interests.  Other than that, I accept the Minister's position with respect to the amendment.</p></speech>

When he indicated the definition would be detrimental, is that purely because it would be out of line with that in the sectoral legislation?  In the context of what is the best possible definition of a student union, if making it out of line with that in the sectoral legislation is the only issue, there is no reason that, through legislation, we could not conduct keyhole surgery on other legislation to apply the new definition to earlier Acts.  If the definition in the amendment is better than what is in the sectoral legislation, we could still use this legislation to amend the definitions in earlier legislation.  Is this definition more accurate in regard to how student unions should be defined or are we pinning ourselves to old definitions just because they are not included in the Bill?  If the latter, that does not mean we cannot define them through this Bill.</p></speech>

It is our view, based on the legal advice we have, that the definition to be inserted in this legislation is too narrow compared with the existing definition.  As the Senator will be aware, the Universities Act, the Technological Universities Act, the National College of Art and Design Act and the Institutes of Technology Act will travel with this legislation and a broader definition is already outlined, so that is the first challenge.  The second challenge, which relates to a legal point on which I have been advised, is that this is the HEA Bill and its scope in regard to how it will interact relates to a consultative role, which does not, as the Senator will know better than I, fully capture in any way, shape or form everything a student union does and that we want it to do.  There is, perhaps, an argument for separate legislation on students and student unions, but it is for those reasons we do not believe it resides here.  There would be unintended consequences by narrowing our legal understanding of a student union.</p></speech>

I urge the Minister to accept this amendment as it is an exact copy of the definition the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, has in the circular economy Bill and is a much better reference point to sustainability than the current interpretation of "environmental development and sustainability".  Ireland helped negotiate the SDGs, they are a blueprint for how we live together on this fragile planet and to omit them in favour of an outdated and dangerous reference to sustainability is not acceptable. </p><p>On amendments Nos. 3 to 7, inclusive, the current interpretation of "environmental development and sustainability" in this Bill is not adequate, involves an outdated understanding of the concept and represents a backward step.  The Minister's Department informed Senator Higgins that the definition comes from the 1987 Brundtland report from the World Commission on Environment and Development.  This commission was dissolved in 1987 and predates the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement and the SDGs, which Ireland negotiated and which form the blueprint for how we might live together sustainably and equitably and share this planet. </p><p>I have proposed a number of amendments to it, including a straight deletion, as I believe it would be better not to use this definition, given how imprecise it is and how much it could undermine climate action in our higher education sector.  The reference to future generations is not in itself objectionable, but when it is the sole metric against which we measure what we do it is dangerous.  The climate crisis is not some faraway future crisis that we benevolently are deciding to begin to address out of the kindness of our hearts; it is here now and millions of people across the world are suffering and dying because of its effects.  If we look to Bangladesh we see approximately 10 million climate refugees as a result of floods; if we look to the Horn of Africa we see one person dying from hunger every 48 seconds and 5.7 million children being acutely malnourished.  This is not happening in a vacuum.  The climate crisis is already disrupting food supply across the African continent and in the immediate future the situation will worsen.</p><p>I have also proposed on behalf of Senator Higgins inserting "climate justice" into the definition and a recognition of historic responsibility for climate change and its effects on current populations.  This is to ensure that we have a recognition in our higher education sector and in the sectoral policies towards climate of our common but differentiated responsibilities and of our historic responsibility for emissions.  That is why the alternative interpretations we have suggested reference climate justice and historic responsibility for emissions.</p><p>I urge the Minister to accept one of these amendments because as it stands this language is regressive, outdated and dangerous if it is the frame for action on environmental development and sustainability in our education sector.</p><p>I withdraw amendment No. 13 as it was resubmitted in error.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#BB00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  I got the distinct impression in the other House when we made additions to the legislation in relation to environmental sustainability and climate that there was a view we had strengthened the legislation.  I do not generally name-check colleagues but Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh did significant work on this on Committee Stage to get it to a better place than I concede it was at when the Bill was published.</p> <p>Amendment No. 2 proposes to include a definition of the United Nations sustainable development goals in the Bill.  This definition is linked to the proposed amendment to section 2(3), which defines "environmental development and sustainability".  A number of amendments were made to the HEA Bill on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il which strengthened the provisions related to sustainable development in climate change, including the addition of the definition of "environmental development and sustainability" in the Bill, which was carefully considered and developed through the legal drafting process.</p> <p>I heard reference to the Brundtland report and Senator Higgins raised this with my officials yesterday.  We have engaged with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications to ensure that Department is satisfied with the appropriateness of it and it is.  The report of the United Nations Brundtland commission defined sustainability as "meet[ing] the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".  This definition encompasses the environmental aspects as well as the socioeconomic factors and is the most widely used and internationally accepted definition.  The definition is also referenced in our national strategy on education for sustainable development 2030, which we launched last week or the week before.  I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p> <p>I said in the other House that section 143 of the legislation allows guidelines to be developed in relation to climate action and environmental sustainability.  A fair few Deputies said that was all well and good but asked how I would guarantee that when the legislation passes the guidelines follow.  Accepting that we live in a climate emergency, I took the step of writing to the HEA in advance of the Bill passing - I can provide Senators with a copy of that letter if I have not already done so - specifically asking it to prepare to commence work on guidelines for sustainable development for designated institutions of higher education.  The HEA is aware that the first guideline and code we want it to produce under this legislation relates to environmental sustainability, climate action and climate justice.  I am using section 143 of the Bill, when enacted, to put in place what I think the Senator is trying to achieve, but through the guidelines and codes.</p></speech>

It is not to say the Bill has not been made better on previous Stages but it possibly has not been made its best.  The Seanad is trying to bring it to that next level of better.  We are hugely concerned by the outdated definition in the Bill.  I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

I am standing in to speak for my colleague Senator Warfield.</p> <p>The principle behind amendment No. 10 is the most important point that we would like to see reflected in the Bill.  Nowhere in the Bill makes any reference to the public nature of our higher education system.  The value of having a public education system cannot be overstated.  The public nature should also not be taken for granted.  We have seen the wholesale commercialisation of higher education over the past ten years, and in some cases piecemeal privatisation.  Most people would be shocked to know that more than one third of the primary school teachers we now train come from a single, for-profit, private college, that the same college is moving into nursing this year, or that we provide millions of euro in funding to private colleges through competitive funding.  This amendment represents a chance to draw a line in the sand.  The very limited reference to the public sector In the general scheme of the Bill, was taken out.</p> <p>In his briefing note on the Bill, the Minister highlighted the Bill's role in providing a pathway for private colleges to become designated institutes of higher education, which we discussed at a previous meeting.  This is also  included in the Long Title as one of the key aims of the Bill.  I understand that nothing in this Bill specifically states that designated institutes of higher education would be entitled to public funding, and having met with the Minister's Department to discuss this they assured me that this was not the intention.  The Bill, however, is full of references to the HEA's role in supporting designated institutes of higher education to deliver on X, Y, and Z.  This creates a huge amount of grey area.  Once private colleges become designated institutes of higher education they will want State funding.  They already get some &euro;20 million per year in public funding.  Their case will only be made stronger by this Bill as it currently stands.  This is why we really want to see that public nature of our higher education system referenced and protected by this Bill, in order to remove that ambiguity and replace a strong emphasis on the importance of maintaining a public higher education system.</p> <p>I will also speak to amendment No. 20, which is in this grouping.  The reason behind amendment No. 20 is that precarious employment has been allowed to spread throughout our higher education system.  Unfortunately, I am aware it is a factor in local universities and in Limerick.  There needs to be a specific reference that the HEA governance of the sector must relate to the working conditions of all workers in the sector.  According to the OECD, Ireland's student staff ratio is at 23.4:1.  This is far out of line with the OECD average of 15:1.  This can only be addressed by a new sustainable funding model.  In an effort to address the need to have student-facing staff, colleges have engaged occasional or hourly-paid lecturers.  These employees are not technically lecturers, as lecturing staff are defined those contracted to undertake a range of academic duties encompassing teaching, research contribution, and scholarly activity.  Across higher education, different job titles or terms are used to describe those engaged in this manner, including: part-time teaching assistants; part-time assistant lecturers; and occasional lecturers and so on.  Those engaged in this manner are usually on short fixed-term contracts, which only pay for their teaching.  In effect, we are talking about the extension of the gig economy to third level education.  It is not something that Sinn F&eacute;in would ever tolerate.  There is no opportunity for these people to engage in research work.  Being research active is core to the role of a lecturer in the higher education sector.  Trade unions have recently informed the committee that some institutes of higher education have failed to afford the terms of the public sector agreement to those engaged in this manner.  The precarious nature of their engagement is further compounded by the fact that there is no sectoral engagement on industrial relations matters across the university sector.  None of this will be new to the Minister and I hope that he will accept the amendment or at least the principle that the HEA should have a role in this area.</p> <p>I shall now speak to amendment No. 24, which is also included in this grouping.  Amendment No. 24 seeks to restore the existing area of section 4 of the 1971 Act, which explicitly charged the HEA with constantly bearing in mind the attainment of the national aims regarding Irish.  It rewords this as an objective with specific reference to promoting Irish-medium higher education.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Bill as it currently stands removes this national aim from legislation.

An incredible thing about Ireland and our third level system is the amount of funding we have been able to draw down due to the excellence of our principal investigators, PIs, and researchers.  They draw awards from the Exchequer, through Science Foundation Ireland, the Irish Research Council, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, Teagasc and all our national funding agencies.  They also draw down funding at an international level because our researchers are competing at that international level.  We are now able to ensure that we offer more PhD and post-doctoral posts.  We are training more people at third level.  This is possible because of the excellence and ability to draw down funding, including from Horizon Europe, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health, NIH.  We have researchers who are winning that funding in their own right.  That funding is available for three or four years.  When this funding is garnered through an institution, one can then take on researchers, post-doctoral staff, PhD and masters students.  They are able to gain experience through an institution.  We need to ensure with this Higher Education Authority Bill that researchers working on these awards have their full rights when working in an institution.  It is incredible to see the increase in the number of researchers.  We need to ensure that contract researchers in higher education institutes and universities have full rights.</p></speech>

Ireland is unusual in that about 95% of students attend publicly-funded or public institutions, which is different to most other countries.  We have one of the highest third level education participation rates in the world, with about 62% of 18-to-20-year age cohort attending.  As for the money Senator Gavan pointed out as going to private institutions, it includes funding for institutions such as the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, which funds students attending courses.  Private colleges such as Hibernia fulfil a specific need for people who want to take up those courses.  While we are not talking about public funding going to Hibernia, I think we need to look at extending student grants to support students.</p></speech>

We are resuming Report and Final Stages of the Higher Education Authority Bill 2022.  We were discussing amendments Nos. 10 to 12, inclusive; and Nos. 14 to 27, inclusive.  Senator Malcolm Byrne was in possession.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#GG00300"><p>My concern relates to the fact that we have a small number of private higher education providers that meet a need within the State.  I am a big supporter of the public education system.  Senator Gavan seems to suggest that these providers are somehow damaging our education system.  They are not; they are supplementing it.  The SUSI grant scheme should be extended to those other institutions.  Some of them, such as the Royal College of Surgeons and the National College of Ireland, are what you might call halfway-house institutions.  The Minister will be aware of the various issues we discussed around designation in this regard.  While asserting the public nature of our system, at the same time, we must recognise the importance of the role of a number of the private providers.  Those private providers are still subject to the same requirements that Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, set out with regard to the quality of the qualifications that need to be provided.</p> <p>I accept that amendment No. 15, which was tabled the Independent Senators, relates to the transparent use of public money.  This reinforces what the legislation is about.  The Bill legislation is about accountability regarding the use of public money.  What is proposed is simply changing some of the wording but it is a very clear acknowledgement of what the legislation is about.  It is not about academic autonomy; it is very much about the questions of financial accountability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#GG00400"><p>I have a number of amendments in this grouping.  As I understand it, the amendment put forward by Senator Gavan is not about discouraging other areas.  It seems to be about promoting, protecting and enhancing the public aspect, which is an important aspect.  Again, it is a positively framed amendment in that regard.</p> <p>All of my amendments relate to the objects and functions of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  This is really important because it sets the agenda that will transform.  We will come to some of the details on the functions later.  These amendments seek to influence the setting of the tone.</p> <p>Regarding amendments Nos. 11 and 12, the current high-level aim of the HEA is outlined as leading the strategic development of the Irish higher education and research system with the object of creating a coherent system of diverse institutions with distinct missions that is responsive to the social, cultural and economic development of Ireland and its people and supports the achievement of national objectives.  I am concerned that in the new set of objects, the idea of a coherent system of diverse institutions with distinct missions is not there in the same way.  We will come to some of the amendments in respect of diversity within institutions, staff and students and how it works but the institutions themselves have very diverse roles.  The National College of Art and Design and NUI Galway are very different.  This is not just about the question of autonomy but the fact that there is a value in having diverse institutions with distinct missions and the fact that when it comes to many areas of policy, one size does always not fit all and different things are brought by different institutions.  Something that may be missing compared with the current aims of the HEA is that acknowledgement of the value in diversity not just within but between institutions and the fact that they may have very distinct missions.  This should be celebrated, promoted and stated at the highest level.  We have equality of opportunity, diversity and inclusion in higher education.  That is internal but there is a value in how the idea that institutions have distinct missions and being diverse is framed within the HEA currently and it should be carried through into the objects of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s.</p> <p>Amendment No. 14 relates to the language in the Bill.  It is currently specified that one of the objectives of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s is to support designated institutions in contributing to social, economic, cultural and environmental development and sustainability through leadership, innovation and agility.  On one level, you could say there is a potential overlap between innovation and agility.  I have a concern in that agility is a very undefined term.  In respect of some other concepts that sound good and for which we fought for years, for example, flexibility in the workplace, I would have understood this from a work-life balance perspective when I was working with the National Women's Council of Ireland and others.  However, this became quite different in the understanding of employers when they were promoting non-fixed hours contracts.  Similarly, the term "agility" is ambiguous.  Innovation is already supported.  We should think of public as well as private innovation because public research plays a key role in innovation.  Innovation is important but having agility in there seems to be underscoring and emphasising.  It matches a concern I will discuss later when we come to the question of the functions of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  There is a bit of duplication.  When you put similes alongside each other, you feel something is getting an extra push compared to other things.  Innovation and agility are alongside each other.  When we come to section 9(1)(f) on the functions of the HEA, we see a reference to meeting the educational and skills needs of individuals, business, enterprise and the professions.  Again, business and enterprise are being framed differently and placed in front of the professions.  There is a concern that it could lead to a greater weighting in terms of a certain approach.  We do not want the long-term transformative work of our universities in front-line research and intellectual exploration that lay the foundations for the future to be subsumed in terms of the needs of enterprise or the skills the market is telling us it needs in the next two, three or five years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why I am a little concerned about the use of the word "agility" and replaced it with the word "excellence".  The word "excellence" is mentioned elsewhere in the functions and is a better word than "agility" here.  Also, I wish to note that the word "excellence" is referenced for research but not teaching. </p><p>On amendments Nos. 15 and 16, students' unions and other representative groups have highlighted and expressed concerns about the term "value for money" as it is used throughout the legislation.  The term is outdated because the general focus in public spending is now on effectiveness, efficiency and impact.  Even within procurement, we work in the wider frame of the most economically advantageous tender whereas a value-for money frame can often be quite a narrow remit.  Sometimes the ways that value for money tend to be measured can be extremely narrow and can lean towards a short-term frame of thinking rather than a long-term frame of thinking for outcomes, results, impacts and effects of educational spending, which will not always come through in respect of a short-term balance sheet but have very significant impacts on society.  The investment is education but the benefits and returns accrued do not always come through with a very narrow value-for-money frame.  In that regard, I have sought to replace it with an obligation to: "ensure that designated higher education institutions are transparent in their use of public money and that such monies are used in a sustainable and ethical manner".  Sustainability and ethics are crucial in terms of moneys.  Let us consider the basic principles such as the important campaigns for divestment in higher education institutions.  If value for money is the primary frame then initiatives such as divestment become more difficult.  The language I have used in amendment No. 15 is a much clearer obligation and refers to sustainability and ethics.  The EU due diligence directive is coming but is not strong enough.  The global direction of travel must be towards a joined-up analysis of how money is spent.</p><p>I have used the word "sustainable" in a separate way, rather than referencing, and I will not repeat the concerns expressed by my colleague.  I am extremely concerned about this matter so if there is a re-evaluation of matters in this legislation then I urge the insertion of an up-to-date and appropriate definition of environmental development and sustainability rather than going back to something from 1987, which is before the Rio Earth Summit took place in 1992, in terms of environmental development and sustainability.  Crucially, at present we are leaving out and not using the available definition of "sustainable" from the UN sustainable development goals that Ireland negotiated.  Ireland, along with Kenya, led the negotiation of what sustainability should look like globally and persuaded hundreds of other countries to sign up to that.  So obviously we should use that definition.  If we are able and confident enough to ask all the countries of the world to sign up then that we should be willing to use the definition ourselves when we talk about sustainability.  That is an important matter and not an academic one.  The definition in the Bill, which I am sure has already been discussed, only talks about the present moment and the future yet does not look to things like historical responsibilities,  In that regard, it is out of step with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and the recognition of respective responsibilities, capacities and capabilities.  That is why I have framed "sustainable" in a different way here and think that it needs to be underscored within the legislation separate from the definition that was provided in the definitions section.  I hope that we can change the definition even at this late stage.</p><p>I believe I have discussed the matter addressed in amendment No. 16.  On amendment No. 17, the Minister highlighted the issues.  He has indicated that he is willing to engage on these issues that concern amendments Nos. 17 and 18.</p><p>Section 8(1)(d) provides for the authority "to advance equality of opportunity, diversity and inclusion in higher education".  Equality is wider than just equality of opportunity, which the Minister has acknowledged.  As section 8 lists the top-tier objects of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, it is really important that equality is at its centre, and equality in the widest sense, because that will have a cascade effect later in the Bill.  Amendment No. 17 seeks the deletion of the caveat "of opportunity" so we have equality in its widest sense, including  equality of outcome.</p><p>Similarly, amendment No. 18 seeks to insert "equity" after "equality" as equity does different work from equality.  The acceptance of the amendment would be a constructive move forward, would be consistent with some parts of the Bill that try to give practical effect to equality measures and would set a better frame for equality measures later in the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 19 seeks to provide for the value of participation within higher education, which is important.  These amendments deal with equality, diversity, participation and inclusion.</p><p>One thing in which an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s has a role, as have all universities, is both inclusion for those who are there and ensuring wider participation in universities.  I make that point in the knowledge that the overall purpose of the Bill is to widen and deepen participation.  I attended the Traveller Pride Awards ceremony earlier today and presented an award to Jason Sherlock of the Minc&eacute;irs Whiden Society of the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG.  The society does really important work.  Such societies, in working with the college on, for example, the Universities of Sanctuary initiative, have both worked to create inclusion within the university community and have driven and actively promoted wider participation in universities, and have reached out in that way.  Therefore, it would be appropriate to insert this provision in section 8(1)(d) as it refers to the objects of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 are fundamentally important.  I am sure that other Senators have spoken about academic freedom.</p></speech>

I am sure that it will continue to be discussed and debated further.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 refer to academic freedom for both staff and students in the objects of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Amendment No. 21 seeks to insert "and protect" after the word "respect.  This section is the appropriate place to include this because academic freedom is set at a high level in terms of functions, which can have the appropriate effect elsewhere.  There have been and will be debates on it going in and from my perspective, we will come to that.  The equality statement performs a specific function but it is important to recognise that both staff and students, I have in mind some PhD. students, do really important, transformative and challenging work.  For example, human rights work is being done in different institutions such as the Irish Centre for Human Rights, NUIG, as well as work being done on front-line human rights defenders in Trinity College, Dublin, and elsewhere.</p></speech>

I suppose we will get into the detail on functions later.  It is about making sure that things have a cascading effect throughout the legislation.</p><p>Amendment No. 25 is important.  I arrived when the debate was under way.  It seems this issue has already been the subject of some discussion.  It relates to the importance of public research for the public good, which addresses social and environmental needs.  This is not to the detriment of any individual institution.  There are important and diverse institutions in the State that are doing important work.  However, we need to be honest that there has been a worrying trend and emphasis, and occasionally a reliance, on private sector investment and partnerships in the third level sector.  This is the result of prolonged underfunding of the higher education.  While they have an important role to play, we must place an emphasis on investing in public research for the public good.  Regrettably, this has not been the case.  Talented postgraduates in science, arts and humanities often have to leave Ireland to continue their research overseas or give up their research ambitions due to the lack of funding.  There are research topics which are important and may be the basis of key theoretical work that provides transformation in the long run may not be commercially profitable or have an immediately deliverable outcome.  These can be left aside although they may be crucial in addressing the social and environmental challenges and needs faced by society.</p><p>I emphasise this because there is a lacuna.  I hate to have to put it that way.  In amendment No. 26, I have specifically named the issue of public-public partnerships for research between designated higher education institutions and public bodies, both in Ireland and internationally.  With the assistance of Deputies, because, of course, Senators cannot do so directly, I have put forward a number of parliamentary questions on public-public research.  I hate to say that the first two question came back with a response as to whether I meant public-private research.  The assumption had been that I had made an error and accidentally wrote the word "public" twice.  That answer came back a second time.  It was only in the context of a third, very lengthy and specific parliamentary question that I got any information in respect of the public-public research that is or might be happening.  I highlighted this to the Minister's predecessor, former Minister of State Mary Mitchell O'Connor.</p><p>I am concerned that many universities have memorandums of understanding around how they will form partnerships with private companies.  Some of the new scholarships and grants in science and technology are partnerships with business that the State subsidises.  However, public-public research has been left in the second tier.  I had the opportunity, as a member of the finance committee, to discuss this with the EU Commission this morning.  When it comes to the challenges we face in areas such as climate change, the environment or Covid, we cannot rely on public-private partnerships.  We saw with the failure to deliver the TRIPS waiver what happens when states channel all their public money into private partnerships rather than public research for the public good.  On climate, many of the most important actions we take may not be profitable for anyone but may deliver the changes we need.  They may cost everyone something but they may be what we need to survive on this very fragile planet which has had ten of the hottest years in 100,000 years over the past decade.  It is in that context that I emphasise this.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment and that we might have a new approach on public-public research.  Let it not be the poor relation in the research agenda in future.</p><p>The Minister is looking at a research agenda in the future so I am highlighting now that this is crucial.  Public innovation has the potential to go to scale, transfer to other countries and to have technology transferred to developing countries more quickly.  We can bring solutions to scale at a higher level, more quickly and share them with more of the world, if we track the sustainable development goals and other goals, if we do so on a public basis with public ownership.</p><p>Is amendment No. 27 in this group?</p></speech>

I have already made this point.  It is in line with Article 4.1(g) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which specifies that all parties to the agreement, which includes Ireland, should:</p> <blockquote> 	Promote and cooperate in scientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and other research, systematic observation and development of data archives related to the climate system and intended to further the understanding and to reduce or eliminate the remaining uncertainties regarding the causes, effects, magnitude and timing of climate change and the economic and social consequences of various response strategies. </blockquote> <p>One of the European Union's greatest moral, humanitarian and diplomatic errors ever has been its failure to share technology around Covid-19 vaccines.</p></speech>

I thank the Senators for taking me through the amendments.  I will start on research while it is fresh in my mind.  I have announced our intention to bring forward a research Bill close to January 2023.  That will be a really important opportunity.  It will be the first time that the State will introduce stand-alone legislation relating to research.  There will be an opportunity in that legislation to explore public-public partnerships and some of the broad and legitimate issues Senator Higgins highlighted.  I expect that the Bill will be before the Houses next year.</p> <p>Amendment No. 10 is in the names of Senator Gavan and his colleagues.  The Senator acknowledged that there is nothing in the Bill that in any way tries to undermine the public nature of the higher education system.  He is asking why we do not explicitly state that we intend to protect and enhance its public nature.  There are two answers to that.  First, we must be very clear about the tapestry that forms higher education in Ireland.  I am the Minister who has taken student loans off the table.  This is a Government which very clearly believes that education is a public good.  We want to invest more of public funds in our education system.  It might not suit some narratives but we are very clear on the idea that education is a public good and that increased Exchequer investment and no student loans is the way to go, along with reducing student costs and charges.  The next budget is our first chance to show form on that.  However, we must also be truthful.  I could point to representations from most Members of this House and of the Lower House asking why we are not providing funding for this not-for-profit college or for that private college that is responding to a particular need.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In fact, I believe there are amendments coming up in legislation asking me to extend provision of student grants to private and, in some cases, to private-for-profit colleges.  We are providing a pathway to designation.  Senator Malcolm Byrne referred to the issue in respect of the National College of Ireland.  This legislation allows colleges for the first time to put up their hand to say they wish to be designated.  Designation does not correlate with funding but relates to quality and to protection for students.  I wanted to be clear in respect of that.  This legislation when passed mandates a strategy for tertiary education.  This will be an opportunity to further flesh out those details.</p><p>I thank Senator Dolan for her contribution and for reflecting on her own experience as a researcher.  Again, our research legislation will provide a chance to do some further exploration of that.</p><p>On amendments Nos. 11 and 12, I want to be very clear that diversity of our higher education system is one of its strengths.  That is the balance we were trying to protect in this.  We are recognising that there is a diversity and the policy intent of the Bill is very clearly to maintain diversity within and among higher education institutions.  Section 35 of the Bill specifically refers to this because it mandates for the preparation of a performance framework for higher education and research.  This section provides that the HEA shall, in preparing a performance framework, take account: "of the diversity of functions, objects and priorities of different higher education providers".  The reference to "the diversity of functions" was specifically included in section 35, following engagement with the higher education sector.  This sector itself asked us to move on this, to be truthful, and we have included diversity there for the reasons outlined by Senator Higgins and, as I said, at the request of the university and higher education sector.  That section addresses the proposed intent of this amendment.</p><p>On amendment No. 14, which proposes the replacement of the word &ldquo;agility&rdquo; with &ldquo;excellence&rdquo;, we had engagement on this and I see the benefit of that engagement coming through in some of the comments because, as was said, we read the legislation and recognise the word &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; is used in the previous object and, therefore, we consider the issue of excellence to be addressed in the objects already.  The word &ldquo;agility&rdquo;, and I accept the word "agility" and the lack of definition, was included in the object to emphasise the need for higher education institutions to be agile and responsive in contributing to social, economic, cultural, and environmental development and sustainability.  We believe that having &ldquo;excellence&rdquo; in the previous object and &ldquo;agility&rdquo; in this section makes sense but we may agree to differ on that.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 propose to delete one of our objects and replace it with an alternative wording.  It is important the current object is retained in order to ensure that the higher education institutions are accountable for their performance and use of the substantial Exchequer funding which they receive.  There are, however, a number of provisions in the Bill which could be used to ensure that designated institutions of higher education spend Exchequer funding in an ethical and sustainable manner, including conditions of funding, data collection, reporting provisions, guidelines, codes and practices.</p><p>On amendment No. 17, Senator Higgins is correct in that we engaged on this on Committee Stage and I have considered it because the issue of equality versus equality of opportunity are two different things.  There is no point in arguing to the contrary; it is a statement of fact.  I have gone back and have spoken to the drafters and to our legal counsel on this.  We are satisfied that we have specific reference to equality in the legislation.  The Senator has acknowledged that and we have equality statements, which we have discussed.  On equality of opportunity, there are two reasons that phrase should remain.  First, we believe in this instance that it is a more targeted phrase because we are specifically talking about opportunity and equality of opportunity.  This is not a political spectrum argument of equality versus equality of opportunity.  We are trying to ensure that opportunity is to the fore here and that there is value in opportunity.  Second, and as importantly, we cannot read the legislation in isolation.  We are trying to mirror provisions within the sectoral legislation which travels with this.  As the Senator will know, that phrase also appears in the Universities Act 1997 and Technological Universities Act 2018.  There is always a risk for both myself and for Senators that when we read parts of legislation in isolation rather than with the sectoral legislation, we can perhaps miss what we are trying to achieve here.</p><p>On the words &ldquo;equity&rdquo; and &ldquo;participation&rdquo;, we believe the provision as drafted covers equity and participation.  We are using the words &ldquo;equality, diversity and inclusion&rdquo;, EDI, because it has now become very established parlance and there is a very clear understanding right across the sector and among all of us about the EDI agenda and the work that needs to be done there.  There is obviously a very strong emphasis in the Bill on equity and I believe the Senator would recognise that as well.</p><p>On the issue of participation, section 46 of the Bill provides that the HEA shall prepare a: &ldquo;strategic action plan ...  providing for equity of access ... and participation and the promotion of success in, higher education.&rdquo;  The Bill is not silent on equity or on participation, not that the Senator is suggesting it is.</p><p>On amendment No. 20, a very important issue is being raised here about working conditions, pay and, as Senator Gavan said, precarious employment.  There is a real problem with precarious employment in the third level sector.  The way to address that is through properly funding the sector and, in return for funding the sector, making sure the sector addresses both student and staff ratios and the issue of precarious employment.  The Funding our Future implementation group, which we have established and which is chaired by myself, Professor Anne Looney and Professor Tom Collins, has specifically set about improving the ratios of staff to students and to reducing precarious employment as a key metric on which we will measure ourselves and the system&rsquo;s success in return for the additional investment we expect to be able to begin to make after the next budget in September.  From a somewhat legalistic point of view, we believe that this would be the wrong place to insert this provision, considering there is employment legislation, and the likes already in place.  I share the view of the Senator in tackling precarious employment but I do not believe this is the right place to set it.  I am, however, absolutely determined to tackle, and to work with the sector on, precarious employment.</p><p>We had a lengthy debate on academic freedom in this House and I presume we will have another one in a while.  We had one in the other House too and it is quite right and proper that we do so, which I do not say in a flippant way.  One of the most important foundation stones of a democracy is academic freedom.  I certainly hope we all, across the political spectrum, value academic freedom, and I think this country we do value it.  Academic freedom is provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act, in section 10 of the Technological Universities Act and in section 5A of the Institute of Technologies Acts 1992 to 2006.  This Bill does not amend these provisions in respect of academic freedom, so they travel with it.  I cannot stress that point enough.  The absolute legislative provisions and the law in respect of academic freedom, which already exists in those three pieces of statutory legislation, come with us in respect of this Bill.  Therefore, academic freedom is absolutely protected.  This amendment with regard to protecting academic freedom is, therefore, deemed to be already addressed in the Bill.  As I said, it is important the HEA Bill is read in conjunction with sectoral legislation.</p><p>There is a provision in sectoral legislation for independent dispute resolution to resolve any disputes and student unions, together with staff associations, are required to be consulted on the preparation of any dispute resolution processes.</p><p>This Bill has been significantly strengthened in respect of the Irish language.  We brought forward more amendments after engagement in the other House, and I mention Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh in this regard.  I believe we brought forward approximately 20 amendments on the language.  I am very satisfied with it and I want to thank Conradh na Gaeilge for its work.  I do not view it necessary, therefore, to accept further amendments in respect of the Irish language.</p></speech>

He did well to get back on all of those amendments.  I wish to make a couple of points.  The Minister is right that we support this Bill.  I very much acknowledge the point made by him on grants.  The announcement earlier this year was very welcome in that we will not being going down the loans route.  Our amendment were to protect and enhance the public nature of the higher education system and the reason we believe that is important was best exemplified by Senator Malcolm Byrne's response, where he clearly has no problem with an enhanced role for the private sector in education.  That is fine and is an ideological difference between us.  We believe in enhancing the public role ahead of the private role.  Parties on the right, which traditionally support privatisation and outsourcing, like Fianna F&aacute;il, take a very different view.  That is why I highlighted the fact that one third of our teachers are now being produced via a private for-profit teaching college.  To me, that is not the way to go and is a prime example of the commodification of third level education.  That is not the way we should go.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is an ideological difference between us - a left-right difference.</p><p>I appreciate that the Minister has said there is a problem with precarious work.  It is important that he acknowledged this because Senator Dolan did not do so.  Anyone involved in third level education knows there is a massive problem with precarious work, people having short-term contracts and having those contracts terminated.  It is a major disincentive to their staying in the system.  That is why we wanted to include the clause about decent pay and good working conditions for academics, including PhD researchers, a very important area which is really not working as it should be at the moment, and non-academic staff in designated institutions of higher education.  Those are my points, but I do welcome some of the responses from the Minister.</p></speech>

I am referring to the issue of academic freedom.  Senator Higgins's similar amendment to section 8 refers to the specific issue of the academic freedom of students.  I take on board what the Minister said about existing legislation that needs to be read in parallel with this legislation regarding guarantees of academic freedom.  However, my amendment to section 8 seeks to include the idea of the academic freedom of students when we are talking about the objects of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Among the listed objects is &quot;to respect the academic freedom of higher education providers and academic staff in those providers&quot;.  There is no reference to students.  Senator Higgins and I have proposed amendments to that line.  Hers is slightly different from my effort, but the end point would be the same.  It would cover the academic freedom, not just of higher education providers and academic staff, but also the academic freedom of students.</p><p>This legislation recasts the situation that existed heretofore regarding the HEA and stands alongside existing legislation on higher education.  The Bill rightly covers new ground and increasingly important is the need to recognise, promote and defend the academic freedom of students.  On Committee Stage, I set out the reasons for doing so.  I said it was not just a matter of equality.  In another place I have proposed that an equality statement would involve reporting back on colleges' policy on promoting the academic freedom of students.  It is also a matter of quality.  What makes higher education higher education and what makes a university a university is that they provide a place for people to explore new ideas and possibilities, sometimes in ways that make us uncomfortable or challenge the <i>status quo</i>and establishment thinking.</p><p>On a previous occasion, I stated that if a student or postgraduate researcher wanted to engage in studies in areas that might challenge current orthodoxies, for example, on the issue of climate change, a university is precisely the place where there should be freedom to do that kind of thing.  Increasingly, we live in a world where there can often be a chilling effect on the free expression and exploration of ideas.  That can happen in informal ways in university campuses, but it can also happen where power is exercised academically.  As a result, it is important for the legislation to address the issue of academic freedom of students.</p><p>On the previous occasion, I mentioned the increasing challenge by inter-institutional links of an international nature.  I mentioned the joint colleges, the joint delivery of courses with China and so on, questions about the human rights, human dignity and academic freedom of Chinese people coming here to study in centres which are partly or possibly completely funded, partly controlled and perhaps completely controlled ultimately by the Chinese Communist Party.  We need much more discussion than we have had to date about how Confucius Institutes operate and are funded.  Last year we had controversy about how Chinese is taught and examined at leaving certificate level.</p><p>We are in a very complex and delicate situation, and it is important that legislation on higher education is not just set in traditional narrow ways about what academic freedom is but actually addresses new challenges and new problems.  Part of that involves recognising and promoting academic freedom of students.  That should be done with an eye to potential problems of an international nature, of a global nature and of an economic nature.  It should also be done because we recognise that the environment we live in is not always one where people are free to explore ideas.  This legislation should be about guaranteeing the quality of what our universities and higher education institutions can do for people and can do for our community, our society and our world.</p><p>Promoting and guaranteeing excellence is what that is all about.  That is why so many of the universities were concerned about the precise way in which their autonomy and independence are to be respected.  We had other debates about other sections and amendments and no doubt we will return to them.  However, the academic freedom of students is pretty central.  I do not understand why the Minister would not accept the amendment to section 8 concerning the objects of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  If the objects of an t&uacute;dar&aacute;s include education providers and academic staff in those providers, why is there no reference to students in that context?</p></speech>

In a very enlightened way this recognises the idea of student unions and their participation in the life of universities.  Just as governing bodies and recognised institutions must respect academic freedom, so also must student unions.  It is wrong that any students should face intellectual boycotts, defunding of their societies or whatever because of pressure from a student union seeking to force some of its number to conform to particular ideological goals.  From that point of view, what Senator Mullen has said deserves considerable thought.  His amendment should be accepted.</p> <p>Regarding academic freedom and the use of short-term contracts, I happen to have some second-hand but fairly accurate observation of the effect of those short-term contracts in universities.  There was a time, I think it was in this House, that the great Michael Tierney was called to book for using short-term contracts and denial of tenure.  A visitor was appointed to University College Dublin to investigate whether that was happening.  On occasion, some people who have tenure in universities preach what they do not quite practice themselves regarding performance targets for younger academics and research targets that they never actually achieved themselves and certainly do not implement.  I ask the Minister to consider the fact that academic freedom is seriously infringed by giving people short-term contracts.</p></speech>

It has been seven months since the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community published its report and four months since I addressed the D&aacute;il on its recommendations.  I thank members of the committee, as well as those of the previous committee that came before us, the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the clerk to the committee, Mr. Leo Bollins, for all their hard work in making this report possible.</p> <p>The key recommendations came from national and local Traveller organisations and activists to make sure we have equality of opportunity in Irish society.  The committee report offers 84 recommendations in four main areas, which include education, particularly at second and third level, employment, accommodation and, most importantly in my opinion, mental and physical health.  Today, I hope we will receive a clearer picture of where we stand in respect of the implementation of the recommendations, most of which are not new.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What we are seeking for Travellers is very simple - inclusive education, delivered health services, especially mental health, safe and culturally appropriate accommodation and an equal chance in employment.  We have seen too many reports and studies that highlighted how Travellers have been failed in these areas.  I genuinely hope this will be the last time I will have to discuss this report and no actions being taken.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I said at the launch of this report, it is not reports or debates that changes things, it is action.  A lack of action would mean a loss of hope for many Travellers who need these actions to be implemented as soon as possible.</p><p>I will not go through all 84 recommendations.  I will discuss two very important ones for now.  There are certain key areas that would provide structure for change that will finally bring the Traveller community the services and supports we deserve.  We must establish a national Traveller accommodation authority to oversee the development and implementation of Traveller accommodation policy.  The current system of local authority provision of accommodation for Travellers has not worked and will not work.  Time and again we have been failed by local authorities.  Between 2008 and 2019, local authorities left more than &euro;72 million unspent on Traveller accommodation, yet the accommodation needs of the Traveller community are still serious.  Who will be held to account for Traveller families living in homeless accommodation, unsafe accommodation and overcrowded accommodation?  The call for a national Traveller accommodation authority was in the expert review of Traveller accommodation in 2019.  The then Minister committed to it.</p><p>The second recommendation is the most important, in my opinion.  There must be a national Traveller mental health strategy with a ring-fenced budget.  There must be clear timelines for delivery in mental health.  We need a national Traveller mental health strategy steering group in partnership with all key stakeholders and, most importantly, Travellers, to oversee its development and implementation.  The critical voice of the national Traveller mental health network must be at the heart of this steering group.  The Government promised a national Traveller mental health strategy in the current programme for Government.  Only a stand-alone strategy will turn the tide in the mental health crisis in our community.  If we get one commitment from the Minister today, would we be able to discuss the stand-alone strategy in the programme for Government?  Is it not ironic that there are three Ministers of State with responsibility for health, including mental health, as well as the Minister, yet there is extremely little action when it comes to Traveller mental health?  Could the Minister tell us what is happening with these recommendations and the implementation of the mental health strategy?</p><p>I will hand over to Senator Higgins.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#NN00200"><p>There are more than 80 recommendations in the report.  They are very strong and they cover all areas of life because, sadly, Travellers in Ireland have experienced systematic disadvantage, discrimination and very bad consequences across many areas of life.  We are not speaking to all of them here.</p> <p>I would like to speak to some of the areas, such as education because that is a crucial one.  I note the award for the NUI Galway Minc&eacute;irs Whiden Society, and that transformation is needed in every level of education.  However, the issues have been left again and again and have now become a crisis, and that is why there is the focus today on the mental health issues Senator Flynn outlined and housing issues.  If there is a housing crisis in Ireland, there has been a long-time Traveller accommodation crisis.  What is particularly notable about it is that rather endeavouring to solve it, we have seen local authorities across Ireland going out of their way to not address and solve it.  That is seen in the &euro;72 million that was not even drawn down by local authorities over the decade from 2008 to 2019.  When funding is available, that is an active choice to not even seek to address the Traveller accommodation crisis.</p> <p>The issues which we have seen and which exist as a consequence of the failure over decades to address them include overcrowding.  The Irish Traveller Movement has counted more than 1,400 Traveller families nationally who are living in overcrowded accommodation.  That is invisible in some of the homelessness figures because people support and will support families and each other, so there are families who are doubling up and having to share their bays in halting sites and rooms in housing.  There is a very significant gap.  As regards the 1,400 that are in overcrowded accommodation, we know that the number is probably much more but it is not being captured.  Travellers are over-represented in emergency accommodation in the State.  Again, we do not have all the figures we should have for this because the ethnicity of Travellers is not often recorded in homelessness figures nationally.  Local authorities and the Government therefore often do not have a full picture of the needs of Travellers.</p> <p>If we look to where we have such figures, in 2019 some 25% of homeless children in emergency accommodation outside Dublin were Travellers and 13% of homeless adults were Travellers.  That is a quarter of all the homeless children.  Consider what that means for a homeless child in terms of access to education.  Think of the incredible promise we are losing, the opportunities and the brilliant young people who are not getting to exercise their full opportunities in education because they are in those situations.</p> <p>Again, there are consequences in terms of sanitation.  Due to the lack of proper provision, many people are living on unofficial sites.  The sanitation units on both official and unofficial sites are often deeply inadequate.  We saw that in the particular impact that Covid-19 had on Travellers and, indeed, in outbreaks of other diseases which we should not have to face in this State.</p> <p>To conclude, a national Traveller accommodation authority is promised and is needed.  This is not being addressed at local level.  It has to be a national issue and must be addressed nationally.  We must also ensure that as new development plans are made across the country that Traveller accommodation of high quality, that is inclusive and positive, is central for the State.  This is a crucial recommendation.</p></speech>

I congratulate everyone who was involved in writing this report.  I was not there when it was being done, but I congratulate them on the incredible recommendations.  I will not speak about writing the report because I was not part of it.</p> <p>It is very important that we are discussing minority communities today.  Every time we speak about minority communities in the House it is not just about speaking about them but having a little extra layered in and understanding a little more each time about how to work best to empower our friends who come from minority communities.  I do not stand here and pretend that I know all the issues because I do not.  I never will know all the issues, but I will do my very best through debates like this to learn, take it on board, expand my knowledge and advocate as best I can.  Like my colleagues, I often get frustrated when a policy is launched, activated, sets out goals and there is funding allocated to it, but the goals of that policy are not achieved.  That happens on so many things, particularly on Traveller issues.  There is so much money that it is a mortal sin, as my mother would say, that this funding for Traveller accommodation was not drawn down by local authorities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What is wrong there?  Governments gave that money and it was not spent.  We must look at each of those national policies and ask the experts why those policies did not work and why, when the local authorities or whoever else were given the opportunity, whether that was the regional health authority or whoever, that did not translate into proper change and assistance for people who need it from all minority communities.</p><p>We are all equal, but what we need now is more about equity.  We need to build equality into the system because, clearly, there is an issue whereby minority communities, specifically Travellers in the context of this debate, do not feel as though they have equitable access to many services, and they do not.  I have just returned from the launch of Fianna F&aacute;il's women's health policy at which representatives from Pavee Point, having contributed to the policy, spoke.  I was very struck to learn the life expectancy of a Traveller woman is her early 60s.  What a loss it is to our country when we lose women at that rate.  There is no data collection on specific Traveller healthcare needs.  Ten thousand women gave birth in the Rotunda last year and 2,000 of them received mental health supports.  How many of those 2,000 were from the Traveller community?  We do not know because we are not collecting those data.  A total of &euro;350 million was specifically allocated in respect of Traveller mental health.  We need to know and ensure that this money is specifically targeted, that it works and that we are empowering communities and building up people to be their best.  None of us is any better or worse than anyone else; it is the chances and opportunities we get that allow us to get even better chances and opportunities.</p><p>Significant funding has been given, and while we need a lot more, we also need change in how it is delivered.  Change can be facilitated from the top down, but it must come from the communities and those communities need to be empowered and assisted to help themselves and one another, and to help everyone else understand how we can make this society fairer and more equal.  I thank everybody who was involved in producing the report.  I have not yet got through it all but I congratulate each of them.  I look forward to working on it and ensuring the 80-odd recommendations will be implemented.</p></speech>

I have had the great privilege of being a member of committees that dealt with Traveller accommodation and other issues on this occasion and on previous occasions, including at local authority level.  I am sure the Minister will have read the report, particularly given that he approaches these issues head-on.  One important issue we in the committee highlighted in the report, which Senator Flynn mentioned earlier, related to the fact we want implementation at this stage.  Enough quantitative and qualitative analysis has been done.  The issues have been highlighted and a programme of actions is what is required at this stage.  I do not think it merits further scrutiny, given the issues are blindingly obvious to most people.  In fact, they were blindingly obvious even without the committee's work, but we have an empirical basis for them now.</p> <p>Of the four key issues, I might begin with employment.  Unemployment among the Traveller community stands at 80.2%, but it would be a racist myth to suggest that 80.2% of the Traveller community do not want to work or do not want jobs.  Like in all sections of the community, there will be some people who do not have the capacity, but the point is we have to break that glass ceiling.  It was necessary to do so in the area of women's participation in politics through quotas and so on, and we are doing to have to do likewise here.  In the public services, where public procurement and T&uacute;s or social employment schemes are involved, there will have to be quotas.  I put it to the Minister that he should examine that matter.  We will not do this on the basis of goodwill, on a wing and a prayer or through aspiration or exhortation to employers.  There will have to be quotas whereby they are legally implicit within the contract.  Where work is being done that is pertinent to Travellers, such as development within their areas, why can it not be mostly Travellers who are employed to work on it?  It will take a graduated effort, but I commend the Minister to start acting on employment.</p> <p>School completion is the next issue that has to be dealt with.  I might outline some stark headline figures.  Only 13% of the Traveller population complete second level school, an horrendous figure that indicts us all.  Obviously, there are issues here.  We have to examine bullying and racism in schools where they impact on Travellers and that needs to be researched and dealt with immediately.  Some 28% of Travellers leave school before the age of 13, another horrendous statistic.  After-school clubs need to made available to Travellers, as does the school meals programme.  Support systems need to be in place, with the culturally acceptable practices for Travellers to get over their feelings of alienation.  They are not staying away from school due to some philosophical position or because they woke up one morning and decided they did not want education.  Of course they want education; their minds are as curious as ours and they want to break through as much as we do in that respect.  Nevertheless, there are reasons they do not stay in school and we have to get to the heart of those reasons.</p> <p>Turning to physical and mental health, there need to be a ring-fenced health budget for Travellers, with a certain amount of money that cannot go elsewhere.  There need to be specific, peer-led mental health programmes for Travellers.  In the context of peer-led initiatives, that is something I neglected to mention when I was speaking to the employment issue.  Where there are projects on Traveller sites, with physical work to be done and various other tasks, Travellers should be involved in all that.</p> <p>The final issue I was going to come to, although my time is almost up, relates to accommodation.  One in three Traveller households lives in mobile or temporary accommodation.  We need that to be monitored and there needs to be a quarterly statement from local authorities as to their progress on Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>It is all about implementation at this stage.  Further analysis is not necessary.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Minister and acknowledge we are in good hands with him on this issue.  Moreover, I acknowledge Senator Flynn, who chaired the committee, and the members it comprised.  There are 84 recommendations but, as other Senators have said, there is no point in another report gathering more dust if we are not going to do anything about it.  The committee has challenged the Oireachtas, advocates for the Traveller community and Travellers themselves to stay focused on the 84 key recommendations, broadly under the headings of health, education, employment and accommodation.  When we talk about Traveller accommodation, I am very conscious of the horrific fire in Carrickmines, a prime example of bad housing policy and bad accommodation in an authority on which I was a county councillor for many years.  Shame on that terrible situation, although I hope there will be some learning from it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I never like to think about or talk to a group of Travellers without taking time out to remember them and their great loss.  They continue to struggle on a daily basis with the wipeout of family members, which was a tragedy related to housing policy, Traveller accommodation policy and overcrowding.</p><p>I have taken the time to read the report as I am sure everyone in the House has.  I will single out a few key items.  Recommendation 45 on employment states: "A comprehensive national Traveller employment action plan should be developed, resourced and implemented."  A local vegetable shop in my town employed three Travellers.  The owner took the decision to employ local people.  These Travellers were local people, they were customers and they bought their vegetables, diesel and coal from this shop.  This woman decided she would employ them.  She never had a problem with any of them and, I am glad to say, two of them are still working with her and have done so for almost 20 years.  She believed everyone should have the right to an opportunity to work for her.  She told everyone - they did not have to be a Traveller - that if they came to her shop and made a bags of it they would be out the door.  She stood in solidarity at a time when no one in the town supported Travellers.  Fair play to her.  That is a good example of mutual trust and respect.  We must lead in business and enterprise, if we can give employment opportunities to anybody.  Travellers are no different.  They seek employment and income to provide for their families, in addition to accommodation.  They are equally ambitious as anybody else.  Somehow, it seems to be Travellers versus us.  We are all seeking to do better for ourselves and our families and to support one another.  That recommendation in the report is a particularly important point.</p><p>Recommendation 50 relates to employment and suggests greater support for social enterprises.  I can think of no more enterprising people than Travellers.  I have been on many of their sites where they are involved with horses - whether it is breeding horses, competing for horses or trading in horses.  It is a commodity.  Whether people are cattle dealers or horse dealers, they are dealers making shillings and making money.  It is a noble profession.  Let us be clear about that.  The problem is many Travellers do not have the ideal facilities for it but they are enterprising and imaginative.  Many of them know how to turn a buck and earn work from crafts, skills and other things.</p><p>I will talk about that in respect of education, which we also considered.  Senator Flynn invited a group of Travellers from National University of Ireland, Galway to appear before the committee.  It was one of the best audiovisual presentations I ever had concerning people who, against very difficult sets of circumstances and backgrounds, made it to university in Galway.  By golly, they were fantastic.  They told of their journeys, experiences and difficulties.  I say "Well done" to them.</p><p>I will turn to recommendation 53 on employment, which states, "Culturally appropriate apprenticeship[s] and internship schemes should be developed in areas of traditional Traveller enterprise."  Everyone knows what that means.  I encourage it.</p><p>I picked out recommendation 68 on accommodation for special mention.  It states, "An ... audit should take place of [the] living conditions ... [of] all traveller specific ... halting sites [and accommodation]".  That should be one of the very first things we should do.  We should audit what we have now and how we can improve it.</p><p>I will wrap up by saying "Well done" to the people who worked on this report.  It includes 84 recommendations and guidelines.  Let us all, across both Houses, commit to rolling them out.  I appeal to the Traveller advocacy groups and Travellers themselves to also heap the pressure on to keep this report as a living, practical document that is ticking off and driving these issues.  I wish everyone well with the report.  Every one of these 84 recommendations can be achieved.</p></speech>

As Senators know, we started a little late because of the legislative programme.  The Minister is supposed to respond at 4.45 p.m. but he might give us some latitude on that.</p> <p>Before I call the next speaker, I welcome to the Gallery Councillor Yemi Adenuga, one of the first elected representatives from a minority community in Ireland.  It is appropriate she is here for this debate.  I also welcome Councillor Baby Pereppadan.  I thank him for being here for this very important debate on making sure that minority communities in this country are respected and afforded the rights they should be.  I also welcome Councillor Ben Dalton O'Sullivan from Cork, which is another minority community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#PP00300"><p>I welcome all our guests.  I thank everyone who came before the committee to share their insights.  As I often say, when it comes to committees, we are not the experts.  We are there to hear witnesses' expert testimony and to make recommendations on the basis of what really matters for their communities.  I will say to everyone who came before us, and everyone who opened their homes on the halting sites we visited throughout the country, including in the constituency of Galway West where I live, that we could not have found a better welcome.  I also thank the Chair of the committee, Senator Flynn, for her fantastic advocacy, not just on the committee but in everything she does.  We owe it to her and all those communities to not just have another report on a shelf but to take action.  That is needed now.  If there is one clear message that came to us, it is that we need action.</p><p>We have had the 2019 expert report, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's 2021 report and now this committee's report.  When the Working Group of Committee Cathaoirligh met with the Ceann Comhairle recently, the strongest message that came from the Traveller committee was the need for transparency on a regular basis.  How many houses have been delivered?  How much Traveller-specific accommodation has been delivered this quarter?  That is what we want to see.  We do not need more promises.</p><p>I will look at the figures.  In 2021, 70 Traveller-specific units were built.  That included 18 new halting site units, five major refurbishments and ten group housing units.  In the constituency in which I live, Cena, which is a fantastic approved housing body, will build four units.  However, this does not scratch the surface.  The figures supplied by Mr. John O'Connor from the Housing Agency indicated that 1,000 of those on the accommodation list have Traveller-specific needs.  That is a massive number we need to address.</p><p>We need to hear from experts so I will reference Mr. Pat Doyle, CEO of the Peter McVerry Trust, who said:</p> <blockquote> 	Very often we have the sites.  Very often we have [the] funding and the backing from the department but [what] we need [is] ... local leadership to step up and say, &lsquo;look, there&rsquo;s a housing crisis and we need to house people.  We need to house Travellers, homeless people, people with disabilities.&rsquo;  We get it from every party [by that he means every political party] that they want housing.  But at a local level we [do not] get [it] ... </blockquote> <p>We need councillors and executives of local authorities to step up to the mark.  As Mr. Doyle said, at a local level it is a case of people saying they know there is a housing crisis, but they do not want these houses in their areas.  That is no longer good enough.  We all need to call that out, including within our own parties.  That is what I wanted to say on accommodation.</p><p>I will also pick up on the employment issue, which I feel very strongly about.  I know of amazing organisations, such as Bounceback and Mr. Martin Ward from the Galway Traveller Movement, and the women associated with Bounceback in Galway.  They run a recycling project there that brings in mattresses in from 12 counties.  Mr. Ward said to the committee that while Travellers are great innovators, which goes back to their history, they are innovators because they do not have any other options, as people do not employ them in jobs in their companies and the public service is not taking them in.  We need to say that it is great, and let us celebrate fantastic organisations, but let us also say it is time for the State to play its part.  There needs to be quotas in the public service because that is the part we can control.  We must control that.</p><p>Many people want to contribute and this is a very important debate so I will leave it there.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.  The Working Group of Committee Cathaoirligh will have another meeting the Ceann Comhairle.  Officials from the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government appeared before the committee.  We will bring others in and will ask them questions on behalf of the Traveller community and the committee we all feel very passionately about.</p></speech>

I also welcome the opportunity to discuss the contents of this important report.  First, like others, I pay tribute to everyone responsible for bringing it together and in particular, the Chair, Senator Flynn and all the Traveller-led organisations, not least the Tallaght Traveller Community Development Project which contributed on education.</p> <p>Senator Flynn made the point in her foreword that there have been numerous reports and studies produced over the years that have highlighted the extreme difficulties faced by the Traveller community.  The trouble is when it comes to implementing those reports.  The report has strong and clear recommendations and I will touch on just a few of them. </p> <p>The issue that Senator Flynn rightly highlighted as being so disturbing is that of suicide and mental health in the Traveller community.  The statistics are shocking in that 90% of Travellers agreed that mental health problems were common in their community, while suicide is the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths.  I was glad to see the committee did not mince its words when talking about the causes of the crisis when it stated &ldquo;Travellers&rsquo; daily experiences of racism and exclusion have a profound effect on their mental health.&rdquo;  We know how important a person&rsquo;s home is for giving them a root and foundation.  Security of accommodation and adequate accommodation are fundamental.  Deficient and substandard living conditions, as well as precarious accommodation and homelessness, have an impact on mental health and on wider health issues within the Traveller community.  Lower educational outcomes also have a damaging impact on employment opportunities.  Chronic unemployment also has a negative consequences on mental health.  All these things are interconnected.</p> <p>While we are discussing the critical importance of the implementation of reports, it must be acknowledged that the implementation of the Traveller-Specific Accommodation report has been painfully slow.  We are not leading by example in implementing the recommendations on that.  The report also addresses the fact that families are sharing bays on halting sites or living in the yards of the houses of family members in group housing schemes.  In those cases, families share one another&rsquo;s electricity supply.</p> <p>I wish to raise one particular issue that came to my attention during the briefing I hosted last week about energy poverty.  Aoife, a representative from the National Traveller Money Advice and Budgeting Service pointed out that the families who shared bays had to share the &euro;200 credit as the doubling up was not taken into account.  There were other examples where the credit was shared between multiple families.  There were other cases where the local authority did not pass on that &euro;200 rebate.  I hope that the Minister will take back to his Government colleagues that if we are going to roll out another &euro;200 rebate, we must make sure that families who should have got the first rebate do receive it and that we get answers as to why local authorities have not passed it on.  If this is to be repeated in the early budget to be announced in September, the flaw in the legislation that enabled this must be fixed.  </p> <p>There is so much in this report I would like to discuss.  There is a lot in it to make you angry, sad, and frustrated.  We all have to accept that the structural biases against Travellers are real and have a devastating effect on their lives.  However, there is also a lot of cause for hope in the report.  I commend the activity of Travellers organising and agitating for something better for themselves and their families.  I thank the committee for its report.</p></speech>

It started today with the first ever Traveller Pride awards.  I encourage people to check that out online.  I want to note Rosemary Maughan who won the intersectionality award.  It is very well deserved.  Every day I learn from her online.  I encourage everyone to follow and learn from her too.  I congratulate all the awards winners and nominees for the incredible work they do for the Traveller community, often behind the scenes and unrecognised and often in the face of adversity and discrimination.  Rosemary and many others talk online about their experiences.  It is important to note that today.</p> <p>We would not have this report without Senator Flynn and all the work she has done on this.  We often say that it is not up to one person or Senator to represent an entire community or carry a community on his or her back but it is up to us as public representatives to support her and her community and to listen to what they have to say.  We must advocate, listen, pass the mic and do everything we can in our roles to support that community.  The report's recommendations are more than clear.  As I read through them, I felt really sad that we need to have a report that contains such recommendations for a community in 2022 to make its lives bearable.  It is not good enough.  It is not okay or acceptable.  It is a really important report and I am glad that we have it but I am sad that we had to have it at all and that in Ireland in 2022, we need a lengthy list of things that can and should be done to support that community.  Speaking to Senator Flynn and other members of the community, I know that the number one thing to consider is that the Traveller community is working on these issues.  They are experts in their own lives, experiences and histories and know how to best go forward to support themselves.  It is important that the Minister or any of us listen to that community because they have the answers.  </p> <p>The community has been pleading for mental health supports.  Scary and upsetting statistics have been read out here and we see them online about Traveller children taking their own lives.  This is a community that is devastated by mental ill-health and the lack of supports available.  That is a stark thing we need to get to grips with.  It is in the programme for Government.  I hope that it is a priority and that we see action on that.</p> <p>Then there are jobs.  It should be a normalised part of society.  Travellers are members of the community with an incredible and unique culture and history but they are just members of the community like the rest of us.  It should just be normalised when they are getting jobs and when they are a part of it.  That is a really important thing.</p></speech>

The work that Senator Flynn and the other members of the committee have completed is historic and vitally important.  I will just speak about mental health and the stark realities of the mental health crisis in the Traveller community.</p> <p>I will read the statistics again because they are vital.  Suicide accounts for 11% of all deaths among Travellers.  Traveller women are seven times more likely to die by suicide.  Travellers represent less than 1% of the population of the Republic of Ireland yet they make up over 10% of suicides among young adult men and boys.  The stories we hear about suicides in the community, involving young children or members of the same family are devastating.  The pain that many families and communities are grappling with is unimaginable.  We know that the mental health care system in this country is strained to near breaking point.  People are often left on waiting lists for unbearable durations but all these issues around access to care are amplified in the Traveller community due to social exclusion and a lack of access to resources.  We need to ensure the community has access to comprehensive, culturally informed mental health services.  This is an emergency. </p> <p>This is a crisis that concerns us all.  Successive Governments have seen first-hand this disaster unfold and have failed to develop a strategy to respond.  We have a moral obligation to deal with the fallout of decades of State persecution of the Traveller community.  The Irish State is culpable for the profound inequalities Travellers face.  The 1963 report of the Commission on Itinerancy presented nomadic lifestyles as inherently inferior.  Travellers were presented as a social problem to be solved.  We need to state clearly now that nomadism is not the problem; racism is. </p></speech>

It is a dense web of disadvantage and cruelty that takes an enormous toll on the community&rsquo;s mental health.  The astronomical rates of mental illness among Travellers remind me of the similar epidemic of mental illness among the residents of Gaza.  Both populations experience a crushing sense of oppression and a pervasive hopelessness.  In both cases, we can work to provide resources, to care for those who are suffering and to try to save lives.  It is critical that we understand that, in both cases, the issue is systemic.  Positive mental health requires freedom, justice and access to opportunities for growth and self-development.  A radical and holistic approach centred on equality and autonomy is needed.</p> <p>This report is an important but early step in the process of producing a legislative and policy response that adequately addresses the seriousness and urgency of this crisis.  We need action and we need it now.  I will close by congratulating my colleague, Senator Flynn, on this report.  Her voice is a unique and powerful one that enriches the work we do in this House.  Eileen is a champion of social justice and a tireless advocate for her community.  I am very proud to call her my colleague and my friend. </p></speech>

Its findings are disturbing.  As Senator Black pointed out in her contribution, while the previous reports, which are nearly 60 years old, identified much of this discrimination, they played down what was going on when there was endemic discrimination at the level of the State.  I again thank Senator Flynn for her very significant work.  As the Senator and the rest of us know, writing reports is one thing but, while the Senator has led a committee on these matters and got this far, there are many miles to go.  It is important work.  The Leader is coming into the Chamber.  I will call on her before I call on the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1653" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#RR00500"><p>I am sorry; I am nearly having a heart attack.  A lot of the time, we talk about politics being all about the personal.  No one could deny that since Senator Flynn came to the House two years ago she has worn her heart on her sleeve with regard to the very personal impacts society has imposed on her community.  I thank her for that and for this report and its recommendations.  This is not the first report, however.  While it is not the Minister's fault and I am not having a dig at him, successive Governments have issued report after report and provided budget after budget but, as Senator Pauline O'Reilly has said, we come back at the end of every year and wonder why things are not different, why budgets have not been spent and why actions have not been implemented.  It is down to us.  It is down to national and local government.  Until we start reflecting on that, we will have a really serious problem.</p> <p>In addition to reports not being implemented, we have to acknowledge that discrimination against Travellers is very much evident in our society.  This is because Travellers are not represented in many aspects of everyday life.  Whether we like to admit it or not, and while it is revealed in quiet little rooms so fingers are not pointed, large parts of Irish society hold enormous prejudice that can only be described as racist feelings towards the Travelling community.  This is so much the case that it is nearly socially acceptable and is not challenged in the same way as any other form of racism is challenged.  We just know that people feel that way and have for generations.  That is probably true but, unless we challenge it, it will never change.  We have to challenge the whataboutery.  It is almost as if this particular community has flaws while no other community in Ireland has those same flaws.  We do not talk about our own shortcomings but just focus on and highlight those of this particular community.  We need to take responsibility for the 84 recommendations at both national and local level.  If we do not see positive implementation, then we will have to take responsibility for the fact that this community is not seen in a positive light.  We are responsible for changing hearts and minds and we can only do that together.</p></speech>

Travellers in Ireland have faced, and continue to face, systemic racism.  I will take this opportunity to reaffirm my commitment and the commitment of the Government to ensuring equality for Travellers and their full and equal participation in Irish life.  We have an obligation across Government to eradicate the barriers that exist to that full and equal participation.</p> <p>The national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, operates from my Department and provides a framework for action on Traveller and Roma issues and represents a whole-of-government approach, bringing together Government agencies, Departments, members of the Traveller and Roma communities and the NGOs that work with them.  The programme for Government commits to a review of NTRIS.  That is something all of us on the NTRIS steering committee are very conscious of.   The one thing that has been said throughout my time in office has been that we need to move from glossy policies to implementation.  There is no good in having a brand new education strategy if the number of Traveller children completing secondary education has not increased.  There is no good in having a glossy policy document on Traveller accommodation if the number of Traveller-specific accommodation units is not increasing dramatically.  The next NTRIS has to be about measurable actions and delivery.  It is very important that actions are measurable.  The work that Senator Flynn and the committee have brought together will be really influential in the development of the next NTRIS.  I am happy to continue to engage with Senator Flynn and the team of Deputies and Senators who worked with her on a quarterly basis or however often they wish to see where we are on the 84 actions so that we can start seeing delivery.  I can use the NTRIS subcommittee to chase up Departments with regard to their implementation. </p> <p>The report highlighted 84 areas covering a wide range of issues.  I will now speak to three key areas: accommodation, health and education.  With regard to housing, I know that the committee dedicated several meetings to the issue of Traveller accommodation and engaged with the Ombudsman for Children on the report, No End in Site.  The findings of that report were incredibly hard to read and made clear that improvements in the provision of appropriate accommodation must continue.  In March of this year, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, met with the NTRIS steering committee and we had a detailed discussion on the issue of Traveller accommodation.  As Senators will know, the expert group to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other legislation published a report in July 2019.  This report included 32 recommendations.  A programme board is in place within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to secure the implementation of those key recommendations.  Traveller organisations are involved in the oversight of delivery of those key changes.</p> <p>Senators Higgins and McGreehan and others raised the key issue of data.  In that regard, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has informed us that there is now a Traveller ethnicity identifier included on the social housing support form.  We are starting to see the roll-out of that ability to monitor data.  My Department is working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on a broader national equality data strategy to allow us access to disaggregated data and information with regard to the take-up of health, education and housing services among the Traveller community and other minority communities. </p> <p>Senator Higgins set out the challenges with regard to education for Travellers.  In conjunction with the Department of Education, my Department is working on a number of pilot programmes to target Traveller attendance and school completion.  The teams operating these pilot programmes are working with parents, children, young people, schools and the local Traveller and Roma communities.  The programmes are under way in Galway, Wexford, Dublin and Cork and have been extended in light of the disruption caused by the Covid pandemic.  Ensuring that Travellers have full access to the education system is paramount in light of the impact that access to education has on a person's life, potential and ability to access employment.  I am aware that, while Traveller education outcomes have improved in recent years, educational attainment among Travellers continues to lag significantly behind that of the general population.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Undoubtedly, the impact of Covid has exacerbated that and has widened that gap.  The digital divide is something we must be acutely conscious of.  I am working together with the Minister for Education and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science on the Traveller education strategy that is promised in the programme for Government.  It is important that work is also being done in my Department on early years education and the access of Traveller children to the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme.  There is reduced take-up of the scheme among Traveller children.  That means that the education gap begins and is built in even before the first day of primary school.  We have to work to reverse that.</p><p>The issue of healthcare was addressed by many Senators.  I am acutely aware of the difficulties faced by the Traveller community when it comes to accessing health services and mental health services in particular.  We know that members of the Traveller community die younger, have more illnesses and are at greater risk of being affected by substance misuse and mental health difficulties.  The Government has committed to publishing a national Traveller health action plan.  I am informed that the plan will be published in September 2022.  Indeed, we have engaged with Senator Flynn on the matter.  The plan aims to address the specific health needs of Travellers, including physical, mental and social well-being.  It will use a social determinants approach.  The national Traveller health action plan will assist with improving Travellers' right to healthcare and the commitment and prioritisation of the provision of funding to expand and strengthen the primary healthcare for Traveller projects.  It will also address the need for the culturally safe and appropriate provision of healthcare for Travellers.  HSE annual expenditure on Traveller- and Roma-specific health initiatives is in the region of &euro;10 million, currently.  Of that, &euro;350,000 is dedicated to the provision of mental health services specifically.  We all recognise that this funding must increase.  The national action plan forms a basis within which that increase can be delivered.  Within my own Department, we are providing additional funding to Traveller organisations for two particular services, the Traveller mediation service and the Traveller counselling service.  I am aware of the really strong work that those services do on a localised basis in supporting members of their own community.</p><p>I have had the opportunity to outline progress in some areas.  However, as I said at the outset, Travellers in Ireland have faced and continue to face systemic racism.  There is so much more that must be done across the areas I have outlined and those outlined more broadly in the report.  It is something that all of us in government, across the Oireachtas and in all elements of the State must act on and work together to address.  </p></speech>

However, the specific actions that are required are set out in the programme for Government.  The office of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, contacted me today about the national Traveller mental health network, NTMHN.  We are going to meet the Minister of State on Thursday to discuss the matter.  Hopefully, that is a step in the right direction and will bring about the change requested by the national Traveller mental health network.  I thank the Senators for speaking on this most important issue today.  I also thank the national Traveller organisations in particular for always having my back.  I would not be able to do the job I do without reaching out to the youth Traveller organisations, Traveller mental health organisations and organisations such as Pavee Point, the Irish Traveller Movement and the National Traveller Women's Forum Ireland.  It is vital that we have the support of those organisations.  One of my biggest fears is that those working for Traveller organisations are getting a bit tired and burnt out.  It is not because of their age.  It is because they have been doing this work for years and very little action has been taken.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned the review of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS.  We must hasten that review and implement a new national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, in partnership with Travellers, that includes a robust implementation and monitoring plan.  There must also be ring-fenced budgets across all of its actions, as the Minister has outlined.  It is extremely important.</p> <p>This week is national Traveller Pride week.  Today we can celebrate Travellers as a community within Irish society.  I note we are not all equal.  We are different individuals, even here in this House.  However, we should be given equality of opportunities within Irish society.  We are different.  We wanted to be recognised as an ethnic minority group within the indigenous people of this country.  We eventually got that recognition in 2017, but not a lot has changed for Travellers.  Unfortunately, things have got worse for our community within Irish society.  The community is tired and burnt out with exhaustion from looking for action.  We know the money is there.  As we celebrate our Traveller Pride week, I wish every Traveller in the country a happy Traveller Pride week and to tell our young people that there is hope.  We have a lot of be proud of as a community.  We are still here, despite the publication of the 1963 report that was meant to destroy us.  We are still here and we are still standing.  We are trying to hold on to every little bit of Traveller culture we have, to embrace it and not be embarrassed about it because society tells you which way you should be within society, if you want.  We have a lot of be proud of.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as the Cathaoirleach said, successive Governments have not always supported the Traveller community 100%.  This Government has the opportunity to put that right and to deliver a better Ireland and a more inclusive Ireland for members of the Traveller community.  We are not the issue  People talk about Traveller issues but we are not the issue or the problem; it is society.  Unfortunately, successive Governments have not supported the Traveller community.  I ask that this Government be the one to be the better change within our society and support us.  We are not asking for special treatment.  All we ask for is equality of opportunity.  We are asking to be treated equally and with dignity, instead of having to beg for services constantly, knowing that we will die younger than our settled counterparts and that we are at a disadvantage as members of the Traveller community.  It needs to end.  We play an equal role within Irish society.  I hope that the Government will deliver.  Going back two years, the Taoiseach did the right thing in terms of breaking down the barriers.  It might only be one but perhaps in a few years' time we could have more.  It is a starting point and the Government has started off on a good footing.  We must continue that and the only way to do that is through action.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  </p></speech>

It would not be appropriate for any Member of the House to question my rights to do so.  The amendments were put in with due process, thought and work.  I commend my staff on the work they put in to legislation and the fact they take it extremely seriously.</p> <p>I called for v&oacute;t&aacute;il on two of the amendments on fundamentally important core principles, relevant not just to this Bill and to Ireland but to the world.  They are the difference between a 1980s version of environmental development and the sustainable development which is defined widely, including in legislation from this House, in relation to the sustainable development goals and the global perspective.  It is a substantial question as to which approach to environmental sustainability we take.</p> <p>The other was on the fundamental issue of whether equality is wider, as the Minister acknowledged, than just equality of opportunity.  The objects, which is the top line of this Bill, is where further discussion of equality flows from.  It is important to get it right.  I do not need to justify putting forward any amendment and pressing a vote on it but I want to signal, lest the record wrongly show, that these are really important issues.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 28 concerns the question of "value for money" relating to the functions of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I have highlighted that the framing of "value for money" is somewhat narrow and out of touch with the understanding we have now of things like most economically advantageous.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I commend the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, for accepting the points that I made about value for money when we debated the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.  Today, we are not just talking about value for money in a narrow sense such as efficiencies or an economic amount but seek to learn what is effective.  It was in that regard that I proposed the deletion of section 9(1)(c) which states: "secure and evidence value for money in the expenditure by an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s of moneys provided to it under section 19" and substitute  &ldquo;ensure financial transparency in designated higher education institutions and effective expenditure of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s of public monies provided to it&rdquo;.  For me, out of the three standards that are set by the Comptroller and Auditor General, effectiveness is one of the most important because we want to know that the money we spend has a good effect.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 28 to 30, inclusive, and 32 seek to ensure that without prejudice to the ability of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s to plan for higher education, under sections 9(1)(d) and (e), that it would also respond to the recommendations made by individual institutions.  We tabled this amendment because it is important that recommendations are factored into how an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s plans for the sector as a whole, which goes back to the core issue of recognising that institutions have distinct missions, characters, wisdom and knowledge.  To preserve university autonomy, we must ensure that the relationship, especially concerning this crucial area of advising on policy, is not solely hierarchical and is a collaborative relationship.</p><p>These amendments seek to address lines 23 to 24 so that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s plans for higher education provision and makes recommendations to the Minister, and that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s would plan for research in the higher education system and make recommendations.  Perhaps the Minister of State, in his reply, will make it clear that it would not be the case that institutions are required, through an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, to make recommendations concerning research given that they have specialist knowledge and understanding in those areas yet would still be empowered to make direct recommendations to Ministers in that regard.</p><p>Amendment No. 31 highlights the importance of climate change, and particularly now given the critical need for Ireland to accelerate actions to deliver on its 51% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target by 2030 and vastly improve our track record for protecting the environment.  I have often said that climate change is a crucial area because I think about this issue all of the time, particularly as the last ten years of the last 100,000 years have been the hottest to date.</p><p>As I said previously about research, Ireland's higher education system has a crucial role to play in discovering, developing and implementing solutions that will help us to achieve our climate, environmental and sustainable targets leading up to 2030 and beyond.  That is why sustainable development is crucial.  Ireland negotiated the UN sustainable development goals and persuaded the rest of the world to sign up to them just a few years ago.  The goals should be our guide and we have only eight to achieve them.</p><p>In seeking to imbed sustainable development stronger into the Bill I acknowledge that many individual higher education institutions have done extremely good work in respect of the sustainable development goals.  I have launched projects in NUI Galway on same.  UCC has won awards for its co-operation and partnership around the goals.  Finally, I commend the Irish Research Council on providing important research grants concerning the sustainable goals.  All of that work shows that sustainable development is a core issue.  In fact, one of the reasons that it is a core issue for many universities is because it is a key factor in securing Horizon 2020 funding and EU funding.  However, more needs to be done to imbed sustainable development in the functions of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s in a way that matches what is being done by institutions.  I wish to note that I have tabled an amendment on sustainable development that concerns green public procurement.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 have been tabled because my colleagues and I believe that the current wording of section 9(1)(f) is unsatisfactory as it overly focuses on the needs of business and the professions, not on the broader needs of society.  Section 9 refers to the functions of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s and 9(1)(f) states: "meeting the educational and skills needs of individuals, business, enterprise, the professions, the community, local interests and other stakeholders".  Clearly, business, enterprise and the professions are named individually when, certainly for business and enterprise, one word might have been enough.  I note that the arts, culture and the environment have not been listed among the educational and skills needs.  I think that they should be so the amendment seeks to insert the words "society, the environment, the arts" among the measures already mentioned.</p><p>Amendment No. 35 concerns the global dimension of the higher education system.  The amendment specifies that as a function of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s there is a need to, "promote co-operation between higher education institutions in the European Union and internationally for the purposes of advancing public research and development which seeks to address social and economic inequalities and environmental challenges and climate change".  Global co-operation is needed to tackle these challenges and I urge the Minister of State to consider this amendment.  We have raised these issues in areas of work because we have only a narrow window of time in which to act globally to avert a layering of catastrophes.  I am someone who is passionate about higher education and I am very passionate about the role that it can play in this regard.  That is why we need to imbed this aspect at the core of higher education.  Again, those who are lucky enough to have the opportunity to access higher education and these institutions have a role to play in tackling social challenges.</p><p>Amendment No. 36 concerns the specified functions of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  As this is Traveller Pride Week, we have an opportunity to accept this amendment as it would imbed this matter.  If the Minister of State cannot accept the amendment then perhaps he might look at other ways in which to bring this matter forward.</p><p>Earlier today, I had the honour of presenting an award to members of the Minc&eacute;irs Whiden Society, NUIG.  As the Minister of State will be aware, the Civil Engagement Group has previously brought forward legislation in respect of Traveller culture and history in terms of education in the primary and secondary education systems.  I seek to mirror those provisions and ask that we consider research into Traveller culture and history, and recognise that there is a major gap in the system.  I note that there is an opportunity here and commend the institutions that have already started this process.  One of the projects that universities need to commence in the next period is research on decolonisation, including the decolonisation of the curriculum.  I hope that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s will support and give guidance to institutions in that process.</p><p>Amendment No. 37 seeks to insert the following: "(n) promote, support and respect academic freedom for staff and students,".  We have already discussed the fact that students make an important academic contribution and, therefore, their academic freedom should be protected.</p><p>On amendment No. 38, in 2015 Ireland, along with 182 UN member states, signed up to the delivery of the 17 UN sustainable development goals, which are a blueprint for a better and more sustainable future for us all.  The goals are not an aspirational and nice add-on.  They are game-changing and a different way of doing things, which gives us, as a planet, society and humanity, a far better chance of sustainability and survival.  As fewer then eight years remain in which to deliver on the goals, Ireland must start accelerating action to deliver on them.  I believe that it is appropriate for universities to lead in this respect, especially given that the goals will be and are core for higher education institutions when accessing EU and international funding, and developing, which is as important as funding, partnerships with institutions of higher education across the world that are working to solve these joint problems and develop collective solutions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Amendment No. 39 seeks to ensure that equity would be inserted as something which an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s would be tasked with promoting and as part of its functions.  I will not go over these points again but it was previously acknowledged by the Minister that equality and equity were not quite the same thing.  Equity should be named as part of the functions of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.</p><p>Amendment No. 40 seeks to insert the provision of monitoring and assisting the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, and specifically Article 24, which falls very much within the remit of higher education institutions.  That is an internationally binding treaty which Ireland has ratified and Article 24.5 specifies that: &ldquo;States Parties [should] ensure that persons with disabilities are able to access general tertiary education,&rdquo;.  The work of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s would be very much in line with the fulfilment of that article.  Article 24.5 continues: "To this end, States Parties shall ensure that reasonable accommodation is provided to persons with disabilities".  I understand that there may be scope within the equality statement to address this issue but I want to name it as a very specific responsibility and article within the UN in the CRPD where higher education will have to take the lead.</p><p>Amendment No. 42 refers to the fact that section 9(2) of the Bill currently provides that: "An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall have all such powers as are necessary or expedient for the performance by it of its functions".  This is quite a great deal of power to give to a public body and is not caveated with the provision that such functions must be related to this piece of legislation.  The word "expedient" is perhaps inappropriate here, and again should be either deleted or deleted and replaced with the word "proportionate", as suggested by me.  That is important because the idea of "expedient" means quickly and doing it as fast as possible.  In an area such as this, and with the exercise of the very considerable powers that are being given to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, ensuring that they are exercised in a way that is proportionate is certainly as important if not more important than ensuring that they are done quickly.  We note that sometimes if there is a requirement for doing things in the quickest way possible, mistakes may be made.</p><p>Can I just check that amendment No. 42 is the end of that grouping, please?</p></speech>

The point I was making, however, concerning this is that there is no guillotine on this discussion but simply because there is no guillotine does not mean that Members should speak at length and repeat points that have been made in earlier debates.  I make the point that when there were complaints made about Committee Stage, that of the three hours and 20 minutes that were allowed on Committee Stage, two hours and 20 minutes of those were taken by Opposition speakers and an hour was taken by Government speakers, including the Minister.</p></speech>

Many of these amendments are doubling up on areas that are provided for within the legislation and on work that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s is already doing.  As already outlined by me, significant contributions were made in the D&aacute;il, particularly around some of the environmental issues and Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh was mentioned in that context.  I am quite happy about the objectives that are set out within the legislation and I believe much of what is raised in the amendments is already covered by what is in the Bill as it stands.</p></speech>

I am aware that Senators on both sides of the House were looking to bring forward amendments and the Department and its officials were engaging over the many Stages on this over the past number of years.</p> <p>On the amendments to hand, I will highlight a number of points.  I am aware that Senator Higgins was speaking about the use of the word "excellence" and in the more recent amendments about the sustainable development goals.  </p> <p>When one looks at the goals, out of those 17, many of those have been funded through the Irish Research Council and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Many of our social sciences are being funded by these bodies around the goals that we mentioned here such as ending poverty and hunger, health and education, gender equality, innovation, and sustainable cities.  </p> <p>We have many centres of excellence which are also funded through Science Foundation Ireland, particularly in the MaREI, the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine, which centres are looking across some of these environmental areas.  That is absolutely crucial.  It is very important, as the Senators have said and as has been acknowledged by the Minister previously, that where we are looking at reviews of this legislation and look forward to it being implemented, but we first of all need to see it being put into place because this is ground-changing legislation.  It will very much change the way we do things at third level in the funding of our institutions and supporting and updating the governance of these institutions and to ensuring the students have a voice in that governance at each stage, particularly of our higher education institutions, HEIs.  </p> <p>The challenge we are seeing here is that hopefully when it is in place and operating as best practice, as it should, we will then be able to look at that segment around the policies and their implementation and at where we see gaps, particularly if there are gaps around the sections that have been highlighted.</p> <p>Some of the amendments which were highlighted by Senators Higgins, Ruane, Flynn and Black were around research sharing and technology transfer.  On that amendment, with due regard to the article of the United Nations framework, I will state that we already have a great number of technology transfer offices particularly within each of our HEIs which are working with researchers to do that and have been funded through the colleges and universities.  It is very important that the research offices within the colleges are also doing the transfer.  The technology transfer is almost a separate stage to the research office.  They work quite closely together but their focus is very different.</p> <p>One can imagine then that the research office is there to support researchers in putting applications for funding to all different agencies whereas the technology transfer offices are there to support a person when a novel idea is developed as part of that research.  It may have a potential commercial or societal application where it may benefit society as a whole.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must develop that to ensure it will not just be in a book that sits on a desk somewhere but will actually be used by us and in society and become something that does not only exist in a thesis as such.</p><p>I will address the last couple of points.

It is evident that our researchers are applying for and getting funding in these particular areas.  There are probably a few other points but I will finish there.

Amendment No. 28 seeks to delete the function in section 9(1)(c) to &quot;secure and evidence value for money in the expenditure by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s of moneys provided to it under <i>section 19</i>&quot; and replace it with &quot;ensure financial transparency in designated higher education institutions and effective expenditure of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s of public monies provided to it.&rdquo;  It should be noted that section 9(1)(m) provides for the function to &quot;assess the performance of funded bodies with regard to securing value for money in the expenditure of funding provided to them by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s under this Act&quot;.  It is important that the functions outlined in 9(1)(c) and 9(1)(m) are retained to ensure that there is value for money in the expenditure by an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s of Exchequer funding provided to it and that there is also value for money in the expenditure by funded bodies of Exchequer funding provided to them.  It is considered that the functions outlined in 9(1)(c) and 9(1)(m) provide for the appropriate level of assurance with regard to Exchequer funding.  The amendment to section 9(1)(c) is not, therefore, considered appropriate.</p><p>There are a number of provisions in the Bill that could be used to ensure that designated institutions of higher education spend Exchequer funding in an ethical, sustainable and transparent manner, including conditions of funding, data collection, reporting provisions and guidelines, codes and policies.  The higher education institutions are required to report to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on the expenditure of the Exchequer funding and the HEA can request additional financial information as required.  Therefore, the higher education institutions are already required to be transparent in their use of public money.  The Bill provides that funding is provided to institutions in accordance with conditions of funding.  One of the conditions of funding could be spending this funding in an ethical and sustainable manner.  Section 143 of the Bill provides that the HEA can issue the designated institutions of higher education guidelines, codes and policies and the institutions are required to report to the HEA on the implementation of these guidelines, codes and policies.  The Minister can also direct the HEA to issue guidelines, codes and policies to a higher education institution.  The provision could be used by the HEA to issue guidelines on the ethical and sustainable use of funding.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 propose to include a reference to insert &quot;without prejudice to such other recommendations as may be made by individual designated higher education institutions&rdquo; in relation to the HEA planning for higher education provision and research and making recommendations to the Minister.  There is nothing in the legislation that precludes higher education institutions from making recommendations to the HEA in relation to planning for higher education provision and research.  It is noted that section 39 of the Bill, which provides for the HEA to plan for higher education provision and make recommendations to the Minister, includes provisions for consultation with designated higher education institutions.</p><p>It is considered that amendment No. 31 is already addressed by section 9(1)(i), which is a general function with regard to research in accordance with national research policy.  This sets the research priorities and could include protection of the environment and sustainable development.  Section 9(1)(i) provides that the HEA shall &quot;promote, support and fund excellent research in the higher education system in all disciplines in accordance with national research policy and in co-operation, as may be appropriate, with Ministers of the Government, Government agencies and such other bodies as An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s considers appropriate&quot;.</p><p>Amendment No. 32 proposes to include a function in the Bill for the Higher Education Authority to respond to recommendations from designated higher education institutions in respect of the overall higher education and research system.  The HEA consults with and engages with higher education institutions on specific issues with regard to higher education, for example, funding, planning, performance, framework and performance agreements.  Through these processes, the HEA can listen to and respond to recommendations from designated higher education institutions in relation to the higher education and research system.  The Minister sets the policy for the overall higher education and research system.  Section 33 of the Bill provides that the Minister shall prepare a strategy for the provision of tertiary education.  Designated higher education institutions are consulted on the preparation of this strategy.  The designated higher education institutions can make recommendations to the Minister through this process in respect of the overall education and research system.  It is not, therefore, considered appropriate to include this proposed provision in the Bill.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 seek to amend section 9(1)(f) to include reference to the HEA supporting the provision of a range of programmes of higher education and training aimed at meeting the educational and skills needs of society, the environment and the arts.  References to the community, local interests and other stakeholders in the Bill are deemed to cover the proposed references to society, the environment and the arts.  It is also important to note that this amendment would have the unintended consequence of removing the reference to Irish language, which was included on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to strengthen the Irish language provisions in the Bill.  It is not, therefore, proposed to accept those amendments either.</p><p>As for amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 38, the Bill includes section 9(1)(i), which is a general function in relation to research in accordance with national research policy.  This sets the research priorities and could include specific research, if deemed appropriate, as set out in these amendments.  These specific provisions are considered too prescriptive for inclusion in this Bill as research policies will change over time and are more appropriately set in research policy strategies.  Section 9(1)(i) provides that the HEA shall &quot;promote, support and fund excellent research in the higher education system in all disciplines in accordance with national research policy and in co-operation, as may be appropriate, with Ministers of the Government, Government agencies and such other bodies as An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s considers appropriate.&quot;</p><p>Amendment No. 37 proposes to include a provision in the functions with regard to academic freedom.  It should be noted that the objects include a provision in relation to academic freedom, which is &quot;to respect the academic freedom of higher education providers and academic staff in those providers&quot;.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Niall Collins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2205"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2205&amp;amp;pid=NiallCollins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Academic freedom is provided for in section 14 of the Universities Act, section 10 of the Technological Universities Act and section 32 of the Institutes of Technology Act 2006.  This Bill does not amend those provisions in relation to academic freedom.  Academic freedom is therefore protected by the relevant sectoral legislation and the provisions in the Acts, which means that this amendment including a function for academic freedom is not necessary.  We discussed this amendment with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it said that when objects are included in the functions it affects the carefully crafted balance of the Bill.  The provisions relating to academic freedom for academic staff in the sectoral legislation provide that they shall not be disadvantaged or have less favourable treatment arising from their opinions.<br/><br/>It is important that this Bill is read in conjunction with the sectoral legislation, namely, the Universities Act.  That Act includes an object &quot;to foster a capacity for independent critical thinking amongst its students&quot;.  The Technological Universities Act includes a function to promote &quot;critical and free enquiry, informed intellectual discourse and public debate within the technological university and in wider society&quot;.  It is therefore not considered necessary to specifically provide for the academic freedom of students in the Bill.  There is no restriction in this Bill or in the sectoral legislation on students expressing their views.  Students have a different status from academic staff in an institution.  They are not employed by the institution and therefore they cannot be subject to any unfavourable contracts, remuneration or employment-related treatment.  There is also provision in the sectoral legislation for independent dispute resolution to resolve any disputes.  Students' unions, together with staff associations, are required to be consulted in the preparation of the dispute resolution procedures.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 39 proposes to amend function (n) to read as follows:</p><blockquote>	support equality, equity, diversity and inclusion in higher education, including the participation and success of students in priority groups, or persons in such groups seeking to be students, in higher education. </blockquote><p>It is considered that the full provision as currently worded provides for equity.  It provides for the &quot;participation and success of students in priority groups, or persons in such groups seeking to be students, in higher education&quot;.  This is a standard wording that is recognised within the education sector regarding equality, diversity and inclusion.  There is a strong emphasis in the Bill on equality and equity, including the object for the HEA to &quot;advance equality of opportunity, diversity and inclusion in higher education&quot; and the function for the HEA to &quot;support equality, diversity and inclusion in higher education, including the participation and success of students in priority groups, or persons in such groups seeking to be students, in higher education&quot;.<br/><br/>Section 46 of the Bill provides that the HEA shall prepare a strategic plan providing for &quot;equity of access to, and participation and the promotion of success in, higher education&quot;.  This plan will set &quot;goals, objectives, actions, targets and performance indicators for improving equity of access to, participation and the promotion of success in the higher education system by students in priority groups, and persons in those groups seeking to become students, in higher education&quot;.A designated institution of higher education is required to have regard to this plan for the purposes of the preparation of a strategic development plan and its equality statement.  Higher education institutions are required to have this plan in place and are required to report on its implementation annually.<br/><br/>With regard to amendment No. 40, there is an object and a function relating to equality, diversity and inclusion in higher education.  There are specific provisions in place for priority groups, for example with regard to funding and planning.  The Bill makes provision for the preparation of an equality statement by designated institutions of higher education, which includes specifying the policy of the institution for enabling access to it and the education it provides for students, priority groups and persons in those groups seeking to become students.  The HEA is also required to develop an equity of access, participation and promotion of success plan and designated institutions of higher education are required to have regard to this plan.  They are also required to report on the implementation of the plan.  There are important provisions in the Bill relating to data collection by the HEA from designated institutions of higher education.  Section 49(1) of the Bill provides that the HEA may collect disability data from designated higher education institutions.  It is regarded as too specific to include the provision with regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in this Bill.  This reference could change over time and it is important that we respect the autonomy of designated higher institutions of education.<br/><br/>On amendment No. 41, provisions relating to co-operation and collaboration with the higher education sector in Northern Ireland were expanded during D&aacute;il Committee Stage to include the provision of student places and the enrolment of students.  Therefore, this amendment is not deemed necessary.<br/><br/>With regard to amendment No. 42, this is a standard wording in the drafting of the legislation and it is necessary for the effective implementation of the Bill by the HEA.</p></speech>

There are provisions in the Bill where these things could be addressed.  What I was trying to do by putting these provisions into the functions is ensure they would be addressed and cement them in that way.</p> <p>On amendment No. 28, the Minister of State has indicated that there is potential for the inclusion of provisions around ethical issues and sustainability in what constitutes appropriate spending codes.  I may engage further on that and will probably not need to press that amendment.</p> <p>Regarding amendments Nos. 29 to 32, inclusive, the Minister of State described at length of the measures whereby individual institutions may engage with the &uacute;dar&aacute;s, formerly the HEA, and where it may consult with them.  I wanted to underscore and make clear that individual institutions can also come forward with their ideas for higher education policy and research.  Any Minister should listen to and engage individually and on a bilateral basis with institutions that bring insight in that regard, rather than having a hierarchical flow where institutions engage with the &uacute;dar&aacute;s and it engages with the Minister.  I am concerned that there is potential for that to happen.  As the Minister of State has said, it does not need to happen in that way based on what is in the Bill so I will refrain from pressing the amendment.  Instead, I encourage every individual institution to put forward its direct policies.  Institutions should not solely engage with an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s but continue to engage with the Minister and with political representatives at large on the ideas they have.  That is something I would expect from them and I hope the Minister would expect that as well.</p> <p>I note that amendment No. 33 would have an inadvertent effect on the Irish language aspects of the Bill, which means I will probably not be able to press it.  However, I am concerned.  The Minister of State mentioned the finely crafted balance in the Bill.  It refers to business and enterprise but not to arts or culture.  That is a gap.  I am sure it is inadvertent but it is a gap.  Regrettably, I will not be able to press this amendment without removing the Irish language part.  I urge the Government, over the summer, to consider strengthening some of the language around arts and culture in this Bill.</p> <p>I have spoken about the matter of the environment already.  I will be engaging with the research Bill.  I may not need to press many of the amendments on research now, not because I think they are addressed in this Bill but in good faith and in the expectation that they will be addressed in the research Bill that is coming in the autumn.  Engagement on that will be important.  On the question of staff and students, the issues of equity and policies are addressed further downstream.  I would have liked to include them in the objects but I understand that while they are not in the functions they are in later specific provisions of the Bill.  I have highlighted the importance of the UNCRPD.  We have not covered the matter of "expedient" versus "proportionate" at length but I think the word "proportionate" is important.</p></speech>

It states, "An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall comply with any directions concerning the engagement of consultants and advisers which may from time to time be given to it by the Minister".  There are a number of sections in this Bill in which the Minister's powers are very wide.  They are framed in a somewhat loose way.  There should not be a risk in the legislation of a situation whereby a Minister is able to direct An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s with regard to the engagement of a particular consultant or adviser in relation to an issue.  We have a risk of individuals who have not gone through the An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s appointment process being placed with it and potentially being given considerable power.  There is a requirement for An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s to comply with any directions relating to the engagement of consultants and advisers.  I have suggested three ways to address this.  Amendment No. 45 removes the provision.  Amendment No. 44 replaces "shall comply" with "may consider".  It would be appropriate and sufficient if there was a requirement for consideration.  Amendment No. 43 would delete the provision and replace it with similar language and a measure that would specify that the engagement of consultants should be subject to an appropriate, transparent process.</p> <p>The intent of the policy may be for the Minister to set out rules relating to best practice and transparency in the appointment of consultants or advisers.  As it is worded in the Bill, it is a wide provision that An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s has to comply with any directions concerning the engagement of consultants or advisers.  There is a risk, as it is worded, that a Minister could, for example, direct An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s that it must hire a person or persons from an organisation as advisers.  I have tried to address this loose wording in three different ways.  I am open to clarification about appropriate, transparent processes of recruitment.  While policy intent is one thing, we need to look at how the legislation is worded.  This is one of a number of sections, with more important ones in the next grouping, where the wording regarding the powers of the Minister is too wide and too loose.</p></speech>

I know from experience that public procurement rules are quite strict and, in many ways, they can potentially inhibit some actions that one wishes for, because the rules have to be followed strictly.  I think this amendment is unnecessary.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 44 would change "shall comply with" to "may consider", while amendment No 43. states, "An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall comply with any directions concerning the engagement of consultants and advisers which may from time to time be given to it by the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, and any such engagements shall be subject to an appropriate and transparent process."  Section 10(1) states, "An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s may appoint such consultants and advisers as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions."  Section 10(2) relates to guidelines or rules concerning the engagement of consultants and advisers.  It could include rules regarding remuneration of consultants, for which functions a consultant may be employed, or issues relating to the procurement of a consultant.  There are rules regarding the employment of consultants, which are approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  These rules are needed to ensure that Exchequer funding is used appropriately and that an appropriate process is followed.  It is, therefore, not considered necessary to include a provision stating, "any such engagements shall be subject to an appropriate and transparent process."</p> <p>The policy intent of section 10(2) and (3) is that the engagement of consultants would be subject to an appropriate and transparent process in accordance with the directions and guidelines issued by the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not deemed appropriate to accept amendment No. 44 as it would provide that the Higher Education Authority would not have to comply with any direction of the Minister or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the engagement of consultants and advisers.  This would not provide for an appropriate and transparent process.</p> <p>Amendment No. 45 proposes to delete section 11, which states, "The Minister may give a direction in writing to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s for any purpose relating to this Act".</p></speech>

Amendment No. 46 seeks to specify that in giving a ministerial direction, it will be done in consultation with the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Amendment No. 47 seeks to delete section 11(1)(b), according to which the Minister may give a direction in writing to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s concerning, "the implementation of any policy or objective of the Minister or the Government".</p> <p>I am concerned that it is too widely framed.  I am aware of the caveat that the Minister may provide a direction in writing for any purpose relating to the Act.  I am concerned about that, but I am more concerned about the instructions that may be given to some of the higher education institutions, requiring them to comply with a ministerial direction that does not include the caveat restricting it to purposes to relating to the Act.</p> <p>I feel that section 11(1)(b) is too widely framed.  There is a concern around unfettered powers of Ministers to issue direction that could be used inappropriately by a potential future Minister, given that the legislation refers to directions concerning, "the implementation of any policy or objective of the Minister or the Government".  It blurs the lines of Government policy and national policy as we cement it into legislation and statutory provisions such as regulations.</p> <p>Amendment No. 51 seeks to insert a new section into the Bill.  It provides that nothing in the legislation, "shall be construed as preventing An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, or designated higher education institutions, from freely expressing its views on matters concerning higher education".  The Irish Universities Association has expressed concern that in some respects the independence of the HEA is being eroded in this Bill.  It is particularly concerned that the oversight provisions result in a shift in the balance around autonomy and control.  It is in light of that that a provision which specifically sets out the advocacy role and rights of institutions is proposed.  It would be a constructive way to alleviate concerns about the advocacy role that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s and individual institutions may play.</p> <p>Amendment No. 71 seeks to amend section 38(2)(d), relating to compliance with the guidelines, codes and policies issued by an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s under section 143.  Amendment No. 149 seeks to provide that in developing codes, guidelines and policies under section 143, an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s will consult with trade union representatives of both academic and professional staff.  The Minister will be aware that we have discussed the issue of student unions at some length.  However, there is concern that throughout the Bill, the role of trade unions as partners is not cemented in relation to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s and individual higher education institutions.  Consultation with the trade unions of both academic and professional staff is important in that regard.</p> <p>Amendment No. 154 seeks to insert a new subsection into section 143, which would provide that where a designated institution of higher education departs from guidelines, codes or policies, the institution be afforded an opportunity to provide an explanation as to which parts of the guidelines, codes or policies it is departing from, the extent of any such departures and the reason for the departures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I am conscious that the comply-or-explain principle was something that had been put forward by some of the universities.  I have put my own version of it here because there are areas where it is appropriate to have a comply-or-explain approach and where an explanation might be provided.  However, there are certain areas where there are implementations regarding equality, human rights and so forth where I believe that an option of explanation should not be sufficient because those are matters which directly affect the rights of others.  I have somewhat caveated the comply-or-explain discussion and proposals that have been put forward by saying it is appropriate in some areas and there are other areas where compliance might be required if there is a potential negative impact, for example, in regard to the rights of individuals.  However, I do think that this explanation process could allow for constructive learning on the part of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s in regard to what governance mechanisms are working well and effectively in each institution.  That completes what I have to say on this grouping.</p></speech>

This is something that I raised and discussed on Committee Stage.  It concerns the relationship between the Minister and the Department and the HEA.  One of the elements that will be crucial is the memorandum of understanding that will be entered into between the Department and an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I understand the position that Senator Higgins is coming from.  However, it does beg the question as to whether an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s could freely express its view on almost any matter with regard to higher education, which is what this amendment would provide.  While it is right for the HEA - the legislation allows for this - to provide statistics and information and contribute towards the public debate, what this would allow would be for an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s to act almost independently of the Minister.  At the end of the day, the Minister is the one who is ultimately accountable to the public for what happens within the higher education system.  The job of the Higher Education Authority is to advise, regulate and so on, but it is not the HEA's role to set broad higher education policy.  In that regard, while I understand Senator Higgins's position and I agree that it is important that public debate is influenced by information and statistics being put out there, the relationship between the Department and an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s is going to be crucial.  To include the type of provision proposed would inevitably potentially lead to conflict and would cause me some concern.</p> <p>Academic autonomy is well protected in this Bill, and within other legislation, so there is nothing to prevent higher education institutions, as they do quite freely now, from speaking out on any higher education issue.  A university president is entitled to speak on an issue of concern to him or her and, on occasion, has even disagreed with Government policy in particular areas.  The question here, however, concerns an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s speaking out, which is different in that it is a State agency and does not enjoy the same level of autonomy.  In that regard, I have significant difficulty with amendment No. 51.  Speaking from experience, it is crucial that the memorandum of understanding that is entered into between the Department and an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s around functions and roles will be particularly important.</p></speech>

I have a lot of paperwork in front of me.  The amendment is nothing particularly extravagant.  I do not know why guidelines would not also be published under section 11, in addition to being issued under subsection (1) .  I am not sure of the differentiation between them.  It would be good practice if one is going to publish one to also publish the other.</p></speech>

It is an agency of the Government.  There is also a role for the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, which is outlined in sections 15 and 16, and concerns the membership of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  It has 11 ordinary members plus a chair, with a 40% gender balance.  The section allows the board of the HEA to put policies, guidance and regulations together for HEIs and many other areas outside of this.  I do not see the rationale in it being able to freely express views outside of that.</p> <p>In terms of the other points raised by Senator Higgins in connection with the amendments on the funding section, Nos. 149 to 154, on the issue of guidelines, codes or policies, the Senator has just given an update on the section.  I apologise, as the amendment I speak to is Senator Hoey's.  The amendment relates to the trade union representatives of both academic and professional staff.  It is important that the governance of the HEIs is effective.  It is also important that what we do with the Bill is ensure that the funding that has been allocated will be used in a way that is going to make a difference for roles at third level.  That is where we will be looking at the governance within the HEIs as well.</p></speech>

I can see where Senator Malcolm Byrne was coming from with respect to amendment No. 51, but I am a little concerned that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s may be silenced by a Minister, while the heads of higher education institutions may voice their views.  I may be wrong, but that is my understanding.  The Minister might clarify the position for me.  Is it possible that the president of a university might have some negative comments to make about higher education policy, and is there a likelihood then, given the overarching role of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, that the institution in question would be disciplined for speaking out against Government policy?  Could the Minister please clear that up for me as I am a little confused in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#HHH00600"><p>I assure Senator Craughwell that one of the great strengths of our sector is that there is regular, open, critical comment and dissenting views.  It is one of the very healthy things about higher education and the university sector.  Whether one is a university president, trade union representative or student union representative, it is a very can-do and collaborative sector, but it is also very vocal.  It is a sector that quite rightly feels free to express its opinion in every and any guise.  That is appropriate.</p> <p>It is very important that we understand and differentiate the role of the HEA.  The HEA is not the Minister, the Department or the Government, nor is it an autonomous HEI.  It is a State agency of the Government, and it has a very specific job.  Senator Craughwell is somebody who rightly likes to hold people to account through various committees.  The line setting is very important and we must set out very clearly who does what in terms of roles.  If someone has a problem with funding policy or policy in general, the conversation must be had with me.  If someone has an issue with the individual running a university, that is a matter for the president and the governing authority.  It is very important that there is clarity as to what I as Minister and my successors do, what the Department does, what the HEA does and where it sits in that system, and what HEIs do.  What this legislation is endeavouring to do is to begin to outline and explain the role of each.  That is quite a healthy thing.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne, who knows the situation at first hand.  The memorandum of understanding between the Department and the HEA is crucial.  The HEA is an extremely important resource for the Minister, the Government, the sector and the Oireachtas in terms of the advice, research and data it can provide, but it is not the body that sets policy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is me and the Department.  That is the difference.  With the amendment, if I wanted to issue a direction to the HEA then I would have to consult the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I truthfully believe that this would confuse the governance.  A Minister does not need the permission of the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s to ask an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s to do something.  The board is accountable to the Minister.  In practice, of course, the relationship is much more collaborative.  The Minister of the day does not need to seek the permission, approval or opinion of the board of the HEA before issuing a direction to the HEA.  I cannot think, in my ministerial experience, of another example where that would be the case.  Would we ever ask the Minister for Health to have to meet with the HSE board before he was to ask the HSE to do something?  The HEA is different here from the whole issue of autonomy around higher education institutions.  The HEA is very clearly a State agency, an agency of the Government, an agency of my Department, and is responsible to me, as Minister, through the board.</p><p>I will also address some of the other amendments.  I have dealt with my view in relation to amendments Nos. 45 to 47, inclusive.</p><p>On amendments Nos. 48 to 50, inclusive, section 12 provides that the Minister may issue guidelines in writing to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s for the purposes of the Act.  This section also provides that the guidelines issued may relate to codes of practice for governance, other codes issued by another Minister, policy, guidance or changes.  It is important that the Minister has power to issue guidance to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.</p><p>Amendment No. 48 proposes that the HEA should be consulted on the issuing of guidelines by the Minister.  The Bill currently specifies that the HEA is required to have regard to these guidelines, and it is therefore not considered necessary to specify for consultation prior to the issuing of the guidelines.</p><p>Amendment No. 49 proposes that the Minister should publish any direction issued under section 11 and any guidelines issued under section 12.  Legal advice was obtained on the publication of directions issued under section 11 of the Bill.  The legal advice stated that it was not appropriate to publish directions issued by the Minister.</p><p>Amendment No. 50 proposes that the Minister shall publish guidelines issued by him or her, and shall lay the guidelines before the House.  It is absolutely the policy intent to publish all guidelines.  They will not be very impactful if we do not publish them.  These will be the guidelines for the sector.  It is absolutely the intent that all guidelines will be published.  By necessity they will be required to be published.  A provision in section 12(2) that the Minister may publish guidelines was included following legal advice.  The provision as currently written enables the publication of guidelines issued by the Minister to the HEA, as appropriate, but provides that not all guidelines would need to be published in case, for example, there was a large volume of emails and letters, etc. with regard to what becomes a guideline and what becomes legally required to be published.  We will endeavour to get the balance right in that regard.</p><p>Amendment No. 51 deals with an important issue.  An t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s absolutely needs to be free to express its views but again it is back to what is an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s and what is the role of the HEA.  I draw Senators' attention to the fact that in the functions of the Bill, section 9(1)(o) states that the HEA shall "advise the Minister in relation to national policy on higher education in accordance with section 14".  There are numerous provisions in the Bill where the higher education institutions are consulted around higher education, including on the strategic plan, tertiary education planning, higher education, the performance framework and so on.  These provisions ensure that higher education institutions are heard.  The objects of the Bill include a provision that an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s shall respect the academic freedom of higher education providers.</p><p>I will return to the comply and explain piece.  Some amendments include proposals for provisions in section 143 to adequately explain non-compliance with guidelines, codes and policies.  I have had very extensive engagement, as I am sure Senators have, with the sector in relation to this issue, specifically with the Irish Universities Association, IUA, discussing the principle of comply or explain.  I have also provided a very detailed written response to the IUA on its request for further amendment outlining the details.  This is why I do not believe further amendments are deemed appropriate, following legal advice.  To be clear - and I have said this on Committee Stage, I have said it in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and I will say it anywhere I am asked because it is the truth - the policy intent is the principle of comply or explain.  I am, therefore, not proposing to make amendments to the Bill in this regard around the inclusion of a specific reference.</p><p>I consider that the Higher Education Authority Bill at present reflects the comply or explain principle and is consistent with the autonomy of higher education institutions.  I sought legal advice on the issue and it has been concluded, following consideration of the advice, that it is not appropriate to make further changes.  The legal advice received considers that the policy intent of comply or explain is already adequately reflected in the Bill.</p><p>It is important to note that the Bill requires the HEA to consult designated institutions of higher education or their representative bodies in preparing guidelines, codes and policies.  These guidelines, codes and policies cannot just land there.  There must be a consultation process with the higher education institutions.  The designated institutions or their representative bodies, including the IUA, can provide observations on proposed guidelines, codes or policies when they are being prepared.  They can, at this stage, provide any observations on any potential issues with compliance.</p><p>In addition, section 143(6) is a reporting provision that provides for the designated institutions to report to the HEA annually on the implementation of their guidelines, codes or practices.  This is a reporting provision and provides the higher education institutions with the opportunity to explain any non-compliance to the HEA.  The HEA can then have regard to that explanation.  We are clear and satisfied that the policy intent on comply or explain is already reflected in the legislation as drafted.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his response.  I still have a concern.  I note that in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science report and scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill, one of the key recommendations was that the legislation should ensure there is a strong and independent HEA.  I am somewhat concerned that the idea of the HEA being independent from the Minister seems not to be addressed.  I believe it was Senator Byrne who said it should not be independent from the Minister.  I acknowledge that the HEA is a State agency but I am concerned that the traditional arm's length approach in the context of State agencies, and the idea of independence within those agencies, is somewhat undermined by the provisions in this Bill.  In that regard, I note that there is a big difference.  For example, everybody has policies but the State and the Government are not actually exactly the same.  It is not the equivalent.</p></speech>

We do not operate a winner-takes-all type of politics in Ireland.  It is the case that State agencies have their own mandate, which may span across a number of periods of government.  Similarly, in the context of the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature, when we are giving powers to the Minister, especially powers around making policies and ideas, it is important to clearly specify which powers are being provided for.  The Minister may have policies, but usually the way those policies would be put into effect is either through legislation or through regulation, with the regulation being something that the Oireachtas empowers the Minister to do.  The concern is that this is quite widely framed.  For example, subsection 11(b) provides for &quot;the implementation of any policy or objective of the Minister or the Government.&quot;  Again, my concern is not so much the previous line which relates to any enactment, but the fact of &quot;any policy or objective&quot;.  This is just slightly widely framed.  I noticed that the memorandum of understanding, MOU, is referenced, but the caveat in relation to the MOU is not there in the legislation.  It is not a reference to any policy or objective of the Minister or the Government that may be drawn in line with the memorandum of understanding.  That reference is not there.  This is why it is a little bit too widely framed and why I am concerned.</p><p>I accept the Minister's bona fides on some of the other areas.  I understand the non-compliance point.<b></b>I had put forward a compromise amendment on that because I feel that a very wide comply or explain provision might be too wide.  I sought a compromise between the Minister's position and the Irish Universities Association position.  My amendment is effectively a halfway point.  I believe this represents a good and constructive compromise.</p><p>I accept the point about the an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s consultation already widely provided for.  I note, however, that we will come to further amendments on trade union representation, which I may need to press further on the next Stage.  That covers my amendments within this grouping.</p></speech>

It relates to the concern about the very high level of discretion that is afforded to the Minister in making appointments to the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  The amendment would require that any persons who were proposed to be appointed to the board would have to be recommended by the Public Appointments Service for such potential appointment.  This is to ensure transparency in the process and to add an extra safeguard in respect of the Government.  I note that while there was ministerial discretion previously with regard to the appointment of members of the Higher Education Authority, there are significantly greater powers being afforded to an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, including greater powers in respect of the penalties it may apply to higher education institutions.  Given the significantly increased and strengthened powers of an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s it is crucial that there is full clarity regarding any persons who may be appointed to it.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there have been situations where persons who had been politically appointed to boards in the State have not always delivered the standard we would have hoped for in their performance.  It is important that there should not just be a clear independence of the board but that there would be seen to be a clear and transparent process relating to the appointments to the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  I note that other Ministers have chosen to employ the Public Appointments Service in respect of appointments to significant roles and significant boards in the State.  Where there is a board that will be exercising significant power the transparency requirement becomes much more important.  In that regard, I urge the Minister to take advantage of the fact that the Public Appointments Service is there.  The final decision would be the Minister's, but the Public Appointments Service should have the role of recommending potential appointees.</p> <p>Amendment No. 54 seeks to address an issue we see throughout the Bill.  I have already signalled the very serious concern, which I place alongside the concerns of students unions, about the fact that there is a distinct lack of a requirement for trade union representation of both academic and professional staff either on the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s or, and we will come to this later, on the boards of individual higher education institutions.  This amendment would mandate that of the 12 members of the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s not less than two members would be trade union representatives, one representing professional staff and the other representing academic staff.  It is not excessive that in a board of 12 members there would be two members who are able to represent those who work in the higher education institutions, either as academics or in the extensive professional staff who work in this area.  This is a very important matter.</p> <p>I will not move amendment No. 55 as I have decided on reflection that this issue is addressed by Schedule 2 in terms of transparency.  I was glad to see the point that I inserted in a previous legislative measure has been echoed in Schedule 2.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of Senator Warfield, who would normally be dealing with this legislation.  Amendment No. 53 relates to trade union representation on the board of the HEA, academic and non-academic, respectively.  The absence of specific reference to trade unions throughout the Bill has been addressed by a number of amendments on Committee Stage, which we welcome.  However, it is important that they are represented on the board of the HEA as well as on governing bodies of individual institutions.  The inclusion of trade unions on higher education institutions' governing authorities is welcome, but this Bill establishes the HEA with new legislation so it appears to be a mistake not to include trade union representation on the board of the HEA.</p></speech>

I fully agree with her on the principle of using the Public Appointments Service.  It is used already in respect of the board and it will be used in the future.  It is the policy intent to use it.  We just do not believe it is appropriate to put the Public Appointments Service, PAS, into primary legislation.  Processes can evolve and names can change and so forth, but the Public Appointments Service should always be used for the appointment of people to the board of the HEA.  I do not disagree with the Senator in that regard, obviously with the exception potentially of the student representative seat.</p> <p>With regard to trade unions, I thank Senator Boylan for acknowledging that we worked together in the Lower House to strengthen trade union representation throughout the legislation and to make it more visible in a number of places.  My position on the HEA board is that it is a competency-based board, not a representational board.  It is absolutely open to members of trade unions to apply and to ICTU to put people forward through the PAS process.  It is important that the PAS process is used and that the Minister of the day can operate within that framework.</p></speech>

I do not have difficulty with that.  The suggestions were reasoned ones.  As we came here today for the resumed Committee Stage, I expected to see Government amendments to make those corrections.  That has not been done and I am not sure what the basis for that is because I have not had any correspondence from the Department on that.  Perhaps the Minister of State might wish to address that.</p></speech>

Since its inception in 1987, though good times and bad, the national lottery has continually provided a steady stream of funding for good causes in the areas of the arts and culture, sport and recreation and various voluntary, community and local activities.</p> <p>I will not go through all the detail that was mentioned in February, but some key highlights are worth mentioning.  In 2021 the national lottery contributed &euro;254 million to good causes.  The total expenditure on those causes was &euro;425 million.  In 2022, the contribution of the national lottery is estimated to be &euro;290 million.  This will amount to an aggregate &euro;453 million for those good causes.  While we still have several months to run until the end of the year, a healthy increase of 14% is estimated this year in national lottery funding for good causes.  Among the several beneficiaries in 2022 will be: artistic endeavours supported by the Arts Council; Irish language support schemes; sporting bodies, sports and recreational facilities and projects and activities supported by Sport Ireland; private housing grants; the Heritage Council; youth organisations and services; the senior alerts scheme; the community and voluntary sector; the Society of St. Vincent de Paul; and Protestant Aid.</p> <p>There are different perspectives on the aims and approach of the Private Members' Bill before us.  We all share a common appreciation of the value of the national lottery in funding good causes in addition to what the Exchequer contributes.  Some good causes might have suffered even more during the financial and economic crisis a decade ago without the continuing support provided by the weekly purchase of national lottery products.  We all want the national lottery to continue to make a contribution to good causes.</p> <p>The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, commissioned Indecon to carry out a report on the current allocation of national lottery funding to and its utilisation by Departments.  Among other things, Indecon was asked to: examine best practice in other jurisdictions; develop policy options to enhance the connection between national lottery sales and the allocation of funding to good causes; monitor and report on the impact of funding allocated; and identify new areas for funding allocations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Indecon also carried out consultation with various stakeholders in March and April of this year as part of its work.  Indecon carried out an omnibus survey of the general population last November.  It is expected that the final Indecon report will be available in the near future to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for his consideration.  It is reasonable to assume that the findings and implementation of recommendations of the Indecon report will help secure and consolidate public support for and confidence in the national lottery as a vehicle for raising valuable funding for good causes in Ireland.  Full consideration of the report could also provide a useful basis for the consideration of any legislative initiatives regarding the national lottery.</p><p>It is also worth referring to the prospective establishment of the gambling regulatory authority which I think is of relevance in this context.  The gambling regulatory authority, which is to be established under the prospective gambling regulation legislation, will operate as an independent regulator under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  It is intended that the authority will regulate gambling, gaming, and lottery services by both the commercial and non-commercial providers of such services, including their advertising, in order to achieve a high degree of compliance with the gambling regulatory legislation.</p><p>The process of appointing a CEO designate for the gambling regulatory authority is in train and it is hoped that a successful candidate will be identified in the coming months.  The pre-legislative scrutiny phase was completed earlier this year.  It is also expected that the Bill to establish the gambling regulation authority will be published after the summer.</p><p>Of course, the national lottery itself is well regulated by the office of the Regulator of the National Lottery.  The establishment of the gambling regulation authority of itself will help establish a level playing field for gambling activity in Ireland.</p><p>I must at this stage recall that in the debate last February I referred to certain legal hurdles that proposed legislation such as that before us today would have to get over.  Legislation in this area would need to be compatible with EU law.  Specifically, I instanced the challenge of addressing the issue of proportionality in justifying a complete ban on a previously legitimate and legal business activity that has been in place for 30 years or so.  There would be a need to show overriding reasons to justify a complete ban as a non-discriminatory and proportionate means of achieving legitimate objectives in the public interest.  It seems likely that some very considerable work would be necessary to mitigate and manage any legal risks that could arise in respect of legislation along the lines before us today.</p><p>The European courts seem to have been very strong in their view that raising public funds does not by itself constitute a legitimate reason for governments to take actions in regard to the rights of lottery competitors to trade.  This is no small issue that will have to inform the drafting of legislation like that before us today.</p><p>In conclusion, it is not proposed that there would be any Government amendments put down to this Bill today.  First, it is considered that much more work would need to be done on working through the various legal issues that would surround such legislation.  Ensuring that legislation is robust and defensible against challenge is a fundamental feature of drafting and proposing legislation.  Second, it seems prudent and appropriate that any initiatives in this area should be considered in the context of the prospective establishment of the gambling regulation authority.  Engagement with the authority about the issues around the Bill before us today and about its objectives and rationale seems sensible.  Legislation could well be enhanced by such engagement.</p><p>Finally, it seems worthwhile to consider how the findings and recommendations of the Indecon report might strengthen and reinforce the links between good causes and national lottery funding.

I am one of the 5,000 agents in the country who has been losing money for the last 20-odd years.  In my case it is in the last 15 years as an agent of the national lottery because we do not earn any income from the sales and because the sales are being made in the bookies.  The media has highlighted the significant amount - the &euro;60 million-plus - that is lost to the good causes fund that distributes money throughout the country in areas of sport and health.  That is what the focus of the legislation needs to be.  That money is lost to the Exchequer which allows us pay out.  In the last months we highlighted the &euro;100 million or so that the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, announced.  Had we not the income from the national lottery, we would not have those funds.  Therefore, I want to put on record my full support for the Bill.</p></speech>

Were I the proposer of this legislation, I would be very disappointed.  This is a Government Minister of State coming in to three Government Senators to more or less tell them that there is a lot of work to do, there is huge concern, there are legitimate objectives, and there is public interest but in conclusion it is not proposed to do anything.  I would be shocked and shattered.  I would expect that kind of treatment directed towards this side of the House or to me.  I must say I am disappointed.</p> <p>Section 3 of the Bill talks about amending section 46 of the principal Act to make it a criminal offence for the bookmaker to use national lottery or any other products for the purpose of a betting offer by increasing the penalties.  It is all reasonable.  I commend Senators Ward, Currie and Carrigy on the work they put into the Bill, and they have clearly put a lot of work into it.  They believe in it.  Others have been in touch with us about the Bill.  For the Minister of State to say they can go off on their holidays and they have a lot of work to do, let us be honest, I do not know if it is a surprise to them.  Whether the Minister of State engaged with them before - I do not need to know - I would be very disappointed if I had gone to this trouble.  I wish them well.  All they can do is continue to work away at it.  I hope that after the summer they will have done a bit more work as the Minister of State has asked of them.</p></speech>

This Bill has been before the House previously and we discussed it at length.  The Minister of State took on a lot of the practical complications that were involved in the Bill.  Senator Ward put a lot of work into it and I commend him on what he is trying to do with the Bill.  I have serious concerns with part of it as I have said here before.  I made quite a strong case and I am delighted the Minister of State has listened to our case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1646" speakername="Ollie Crowe" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#MMM01500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  This has been going on for some months.  Some points have been made but I wish to highlight additional information and facts.  Going back a little before we go forward, the national lottery licence was sold in 2013 for 20 years.  It was sold in the context of the market conditions at the time.  Since then, it was changed from 45 numbers to 47, further reducing the chance to win.  The addition of two numbers meant that the odds of picking all six numbers reduced from 8 million to one to 11 million to one.  That is a huge decrease.  No doubt that was a factor in it not being won for well over six months last year.</p> <p>The millionaire raffle is another example of how consumers are worse off under the private operators who took over the lottery.  The Easter millionaire raffle in 2013 had a maximum of 180,000 tickets sold at &euro;20 per ticket.  The Christmas 2022 had a maximum of 500,000 tickets sold at &euro;25 per ticket.  The revenue 2013 was around &euro;3.6 million of which &euro;1.7 million was returned in prizes.  In 2022 it was &euro;12 million revenue of which &euro;2.1 million was returned in prizes.  You do not need to be a mathematician to understand that.  It is an incredible and unjustified increase by any stretch.  It is simply greed because the operator can do this and there is no competition.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My understanding from my research is restrictions that stopped the lotto from operating online were removed as part of the sale.  Immediately after the licence takeover, scratch cards that cost &euro;10 and &euro;20 were added.  These can also be purchased online, which I believe is a dangerous trend.  In 2020, following an investigation, the national lottery regulator found the operator had breached three provisions of the National Lottery Act 2013, as well as its licence with the State, by omitting top prizes totalling &euro;180,000 from three scratch card games, one of which was held in 2015 while two others were held in 2019.</p><p>At the time this licence was sold, bookmakers were operating in these markets as they have done for decades.  It is problematic that the State would now intervene to alter the landscape for private operators that both provide gambling products to, in effect, create a monopoly in favour of one operator.  I find it even more problematic that it would be done in favour of a private operator in areas where it currently has a complete monopoly, such as, for example, the millionaire raffle.  It just does not seem correct.  It must be noted that until 2033, the lottery will be majority owned by a Canadian investment firm that is making large profits and has paid hundreds of millions in dividends since gaining this licence.  Many people like the option of doing fewer numbers in the bookmakers to increase their chances to win at a much lower price, especially since the operators of the lotto increased the minimum play by 33% following the takeover, with the minimum cost rising to &euro;4 from &euro;3, as the Minister of State will be aware.</p><p>I would like balance but what is being suggested is the State should intervene in the market between private operators that both offer gambling products, thereby creating a monopoly for one and removing the option for people who wish to gamble on the lotto at a much lower cost with fewer numbers.  It is a suggestion that should be considered very cautiously. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-07-12a.613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022071200002#NNN00200"><p>I have to agree with Senator Boyhan.  I am disappointed.  There was previously a very clear indication from the Government that it was in favour of this legislation.  In fact, I am aware of correspondence between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne, which was put into the public domain, that the former wanted exactly this kind of legislation to be put in place.  As it happens, it crossed with this Bill, which was published a few days later having already been with the Bills Office.</p> <p>What is in the Bill is a proportionate and reasonable attempt to do exactly what the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has said he wants to do.  On the last occasion, we were told there were problems, which I accept, with drafting the definition of a betting offer - that now appears to have exited the concerns of the Department - and problems relating to legitimate expectation.  The latter no longer exist because the Minister of State should know that in bringing forth legislation, legitimate expectation concerns cannot arise.  This is something that has been done in the UK, for example.  No issue arose in respect of legitimate expectation at a time when the UK was a member of the European Union.  Exactly this kind of restriction was placed on gambling offerings in the UK and no issue arose from that.</p> <p>We now have a situation where we are told we need to wait - I think this is what the Minister of State is saying - for the outcome of the Indecon report.  That is news to us, given this Bill was published in April last year and it appears the Indecon report was only commissioned around Easter this year.  Indecon may have done its surveys, and that is great, but we do not need to hear from Indecon to decide whether there is a public policy basis on which we should bring forward this legislation.  That is something about which the Court of Justice of the European Union, CJEU, has been quite clear in the Stoss case.  It has stated we do not need research to demonstrate X, Y and Z in public policy is necessary.  In fact, the European courts have been very clear that gambling, in particular, is an area in which member states must be given wide purvey to reflect their own social mores or social objectives in how they regulate it.</p> <p>This is why I also have a difficulty with this idea we are now talking about, namely, whether the Bill is compliant with EU law.  It goes without saying legislation passed by these Houses must be in compliance with European law.  I presume the Minister of State is referring to elements of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, specifically Articles 49 and 56.  I do not believe this legislation is abhorrent to those articles.  In fact, if we look at the case of Digibet and Albers, for example, the CJEU has referenced the overriding reasons of public policy that is in the public interest, which can satisfy the justification for a state to bring in legislation like this.  In that case, the court referenced consumer protection, combating fraud and crime, and preventing incitement to squander money on gambling.  That is what that case was about.  The CJEU has been very clear it is supportive of the rights of individual member states to bring forward legislation in exactly this area.</p> <p>I do not accept there is legitimate expectation on the part of any commercial gambling company, that there is a conflict with European law or that we need to wait for an Indecon report.  I also do not accept we have to wait for the view of the gambling regulatory authority for two reasons.  First, we do not know when that authority will be up and running.  That legislation has not even been published.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Justice that undertook the pre-legislative scrutiny of that Bill, which is a justice Bill quite separate from the regulation already in place regarding the national lottery.  That Bill, or at least what we know of it, did not reference bringing the national lottery under the auspices of a gambling regulator.</p> <p>It has always been the case in this country that the national lottery has been separately and distinctly regulated because it is a separate and distinct offering compared with what bookmakers and commercial gambling operations offer.  They are unregulated.  I welcome their regulation and look forward to that legislation but they are a separate issue from the national lottery, which is why it comes under the auspices of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and gambling comes under the auspices of the Department of Justice.  They are not even managed by the same Departments.  That is an absolute red herring when it comes to any opposition to this Bill.</p> <p>I am most disappointed by the fact that I understood there was a previous commitment from the Government to bring forward amendments to fix the problems it saw with this Bill.  I concede there are problems but they are fixable and could have been fixed simply by amendment.  Despite communications from Senators to the Department warning it that this stage was coming, and despite the fact we have already had a day on which we had 40 minutes' discussion of this Bill on Committee Stage during which that was then the issue, no amendment has been brought forward.  I do not understand the sudden cooling from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, when we have a stated ambition on behalf of its Minister to bring this kind of legislation through.  I do not understand why we are not progressing this today.</p> <p>As far as I am concerned, we will finish Committee Stage today, whether the Minister of State has reservations or not, because that is the job of this House and that is what will happen.</p></speech>

I see it from his side.  I believe it is good legislation and it is, in effect, a slap in the face from members of his party in the Government.  That is the reality of it.  I do not want to rub salt into the wound.  Senator Ward has put a lot of work into this Bill.  We have three Fine Gael Senators who brought this legislation to the House and who did a lot of work on it.  I also thought there would be some amendments.  I am somewhat surprised there are not.  Words indicating this legislation is not robust enough were used; this is pretty cutting stuff to say to a member of a Government party.  This might all have been ironed out yesterday or the day before.  The tone of the response is harsh.  It is a rejection by the Minster of State of a Bill brought forward by members of a Government party on his side of the House.  Clearly, all communications have broken down.  It all seems to be a bit of a surprise to these Senators and I share their disappointment.  Last time we discussed this, I went away thinking there would be some amendments.  That is what it is.  Let us call it what it is; a slap in the face by the Government to members of a party that is in the Government.  I would be grossly insulted if I had brought such legislation to this House.</p></speech>

I accept that is the problem the legislation is trying to solve.  Senator Boyhan mentioned that a lot of work has been done and there is a lot more work to do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Much work has been done, not just by the Senators but also within my Department.  Commissioning that independent and external report is a good thing to do.  Considering that report is good.  Getting clear legal advice about whether this law would be challenged and whether that challenge might be successful is important and doing the pre-legislative scrutiny on the gambling Bill in the Department of Justice is also important work.  We need to make sure it will stand up and that we have all the information we need to make a good law.  We clearly share the same objectives.  We want to make sure there is sufficient money for good causes.  </p><p>We have been discussing the emphasis on making sure the money for good causes is retained and maximised.  Senator Crowe suggested we should think about the prizes and the value for money for the consumer.  We are trying with the Indecon report to make sure we follow best practice compared to other countries, to do a good analysis of what works in other jurisdictions and to make sure the money being spent on good causes is spent in a way that is transparent and obvious to the public, so that if we fund a project and people get a great benefit from it, they can make the connection between buying a ticket and something in their community getting funding.  The EU does that well but perhaps that could be done better in respect of lottery funding.  I look forward to seeing what is in that report.  I know it has been drafted but I have not seen the draft yet.  I think it is very close to its conclusion.  It would be wrong to make legislation about this without having the report.</p><p>The comparison was made to the UK and other jurisdictions that have banned betting on lottery numbers.  The problem is if the ban is brought in at the time the lottery is brought in or at the start, you have not allowed a business to build up and, as was said, a legitimate expectation for that business to exist.  We are looking at Articles 49 and 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU in this regard.  In Ireland for roughly 30 years, bookies have been running this business.  The legal advice we have from the Attorney General's office is that if we take that business away solely on the grounds that we would like to take their money and spend it on good causes, that could be challenged and it may not stand up.  We need to think about this.</p><p>Senator Boyhan referred to the harsh tone of the comments.  That was never my intention and I apologise if my tone came across as harsh.  In terms of working together on this, I am always willing to meet any Senator who contacts me.  Any Senator who wants to come around my office and discuss legislation or ideas they have, I am willing and my door is open to anybody, whether a Government or Opposition Senator.  That is always the way because I do not have all the good ideas.  Most good things I have done have been somebody else's idea, I have to admit.  That comes from being open and listening to people.</p><p>Senator Ward made the point that the regulation of the national lottery is completely separate from private gambling regulation and they are completely different animals.  I am not sure I accept that.  As I see it, the consumers are the same people.  They are the public whether they walk into the bookies or buy a lottery ticket.  They are buying it in different venues but they are the same people spending the same disposable income and, at the end of the day, they are gambling.  They are betting in different ways.  The only difference is the bookie is a profit-making organisation and the lottery is sending most of its money to good causes. </p></speech>
