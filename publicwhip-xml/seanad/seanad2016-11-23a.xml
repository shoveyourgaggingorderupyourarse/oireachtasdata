I commend him on the work he has done in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p> <p>Crusheen railway station is located on the western rail corridor.  The number of people using the western rail corridor, specifically from Ennis to Galway, has grown in recent years.  In 2015, 102,000 passengers travelled the route from Ennis to Galway.  It is the highest number of passengers so far since the line was opened a number of years ago.  Given the fact that parts of the line have been flooded, particularly from Limerick to Ennis, the number of passengers is quite impressive.</p> <p>I request the Minister to outline when he plans to commence work on opening a railway station at Crusheen.  There is an old railway station in Crusheen.  There is a growing population in the area from Crusheen to Ruan and in the surrounding northern and eastern districts of Ennis that would definitely use a railway station at Crusheen.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many stations of this type are now automatic, as a result of advances in technology, so no human resources would be necessary.  The more stations that are opened along any of our rail lines - and specifically this line - the more people will use those lines for leisure and to commute to and from work.  I hope the Minister might have some good news for the people of Crusheen and the surrounding areas who are hopeful of having a railway station at some stage in the near future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this important matter.  He has made a very good case, within the context in which we work, for the station he mentioned at Crusheen, County Clare.  I will begin by addressing the broader context of this issue.  The Senator will be aware that submissions are being taken as part of the public consultation side of the ongoing rail review.  If Senator Conway and others make the case for Crusheen in the context of the public consultation process, which will continue until mid-January, that case will be considered on its merits.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I am responsible for policy and overall funding of public transport.  The operation of the rail network, including the stations on it, is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  There is sometimes an expectation that I can move in and build a couple of railway stations to satisfy various vested interests, but it does not work like that.  Perhaps it should.  I am not sure.  At present, the operation of the network is left to a body which is not directed by politicians on a daily basis.</p> <p>I would like to set out the background to the redevelopment of the western rail corridor, including the Ennis to Athenry line on which the proposed station at Crusheen would be located.  In 2006, when a great deal of capital funding was available for infrastructure projects, the Government of the day approved funding of &euro;106.5 million for the first phase of the redevelopment of the western rail corridor under the Transport 21 programme.  This investment allowed for the reopening of the 36-mile stretch of railway line between Ennis and Athenry and the opening of six stations.  The line was opened to the public in March 2010.  In the business plan for the first phase of the western rail corridor, it was projected that annual passenger numbers would reach 200,000 by 2015.  However, the latest official passenger numbers from Irish Rail show that just 102,442 passenger journeys took place on the line in 2015.  I note Senator Conway's point that flooding may have caused a reduction in the number of passengers to be expected.  After five years of operation, just over half of the passenger numbers estimated in the original business case have actually been realised.</p> <p>I understand that Clare County Council granted planning permission for the proposed railway station at Crusheen in 2010 and that funding for the construction of the station was included in the predecessor to the current capital plan, which was to cover the period from 2012 to 2016.  However, the station was not progressed for a number of reasons, including the reduction in capital funding for rail infrastructure that was required to support emergency funding for the CIE group in the 2012-2013 period.  Although the case made by Senator Conway is a good one, he will understand that the development of Crusheen railway station was one of the many victims of the crisis of recent years and the lack of funds associated with it.  He will be aware that Exchequer funding for public transport projects over the coming period is set out in the current capital plan, the transport element of which covers the period up to 2022.  As I have said on a number of occasions, the first priority of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport within the capital plan is to ensure the maintenance of existing transport infrastructure, including the heavy rail network, at steady-state levels so that it remains safe and fit for purpose.  Based on the funding allocations for public transport under the capital plan, we should achieve steady-state levels by 2020.  This, rather than the expansion of the network or the opening of new stations, remains our focus in view of the current constraints on availability of funding.</p> <p>Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann remains in a challenging position financially and has limited resources of its own to fund additional projects.  The company has not made any proposal to the Department recently regarding the opening of Crusheen railway station.  I will make inquiries in the next week about the Department's determination and whether it has received representations on behalf of Crusheen.   The Senator will be aware that the Government has committed to review the capital plan in 2017.  I am determined to make the case for public transport investment to be increased and accelerated as a result of that review to address our growing transport needs.  If additional funds were to become available following on from this, there would be many competing demands within the public transport sector.  All projects would be subject to robust analysis and would require strong business cases to justify their value and demonstrate how they would significantly improve the public transport system.  I would welcome it if the case which has been made by Senator Conway this morning were repeated at that time.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, the National Transport Authority is running a public consultation on rail in Ireland.  As I have mentioned, it was launched last week with the publication of the 2016 rail review, which the authority undertook in conjunction with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, and the authority's consultation document on the role of rail in Ireland and funding its delivery.  The public consultation process, which will give the public and all interested parties an opportunity to give their views and contribute to the debate on the future of heavy rail in Ireland, will run until 18 January 2017.  The National Transport Authority will then prepare a report based on the findings.  I intend to bring this report to the Government thereafter.  No decisions will be made about the heavy rail network until the public consultation process has concluded and been evaluated.  It would be welcome if the Senator were to contribute to that process by making a submission that includes the case for Crusheen.</p></speech>

Two major issues have challenged the railway line in question.  I acknowledge that the projected passenger numbers did not materialise.  First, the downturn in the economy affected all sectors of our society.  Second, as the Minister correctly pointed out, parts of the line between Ennis and Limerick were closed for almost six months in 2015 due to flooding.  That was always going to hamper the number of people using the line.  I agree with the Minister that we cannot expand the rail network any further.  We have to maintain and develop the current network.  I would slightly disagree with the Minister.  I am of the view that the more railway stations that are opened, the better because additional stations make our railway lines more accessible.  I think Crusheen has a case to make.  I will subscribe to the review.  I encourage those who are promoting the need for a railway station in Crusheen to do likewise.  As the economy continues to grow, I hope funding will be available to provide the people of Crusheen and the surrounding districts with a railway station.</p></speech>

Now that he has raised this case with me, Crusheen will certainly be embedded in my mind when these matters are being considered.  I might respond to his sensible agreement that a lack of funding has been responsible for many of the difficulties relating to our railways by saying we expect that the rail review, which has identified a funding gap of approximately &euro;103 million per annum over a long period, will compel us to address the problem of underfunding.  The funding gap has to be addressed by subvention or other means.  The crisis with our railways cannot be allowed to continue in this way.  This means that we must address the problem according to two criteria.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One is the social need for rail and the absolute commitment of the Government to a very efficient and necessary rail network in this country.  Whether that is done by subvention or value for money will be something decided when the consultation process is over.  All I can say to Senator Conway is that no stations have been identified for either building or closure at this stage.  That process will take place after the consultations are completed and handed into the NTA which will then report to us.  It will put the case that Senator Conway has made for Crusheen in the mix.</p></speech>

The issue is that because he declined to take part in certain VAT avoidance arrangements, he is no longer trading, according to the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  He is no longer in a position to earn a livelihood from what is a very well-kept and high quality family farm.</p><p>The issue I have had all along is there is a need for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to be extremely vigilant about whether there is any unfolding scandal here of an abuse of power in the poultry industry.  If a farmer is not able to sell his milk to one co-op, he can go to another one, but what happens when a farmer finds he is not in a position to sell his poultry because he has done due diligence and checked whether he can act in a particular way according to the requirements of Revenue and so on?  If that farmer found he was not in a position to take part in certain arrangements and was blackballed as a result, either or indirectly, is it a matter that would be of concern to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  It certainly should be and one does not have to be, as I am, from a small farming background to be concerned that small farmers are entitled to make a livelihood.  I would not fault any farmer for entering into an arrangement to make a livelihood but a small farmer, or even not such a small farmer, who wants to, as it were, follow his conscience or take the route of good citizenship should never be victimised.  There is a real danger in our world today internationally that the big corporations have their way with the small guy.  That should not happen in Ireland, in Cavan or anywhere else.  I want the Minister and his Department to take an active interests in this case because it seems to me there is not a whole lot of competition among processors in the poultry sector and that creates particular dangers.</p><p>In the news report, the farmer said he had lost out on an additional &euro;25,000 a year because he had not participated in certain arrangements.  A processor, such as Carton Brothers Manor Farm, is entitled to source produce from whomever it likes, but if there is a question of a supplier getting penalised because he took the route of good citizenship, then an important public issue arises.  That is the issue I want the Minister to address.  We cannot stand back and say it is a private arrangement between a processor and a supplier.  It is an issue if somebody took the route of good citizenship and finds themselves cut out.  This farmer is no longer in business.  Sheds are lying idle which is a change from a situation where a guy was producing 1 million chickens a year.</p><p>It is very much in the Minister's interest to find out what went on regardless of whatever issues arise on the VAT issue in future and whatever the tax arrangements were.  The State has an interest in ensuring the people who take the route of good citizenship are protected, whether that means informal or formal activity by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is an issue here.  It is an issue I will not let lie.  I will return to it again and again until I am satisfied the State is doing everything necessary to investigate whether people have acted properly.  Whether it is the big processor, Carton Brothers Manor Farm, Mr. Mohan or others, it is important that the State ensures the small guy does not get victimised, particularly if he is acting according to his own lights and doing what he believes to be the right thing having exercised the necessary due diligence.</p><p>I do not know what response the Minister will give today but there are options.  This issue can trundle on and become more of a controversy while an individual seeks justice.  It is perfectly within the gift of the Department to appoint a mediator to try to bring the sides together to try to get to some kind of understanding and to ensure in any case that justice is done in the final analysis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#C01500"><p>I thank Senator Mullen for raising this matter.  While I have overall responsibility for the regulation and development of the Irish poultry sector, the specific matter raised by the Senator is solely under the remit of the Minister for Finance.  The matters raised are being dealt with through an amendment to the Finance Bill which the Minister for Finance is currently bringing through the Oireachtas legislative procedures.  I have, however, indicated my support to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, for the initiative in the Finance Bill to ensure there is no abuse of the flat-rate VAT system, thereby ensuring the integrity of the system and its continued availability to farmers.  The flat-rate system generally works well and is an established element in agri-taxation policy.</p> <p>On the particular circumstances in which this producer is currently operating, the Senator will agree it would be inappropriate for me to comment directly on the detail of it.  The issue of where and to whom suppliers send their produce and the nature of their relationship with their processor is a commercial arrangement in which no Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine can have any role.  That said, it would be a matter of some concern if any supplier suffered adverse consequences solely as a result of drawing attention to alleged wrongdoing in any part of the agrifood sector.</p> <p>On the wider issues, the poultry sector is an integral element within the agricultural economy accounting for approximately 3% of the gross agricultural output and proudly supports around 6,000 jobs, most of these in rural areas.  Output at producer prices in 2015 amounted to &euro;190 million and the value of poultry meat exports amounted to &euro;320 million.  On the back of increasing demand for poultry protein and low feed costs, the outlook for the sector is positive for the remainder of 2016 and into next year.</p> <p>As part of my Department&rsquo;s contribution to the development of the poultry sector, we have a range of supports currently in place.  Last year we announced the opening of the new pig and poultry investment scheme under the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, helping to underpin economic growth and development throughout rural Ireland.  This investment reflects our ongoing commitment to the growth potential of this important sector and to the modernisation of farming in Ireland.  There is also additional funding under the young farmer capital investment scheme and the organic scheme for the poultry sector.  Poultry producers are also eligible to apply under the animal welfare safety and nutrient storage scheme.</p> <p>Earlier this year, my Department launched the &euro;100 million knowledge transfer group as part of Ireland&rsquo;s &euro;4 billion rural development programme.  Knowledge transfer groups will be implemented for some 27,000 farmers across six sectors, including poultry.  These groups will provide a key support to the agrifood sector in building its knowledge and skills base to underpin continued growth and competitiveness.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Creed:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=259"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=259&amp;amp;pid=MichaelCreed&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The scheme builds significantly on the previous discussion group model and is designed in such a way as to ensure the farmer and adviser engage in one-to-one discussions on key aspects of a farmer&rsquo;s business such as controlling input costs, environmental sustainability, breeding and herd health.  This one-to-one engagement will be complemented by group-based discussion and the sharing of experience and information between farmers.  I am satisfied that these various measures will greatly assist the ongoing development of the poultry industry.  Food Wise 2025, the ten-year strategy for the agrifood sector published in July last year, identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the sector and sets out an enabling strategy that will allow the sector to grow and prosper.  Food Wise 2025 includes over 400 recommendations on cross-cutting themes of sustainability, innovation, human capital, market development and competitiveness, as well as specific sectoral recommendations.</p><p>Food Wise 2025 foresees the creation of 23,000 additional jobs in the agrifood sector all along the supply chain from primary production to high-value added product development.  The implementation process for any strategy is vital for its success.  I chair the Food Wise high-level implementation committee, with high-level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee reviews progress on detailed actions on a quarterly basis in order to identify and solve problems quickly.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee on priorities for particular sectors or themes in enabling and delivering sustainable growth in investment and employment to benefit the agrifood sector.</p><p>Opening markets is a priority, particularly in the context of Brexit to further increase the market opportunities for Irish food and drink internationally.  We are after all an exporting nation with 90% of our food produce leaving the island.  It is for this reason that we have undertaken major trade missions to Asia and Africa in recent times.  In summary, the success of the Irish poultry sector, as with other elements of our agrifood sector, rests on the relationship between farmers and their processors in the first instance and further up the chain between the retailers and consumers.  It is imperative that there is equal opportunity for all concerned to make a sustainable margin and I trust in the poultry sector as with others that the opportunity exists for the producer to undertake its business in such a manner. </p></speech>

When he says that it would be a matter of some concern if any supplier suffered adverse consequences solely as a result of drawing attention to alleged wrongdoing, I presume he does not mean that it would not be a matter of some concern if, for example, he were to suffer consequences for going on not to participate in certain arrangements.  What does the Minister mean when he says it would be a matter of some concern?  Does he mean that he would make it his concern and the concern of the Department?  I think I have said enough to show that there is a case here for the Department to look into a matter because a significant public interest issue arises if somebody is victimised because in some way he or she did not want to get involved in something he or she believed was illegal.  That is the issue before us and it is one we are going to have to return to.  I think the Minister will agree with me that the State should ensure that the system should not be rigged against small farmers or against individuals who do not play ball with big corporates.  That is what this issue is about and I think we might have further conversations on this in the future but I very much thank the Minister for the attention he has given it to date and for coming in this morning.</p></speech>

It would be of concern to me if I felt somebody was being victimised.  There are many avenues that may lead to a resolution of this.  I am sure there is hardly a county in the country that does not have a story about some farmer in some enterprise who has a difficulty with his processing outlet.  If the Department was to become engaged in trying to find a resolution to each of those individual problems it would be overwhelmed.  In many respects even the Competition Authority has made it abundantly clear to us that we have no role to play, for example, with regard to the arrangements that exist between farmers who are constantly in difficulties with the meat processing plants.  We are told strictly that is not a function for us.  I do not have the detail of the case the Senator alludes to.  I have read the media comments on it etc. and, as I said in my response, I would be concerned if I felt that a grower in the poultry industry was being victimised solely on the grounds of raising an issue which the Senator has alluded to.  I would like to think that this issue could be resolved.  I am not saying that is a role I or the Department can play but there are many people out there, stakeholders and representative bodies, who may feel, as the Senator strongly does, that this is a case of large versus small and I am aware that in terms of the poultry industry, there are not many outlets where one can go if one has a falling out with a major processor.  I would like to think that this issue could be resolved but I am of the opinion that it is not an area where the Department or I can usefully play a role.</p></speech>

It is a very important trade because it takes the glut of Friesian bull calves off the market, which helps our beef and dairy industries.  This is an alarming decision for the agricultural community.  Approximately 60% of the dairy industry is based in Munster and there are 1.4 million dairy cows in Ireland.  Of those, the vast bulk will be in calf to a Friesian going forward and to have a glut in the market for Friesian bull calves running into the January-February calving season is a great worry.</p> <p>Last year, Cork Marts exported up to 20,000 head of calves.  Spain received approximately 7,000 head and Holland approximately 12,000 head.  That is equivalent to a quarter of the export trade at the moment for live calves in Ireland.  In 2015, 85,500 live calves were exported.  This year, the number dropped by 13,000 to 72,500.  This will have a knock-on effect on the beef industry.  The kill in Ireland has increased by 5.1% or 70,000 head of cattle.  It is projected next year that the kill will increase by a further 6% on top of that, which would be a further 120,000 head of cattle.  There will be a glut on the beef side of the market too, which will have a knock-on effect on the beef and dairy industries.  Nobody wants these Friesian bull calves in Ireland.  We need to get a market.  The most appropriate and fastest way to get these calves off the island is to take them off when they are between three and six weeks old, because seven calves can be moved in the same space as a 500 kg bullock would require in the trailer. </p> <p>It is a major worry for our market and for the island.  In many ways we need to engage with the exporters to ensure we have an outlet.  This could become a welfare issue because how will we deal with 1.4 million dairy cows calving with no outlet for these Friesian bull calves?  Artificial insemination, AI, is up 6% and most of it is Friesian so there will be more Friesian bull calves on the market.  We need to work with the exporters and with Cork Marts to get them back into the business.  Bandon Mart will have 1,800 head of Friesian bull calves going through it in peak weeks.  That is a phenomenal figure.  It is the biggest mart in Ireland.  We need Cork Marts to come back into the business because it is in a real dairy heartland.  If it does not come back, calves will plummet from &euro;90 to &euro;120 this year to anything between &euro;50 and &euro;60.  That would be the maximum.  It is a huge problem for us and I hope An Bord Bia might be able to work with the exporters and with the Department to try to encourage exporters.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unless exporters come into the space, it will have a knock-on effect on the dairy industry but will a huge impact on the beef industry in the years to come.  We do not want grade P animals coming onto the grid.  At the moment they are coming on around 350 cent to 360 cent a kilo.  It will be a nightmare situation if these animals come onto the market in two and a half years' time.  I hope we can engage and do something because if we do not, we will have a huge problem in two and a half years' time and next spring it will be a disaster for the calf trade.</p></speech>

The decision by Cork Co-operative Marts to remove itself from its direct involvement in the live trade in calves is a matter for the company.  It would be inappropriate for the Department to comment on that decision which is based on commercial considerations.</p> <p>On the general issue of live cattle exports, I want to stress that we have built huge expertise in this trade over the years with a number of top class players involved in this sector.  Total live exports of calves and cattle amount to nearly 125,000 so far this year.  The live export trade, whether to other European Union member states or to third countries, is a vital component of Ireland's livestock industry and serves a dual purpose of stimulating price competition for domestic cattle and satisfying a real demand in overseas markets for specific types of animal.  It complements the processed beef trade by providing alternative market outlets, thereby underpinning the meat and livestock industry generally.</p> <p>The main exporters of calves from Ireland have built up their experience over many years.  Ireland takes pride in its strong reputation for maintaining high transport standards.  The transport of animals over long distances is conducted in a manner which safeguards the animals being transported.  That is something to which we are committed, namely, having the highest animal welfare standards in terms of live export transport arrangements.  Not only do we meet the EU standard but in fact we insist on a higher standard.  That is appropriate and proper given our significant dependance on that market.</p> <p>The live cattle trade has proved more difficult in recent years due to changes in animal health rules, particularly in Belgium, as regards infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, IBR.  Changes in the interpretation of the European Union rules on animal transport in the Netherlands have in recent times created some additional difficulties for Irish calf exporters for the coming spring.  My Department has been working closely with the Dutch authorities in this matter and will continue to do so.  Other markets such as Spain will play an increasing role in this trade.</p> <p>Senator Lombard will be aware that Bord Bia has an active promotional programme in place that supports exports to both established continental and new markets for live cattle.  Through its international network of overseas offices, it actively supports the development of the live export trade through the provision of market information, developing market access and promotional activity.</p> <p>The major development this autumn of the reopening of live trade to Turkey has resulted in three significant shipments already having taken place involving in excess of 8,000 cattle.  I should also mention the trade mission I led to Morocco and a subsequent trade mission to Algeria.  Apart from these countries, the markets currently open to live cattle from Ireland include Lebanon, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt and Serbia in addition to other member states of the European Union.  Last year saw high levels of exports of cattle to both Britain and Northern Ireland, largely driven by favourable currency rates which made cattle from this country very competitive in those markets.  I will continue to ensure that Irish livestock producers have the option of exporting to as many global markets as possible.</p></speech>

Bord Bia's involvement in the markets is important.  All I can ask is that we perhaps redouble our efforts regarding Bord Bia and see whether it could engage with exporters.  If there is a space where a quarter of the export market is left open, we need to encourage new people to come in.  I appreciate that it is a sensitive issue with the Bandon Mart co-operative stepping out of it, but the space and where it is at the moment is a huge issue for the agriculture industry.</p></speech>

Bord Bia's engagement in this matter is in partnership with the live exports.  I was in north Africa recently on a trade mission which had participants from the live export trade as well as from Bord Bia on the trade delegation.  There is that joined-up thinking in respect of the endeavour.</p> <p>I appreciate we are facing a perfect storm in many respects.  The expansion of the dairy herd has brought an increased number of Friesian bull calves, in particular, to the marketplace.  The overwhelming trade in the export of calves has been in that space.  We also face immediately the challenges associated with Brexit in the form of fluctuations in sterling, which has made it more difficult for the beef sector.  This makes it imperative that live export opportunities to any possible location are exploited, bearing in mind our continued commitment, and that of live exporters, to the highest animal welfare standards which are a fundamental foundation stone of that policy as approached by both the exporters and my Department.  I again thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p></speech>

I am deeply concerned about the involvement of foreign private contractors delivering similar services to that already provided by the local employment services in an effort to reduce the number on the live register.  The basic requirement even to be considered eligible to bid was that a company had a minimum turnover of &euro;20 million per year, which excluded many local Irish companies from the scheme.</p> <p>I am concerned that the local employment services and other such groups are competing with international companies whose very design is to generate huge profits.  With these companies driven by profit and wanting to ensure the full payment can be drawn down, there is a danger that the long-term harder to reach unemployed are overlooked in favour of those who are more ready to slip back into certain employment sectors.  These companies are paid by results within timelines, in contrast with the LES.  For example, mediators use guidance counsellor principles to assist clients as part of the planning process.  In many cases this can be extremely labour intensive in supporting individuals to the next step in their progression.  This can be especially intensive with those most distant from the labour market or individuals with issues around alcohol, substance misuse or mild depression.  Is it not true that if a client has mental health issues or any kind of disability, he or she is referred back to the Department?</p> <p>I am also concerned that outlying rural areas will be abandoned in the drive for profit maximisation and in the name of efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.  The 2016 LES contracts reduced mediator caseloads to 120 activation clients for the first time as part of the Pathways to Work initiative, ensuring activation clients are met and supported on a monthly basis.  I am concerned that this reduction is part of the Department's obligations to ensure JobPath contractors have sufficient client referrals to comply with the contractual agreement with the Department.  Will the Minister explain why the Government thought it necessary to privatise these services, displacing existing services and engaging British companies when there was no legal obligation to put such services out to tender?</p> <p>JobPath in Mayo commenced at a time when the economy was starting to improve.  It would appear that the JobPath contract came too late and at the taxpayers' expense.  Did the Department consider reviewing the LES contracts at the time to deal with the demand generated by the recession?</p> <p>There is also the issue of those selected for JobPath.  They are being forced to travel miles to access services that are provided in the local LES offices.  This does not make sense.  For instance, we are spending money on taxis to take people from one end of the county to the other when they are passing by their LES office where they could be supported into employment and receive exactly the same, if not better, supports as they would from JobPath.</p> <p>People are being told to attend the information days and are required to register with, for instance, Seetec in Mayo and the west.  If they do not, their social welfare payment will be cut.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Once registered, they are no longer eligible for a community employment scheme for up to a year.  Again, that makes no sense whatsoever.  Additional travel and child care costs are pushing those participating in JobPath into further poverty.  Many of those people feel intimidated and live in fear of losing their benefit.  An additional payment needs to be considered by the Department.  My experience is that clients are not being provided for adequately through the benefits system.</p><p>In light of the planned review by the Department of Social Protection of employment services, including JobPath, Jobs Clubs and local employment services, how much has the programme cost to date, that is, the entire tendering process and use of economic research specialists?  How much will the programme cost the taxpayer by the end of the four to five year cycle?  Are there any break or penalty clauses if the Government decides to pull out early?  How can we expect the local employment services to compete with companies that are for profit and are being widely promoted to third parties by Government and the Department of Social Protection?</p></speech>

An open public procurement process was conducted in accordance with European Union and Irish procurement rules.  Two companies, Turas Nua and Seetec, were selected to deliver the JobPath service.</p> <p>The companies deliver services directly and also engage with a range of local subcontractors, including training and employment service providers.  JobPath is an addition to, not a substitute for, the services already provided by the Department and the LES.  JobPath is thereby increasing the Department&rsquo;s overall capacity to engage with, support and assist jobseekers to get sustained employment.</p> <p>JobPath is a payment by results model and all initial costs are borne by the companies.  JobPath is so structured that the companies are not able to fully recover their costs until they successfully place sufficient numbers of jobseekers into sustained paid employment.  Participants on JobPath receive intensive individual support to help them address barriers to employment and to assist them in finding full-time sustainable jobs.  Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Jobseekers are also provided with a range of training and development supports, including online modules, career advice, curriculum vitae preparation and interview skills.  They spend a year on JobPath and if they are placed into a job, they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to 12 months while in employment.  During their time on JobPath, they may also be referred for further education and training opportunities.</p> <p>In 2016, the Department agreed contracts with the LES to provide a more intensive level of engagement with jobseekers.  In order to assist the LES to undertake a more intensive level of engagement, the number of jobseeker referrals was correspondingly reduced.  This would not have been possible without the benefit of JobPath.  JobPath is thus assisting the LES to deliver a better service for jobseekers and also assisting jobseekers directly via its own range of services and supports.</p> <p>Rather than being anti-competitive, the JobPath initiative has brought additional providers into the Irish employment services market and is thus providing jobseekers with a wider range of services.</p></speech>

In the first instance, in the European Union procurement rules there was no obligation on the Irish Government to privatise these services.  I believe it is the wrong direction in which to go.</p> <p>The Minister said this was additionality in terms of the LES and the services already in place.  I disagree fundamentally with that because if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it generally is a duck, especially in this case.</p> <p>To go back to my original questions which were not answered, and I understand this is not the Minister's portfolio, how much has the programme cost to date in terms of the tendering process and the use of economic research specialists?  How much will the programme cost the taxpayer by the end of the four to five year cycle?  Are there any break or penalty clauses if the Government decides to pull out early?  Those are my fundamental questions and I would appreciate answers to them.</p></speech>

As the Senator said, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it is a duck.  Whatever it is, it is working.  We have a huge target in respect of long-term unemployed people who for many reasons, including the length of time they have been out of work, the fact that they require upskilling, etc., are the most difficult cohort on the live register in terms of moving them into gainful employment.  Bearing in mind the costs, it is appropriate that there is a focus on that cohort.</p> <p>The Senator made reference to the fact that the companies had the capacity to skim and take on those with whom they could work most appropriately.  That is not the case.  They have no role in respect of the random selection of people who are long-term unemployed.  That is a function of the Department, which gives the clientele base to the company.  They do not pick Mr. X or Miss Y who looks like somebody-----</p></speech>

It incentivises both the company and the individual through the programme they deliver.  It incentivises both to achieve sustainable employment.  These are not job placements in schemes.  This is sustainable employment.  This is the most challenging cohort on the live register to deal with, and it comes at a cost.  I do not have the figures, and I understand the reason it might not be appropriate to publish them.</p> <p>In terms of the procurement of services, if we look at the service delivery model in Mayo, and I know it is the case in my constituency and in many other parts of the country, I have no doubt that many of the services are already contracted out to private service operators who run the local social welfare offices.  I am sure the Senator is not saying that they do not do as good a job in Mayo as they do in Cork.  That is also a service that is contracted out.</p></speech>

Fossil Free TCD has been lobbying and campaigning very diligently on this issue for many months, with the culmination this week of a commitment to divest.  I believe the students should be applauded on their resilience and commitment to the cause.  I know that Senator Ruane, when president of TCD Students' Union, campaigned and lobbied for the same result.  Trinity also has endowments in various other sin stocks, such as arms and tobacco companies, which in recent years students have taken issue with.  They feel that these investments contrast with the university's vision.  I too feel that the investments made by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, using taxpayers' money are out of line with the vision we have for a tobacco-free Ireland by 2025.  This is an issue I have raised before and will continue to raise.  In the words of Professor Luke Clancy, it is unconscionable.</p> <p>Since I first brought this issue to the House on 19 October, 500 people will have died from smoking-related illnesses.  If that does not portray the urgency of this issue, I have no idea what does.  In response to a parliamentary question I submitted through Deputy Jack Chambers, the Minister for State, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, said that she would, in consultation with her colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, express concerns to the Minister for Finance about the appropriateness of these investments in tobacco companies in the context of the review of the investment strategy and exclusion policy.  I have brought a Commencement debate to this House.  I have written to the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Noonan, asking them to beseech the ISIF to divest immediately from these holdings and I have also written to the CEO of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA.  To date, I have received no substantial response.  I repeat that 500 people will have died from tobacco-related diseases in the last month.</p> <p>Later today, I will meet representatives from ASH Ireland, the Irish Heart Foundation, the Irish Cancer Society, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland to seek joint collaboration to bring an end to this hypocrisy.  I also have a motion before this House proposing that Seanad &Eacute;ireann calls on the Minister for Finance to bring to an immediate end the investment of taxpayers' money by the NTMA and ISIF in the three separate tobacco companies in which they have equity holdings.  Based on the lack of response and urgency from the Government, I have been consulting with a number of party colleagues and have legislation prepared which would prohibit the investment of any taxpayers' funds in tobacco companies and seek the immediate divestment of any funds currently invested.  This legislation is currently with the Bills Office and I expect it to be published in the coming days.  I put the Leader on notice that I will be calling for the support of my colleagues in this House to ensure this legislation is successful.  I look forward to debating the public health (prohibition of tobacco investments) Bill 2016 in the near future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#G00400"><p>I believe we need to invite the Minister for Health to come before the Seanad to debate the regulation of crisis pregnancy services.  The Second Stage of the Labour Party's Private Members' Bill on this issue, which enjoys Government backing, was debated in the D&aacute;il last week.  In principle, I wholeheartedly support the idea of regulating counselling services in this area.  However, in the D&aacute;il last week, the Minister, Deputy Harris, kept referencing an anti-abortion counselling agency that featured in a recent newspaper expos&eacute;.  However, he chose not to mention the well-documented illegal and life-endangering counselling practices at State-funded clinics run by abortion-campaigning group, the Irish Family Planning Association, IFPA.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Harris, knows well that IFPA counsellors were caught on tape telling women to lie to their doctors to say they had a miscarriage and not an abortion where complications might arise after their abortions.  That was the advice that a master of a Dublin maternity hospital said would put women's lives at risk.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, also knows that IFPA counsellors were caught on tape coaching women on how to illegally import abortion pills to self-administer without medical supervision.  These are just two of many abuses unearthed at IFPA centres.</p> <p>It beggars belief that the Minister for Health would not condemn what went on there.  Such double standards are breathtaking.  In the D&aacute;il last week, Deputy Joan Burton even thanked the IFPA for its assistance in drafting the Labour Party Bill.  This is banana republic territory.  A whistleblower from that IFPA investigation contacted me this week to say that she was sickened after watching last week's D&aacute;il debate.  She described it as a slap in the face to the many women who suffer in silence with life-long regrets as a result of bad advice they received at the hands of the IFPA and others.  I also believe there is no excusing the dismissive attitude of the Minister, Deputy Harris, in the D&aacute;il last week when Deputies Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins raised legitimate and well-researched concerns.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We could also talk about the IFPA receiving six-figure sums from George Soros's Open Society Foundations to promote abortion in Ireland.  We could discuss how we feel about large international foundations funding and directing abortion campaigning in Ireland.  For now, I call on the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to meet the whistleblowers who exposed the IFPA wrongdoing.  It is the very least he could do, particularly after last week's D&aacute;il performance.  I propose we invite the Minister to come here and debate the issue as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

His reform package includes a recognition that small businesses that have not thrived under the previous rates system are in need of assistance.  Provincial towns that have not yet benefitted have been mentioned as the areas that will receive rates relief.  Recently, I called for a review of rates to be carried out for businesses in the South, mostly in rural Ireland, which are plagued by poor or non-existent broadband connections and basic telecommunications systems, as well as other vital infrastructure including flood protection.  The disadvantage placed on these businesses must be taken into account and it is unfair to expect them to pay the same as those receiving functioning, reliable broadband services and proper infrastructure.</p> <p>I acknowledge the forensic work by my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, on the recent Finance Bill.  An amendment to the Finance Act will severely limit the abuse of tax breaks for non-resident vulture funds.  The use of Irish collective asset management vehicles to hold money for five years and thus avoid paying taxes on disposal gains has been practised by a number of individuals.  When it was highlighted on Committee Stage, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance agreed to introduce an amendment.  I highlight these two cases as examples of Sinn F&eacute;in's commitment to island-wide economic equality.  While there are two separate Administrations, some of the most effective measures have come from co-operation in the North-South institutions and between individual Ministers.  An example is the growth in the agrifood sector.  One can only imagine the benefits that would come from an all-island approach to some of the biggest economic challenges facing families and businesses across the country.  Again, I urge fellow Senators to read the excellent report on modelling Irish reunification, by Professor Kurt H&uuml;bner.  If the Leader has not seen it, I will lend him a copy.  It is an excellent document that needs to be discussed in the House, with the Minister present to facilitate the debate.</p></speech>

I am disgusted because it is undemocratic.  Several weeks ago, I brought the Bill to the House.  I first informed the House.  The Bill was prepared and ready.  There have been many weeks during which the Minister or the Department could have consulted with me or my team to discuss the Bill if there were shortcomings.  It is an issue of marine pollution.  Other countries such as the UK, the Netherlands and Italy are already working on similar Bills.  The Minister said my Bill is breaching Articles 34 and 35 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Based on the precautionary principle, Article 36, it is fine.  It is a simple Bill, designed to pass through the House.  It is relatively straightforward.  The Minister said he would do the be all and end all for the marine environment and fisheries.  He has not.  He has had years.  He now is responsible for a housing crisis, which he is not managing.  He certainly is not managing my Bill because at 5.30 p.m. on the day before the Bill was to be debated, he informed me that he wanted the Bill killed.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il has requested its senior member in the coalition to ensure the Senator's Bill be killed off in order to allow Fianna F&aacute;il to come forward ahead of it.  If Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il are a coalition, they should stop playing games.  They operate together.  They vote together.  Fianna F&aacute;il Members sit there and wait to see which way each vote will go.</p></speech>

In this post-Brexit world, we are looking constantly for opportunities for the Irish economy to make the most of a bad situation to attract investment and workers to the country.  One area that a number of companies and employees are looking at is the education sector.  This morning I call on the Leader to bring in the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, to have a discussion on the feasibility of introducing the International Baccalaureate examination to the Irish education system.  At present, there is only one secondary school, a private secondary school in Dublin, that offers the International Baccalaureate at second level.  There are two smaller ones at primary level.  It is increasingly becoming an issue with large multinationals and Irish companies that require a multinational workforce that they are not able to identify appropriate educational needs for the families of workers moving to Dublin.  I would ask the Leader to call in the Minister to discuss that.</p></speech>

I will reintroduce a campaign, which I launched in the House previously and called Name and Shame - we have that privilege in this House - to be a consumer watchdog.  I bring to the Leader's attention that people ring 11811 for directory enquiries.  The charge is &euro;2.74 for that call, but Pure Telecom, an Irish company with two directors whom I will not name and which was ripping me off, is charging &euro;5.50 for that privilege.  That is a rip-off.  That is a 100% increase.  I am saying to consumers, "Beware of Greeks bearing gifts."  Pure Telecom representatives rang me and, in my innocence, I changed from Eir to that company.</p></speech>

I got that cold call.  I thought it was a great offer but they did not tell me what was between the lines and that I would be charged &euro;5.50 for one call to 11811.  I am saying to consumers to be wary of such cold calls coming in and making the subscriber an offer to change electricity provider, telephone provide or buy this or that.  There is something wrong.  I will use this House, as long as I am a Member, to expose such matters.</p> <p>I also appeal to RTE broadcasters to refrain from promoting shopping north of the Border.  They should remember who is paying the licence fee.  We south of the Border pay &euro;160 per year for that honour.  These great offers north of the Border are a myth in most cases but those going up there think otherwise.  They should also check their insurance cover that they are insured to drive north of the Border because, whether we like it or not, they are leaving the State.  I do not like it but they are technically, from an insurance point of view, leaving it.</p> <p>These are the kinds of issues I will bring to the attention of consumers.  The Consumer Association of Ireland and the National Consumer Agency should wake up.  They are not doing the job they were set up to do.  We have to do their job now in this House.  I will continue to do so, now that Fine Gael has decided to drop the rip-off Ireland campaign.</p></speech>

It is great to hear about people jumping in and out of bed and various other matters.  I am delighted that Fianna F&aacute;il Members found a warm bed when they arrived after the Labour Party, even if they did have to change the sheets.</p> <p>It is despicable that somebody has tried to steal the Green Party's clothes on the issue of that party's Bill.  The Green Party is part of the rise of change in Ireland and it is despicable to try to scuttle the Bill at the 11th hour in order that somebody else can take it.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Gallagher, mentioned the genderisation of education and the failure of the education system to attract a significant number of men.  Anybody who works or has worked in the education area, as the Leader has, cannot but be aware of the fact that fewer men are coming into it.  I attended a meeting of men called Men's Voices.  I am not 100% behind any particular pressure group, but one issue that was raised which has merit was the establishment of a men's council of Ireland.  It would include organisations such as the White Ribbon and Men's Sheds.  It has merit in so far as it should be possible to establish such a council and ensure it gets funding from the State.  I would ask the Leader to consider that and maybe discuss it with the relevant Minister to see if it has some traction within the Department.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

An area that we seem to neglect or ignore, probably because it does not rise on our trajectory very often, is the role played by customs personnel.  Members of this House should congratulate them.  They put themselves in more risk than personnel in any of the other services because the type of people they deal with, the criminals the Leas-Chathaoirleach pointed out last year, are very dangerous.  The customs men and women fearlessly go about the country seizing illicit cigarettes, fuel and alcohol, and they do that for the State.  They deserve our congratulations and support.</p></speech>

Most of them are American-based companies about which there has been a good deal of scaremongering.  However, the heads of companies such as Cook Medical, Uber and Northern Trust came out yesterday to state they are delighted they employ up to 9,000 people in Limerick and almost 8,000 in the Clare area around the Shannon free zone.  It is a positive move that the heads of those companies have stated they are delighted to stay in Ireland and have no intention of relocating anywhere else.  The head of Dell EMC, which is based in Dublin and Cork, has said that the company has been committed to Ireland for 30 years.  It, too, has pledged its support for remaining in Ireland.  Most of these companies said that they are looking at the skills set available on their doorstep and that they need access to Europe.  I want to allay the fears of people who were afraid these companies would pull out of the region because they are major employers.  I congratulate the heads of these companies on coming out with such a statement.</p></speech>

The Leas-Chathaoirleach may know that last week in Britain, in response to a parliamentary question, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, James Brokenshire, asserted that the whole of Lough Foyle is within the United Kingdom.  That is an arrogant and provocative statement that the Irish Government has contested.  We know that Lough Foyle has been disputed for many years.  We also know that the Loughs Agency responsible for administering Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough under the Good Friday Agreement has repeatedly called for this dispute to be resolved.</p> <p>What is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade going to do about this matter?  A report in one of today's newspapers refers to a charter from 1662.  That is the basis on which the British Government claims Lough Foyle.  A lot has happened since 1662.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, should come into the House and reassure the communities around Lough Foyle that those waters will be shared to the benefit of all to ensure their fisheries and tourism potential is fully realised.  I ask for a firm rebuttal of the comments of the Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, and a firm statement that we are moving forward working together on this island.  As for those who want to pander to the Brexiteers and those who want to refer to a charter from 1662 and to live in the past, that is their business.  However, we need the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to assert Irish interests and make it clear that whatever they are doing about Brexit, they will not destroy the livelihood of fishermen and tourism interests in the north west of Ireland.</p></speech>

As I find it very difficult to bring in family members to talk to all Deputies and Senators about the impact of alcohol misuse on their families, I have decided to hold a briefing today to which I hope all the Members here will come and listen to these people, who have been impacted by alcohol misuse, the culture around alcohol and the devastation it causes.  I encourage every Senator to attend.  When representatives of RGDATA were in here they were able to take photographs in the briefing room but we are not even allowed take photographs of the people who will speak today.

To get the Department to agree that the Minister would come into the House to discuss the Bill I had before it two weeks ago, I had to agree that I would not refer the Bill on to Committee Stage.  Members should not be disappointed.  Unfortunately, there is a tendency in Ireland to ensure that if a Bill does not come from a Department but is a Private Members' Bill, it goes no further.  One must work at it.  I published the Bill I had before the House for discussion two weeks ago in 2014 and for two years, I could not get a Minister to come into the House to debate it.  I do not care what the Department says on it.  There is resistance when a Bill does not come from a Department.  We should be honest about those matters.  Members have to continue to fight for that because if they believe firmly in a Bill, which I know is the case with Senator O'Sullivan, they have to keep lobbying, fighting and working with their colleagues to make sure they get the necessary support to bring about change.  It is part of the system we have to live with.  We might not like it but, unfortunately, that is how I have seen it happen in the past five years.  Perhaps that is something we should seek to change so that we can take on board the views of people with expertise in particular areas.  The best example was the committee set up to do a ten-year strategy for health.  There was resistance to having Members of this House on that committee.</p> <p>I want to raise one or two more issues.  The first concerns the banking sector.

There appears to be some resistance from the banking sector here to banks based outside Ireland coming in here.  If that story is true, and I am extremely concerned about it, the Minister for Finance should come into the House to clarify that there is not resistance to those jobs being created here.  There would be a huge spin-off from the point of view of the economy and it is something we need to develop.  I did a calculation on the number of jobs created since 2012 and in the past four years, 199,000 new jobs were created.

The "Be Winter-Ready" campaign for 2016-17 was launched recently and he might update Members on plans to tackle issues such as flooding and severe cold weather, particularly on salt stocks, grit, pumps and the early warning systems.  He could update us too on the reporting and preparations local authorities are undertaking and how they are measured by the Government task force, and could indicate where people can contact local services if an emergency arises from the extremes of the winter weather.</p> <p>I note that Ger Fleming of Met &Eacute;ireann is not very pessimistic about the long-range forecast but he stated that it can be accurate only for two to three weeks.  I think we must be ready.

This morning in Clifton House in Belfast Sinn F&eacute;in launched a comprehensive discussion document entitled "Uncomfortable Conversations".  Its focus is on the process of reconciliation across the island.  It is ironic to be talking about this, given some of the exchanges this morning.  We could all do with a degree of reconciliation now and again.  Almost 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement, the process of peace and reconciliation cannot ever be taken for granted.  It can never be allowed to remain stagnant or static.  We must always be very conscious of the need to reassess, reinvigorate and re-energise that process.  We have made monumental change.  The next step on that journey, as widely acknowledged, particularly but not exclusively in the North, has to be the national dialogue around reconciliation.</p> <p>We have had a national dialogue and will have more on Brexit.  It is important.  There have been calls in this Chamber and others for a dialogue about preparations for Irish reunification.  In parallel with those discussions we need to have a conversation about respect, equality and embracing and cherishing one other&rsquo;s views, perspectives, cultures, languages and practices.  In the North, there is an acute sense that political Unionism has failed to step up to the mark in respect of its responsibilities to the equality agenda, to respecting a sense of Irishness and Irish identity, the Irish language, as well as expressions of our culture and national identity.  As part of a process of nation building we have to have that process of national reconciliation.  I am very proud of the role that republican leaders, particularly Martin McGuinness in recent years, have played in that process.  It cannot happen in isolation and we should not allow it to happen in isolation.  We all have a role to play.  If the conflict affected all our lives and history across this island, so too must the process of reconciliation.  I hope this Chamber can help to facilitate and convene some of that dialogue. </p></speech>

There is a lot of talk about people on trolleys in hospitals and of needless admissions to hospitals.  We all know of occasions where elderly people presenting with needs such as intravenous medication are transferred to hospital from their homes or from nursing homes.  They must go in to the hospital through the accident and emergency department.  If there was a consultant-led, community geriatrician team many of these elderly people could be assessed and treated in the nursing home or their own homes.</p> <p>At Christmas 2015 I went to Mullingar hospital where there were 20 people on trolleys, 16 of whom were elderly and most of them needed to be rehydrated because they were ill.  They had been in nursing homes but there was nobody there who was trained to put up a drip to hydrate them.  If there was a community-based team with a consultant and nurse that could be done within the person&rsquo;s home or the nursing home and would save much hardship.  Thankfully, this morning there is nobody on a trolley in Mullingar hospital.  This could help to reduce overcrowding in the accident and emergency departments in hospitals such as Mullingar on a bad day.  Just as important, it would also preserve the dignity of older people and save their families the stress of a hospital admission.  Others here have suggestions and I have asked for this over the past 18 months and was told it would happen as a pilot scheme and I do not think it has.  If it has, I cannot seem to find it.  </p></speech>

This practice of putting forward a last-minute amendment is very unfortunate and does not help democracy.  There is an irony in the legal concerns being produced at the 11th hour in this regard.  If the Government has such strong concerns about the fundamental treaties for the functioning of the European Union I expect it will also urge its Members of the European Parliament to support the proposal going before the European Parliament today that the investor court system be referred to the European Court of Justice.  A serious concern has been expressed in this House about legal issues in respect of the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, between Europe and Canada, the key focus of which was on investor courts and their operations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Investor courts have now been identified as potentially violating fundamental European founding documents.  There have been strong calls for their reference to the European Court of Justice.  If there is such a desire for consistency with treaties, I would expect that not only the Government parties, but all parties here in the House who have representatives in the European Parliament, and I know some do, will take action to ensure that investor courts, as a stand-alone element, are challenged.  The investor courts have poisoned our trade policy across Europe and led to our lack of success in numerous trade agreements.  We must, therefore, consider whether to proceed with them.  We must proceed with a positive constructive trade policy that focuses on appropriate areas of tariff and an exchange of goods.  Unfortunately, there is no hope of that because yesterday the European Parliament voted against debating this issue.</p></speech>

All of this has happened at a time when democracy must be re-enforced and when everyone acknowledges that the European project is under threat.  Those of us who are passionate about the European project and democracy must assert and show the citizens of Europe that checks and balances are in place and that we take our role seriously.  The Government chose to ignore the democratic decision of the Seanad.  The Government must now not bypass the proper democratic and legal process at European Union level.  These decisions are political and responsibility must be taken.</p></speech>

The previous Leader of the House did a lot of work on this area.  Everyone knows that online gambling is a big problem.  Gambling is hard to detect and online gambling is even harder to detect.  As we all know, gambling destroys families.  Experts say that gambling is the worst addiction due to it being undetectable.  A debate on the matter is welcome.</p> <p>I note with interest and welcome the fact that the Central Bank will announce the outcome of its review on mortgage rules this afternoon.  The existing restrictions set limits on how much home buyers can borrow in respect of their income and the size of deposits.  I agree that we must do all in our power to prevent the irresponsible overheating of the housing market again.  However, the lack of available houses and soaring rents in the past two years means many couples dream of owning a home has fallen between two stools.  Senator Humphreys mentioned this issue this morning but I have touched on it too as these matters are connected.  I suggest we discuss the matter with the Minister when he attends for a debate.</p></speech>

I also support the comments that Senator Higgins made about CETA.</p> <p>Today, I wish to raise the issue of Palestine.  As the Leader will be aware, there was a vote in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to recognise the state of Palestine two years ago.  Indeed, a commitment to recognise the state is contained in the programme for Government, yet any time my party leader or others bring up the issue, we are fobbed off by the Taoiseach.  I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to come to the House to debate the matter.</p> <p>I recognise and acknowledge that there are people across the Chamber who feel strongly about Palestine and support the Palestinian people.  I ask my colleagues in Fine Gael who feel strongly about the issue to raise it within their parliamentary Oireachtas team.  There is no need for legislation to be enacted in order to recognise the state of Palestine.  We simply need the Taoiseach to stand up and say that this State recognises the state of Palestine.  </p> <p>I remind Senators that the situation in Palestine gets worse by the day.  We met an impressive group of people from the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel a fortnight ago.  They described the demolition of 252 Palestinian homes this year to date, which made 1,100 people homeless, including 500 children.  We know that the Israeli authorities are increasingly refusing to allow people into the West Bank or Gaza because they are afraid of what people might say when they return home, thus exposing the horrific nature of the apartheid state in Israel.  </p> <p>I appeal to the Leader, hopefully on behalf of a number of Senators in this Chamber, to please talk to the Taoiseach about recognising the state of Palestine.  The people of Palestine should not have to wait another day for this State to recognise the state of Palestine.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to doing so.  Let us work on this together and ensure we make progress.</p></speech>

We have called for the debate in the South on numerous occasions.  The Leader has said that he wants the debate and will arrange it.  Will the debate take place this side of Christmas?  </p> <p>We also need a debate on the issues that affect the Irish diaspora this side of Christmas.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Joe McHugh, visited the United States recently and spoke to people there.  In the aftermath of the US presidential election, I have been contacted by many documented and undocumented people who live in the United States but are concerned about their situations.  It is important to find out what the Irish Government will do to support them.  The Irish diaspora will also be affected by the Government's decision to row back on its promise to introduce presidential voting rights during its lifetime.   </p> <p>I support Senator Black's comments about families who suffer as a result of a family member abusing alcohol.  The Senator is right to raise this important issue and it should be included in the dialogue on the legislation she mentioned.  I commend her on arranging a presentation on the matter.

The motion states: "That Seanad &Eacute;ireann strongly condemns the Bank of Ireland for its arbitrary and undemocratic decision to close the accounts of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign and requests that they immediately reverse this decision.&rdquo;</p> <p>When I raised this matter first, there was pretty unanimous agreement throughout the House.  My understanding was that the Leader had indicated that he would make Government time available.  I am not sure if there has been a row back and I hope not.  I am sure that the Leader's good feelings and decency would indicate that we will debate the motion.  When it is envisaged that the motion will be debated?

Accurate information should be provided - in the case the Senator raised - to women no matter what their ideology is.  The Minister has a very balanced view on it.  He is very clear.  If the Senator reads the transcript of the Minister's remarks it is about having factual and accurate information on women's health.  The Government is looking at the issue of regulation and it is important we look at the whole issue of regulation of counselling and psychotherapy.  At the moment, one can do a weekend course, put up a plaque, advertise to give a course no matter what the area is, and can give information to people which will affect their mental health and which will affect them in a variety of ways.  If we are genuinely interested in the provision of accurate information whether it is on women's health or mental health, there needs to be regulation.  It is important that it is done.  The Senator raised the issue of money and I do not want to have a row with him but the pro-life campaign is well able to get money from abroad and bring in people from outside.</p></speech>

The cynical, dark side of Senator Humphreys is beginning to come out.  There are no games being played in regard to this Private Members' Bill because the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is more than willing, as he has demonstrated in the past, to work with Senators on different legislation and to come to the House.  The game is being played by Senator Humphreys and he is playing to his own gallery.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has been dealing with that issue.  Senator Noone raised the issue yesterday in terms of housing and the critical need to increase supply in the private rented sector and in public housing.  I will have the Minister come to the House on that issue.</p><p>Senator Richmond raised the issue of the international baccalaureate post-Brexit.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Bruton, come to the House.  The Senator has raised a very important point on that.  </p><p>Senator Leyden, in his dynamic and unique style, raised the issue of rip-off Ireland.  I assure him from a Government perspective, the Government is trying to reduce costs to the consumer.  We are very mindful of the fact we are the custodians of the people while in Government.  In terms of rip-off Ireland, the points the Senator makes are best taken up by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  The two bodies were amalgamated under the previous Government.  The points the Senator makes are very important.  The consumer should read the small print because sometimes when the doorbell rings and a person is asked to switch energy providers, which is just one example, the small print catches them out.  He raised two issues in regard to the telecoms industry.  The charges are exorbitant.  I would be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, come to the House.  I am not quite sure what the Senator meant about RTE promoting North of the Border sales.  Advertising is a source of income for the national broadcaster.  The point he makes is worth looking at again.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised a number of issues.  I would be happy to work with him on the issues he raised.  The important point from Senator Craughwell's point of view is that cross-Border smuggling is an ongoing issue.  I commend the Leas-Chathaoirleach in his previous role as rapporteur of the report on that issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government, through the Garda, Defence Forces and Customs and Excise, has been very vigilant on it, particularly around the North-South axis of the Border but equally on our coastline.

I share his view.  At the recent North-South Ministerial Council meeting in Armagh, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, was very clear that he did not accept the British claim and wants the matter to be resolved.  The Minister is on record as saying it at the meeting.  The view of many of us in this part of the country is that there should be no hard border on land and no border at sea.  I have always had the view that we have a part of the Lough Foyle jurisdiction and I see no reason it should be changed.  If the Senator wants to raise it on the Commencement debate, he may.</p><p>Senator Frances Black raised the issue of lobbying.  I commend the Senator on her very proactive work on alcohol.  We need to be very strong on it.  As part of our society and community, people are entitled to lobby.  Every day, we are lobbied about legislation and issues.  It is a question of how one differentiates between different types of lobbying.  This is why the Regulation of Lobbying Act exists and there has to be a register.</p></speech>

I would be very happy for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to come here to clarify the position and the role of the Central Bank.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke referred to the lack of representation of the Seanad on the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  It is very disappointing that there is no representation from this House on the committee.  The Senator referred to the number of jobs being created.  A staggering number of people are back at work.

I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to have that uncomfortable conversation.</p> <p>Senator Gabrielle McFadden raised the issue of the need for consultant-led geriatrician teams in communities.  This time of the year is an interesting time in our hospitals.  Yesterday, there was a huge surge in the number of people attending emergency departments.  The Government has taken a number of initiatives around the winter initiative, allocating an extra &euro;40 million to it.  It is important we promote an alternative to going to an emergency department.  This year, 4,500 more people have attended emergency departments.  However, 2,000 fewer people have been on trolleys than this time last year.  It is unacceptable that any person has to spend any inordinate amount of time on a trolley.  The Minister is committed to working on delayed discharges and providing more people with home care packages and aids and appliances.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss it.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised a number of issues.  I am trying to have the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, come to the House before Christmas.  The issue is that legislation takes priority over statements.  I will talk to Senator Norris about No. 9.  I have no issue with it being taken.  I would be happy to have it discussed.</p> <p>I neglected to reply to Senator Higgins.  I also neglected to respond to the issue raised by Senators Davitt, Noone and Gavan, namely, online gambling.  The Senators are right.  It is a major issue and has a profound impact on the lives of the people affected and their families.  The gambling control Bill is overdue.  It has been three years in gestation.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, has responsibility for this area.  I have spoken to him and he wants to progress the issue.  The general scheme of the Bill has been outlined.  It is important we have the debate and bring the debate forward as soon as possible.  Online gambling is open at any hour of the day or night and it is growing in popularity with online access.  It is a worry.  I would be very happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss it.  We all agree the Bill must be progressed.</p> <p>Senator Higgins raised the European Parliament.  We have no jurisdiction over Members of the European Parliament.  In terms of a dispute settlement mechanism, it is important to have an international trade deal.  The investor-state dispute settlement will not prevent governments from regulating in the public interest.  It is a bit unfair and a bit of a myth that it will allow big companies to do what they want.  I do not think it will.  The Government supports and recognises the need for both CETA and TTIP.  We had a debate in the House and the Minister will happily return to the House.  The Senator may bring forward a Private Members' Bill or a Commencement matter.  It is important we bring balance to the debate.</p></speech>

Is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuilimid ag br&uacute; ar aghaidh leis an reachta&iacute;ocht seo mar t&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im tith&iacute;ochta sa t&iacute;r, ach t&aacute; cuideanna &aacute;irid den Bhille seo ag cur imn&iacute; orainn.  We are happy that a Bill is coming forward and that some of the issues in the housing sector are being addressed.  However, we have some very serious concerns regarding parts of this Bill.  We look forward to teasing out these concerns with the Minister.</p> <p>A worrying provision relating to the strategic housing developments and proposing the fast-track planning procedures for residential developments of 100 units of more and large-scale student accommodation projects of 200 or more bed spaces is contained in Part 2.  The Bill will also place a statutory requirement on An Bord Plean&aacute;la to report back in 16 weeks.  One of the problems we have with this provision is that it appears the Government is tampering with the planning laws in order to facilitate these new developments.  We do not feel that the Minister has provided a sufficient evidence base for this proposal.  We would like him to clarify where the evidence is which shows that this is a good way to proceed.  We do not feel that the Minister has demonstrated either that the move will not undermine the good planning and further alienate communities from the planning process by taking it out of the hands of the local authorities.  We are unconvinced that better solutions were not considered, such as facilitating a greater use of pre-planning engagement with local communities.  We are also not convinced that planning delays are the main reason housing projects are being held up.  We would like to find out more about the evidence for that.</p> <p>Our concerns are echoed by organisations such as the Association of Irish Local Government, which has issued quite a number of notes in this area that relate to the general role of the local authority planning function, the centralisation of the planning function, the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the recruitment of technical planning staff, public engagement in the planning process, etc.  We can discuss those elements further.  The Minister might offer his initial thoughts on this and the evidence that this is a good move.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1387" speakername="Denis Landy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#P01000"><p>I thank the Minister for coming before the House today.  On Second Stage, I asked the Minister a specific question.  In his opening address, he used a timescale of two years or 24 months repeatedly, obviously to emphasise, in his opinion, the delays in the process.  I asked the him to provide the evidence for that, just as Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh has now also requested it.  I have the transcript of that debate.  I was obliged to leave at the time because I had to receive a deputation that evening, as I told the Minister, but I went back over the transcript in the interim.  I saw nothing from the Minister's response that actually explains what evidence there is to support his position.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Denis Landy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2349"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2349&amp;amp;pid=DenisLandy&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To me, this is an attempt to solve something, but it is the wrong way of going about it.  During the recession, planning applications decreased massively.  Local authorities that might have been receiving 1,500 planning applications each year saw that number reduce to a trickle.  Naturally, staff were redesignated within local authorities and some planning staff left local authorities.  Now planning staff are coming under pressure as housing applications start to come in again.  Even though the Minister and his predecessor have made financial provision for the recruitment of technical staff, those positions have not been filled in many local authorities.  At the moment, we have a dearth of staff in planning offices.  Rather than putting staff back into local authorities, the Minister, with the approval of the Cabinet, has decided to set up a new strategic planning unit within An Bord Plean&aacute;la in anticipation of the next round of planning applications.  I think that is the wrong way of going about it.  The staff should be beefed up at the local authority level.</p><p>When I spoke on this Bill on Second Stage, I placed a strong emphasis on the need for the local knowledge of the members of local councils.  As I look around the Chamber, it strikes me that at least half of the Senators who are present are former councillors.  Now that someone else has sat down, perhaps I cannot say that the vast majority of us are former councillors.  I will explain how the relationship between councillors and planners works.  Councillors are able to talk to planners and planners are able to talk to councillors.  Even if one was not dealing personally with the case under discussion, one might have local knowledge of the area.  All councillors receive calls from planners who want to know whether there might be some situation that is not apparent on an application in a certain area.  They offer their support in such circumstances.  That will be completely lost under this Bill.  The Minister has said that provision will be made for discussions with councillors at local level.  The problem is that this will possibly be written into the code, but it just will not happen.  Again, we will have a pulling away of democracy at local level.  When people wonder how a 300-house development came up in an area, their elected councillors will tell them they had nothing to do with it and it is a matter for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As I said on Second Stage, ancillary facilities such as takeaways could be attached to such developments even though that might be contrary to what the local councillors provided for in the development plan when the area was being zoned.  The big problem is that members of local authorities will have no control over what goes into these areas.</p><p>On Second Stage, Senator Boyhan raised the case that was made by the Association of Irish Local Government.  I support that case, which is that local councillors are elected to deal with issues at local level, rather than to hand responsibility for such issues to a centralised body like An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The biggest development ever seen in this country was Dundrum shopping centre.  That did not go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la because those involved in the preplanning phase of the development went through the application with a fine-tooth comb.  They looked at it upside down and inside out until the planners, developers, residents and all the people affected by it were satisfied.  The idea that big council developments will automatically be satisfactory because they will go through the councils to An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not stand up.  Equally, the assumption that is being made with regard to planned developments of more than 100 units does not stand up.  Developers will build smaller numbers of units because of financial constraints.</p><p>I would like to mention another situation that has happened across the country.  I will mention as an example a housing development of 100 units that was built but with zoned land behind the estate not being built on.  The people who bought the 100 units were led to believe that their houses would be the only development in the estate.  Two years later, the developer came back and looked for permission to build another 200 houses behind the houses that were already built.  Nothing could be done about it.  This behaviour is going to go on and on.  I suggest we should tackle the number of planning applications that are pending at present.  I understand that planning permission has been granted for 43,000 units in the Dublin area.  I am open to correction in that regard.</p></speech>

I stand corrected.  If we were to tackle the reasons those permissions are not being moved on, we would deal with much of this problem.  We all know that people are waiting for the turkey to get fatter.  I think this issue is being approached from the wrong angle.  This proposal is an attack on local democracy and a charter for developers.  The developers are rubbing their hands in glee because of this measure, which I oppose.  As I said on Second Stage, I welcome many of the other sections of the Bill, but I totally oppose this section because I think the Minister is going about it the wrong way.  I do not think it will do anything to fast-track what has to be done to meet the housing need that exists in this country, as we all know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#Q00400"><p>There have been many debates on the housing crisis in this Chamber, the D&aacute;il and local authority chambers around the country.  We all acknowledge and recognise that there is a housing crisis in this country.  In my view, crisis interventions are required.  This Bill is just one of the interventions that are being made by the Minister and the Government.  I have said previously that the Government is doing everything in its power through legislation, the provision of funding and other initiatives to try to kick-start the construction sector so that it can provide social and private housing to those who are most in need.  I have the utmost respect for Members of this House, especially those who have served on local authorities, as I did for over eight years.  I have a fundamental belief in the primacy of the mandate of local elected members.  I recognise the opportunity for local authority members to tease out some of the issues or concerns around this Bill.  As a former councillor, the Minister can explain this.  I know he has engaged with many local authority members from around the country and their representative bodies, including the Association of Irish Local Government, which I commend on its strong submission on this Bill.  That is the way it should be.  I understand the concerns being expressed.</p> <p>I understand this Bill will ensure that housing is only built on lands that are specifically zoned for residential purposes by local authority members.  I ask the Minister to clarify this on the record of this House for once and for all because the power of zoning is one of the primary reserved functions of local authority members.  Can he clarify for local authority members that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, or any other agency for that matter, will not be given any additional powers to grant permission for housing in areas that are not already zoned by local authority members?  The fundamental point is that this is the fundamental power that local authority members have.  I ask the Minister to clarify that this is not being diminished in any way.  In fact, it is probably being enhanced because under this legislation, An Bord Plean&aacute;la will be able to grant permissions in respect of zoned lands only.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong in my belief that before now it was possible for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant permission in respect of lands that might have had a different zoning.  This is one area he might address.</p> <p>It is important for us to debate the issues that are of concern and listen to local authority members, who are the closest public representatives to the ground in our democratic system.  Many councillors understand that we need some kind of positive and proactive legislative measure to try to kick-start large-scale housing, primarily in larger urban areas.  We should honestly admit that much of this legislation will probably not apply to three quarters of local authorities in this country because they do not have the required demand for large-scale urban development.  One of the mistakes we made in the past was that we allowed large housing estates to be built in small rural areas where there was insufficient need or demand for such housing.  The Housing Agency is doing a lot of good work to analyse the demographic changes, the types of houses that are needed and where those houses are needed.  I expect An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which I recognise is an independent agency, to utilise that information in terms of whatever permission is granted.</p> <p>Before I conclude, I would like to assuage some of the concerns of local authority members, who are responsible for adopting county development plans and local area plans.  Zoning plays an important part in that function.  If a large-scale development is to happen in a local authority municipal area, I believe there should be some opportunity for the elected members in the municipal district to engage with the executive, possibly at the preplanning stage under this legislation, so that the elected local authority members in the area can let their views be known on the record.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This would in turn form part of the report to be submitted back to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I believe this would address many of the concerns that there be a genuine engagement with local authority members and the executives of local authorities before a proposal is referred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for decision.  We could move towards such an approach.  I am interested to hear the Minister's views in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#R00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his engagement to date.  I have taken on board what Senator Coffey said, but the Minister is here now.  This is his opportunity to perform, to prove himself and to deliver on pre-consultations and engagement with councillors, Senators and Deputies.  It is all very well to talk about what we will deliver and then to be told, as we approach the door of this Chamber, that the Minister is not in full agreement.  If the Minister is not in agreement, he argues his case on the floor of the Seanad.  If we are unhappy, we argue our case with the Minister.  Many councillors are tuned into the webcast of this debate because they are aware it is taking place.  They are concerned, and rightly so, and they will not apologise.  I am a former county councillor.  I know the planning process intimately.  A former member of An Taisce, I have been involved on both sides of the planning process.  There is an area in the middle where we must get compromise and agreement.</p> <p>I will not come in here and bellyache and then do something contrary to what I have said.  I will not oppose this section of the Bill.  It is my absolute intention to support it.  In this section we propose to give legislative effect to the action plan for housing and homelessness.  The Minister has outlined in the action plan a requirement for 47,000 houses.  There are five pillars and 84 key objectives in the action plan, and the Minister was brave enough to put timelines on them.  Some of them have slipped, not all through his fault, but no doubt we will catch up.  We look forward to the next quarterly report.  The Minister has already given us a report on the deliverables of the plan.  However, we have a housing crisis.  It is all very well coming into this House, a council chamber or anywhere else to talk about a crisis.  If we have a crisis, we must do something about it.  The crisis did not arise yesterday.  The Minister is very well aware, as is Senator Coffey, of the dynamic and the problems that have faced housing for a number of years and of successive Governments that buried their heads in the sand.  I acknowledge that the Minister is doing something.  The action plan might not all go well but it is a start and a positive.  It has a timeframe and deliverables.  We as politicians will be failing if we do not haul the Minister back through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il and ask questions about what is and is not happening.</p> <p>I have said it to the Minister before and I say it now on the record of this House.  He will be open to criticism that this is an undemocratic process because it does not engage with people.  Local councillors represent people.  The Minister is aware of the Aarhus agreement and the obligations to engage with communities and citizens and recognise their elected representatives.  He is aware of the Supreme Court case in which Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness found that a county development plan was a binding contract with the people.  That is it.  Everyone has a legitimate expectation to go into his or her county hall, of which there are 31, look at his or her county development plans and see the map-out and the plans for a whole range of envisaged services and infrastructure.  That is everyone's right.  People have the right to consult.  They have the right and expectation to have some comfort in the knowledge that planning will evolve as per a county development plan, subject to most things being right, such as money, resources, planning applications, economic prosperity and development.</p> <p>What are the criticisms of the Bill?  I want the Minister today, or during this process in the next few days, to come some way towards demonstrating that he has met people and tried to address some of their amendments, even if it be a slight adjustment of an amendment.  I do not want to hear Ministers coming in here and not listening to very basic matters.  I set out originally with 16 amendments to the Bill; today I have two.  On some of them I was reassured by the Minister's officials - I will not go into it now - that they could be dealt with through regulation.  The Minister needs to explain that at some point today.  Elements of the Bill will be dealt with such as, for instance, the fees.  Who pays the fees?  What fees are to be retained by the local authority in the course of an application?  I have spoken to a number of senior planners across the country in the last few days.  They have a concern that they will lose revenue because of planning applications.  However, the Minister can address that today and tell us whether that is the case.</p> <p>Regarding Senator Coffey's remarks, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has contravened, and continues to contravene, county development plans, which is within its right.  The Minister has enormous powers to make directions regarding county development plans.  Senator Coffey would be fully aware of that from his previous position in the Custom House.  We might talk about a county development plan as being supreme.  Let us face it: what are councillors?  They do not have direct input into making planning decisions but by golly, they are the guardians and custodians of a county development plan.  That is fair.  The House should remember that local government was enshrined in our Constitution by a referendum of the people.  That is clear.  We recognise constitutionally the role of local government, the right to engage and the right to represent diverse communities with different and conflicting opinions.  My concern is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>The Minister could do two or three simple things, which I will tease out when we come to the relevant sections.  For instance, he accepts and acknowledges that local councillors have a democratic mandate.  They have vast experience locally.  He could, for instance, decide that elected members of councils would not be charged any fee to make an observation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding the planning applications that come onto the system.  I call on the Minister to make this decision.  I do not do so to give politicians favourable advantage.  I do not suggest such a provision for Senators or Deputies; I only suggest it for county councillors in recognition of their special mandate.  I also suggest that a special statutory meeting of the local authorities take place.  It should be statutory so the public can attend the meeting.  Most council meetings are now broadcast by webcast, although the public galleries are still open.  It is a public process.  We must be careful about the quasi-judicial functions of planning because lobbying legislation is in place, and rightly so, to which we would have to have regard.  We must tick the boxes of openness and transparency.  The Minister could, in this legislation, empower and direct county managers and chief executives of councils to have a public, open, statutory council meeting only to brief the elected members on the proposal that they will submit to the board.  I am not suggesting a long, protracted meeting with long minutes that need weeks and months to approve, amend and change.  That is too archaic.  That is why I am not suggesting that.  I initially suggested that the approved minutes be submitted.  It is too archaic and is too long a process; it goes on and on.  It is not easy to get 40 councillors to agree on what they said and did not say.  It is more important that the Minister allows a statutory council meeting to take place.</p> <p>Finally, the Minister should look at the planning fees again.  This is about openness and engagement.  They are currently &euro;20 to a local authority.  I do not know what the Minister will tell us or what he is in a position to tell us today about the regulations.  At this juncture, I wish him well.  I want to support the Bill but I also want him to demonstrate in this process in Seanad &Eacute;ireann that he will support some of the reasonable, well-articulated and well-argued amendments.  He needs Members' support in this process.  I do not think anyone in this Chamber, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann or any council chamber does not want to address the housing crisis.  The Bill is only one aspect of it.  The Bill is weak on openness, transparency, accountability and the recognition of the legitimate mandate that elected representatives have.  Let us not have rushed legislation.  Rushed legislation is bad legislation.  It is interesting to note that within a relative few days of his publishing the Bill, the Minister has tabled a substantial number of amendments.  I do not know from where they have all come.  Am I to believe they are part of his engagement process or am I to believe that they are tweaks by the public service to put matters right?  In any case, there are a lot of amendments for a Bill that has only been published a week.  I look forward to engaging in the entire process.</p></speech>

I think we all look forward to the debate ahead.  I will not speak extensively on this section.  We will have an opportunity to contribute on some of the proposals.  As my colleague, Senator Boyhan, said, I hope the Minister will be open to considering some of the amendments which have been tabled and, notwithstanding the desire to move forward speedily on this, will engage with them.  Very constructive proposals have been put forward in the amendments.  For example, the Minister himself recognised the fact that there are 28,000 units outstanding at the planning permission stage already.  We have constructive amendments to ensure that if we introduce these new processes, they will lead to actual building and delivery of units.  We are all keen to see that we not only open the door but also ensure there is action and movement through it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We will come to the matter when we debate our amendments.  </p><p>I recognise that this legislation is part of the bigger picture.  Given the concerns that we have heard from citizens, it is important that the Minister makes it clear again where it fits in.  The one key strong strategy that everybody has consistently identified is the need for more and better social housing.  Even though the section does not deal with the issue, I want the Minister to address how the legislation fits with the commitment to build more social housing.  Let us consider county council developments, county development plans and land that has been zoned as residential.  Given that strategic frame, how can we ensure that the appropriate land is made available for social housing development?  I want to hear the Minister's initial plans for same.  A vastly increased amount of funding is needed for social housing.  How can we ensure that landbanks for social housing are not used solely for commercial development?  These pieces fit together and I would like to hear how he believes we can strengthen this aspect.</p><p>The availability of social housing is of huge public concern.  The Minister has made considerable strides to commit to a 30% increase.  Over the next two, five or six years the demand for social housing will increase due to demographics.  I hope there is a massively increased commitment made to social housing in terms of the landscape that will be shaped by the new approach to planning permission.  My party has not tabled amendments on the matter and I am happy to hear the Minister's thoughts on how he will address it.</p><p>The year stipulated in the legislation is 2019.  We take it on trust that the Minister intends this as a temporary measure that will expire at that point.  That is why we have reflected the date in some of our amendments.  I note that the date can be extended to 2021 by order of the Minister.  I ask that he commit to holding a constructive debate on the extension of the date.  With something new, it is important that Senators who are close to and work with councillors contribute to the debate.  I am not referring to myself because I was not elected by councillors.  We must learn from the measure as we move forward.  We should be consulted about extending the date.</p><p>I wish to express two more concerns.  We are saying that the provision will only apply to land that has been zoned for residential development.  I note that the under paragraphs (c)(i) and (ii), there are provisions whereby other non-residential uses may be part of strategic developments.  Let us bear in mind the county development plans, it is important that the Minister reflects on how the provision will work.  How does this fit in with ensuring that county development plans are reflected?  There may be a strong case for child care or other facilities in developments. </p><p>Lastly, when we discuss deep strategies later let us remember that it involves recognising the diverse needs of the population.  I hope that the Minister will support and accept our amendments.  I also hope that he ensure that strategic developments are deeply strategic.  The definition has set out the strategies using numbers.  We must consider the quality and kinds of housing and that it serves all of the population.  I mention that because we have tabled amendments that refer to people with disabilities.</p><p>I look forward to further debate of this section and to moving on to the next section.  I would appreciate if the Minister clarifies the points that I have raised.</p></speech>

As I travelled here this morning, I listened to the radio in my car and learned that two people in Dublin become homeless every day.  That statistic puts matters in context for us.  We must ensure that we pass this Bill.  We have a duty to the people of Ireland to ensure that they are not homeless.  The responsibility lies with the Minister and with us to ensure that the legislation is enacted as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>I have massive issues with the county development plans.  As Senator Coffey said, the Minister spoke to local authorities and different bodies but I do not believe that he has consulted enough to convey what is meant by the new housing emergency plan.  I attended a local authority meeting a fortnight ago at which different aspects of the legislation were discussed.  However, the councillors present were unaware of half of the provisions.  This led me to believe that there is a lack of information about the plan.  As I have said on several occasions, we must convey the information to councillors.</p> <p>I wish to state that the plan is good.  Fianna F&aacute;il has tabled six amendments that I shall address individually.</p> <p>The biggest issue facing local authorities is unfinished housing estates and unspent bonds.  I know that the issue will be dealt with in the Bill but the Minister must ensure that there is enforcement at every housing estate that is built from now on and that bonds are spent.  These estates are a nightmare due to discrepancies in items that range from lighting to footpaths, railings and fences.  The Minister must not allow this situation to arise.</p></speech>

He took the poisoned chalice and by God has he run with it since.  He still has a lot more to do and, therefore, needs our support.  That is what I intend to do as far as is practicable.</p> <p>One does not need to have been a county councillor to understand the legislation or what the Minister is trying to do.  Yesterday, my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh, raised the issue of homelessness in my home city of Galway.  Every town and village in Ireland is now plagued with homelessness.  The Minister is not a magician but he has taken a fair crack at solving the problem and Senators must assist him, as far as is practicable.</p> <p>The amendments tabled by Senator Boyhan and I deal with the charges imposed on councillors who make representations about planning.  We want the associated fees abolished.  The provision will put local democracy front and centre, as do all of our amendments.  We have tried to facilitate the Minister as best as we can.  We have also borne in mind the people who operate at the coalface in every town and village because they must face their constituents with decisions that are made.  It is not unreasonable to request that a formal council meeting on a statutory footing should be held to brief local authority members.  It is more than likely that we will not push a vote on the matter.  If, however, the Minister does not accept our proposal, we will table an amendment on Report Stage.  We will continue to do so until such time as we have completely lost the battle.</p> <p>I shall not reiterate what previous speakers stated.  We support the Minister, as best as we can, and ask him to be reasonable.  I urge him to take our suggestions on board, as far as practicable, and  to promise regulations where regulations suit the issues.  I will not be opposing section 3 and I will support the Minister in respect of it.  Let us see if we can find ways to work through the various issues together.</p></speech>

We are in the kind of emergency situation that places an onus on us to pass the Bill as fast as we can in order to tackle the current housing crisis.  Section 3 covers a period of three years with a possible extension of two years.  The provision applies to housing developments that are comprised of over 100 units, which is not the normal size of a housing development. The Cork county development plan was based on nine master plans and catered for developments comprised of many 1,000 units.  This legislation is important in the context of large-scale developments.</p> <p>Cork has one strategic development zone.  Such zones play a part in ensuring we have enough housing units to tackle the housing crisis.</p> <p>This new legislation follows on from the strategic Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2006.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The latter was introduced to cater for major projects and led to requests for planning permission literally going straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It worked effectively and we are tweaking and changing it.  One of the key aspects of that planning Bill was that it allowed the Executive and councillors to have a submission made through a public meeting.  It worked very well.  I worked in that process and I saw it go through my own local authority in Cork on two separate occasions.  With what is being proposed, we are not reinventing the wheel but we are trying to ensure larger housing developments can be fast-tracked and we can get them delivered at a faster rate.  I hope the Minister will take into consideration the 2006 legislation that worked effectively, with Members having an opinion on that Bill.  That process worked well and we can follow it with this Bill.</p></speech>

Lest there be any misunderstanding I put on record again that I welcome the Minister and what he is trying to do.  If there was an inference, and I am not saying there was, that because we do not agree with everything in the Bill, we do not want to solve the housing problem, nothing could be further from the truth.  We might be approaching the issue in a different way.</p> <p>I am trying to pick up some threads where we can find common ground on this specific issue.  In his closing remarks the last day the Minister stated that the idea that local councillors have no role is not the case and there is no reason the procedure that exists in local authorities whereby controversial planning applications are referred to a committee for discussion, with planners getting feedback from democratically elected councillors on how they look at planning applications, cannot happen during the pre-planning consultation process.  He indicated that ultimately the planners make recommendations on planning issues and, of course, councillors make decisions on zoning issues, local area plans, policy considerations and a series of other issues, including the county development plan.</p> <p>Senator Coffey commented earlier and if we could take out counties with cities, which are Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick, Galway and perhaps some counties in the midlands with a high population, there would not be too many of these applications.  On the previous day I used the example of Fingal which had 800 applications made in the first eight months of 2015, but of those only seven applications had in excess of 100 units.  We are not talking about many of these applications as we speak but if building is ratcheted up, perhaps we will see it.</p> <p>This is a suggestion from the Minister, but could he not put it in the Bill as a statutory requirement because it would assist the concerns of councillors, and which I have on behalf of councillors, as well as the concerns of ordinary people who do not want to see a sleight of hand?  The word "developer", unfortunately, has become a bad word but there are many good developers.  I worked with many good developers over the years who built necessary social and private housing.  The word has become associated with bad things that happened, so when people think about developers, they believe something underhanded is possibly being done.  I ask the Minister to put the issue of large multi-unit developments on a statutory footing, as this might assist or assuage the concerns that I and others have about democratic input at local level being pulled from the system as proposed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#T00300"><p>I thank the Seanad for really co-operating in trying to facilitate the movement of this Bill quickly through the Houses.  I am determined to try to get this legislation finalised and enacted before the end of the year in order that when we start next year, we will have a series of new systems that can deliver more efficiently than current systems.</p> <p>The focus so far in the discussion has purely been on the changes for the process around making a planning decision for large-scale units.  It is one relatively small part of a much bigger plan that is focusing on multiple different areas.  The Rebuilding Ireland plan has a specific process around looking at how we finance projects and there is a specific proposal around how we look at infrastructure deficits.  There are also specific proposals around how we insist on mixed tenure developments in trying to build much more vibrant and diverse communities.  There are strong sections on disability and so many other issues from the many strands of the housing and homelessness challenges we now face.</p> <p>All we are doing here is recognising that some of the response requires legislative change.  Therefore, when people say this is not going to solve the housing crisis, we know that of course it will not.  It is not supposed to do it on its own.  It is one contributing factor to solving one of the issues, namely, the delays in getting certainty around a planning decision.  That is all.  I do not want to overblow that as a silver bullet to solve all our problems because it is not.  I am sure we will have plenty of more debate in this House on social housing, a rental strategy, the planning system and some of the other issues we are dealing with in this legislation.  All this does is prioritise the legislative change that comes out of the strategy that we published and launched last summer that is rolling out in delivery terms.  We have already had our first quarter update in terms of meeting the targets we are setting and we are pretty much on schedule for everything.</p> <p>This is important and I do not pretend it is not.  I can give some evidence as the Senators' colleagues in the D&aacute;il asked me about the evidence for introducing this.  I asked for and received from An Bord Plean&aacute;la the timeline around decision-making for large-scale planning decisions this year.  I got it a couple of months ago.  There were only 15 decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on applications with more than 100 units at that point, although there have been a few more since.  That represents the vast majority of applications for more than 100 units.  Although it is true there are some examples of large-scale planning applications that do not go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the vast majority do.  The average length of time it took to get a decision from pre-planning consultation to final decision was 78 weeks.</p> <p>We are talking about how to build enough houses for people.  We are looking at what happened last year.  There were 12,500 houses completed last year and 6,000 of those were one-off houses in the countryside.  Of the other 6,500, a very significant percentage were examples of unfinished housing estates and apartment complexes being completed.  We are probably talking about somewhere between 3,000 or 4,000 new houses being built in total in the entire country.  At a time when we need to be building approximately 30,000 units, we are building approximately a tenth of that number.  That is the extent of the problem we are trying to solve through multiple strands, policy changes, funding proposals, legal changes and so on.  If we can bring more certainty to the planning decision in terms of timelines for large developments, it will become easier to finance them.  Timelines and uncertainties around planning decisions are a big factor in the financing of projects.  This is not a charter for developers or anything, but that is a fact.  If somebody is building more than 100 houses, we are talking about multi-million euro financing, and to put that in place, certainty in getting decisions on planning is essential.  That is the feedback we are getting.</p> <p>We want to encourage more ambition for the likes of student accommodation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are probably 10,000 student accommodation places in the pipeline, either in planning, being prepared for planning or under construction.  We probably need 30,000 between now and 2019.  How do we get that moving faster?  A streamlined timeline for how we get those decisions would help.  It is a case of getting some more certainty and urgency into the supply response.  That is the context in which I am trying to operate. </p><p>Second, how do we ensure we are not undermining the quality of decisions, which is very important for some people here too?  In an effort to solve a problem let us not cause another problem by making bad decisions.  That is why this legislation is, if anything, protecting zoning for large housing decisions.  My understanding, and I will happily stand corrected, is that An Bord Plean&aacute;la, if it chooses to, has the power to grant a planning permission for a residential property on land that is not zoned for housing if it has good reason to do that, consistent with national strategy or other factors that it must take into account.  In this legislation it is specifically precluded from granting a planning application for a residential development unless the land is zoned for housing.  There is no rush job here.  This involves putting in place a process that makes the right decisions, gives certainty about zoning but makes sure that we have timelines and statutory pressure on the system to make decisions.  </p><p>Are we bypassing local democracy?  I met representatives from the Association of Local Government, AILG, a couple of hours ago, with Senator Coffey.  They were speaking at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and I wanted to take the opportunity to talk to them and reassure them.  I think we did give them some reassurance.</p></speech>

We will introduce an amendment next Tuesday on Report Stage, which is very similar to the amendment the Senator will move later.  We can tease out why there need to be tweaks and so on.  We will require chief executives during the pre-planning consideration process, which is a statutory nine-week period, to inform and consult councillors on large scale planning applications going through this system.  It will also impose an obligation on planning authorities to incorporate the view of councillors in their final report.  If there are problems with that let us hear them and argue them out.  The reason I do not have an amendment today is that I wanted to tease these issues out and we can finalise them on Tuesday.  That is what moving from Committee Stage to Report Stage involves.</p><p>There are several things that I assured councillors of and I want to assure them again today.  First, when they make decisions on zoning they will not be undermined by this legislation or process.  They will have an involvement, if they choose to, in the pre-planning consultation process and they will be able to make observations and objections if they want to when the formal application is made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as well.  There is a role for councillors, if they want to get involved in having their say on applications that are moving through the system.  </p><p>Most planning applications will not go through this system.  Most will be for five, ten, 15, 40, 70 or 80 housing units in different parts of the country, many in and around the Dublin area.  We have not seen large scale developments of the quantity we need in the areas where we need them on lands that are zoned.  We need to try to encourage that quickly.  There is no point having a special development zone, SDZ, in Adamstown that can accommodate 4,000 housing units if we are building only 150 houses a year, when we need a more ambitious approach.  There is no point having an SDZ in Cherrywood that can accommodate 7,000 housing units, if we are not moving on it.  There are multiple examples of that around the greater Dublin area.</p><p>We are now moving on those sites and those developers are saying that I am giving them the certainty and they will back it up and start delivering.  Two or three weeks ago we launched 23 &ldquo;pathfinder&rdquo; sites which we will prioritise to work with local authorities and developers to deliver 60,000 housing units across the country, not just in Dublin.  In the next four years there will be 30,000 housing units on those sites.  Doing that involves a combination of infrastructure, financing, planning decisions, SDZ master plans, proper negotiation around mixed tenure.  Some get significantly more than the 10% social housing that is required under Part V because it makes sense for everybody to do that.  We will be moving on projects such as O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens which will have 30% social housing and finding a way to finance that and so on.  We know that planning decisions for large residential developments take too long.  That is having a restrictive influence.  It is not stopping it but it is restricting it.</p><p>There are many sites that already have full planning permission, between 27,000 and 28,000 around Dublin.  Many, however, have problems.  We are addressing those problems through financing, infrastructure, a vacant site levy and all sorts of other things.  There are sites zoned for housing that do not have planning permission.  There are developers who want to go ahead and develop on them.  We need to try to put a system in place that will bring certainty and encourage them to be more ambitious than they otherwise might be.  That is essentially what this element of the legislation is about.  </p><p>In terms of the social housing provision element, which Senator Higgins raised, many of those pathfinder sites have a big social housing element but in respect of some of the broader planning applications if a developer can deliver bigger projects he can deliver more social housing too.  We do not have the luxury of maintaining the <i>status quo</i>and just tweaking it.</p><p>We have sanctioned almost 500 extra staff for local authorities, the majority of whom are in place.  They are engineers, quantity surveyors, planners and architects who can speed up planning decisions.  We are beefing up An Bord Plean&aacute;la by seven or eight people.  One cannot compare beefing up An Bord Plean&aacute;la to deal with an extra demand here with increasing the staff in 31 local authorities.  They are two separate issues.  It is not one or the other.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is anticipating that it might get 50 applications next year under this new provision.  It wants to make sure it can manage and streamline that process efficiently.  It is not a silver bullet but it is an important part of the overall mix.  I ask people to work with us on it.  We will introduce amendments and try to support amendments when we can.  Sometimes even though I agree with the sentiment in the wording of an amendment I might not be able to accept it without getting legal advice first.  That is why we will be back here on Tuesday, to finalise some of those issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope I have answered most of the questions that people have raised.</p></speech>

Of course we know that it involves much more complex things; we all know that.  I wish to make reference to the Oireachtas Library and Research Service's Bills digest, which is fully impartial.  It is an interesting document.  I spoke to the Minister's officials when they were briefing us last week and they were not even aware of the Bills digest.  The Senators are aware of it because it has been circulated to all of us.  It makes for really interesting reading.  This is a complex problem and there are many different strands needed to address it.  However, it is not a new problem.  I am not in the blame game.  Senator Coffey would be very familiar with housing.  He is an expert in it.  The Senator was in government for many years and, as a Minister of State, had special responsibility for housing.</p> <p>I wish to address a few issues that the Minister touched on.  I absolutely agree with him on the strategic development zones.  The Minister mentioned Cherrywood, which has capacity for between 7,000 and 9,000 units, depending on how it is all structured, which is really exciting.  He makes a very good and valid point.  However, let us not compromise, undermine or be perceived to compromise or undermine a strategic development zone that was approved by the Cabinet of the day.  Ultimately, a strategic development zone must be approved by the Cabinet.  There are strict criteria laid down for these zones.  It went through a very long public consultation process.</p> <p>The Minister can contradict me if he wants, particularly as I would be interested to hear if there is a different view.  My understanding is that it is provided for in the legislation that, effectively, landowners and developers who find themselves in strategic developments zones can actually apply to vote for this fast-tracking process.  I have no difficulty with that.  However, I wish to lay a clear marker for any of them who are observing these proceedings and becoming excited because we cannot water down the strategic development zone objectives in any way in respect of approved zones.  Of course, it is open to Government to amend a strategic development plan.  That has not happened yet but it might.  I do not wish to pre-empt anything.  I see great potential, particularly for the zone in Cherrywood in the context of public transport in light of the fact that it is the responsibility of a local authority that built six houses last year despite having a housing waiting list with 6,000 people on it.</p> <p>I wish to address two or three other issues.  The Minister did not mention a waiver for planning fees for elected members regarding their engagement, in the context of this specific process, with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Perhaps he might comment on that matter.</p> <p>It would be very helpful during this process if, when he cannot deal with the amendments, the Minister might discuss - as we go through them - which elements can be covered by regulation instead of by amending the legislation.  I say that sincerely.  I know there is a lot of complex regulation in this area.  I am delighted about the Minister's reassurance that there will be no deviation and that the board will not be permitted to contravene the development plan.  That is what the Minister has said and I am delighted with his comments.  There is a section relevant to that matter.  Believe it or not, however, under the legislation the Minister is granted powers to contravene a development plan.  He has reassured us in respect of that matter and all we can do is hold him to what he said.  He has come before the House and informed us as to what is the position.  I welcome that.</p> <p>I wish to discuss the income that the local authorities currently receive in respect of major planning applications.  The fee would be substantial if one approached a council with a plan for 200 houses.  There would be a lot of planning fees attaching.  Are these going to be retained by the planning authorities?  The Minister might address that at some stage.  There is a concern around whether these fees are going to be transferred to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I know that it needs money to operate.  The Minister spoke about strengthening the capacity of local councils.  He told the joint Oireachtas committee that he had approved the appointment of additional planners, architects and engineers.  However, I spoke to three local authorities in respect of which he has done this and they all asked from where the money to fund it will come.  It is easy for the Minister to approve appointments but who is going to pay for them?  From where will the money come?  The Minister will rightly say that it is the responsibility of the local authorities.  However, there are some local authorities that are not in the same financial position as others.</p> <p>I hear what the Minister is saying in terms of strengthening the position of planners and providing the capacity to employ more people.  There will be additional work and there has also been an upturn in the economy in any event, thanks be to God.  That will create further demands.</p> <p>The Minister might clarify the issue regarding local councillors.  The Minister says he wants to strengthen them.  No one is trying to push them out of the process.  Will he consider no fee for an elected representative who wishes to make a representation, observation or comment within his or her functional planning authority area to the board?  It could be a positive comment, it does not always have to be a negative one.  They may not be against something but they may wish to write to the board expressing concern.</p> <p>The Minister knows that it is impossible to collectively articulate the views of councillors.  Councils are bigger than used to be the case.  There are 40 councillors on many councils.  How can the views of 40 members be articulated?  A stenographer would be needed for eight hours.  The record of proceedings must then has to be amended.  At every council meeting, the minutes have to be brought back in order to be proposed, seconded and amended.  It is a very long process and it will delay matters rather than fast-tracking them.  I know the Minister does not like fast-tracking things and that occurred to me the other day.  This Bill smacks of fast-tracking, however.  On every second or third page, there is evidence of that.  I am sorry to go on about this particular issue but I believe it is important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1387" speakername="Denis Landy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#V00300"><p>I listened very closely to the Minister's evidence and I have it listed here.  There were 15 decisions made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la on developments in excess of 100 units.  The average length of time it took to get a decision was 78 weeks.  There needs to be a further breakdown of that figure.  Anecdotally and evidentially, the biggest delay in any planning application, whether it is for one unit or ten, is in the further information phase.  Unless we have the statistic that breaks that down to show how much of the delay of the 78 weeks was based on the requirement by the developer or developers to provide further information, the evidence the Minister provided does not mean a whole lot.  That is the first point I will make.  Obviously, it was provided to the Minister by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and he can only relay information of which he has been made aware.  We need to go behind the figure of 78 weeks and scope the detail of the 15 cases to discover the reason for the actual delay in each case.  I am a betting man and I would have a fair punt with the Minister that the delay was with the developer more often than it was with the system.  That is my first point.</p> <p>Although the Minister has not agreed to introduce an amendment, he has said, in the context of the consultation with councillors, that he is not going to bypass local democracy and that the comments of councillors will be included in the report that will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on any big decisions.  The Minister then spoke about staffing levels.  He said that there will only be seven or eight extra staff in An Bord Plean&aacute;la at a cost of &euro;1.4 million.  I presume that includes the cost of resources for the staff as well.  My understanding is that the staff employed by local authorities were taken on across the board and not just in planning offices.  The Minister is doing everything possible to speed up this process.  I say that in a genuine way.  However, with the greatest of respect, I cannot understand how he cannot see the logic of doing this at local authority level and avoiding An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the first instance.  Fifteen applications went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and eight of those were in Fingal.  Roughly, across the local authority system, as the Minister said, we might be looking at 100 of these applications in a year.</p></speech>

Okay.  Let us say two per local authority.  Why can these not be dealt with by one or two specialist members of staff within the local authority?  In that way, we could forget about this whole process of fast-tracking through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The evidence that the Minister has provided needs further scoping.  I will not say that it does not stand up because that would not be fair.  However, it needs further scoping to stand up.  Secondly, I believe that this job can be done at local authority level without having to set up this new structure and without the impression being given, correctly or otherwise, to the general public and to counsellors that in some way democracy is going to be affected by this move.  I am prepared today to grant the Minister to introduce an amendment to deal with those issues on Report Stage.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1377" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#W00200"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.  I thank the Minister for his contribution and the discussion on a number of the different areas.  Some important points are being raised.  I note the Minister stated he had a discussion with the AILG, even though it was a ball-hopping scenario.  I wonder did it change its position during that conversation on what it has said previously.  For example, on the general role of the local authority planning function, the association has stated that people are entitled to appropriate standards of utility and design in their houses, which are best decided through the transparent local authority planning system, that its members have seen too many examples of where rushed building programmes have left lasting social problems, that the proper planning of housing provisions begins with consideration of location and ensuring, depending on the scale and nature of the development, that there is proper provision of facilities such as schools and public transport, and that the local knowledge of county and city councils is an invaluable asset in ensuring co-ordinated provision of housing and the necessary support services.</p><p>When it comes to centralisation - this links in to what Senator Landy stated - the AILG notes that all local planning authorities have statutory planning timelines of 16 weeks which must be adhered to in all cases, including an eight-week period for a decision on an application following validation of the application, a further four-week period if a request for further information is made and a final four-week period for grant of permission if no appeal is made.  The association states that while it accepts that delays in the planning process may arise, it is of the opinion that these delays can often be on the part of the applicant who has a statutory six-month timeline for replying to requests for further information.  In order to help speed up the timely delivery of planning decisions by local authorities, particularly in respect of large residential developments, the association proposes that this period should be shortened to no more than a three-month period to reply to requests for further information.  It is putting the onus back on the developers to come back more quickly.  I wonder whether the association has changed its position on that or did its representatives intimate that to the Minister today?</p><p>The association also states that in order to help eliminate any time delays within the local authority planning system, it would also propose a mandatory time-bound pre-application consultation process at local authority level.  This pre-application consultation could mirror the proposal detailed under head 4 of the general scheme of the Bill, including the preparation of a report by the planning authority on the application following this consultation process.  The association states this would help to assure applicants that once their application is lodged with the local authority, it would be dealt with in a timely manner.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that and would he agree with the association?  The Minister met the association and had a conversation with its representatives but has their position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>this document changed?</p><p>It is also important to note the Minister stated we need to move quickly and must ensure that we get planning permissions in place.  It is my understanding that there are 26,000 planning permissions outstanding in Dublin alone.  The Minister suggested that to shorten the timeline makes it easier to finance.  It would strike me that the 26,000 outstanding planning permissions would point the finger in a different direction, that there seems to be lethargy on the part of the developers to move ahead and build the houses based on the planning permissions they have already got through the local authorities through the traditional process or that the banks or financing institutions are not giving them the funding to go ahead with the projects.  The Minister mentioned that we need to be building 30,000 houses.  As it is, there are 26,000 permissions outstanding in Dublin alone.  Why are they not moving ahead?  Is changing fundamentally the planning process the right way to be going?  It would not appear that the lethargy is on the part of the local authorities.  The local authorities have statutory timelines they must adhere to and they seem to be doing that.  It would seem, from anecdotal evidence, that it is the developers who are holding the progress up.</p><p>On the 500 extra staff sanctioned, I note the Minister's use of the word &quot;sanctioned&quot;.  It is easy to sanction extra staff but, as Senator Boyhan has asked, how many of those are <i>in situ</i>?  Is it an issue of funding, if they are not in <i>situ</i>, and who will be paying for those?  If the Minister could possibly address those issues as well in his response, I would be grateful.</p></speech>

I have two or three points to raise with the Minister.</p> <p>It is extremely important to ensure this Bill does not become an avenue for speculation.  One of the features towards the end of the so-called Celtic tiger was where there were a lot of developers getting planning on sites and flipping them overnight.  Many of the builders who came in and bought those sites were cowboys.  This legislation is about the building of houses.  It cannot be about speculation.  The following are the questions I want to ask the Minister.  Are there limits in the Bill?  If a developer goes for planning to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on a strategic site, are there limits in place to ensure that these houses will be built?  One cannot have a situation in which the developer sits on the site for any length of time with no houses built or instead flips it over to someone else who has not got the planning on the site and who may not be the type of person one wants to build that development.  As the Minister is aware, it is not only about the site but also is about who will build the houses.  I, and probably everyone else if he or she is being honest, have seen sites that were flipped over by developers and some of the individuals who built on those sites have been disastrous.  The purpose of this legislation is to fast-track the building of homes.  What control mechanisms are in place to ensure that if planning is given by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the houses will be built quickly and to ensure that whoever gets planning on this will build the houses instead of flipping the site over to someone who will sit on it where one is into the realm of speculation?</p> <p>It would be extremely important to ensure that this legislation does not have the unintended consequence of encouraging the rezoning of land where land that is currently not zoned for residential use for whatever reason finds its way into being rezoned and then the owner applies.</p> <p>I welcome the legislation.  I very much see the purpose of it.  The Minister designated a site in Limerick as being one of the national sites.  I very much welcome that the local authority would have an input.  My understanding of the way the legislation will work is that there will be a pre-consultation period with the local authority and residents and others will still be able to submit objections to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Is there a way that they could feed into the pre-consultation phase process that the local authorities are required to carry out?  Maybe it is in the legislation.  I merely want to be certain so that what one will have is the local authority with pre-consultation and a feed-in reference with the local councillors and local residents so that when their submission goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, there is a rounded and built-in review process under way and local people can have their input.</p></speech>

As it happens, that is not what this is about.  There is as big an onus on developers here as there is on the system to make decisions.  If developers do not have their work done before they go to a pre-planning stage, they will not get very far.  We can no longer tolerate the practice of a poor developer going in with a poor proposal on zoned land, where, effectively, local authority architects and engineers end up having to redesign the project over months of consultation, because we need to have a much better, much higher-quality application ready for consideration in the first place.  I have stated bluntly to developers, whether at CIF conferences or wherever, that the onus is now on them.  The State is responding with a streamlined decision-making process which maintains the integrity of decisions but also gives certainty around timelines for those decisions.  However, their role in this is to significantly improve the quality of applications from day one.  Otherwise they will get thrown out and we make no apologies for that.  Half-assed planning applications for more than 100 housing units or more than 200 student accommodation units do not deserve to get serious consideration anyway, as far as I am concerned.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is not a criticism of local authorities <i>per se</i>.  It is about changing the system and everybody's input into it, from developers to putting an onus on local authorities to have a statutory period of pre-planning consultation which will essentially result in a local authority making a recommendation as to whether an application should be granted before it goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This would have a major influence over the final decision, I suspect.  Local authorities have real power here.  Planners will make recommendations and observations, and councillors will have the opportunity to make observations.  Let us not forget that they are not planners.  However, they may comment on other related issues that deserve planning consideration.</p></speech>

While I accept that it would improve it, even if we had a guaranteed eight-week decision-making process at local authority level every time, which is virtually impossible, by having more staff and better systems, we would still be going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Although An Bord Plean&aacute;la has an 18-week timeframe in which it is expected to make decisions, there is no statutory requirement.  The statutory requirement will be in the legislation.  We are trying to condense the decision-making process while ensuring the right decisions are made.</p> <p>We are putting much more of an onus on developers to do the key work that needs to be done before the pre-planning consultation begins.  Developers will have to engage with local authorities before they ask for a formalised statutory pre-planning consultation to ensure they are ready to begin the process before they ask An Bord Plean&aacute;la to trigger the statutory timelines.  This is a change for the better for developers.  It is a temporary change for the local authorities, councillors and An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the next three years to try to ensure the housing delivery we are likely to see anyway over the next ten years happens sooner rather than later.  That is all.  If it is viable to build houses on zoned land, we want them to be built next month and next year rather than in three or four years' time.</p> <p>Another good point is the question whether the provisions of the Bill that allow for an automatic renewal of planning should apply to developers who get planning permission to build more than 100 houses through the process.  There is a proposed amendment on this later.  Until this debate, we had thought we should apply the same to everybody.  However, there is a fair argument that the whole point of this is to get things moving fast.  A Senator made this point.  If somebody takes advantage of a streamlined system to get a quick decision and then decides to sit on it for five or six years while property prices increase, we should not tolerate it.  As Senator Kieran O'Donnell said, this is about getting houses built and facilitating it.  It is about getting the right kind of houses of the right density, quality and design built next year rather than in five or six years' time.  I will give a very strong signal to developers that the State is doing its bit in streamlining a decision-making process, and their job is to build the houses once they get through the system.  If they do not, their planning permission will not be renewed without going through the process again.  In five years' time, we are unlikely to have the fast-track process in place.  The incentive will be there to get on and build the houses.  We will talk about it in more detail later.</p></speech>

I will ask once more.  We did not get clarity on the evidence provided by the Minister for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  How exactly will councils have input?  Will it be as suggested in the amendment, in which the Minister indicated he might accept input via statutory meeting?  I welcome the fact the Minister met the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG.  I also understand there was no commitment at the meeting from either side.  Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh asked the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1377" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#X00700"><p>I was going to follow up on it.  The Minister was drawn down a different alley.  I wondered about the AILG's reaction to the conversation this morning and the extra staff sanctioned.  Apart from the 26,000 outstanding planning permissions, is the blockage not at the other end with the developers who are not moving?  How big a development is envisaged?  What is the biggest development that could be envisaged under this new planning process?  There is a massive need for student accommodation.  Recently, NUI Galway was granted planning permission for 400 units close to the campus.  I have seen a development plan for NUIG into the future that envisages up to 10,000 units on adjacent sites.  There was a little consternation locally about the 400 units in one space.  It was not huge consternation, given that people are very aware of the issues of having an extra 400 units with, probably three to four students in each of them.  If planning permission were given to such a company to build up to 10,000 units on a site in this area, there could be serious problems and a local authority would need to have an input, given the pressure it would put on local infrastructure.  There is traffic chaos as it is in Galway, and it would add to the traffic issues.  There would be issues about the types of people and some of the students.  Would cr&egrave;che facilities be provided as part of the overall development?  If there were parents, including lone parents, there could be an impact on local schools.  I imagine there would be a number of large-scale projects, given that a number of international companies are examining the student accommodation market in Ireland with a view to investing in very large-scale projects.  Any large-scale project of this nature would need to have a very full discussion with all the local authority representatives, given that there would be consternation in local communities around it.</p></speech>

How many local authorities have received large-scale housing plans of more than 100 houses in the past ten years?  Carlow has not had one in 15 years and, like many other local authorities, would love one.  I represent councillors, given that I was a councillor for 20 years.  This larger planning scale will not affect most rural counties.  The confusion is unreal.  The Minister should be coming here and saying the scale will work for ten particular local authorities and that it will not affect other areas.  He should tell us we are going to try fast-tracking, although it is not a word he likes.  That is the area the Minister should address.  Instead, everybody is talking about local authorities.  I understand.  All rural local authorities in small counties would love to be able to say a builder was going to come in and build 100 houses, but it is not realistic and it is not going to happen.  The problem is the lack of information from the Department to the local authorities.</p> <p>We have had this for three years.  People need homes and we must build them.  The Minister is right.  We need to move it now.  We must work with the local authorities and the councillors.  Given some of the questions being asked here, I have to wonder where the Senators are coming from.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to move on this.

As a former councillor, I understand how important the councillor's role is.  However, most local authorities will not be affected by this.  I am disappointed that the Minister and the Department did not come here with the figures so that they could say where this is going to happen.  Although this will apply to local authorities, my local authority has not had a development of this kind for 15 years.  I would love such a development and so would everybody else.  I do not know whether the Minister can give a commitment that builders will come into local authorities and build over 100 houses quickly.  I would welcome such a commitment.  I would be delighted by it, but is it realistically going to happen?</p></speech>

This is one of the many things we can do to help the process.  I take the point that planning permission has been granted for 27,000 or 28,000 units in Dublin.  Some of the reasons those sites are not moving relate to finance, infrastructure and speculation.  We need to intervene in all of these areas to try to get those sites that have planning permission moving.  There are many examples of zoned land where developers want to move ahead and can afford to do so.  We need to get that process moving quickly.  Have I missed anything?</p></speech>

I gave an example.  The breakdown of the 15 individual applications, in terms of the timeline for each segment, is available.  If one looks at it, one will see that it is shared across the system.  Some of the delays have been caused by requests for further information.  A delay on the part of the developer is potentially just as likely as a delay on the part of the system.  The new system for statutory periods puts pressure on developers as well as the State system of decision-making.  That is the whole point.  It is not one-sided.  This is not about saying the State has to do everything to give developers planning decisions.  Developers will be put under significant pressure to comply with the statutory periods that are now in place.  There will be a cost to that.  There will be a need for professionalism in those applications.  The kind of sloppy applications that take forever to get a decision will be thrown out.  That is the point I am making.  This is not a criticism of local authorities.  This is about changing the system to provide for timelined decisions, thereby putting a little more pressure on everybody.  That is all it is.</p></speech>

It is important that we get time to tease out some of these genuine issues.  The Minister chose an unfortunate example when he mentioned Oranmore because there are still issues around the development in question and a development adjacent to it.  This example points to the reason we need the input of local authorities and councillors when decisions are being made.  The developers who got into difficulties and left a large hole in Oranhill have now come forward to say they are looking for a different planning permission in an adjacent area.  If they are to be able to circumvent the local authority scenario and go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the local knowledge of councillors will not be available to bring to bear when a decision is being made on their planning application.</p></speech>

I am not convinced that we will speed things up very much.  I also raised with the Minister the issue of how big a development could be.  A number of years ago, we might not have envisaged that a large international corporation that builds student accommodation would come into Ireland wanting to build thousands of units.  I do not think it is beyond the realms of possibility that this could happen now.  My understanding is that some third level institutions would like this to happen because they have land banks available.  Will there be an upper limit on the size of a project of more than 100 units that may be brought forward under this system?  I know we are focusing on developments of just over 100 units, but I know there are plans for this type of corporate development and this type of scenario.</p></speech>

The reality is that they are likely to end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la anyway.  We are talking about a streamlined system.  I think the question that has been raised about a proposal to regenerate or change an entire quarter of a city by means of a new development plan or a new strategic development zone is a fair one.  Senators might be familiar with the docklands site in Cork or some of the student plans in Galway city, where there is huge pressure.  Most of the private rental market in Galway is driven by students.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is an onus on a local authority to put a local area plan in place and perhaps to designate or ask for designation around an SDZ to work with developers.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is anxious to make the right decisions here and I expect that if there was something on the scale of 10,000 student accommodation units, or even 3,000 or 4,000, there would be a public consultation process involved in the decision.  In most of the normal residential applications, there will not be a formal public consultation process because that would make it impossible to make a decision in 16 weeks.  If there was an exceptional application in terms of scale or controversy or something like that, An Bord Plean&aacute;la could go through an extended period of time that would include a formal public consultation process, which is something we are used to anyway under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.  We would not need to do that for most of these applications because most of them will be housing applications on land zoned for residential housing.  It should not be that controversial.  It should be about getting the design and density and all of the other aspects linked to good planning decisions right.  </p><p>I have answered most of the questions and if we can move on, perhaps we can deal with the individual issues as they come up with the amendments. </p></speech>

We are all very familiar with the critical infrastructure applications and fast-tracking to the board.  We all understand it.  That is not a problem.  The point the Minister seems to be missing is the right of citizens to engage in the process.  I have previously put in observations to a strategic infrastructure development board and I had to put my hand deep into my pocket to pay the board fees.  I was involved with an oral hearing with the board.  It took it a year and a half to make a decision.  That is the famous board in which the Minister has all the confidence and expectation.  I was an elected representative and I constantly had to put my hand into my pocket to make views known.  That is the reality of it.  That is not right and proper.  It is not open or democratic engagement with a quasi-judicial planning process.  I have no problem going on the record and paying a fee but not the mad fees the board is choosing.  That is the important bit.</p> <p>Let us deal with the Bill before us.  This is a fast-tracking process.  I have no difficulty with what the Minister is trying to achieve but there is a democratic deficit.  It is the right of Johnny the citizen to say he wants to make his view known on something that impacts on his home, local school or community centre.  Under the scheme, he will not have the right to go to the local authority and will have to go to the board.  If he is unhappy with the board, he has no right of appeal.  The Minister and his officials keep coming back and saying there is the judicial review route.  Judicial reviews cost a lot of money, and the substantive issue is not judicially reviewed; only the process can be judicially reviewed.  It can deliberate on whether the system has erred or strayed in process but not on the substantive issue of the development.</p> <p>Let us deal with the Bill before us.

He has not addressed the democratic deficit of the elected members in any of his responses.  That is the weakness in it and it is the real criticism.  The Minister is the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Local government is part of the Minister's remit.  He should be enhancing the competence of local government in its broadest sense and giving the citizens the right to engage at virtually no cost.  That is the issue at stake here.  They will have to pay a fee, which the Minister has not clarified.  He said he will do it by regulation or next week.  That is fair enough.  I am patient and I think it is reasonable to ask the Minister to go away and think about it, but the Minister knows what he is going do.  There will not be any great surprise.  The Minister does not need until next week to share what he will do with us on that issue.  The deficit is the real core issue.  When someone puts a microphone in front of the Minister in the next few days, he will have to be able to stand over the process as democratic, open and transparent, and one with which citizens can engage.  It will not do to say the Minister has had legal advice from the Attorney General and he cannot share it.  This is the Parliament and we are asking the questions.  That is what I want to hear the Minister say.  I want him to tell us and reassure us on how he will strengthen and address the democratic deficit in this process.  That is the real issue I am trying to hammer home.</p></speech>

He is looking to hit home on it and that is fine.  The Senator wants to emphasise the point.  I have spoken to many councillors about this issue.  I took the opportunity to meet informally with representatives from AILG today.  I have also spoken to LAMA about these issues.  We are looking at bringing forward a Bill.  I have to get a legal draftsperson to make sure its wording is legally sound but I wanted us to have the debate today so we could get a full assessment and have a conversation around how best to do that from a policy perspective.  I suggested earlier that during the nine-week statutory process of pre-planning consultations and consideration, councillors would be formally involved.  The engagement would be part of the formal process and the results of that engagement would be part of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's consideration when they are considering the Bill.</p> <p>On the issue of fees, which the Senator has also raised a number of times, one of the recommendations from the Mahon tribunal was that fees should be reduced significantly or they should be zero.  The other planning Bill I referred to earlier is about implementing in law the Mahon recommendations on the planning system.  We will deal with the fees issue there.  I take the point that people who are democratically elected represent the viewpoint of communities.  If they have an objection or observation to make during the planning process, we should certainly look at the cost of it and it should not be prohibitive.  We will look at that in terms of whether we waive it altogether or look at something very small.  I will come back on that perhaps when we are dealing with it later on. </p> <p>We are trying to deal with the issues the Senator has raised.  I am not the kind of Minister who wants to just bypass local government.  People talk about bad decisions that were made and bad consequences, such as Oranmore.  I do not know the details of that but it was the current system that delivered those decisions.  The current system is not immune from mistakes either.  The current zoning and planning processes have both made mistakes and caused damage to communities, which was added to by an implosion of the property sector and the banking sector on top of all of that.  We are learning lessons from that and we are changing the planning system.  That will be done in time as we do a review and we will have legislation on the back of that process.  We will not rush it.</p> <p>This is a different thing.  It is about trying to get movement in the housing market because we desperately need it.  Many people, as some of the Senators will know better than most, are living on the streets because of it on nights like last night and tonight.  Some Senators are very concerned about that.  We put measures in place to make sure that anybody who was exposed to rough sleeping last night or who will be tonight will be taken into a shelter to get out of the cold weather.  We are working with NGOs, voluntary organisations and the system to make sure it can happen.  Many of the shelters are taking in more people than they normally would.  They are taking on extra staff beyond what they normally do to make sure we respond in a compassionate way to the risks that people face because they are homeless in weather like we are experiencing at the moment.</p></speech>

Where a local public representative is making an appeal or querying a planning application, we must accept that they are not doing it for the good of their health.  They are doing it for the citizens they represent.  It would be a huge comfort to Members of the House if the Minister were to say he would make it zero for a local authority member.  As my colleague, Senator Boyhan said, we are not looking for it for Senators, Deputies or anybody else but the local councillor who deals with the people all day, every day.  I see the smile on the Minister's face and I will take that as a positive reaction.</p></speech>

I know other elected representatives would be dealing with communities which have had major issues with the consultation process and I appreciate the Minister's statement that for larger developments there might be a need for a consultation process.

There have been a number of infrastructural developments in our area, some relating to decisions about wind farms.  Local communities are up in arms because they felt that the consultation process was not adequate.  Another issue arose in our area about a greenway on which there was a consultation process but people felt it was not adequate and not everybody was put on notice of that or made aware of it.  There is huge pressure on communities in that type of scenario in that they are told the development is essential and that it has to be forced through even if it is detrimental to certain people in the communities.  I want to put that on the record.</p> <p>I am not convinced by the Minister's argument.  I will not press the amendment but I will oppose the section based on the arguments we put forward.  I am sure it is a political disagreement but we believe the case being put forward to bypass that democratic scenario where the councillors have an input into the process is not the pressure point.  There are other issues and we would like to keep that democratic role for the local authorities.</p></speech>

The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has calculated there is outstanding planning permission for 27,000 units, as we heard yesterday, although the Minister today stated the figure was 28,000 for projects that have not commenced.  Developers sitting on one or more existing planning permissions should have to start building those projects in order to be able to avail of fast-track planning.</p><p>Essentially, it is ludicrous that 28,000 potential units are sitting out there.  There is a housing crisis and people are sitting on their hands by not developing these projects.  We are talking about the urgency of the issue and the developers must get their hands out from under their bums and start building as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister will also be amenable to supporting the amendment as it is practical.  We spoke earlier about the concerns and obstacles to large-scale planning development and how strategic projects were not happening.  It is very important for us to be clear that we are not simply looking at answering a wish list from the construction industry.  I am sure that is not the intention of the Minister.  If there are to be large-scale developments but if there is an absence of them, it is not entirely to do with planning and planning simply is not the issue.  The facts belie that because, as the Minister indicates, there are 28,000 outstanding planning permissions.</p> <p>This amendment is extremely practical, indicating that we cannot be dependent on the construction industry and its whim to turn on or off the building of houses in Ireland.  Currently it very much seems that the industry is setting the agenda.  It decides if it will build and is trying to set the rules around how and when it will build.  If this Bill has the serious intent of delivering long-term solutions and large-scale housing developments, it must have both elements; it must demand something from the construction sector as well.</p> <p>Thanks to research from Deputy Burton, we know that many people in the construction industry are not paying tax at the very reasonable 12.5% level because they are using methods similar to those used by others in America, including the recent very high-profile case, to write off their current profits against previous losses.  We know that between the construction and financial services there was in 2014, for example, more than &euro;1.2 billion written off as taxes not to be paid because they could be written off against previous losses.  The construction industry is not contributing in the way it should be in tax terms.  Many of the major actors in the construction industry have been building elsewhere in the recent period and it seems that at times we are almost at their mercy when it comes to building in Ireland and whether they will be happy with a certain level of profit.  The citizens of Ireland, both those in vulnerable housing positions and those seeking to buy, do not have recourse to such tax measures.  The citizens of Ireland do not have the leisure to wait and see if they can get 10%, 12% or 15% profit on their endeavours.  There is a significant number of people in Ireland working at a loss or to break even on their lives.  We want to help those people.</p> <p>We have been supporting the Minister moving forward in this planning area but we want him to add a robust message to the construction industry that all those who seek to avail of this new planning structure - fast-tracking, if that is the label to be attached to it - should not be allowed to do so while they sit on planning permissions for up to 28,000 units in Dublin alone, as we have heard.  Any construction company or developer wishing to avail of this should have to demonstrate good faith and that they will act on a planning permission.  The proposal is very simple in that a commencement notice must be submitted to the relevant planning authority for any outstanding planning permission for 100 units or more before an application under this section and this proposal can be made.  This must be unarguable if there is seriousness on all sides of society, including the construction industry and developers.  It is about stepping up to the collective challenge and let the developers show good faith by filing commencement orders relating to outstanding large-scale projects.  It is not about every house in Ireland.  They should begin building right away, even without having waited for the new orders to come through.</p> <p>This is a very reasonable proposal and I would like the Minister to indicate if he can support it and we can send that message.  If he cannot do so, I would like to know the reason.  I cannot see any reasonable argument against this amendment.</p></speech>

This is an excellent amendment and it is very logical.  Why should a developer who has stockpiled 100 units and not even put in a commencement order for them be given another planning permission before he or she has even started the process for the first 100 units?  That would be idiotic.  Let the developer get the first 100 started before he or she gets permission to start applying for another planning permission.  It is similar to the case in north County Dublin where a builder has been implicated in the pyrite issue.  It has left many families absolutely devastated, but having applied for permission for another development, the developer got it.  That was before he made any remediation for the houses that were improperly built under his direction.  How can it be justified that somebody with permission to build 100 houses and has done nothing about it can be given another planning permission?  It is wrong and I will vote for this amendment.</p></speech>

I hear what they are saying but I will be the devil's advocate.  We have a housing crisis and, if I understand it correctly, this amendment applies to an extant or current planning application for a number of units.  If the new legislation is given effect and permission can be fast-tracked, would such a party be permitted to put in a new application?  Will somebody clarify that?</p></speech>

I would like to hear from the proposers about their intentions, as well as the Minister and his officials.  We should look to throw more light on this.  I would not like to jeopardise a better planning application with higher densities in an appropriate location that ticks the appropriate zoning boxes.</p></speech>

Planning applications may have been granted on what are now seen as flood zones or flood plains or whatever.  We need to be careful.  I absolutely agree with the sentiment that we want to get people moving and that if people are speculating and sitting on sites for which they have planning permission - for example, the 28,000 that a number of Senators quoted earlier in and around the greater Dublin area - we want to get them moving and put as much pressure on them as we can.  However, depending on the site, some are viable and some are not.  Even still, and in some parts of the country, it is not viable to build a house at the moment, certainly in the minds of many developers, because house prices are still significantly below where they would have been when the planning permissions were given.  That is not the case in Dublin or Cork.  Senators should not shake their heads at this.</p> <p>I accept that there is frustration in this regard, but we also need to deal with the facts of the situation.  There is a reason housing development is now starting again, there is a reason there is a significant increase in planning permissions and commencements, particularly around the Dublin area and some of the other urban areas, but there is also a reason we are seeing virtually no house building apart from one-off houses in other parts of the country.  The point is that some planning decisions were granted that are not on sites that are viable at the moment, for local authorities as well as private developers.  We need to acknowledge that.  The core issue is that if there is a zoned piece of land on which it is suitable to build houses and if building right now is a viable proposition, we need to get the site moving as quickly as we can.  That is what I am trying to do anyway.  If there are developers or builders who are able to borrow and put that business case together to build both social and private housing, we need to encourage that process.</p> <p>We should agree on the point made in amendment No. 4, also in the name of Senator Higgins, that if we give people planning permission through this new mechanism and they do not build, we should not allow them provision for an extension after five years.  The point is to try to get the system moving quickly.  If developers do not respond to the mechanism, given the benefits to them of the new system being introduced, and if they do not deliver on a commencement notice and start to build, after five years the planning application, like virtually every other planning application in the country, should not be eligible for renewal.  There is therefore a distinction between the two matters.</p> <p>Once developers benefit from this new system, they need to get moving on construction and putting together developments.  If they do not, they will have to go through the process all over again, and this system probably will not be in place in five years' time, so they will have to go through a much longer system.  However, I would not like to see any case in which a developer has a site that has planning permission but, for whatever reason, is simply not viable at the moment because the developer is waiting for a road to be built or a gas pipeline to be connected or there are some waiver issues - there are many reasons they may not be developing - and that that developer, which is ready to go on another site, cannot get through the planning process.  I do not disagree with the frustration I know is there, but I think there is an unintended consequence of the amendment of which we need to be wary.  That is why I do not propose to accept this amendment, even though I propose to accept the principle of amendment No. 4.  I just need to check the wording of it with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  In principle, I am happy to accept amendment No. 4, but not amendment No. 1.</p></speech>

I think the thrust of the amendment and what it seeks to achieve is laudable, and we will probably support it.  Senator O'Donnell made a very good point in the previous debate that we want to build houses, not fuel speculation.  There has been a huge amount of speculation over the years.  I think that is what this amendment seeks to address, that developers may look at this new process, say to themselves that there is money to be made here, work on the development of a number of planning applications but then try to sell them off to the highest bidder or bring in a builder who will ensure the most profit for the speculator.  That is the danger that has been envisaged in the amendment, and that is the loophole we want to make sure is closed before the legislation is passed.</p> <p>The Minister talked about bouncing a ball earlier.  I bounce the ball back to the Minister and ask him whether he agrees with the thrust of what is trying to be achieved in the amendment.  We have spoken about the 28,000 applications that have been sat on.  Some of them may be in areas that are not viable at the moment, but I imagine quite a lot of them, since they are all in the larger Dublin area, would be viable.  How many of those are speculator-led or developer-led applications that were passed and are being sat on for the developer to make a bigger profit envisaged in the future?  We are trying to avoid that happening again and avoid a developer-led market again in that scenario.  Will the Minister therefore take on board the essence of what the Senators are putting forward in the amendment?  How can the Minister try to encompass this provision into the legislation being brought forward?</p></speech>

His clarification was the same one I had wished to make to Senator Boyhan.  This is not about planning applications; it is about existing planning permissions, that is, those that have gone through the 78-week process, as described, and have been through all the loopholes.  These are situations in which there is no question but that permission to build has been granted.  I appreciate some of the Minister's concerns about this but I believe that it is still fundamentally important.</p> <p>I would like the Minister to consider potentially coming back on Report Stage with an amendment of his own in this regard.  While there may be cases such as those the Minister has described, we need to be clear about what we are talking about when we talk about "viable".  Clearly, to a large extent, these situations are viable because they were granted planning permissions.  If there has been a further development in the case of a flood plain, that is a particular issue.  If there is a gas line that is waiting to come through or a road to be built, they may be key issues, but it seems we are talking about "viable" simply in terms of the level of profit that can be made.</p> <p>If we are serious - and I believe the Minister is - about housing, we need to be absolutely clear that, unfortunately, profit alone cannot be the main driver, the main consideration and the gift that must be offered up in order to have reasonable housing and accommodation.  The Minister spoke to the reason houses had not been built and that they are being built now, that is, the profit incentive.  In the future we may well not have secure public finances.  We live in an unstable world.  We cannot build our plan simply on a limitless degree of profit in terms of construction companies setting their own agenda completely in what they regard as sufficient motivation to build.  Nobody is saying that developers must build if they will make a loss, but let them weigh up the advantages, which the Minister has rightly said are given and afforded to developers in this legislation, and the opportunities to build and fast-track planning proposals, to invest and to seize this moment as the moment when they can build and sell.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That should come with the cost of the kinds of other planning developments we need around the country which have planning permission.  There is a reason our housing industry failed and much of that is because of speculation.  The reason we are in the situation we are in now is because there was an absolutely untrammelled, speculative approach to housing based on the idea that the market, solely, would provide.  I hope the Minister's measure will provide balance.  He is working with the providers but it should be clear that his fundamental responsibility is not simply their financial returns; his core responsibility is to ensure we have the housing supply we need.  This is an opportunity to leverage our power as legislators to ensure we see movement because speculators have been drip-feeding development in parts of the country.  They are waiting to decide when they feel motivated to build and that is on the back of the hardship of citizens.  We would be very happy to work with the Minister to bring this forward in the limited time available to us.  Perhaps the Minister could table amendments to address the hoarding of planning permission under speculation and, for example, he could put forward a definition of "viable" and have it incorporated into the considerations of the planning process.  We are not talking about a huge number of developments here, only developments of 100 units or more.  These are the large-scale actors.  If we are talking about companies that are putting forward new proposals they must be companies that are valid and viable in that sense as well.  It sends a very strong signal and it is not unfeasible or unreasonable.  I would like the Minister to consider working with us to see how the goal we have set out might be achieved and how the Minister feels his concerns could be addressed in an amended version of this amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

When I read it quickly at first, I presumed it pertained to the particular site on which one was looking for planning permission.  Otherwise, for me it would not have made a lot of sense.

I could name a whole pile of counties but there is no point in alienating any more people in my life so I will not do that.</p></speech>

The cost of building those houses before paying levies or putting in infrastructure is a minimum of &euro;150,000.  That is a minimum.  We want to get houses built and people in them.  That is the problem.  Senator Higgins's sentiment is dead right.  I fully agree with it but when I read the proposed amendment quickly I presumed it pertained to a particular site.  There could be some smart alecs, as the Senator alluded to earlier, who claim there were not enough units on the site or it was not viable.  Those guys need to be cut out but we should not tarnish everyone with the same brush.  We will go back to relying on the bigger builders that have come through this crisis.  They probably bought lots of sites in places where it is not viable, for example, because they were piggybacking on other sites.  This has to be modified if it is going to work.</p></speech>

Perhaps they are built in the wrong place or on flood plains.  If so, they should be just bloody well demolished.  They should be gotten rid of if they are in that condition.  It is a tragedy to think that something that cost &euro;150,000 to build cannot be disposed of at &euro;50,000.  That is a really chronic situation.</p> <p>I was impressed by the Minister's reply.  It was clear and thoughtful.  Has the Minister come across any evidence of hoarding or of people keeping planning permissions dormant so they can put them in when there has been a big gazump in the market?  That is wrong.  When the Minister says it is not a viable situation and they are not economically feasible, how often is that the situation?  Could I suggest a possible amendment that the Minister might consider on Report Stage?  It is quite simple.  In page 7, between lines 21 and 22 to insert the following, "where there is evidence of hoarding" before the words "an application" because that would deal with the situation.  It means that if the authorities have evidence that a builder has been deliberately hoarding permissions and not acting on them, then he or she should be prevented from making use of the Bill.  That is a reasonable amendment to the amendment.  It keeps the thrust and intention of the amendment but it targets it a bit more specifically at people who the whole House feels should not be included in this process.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#EE01900"><p>I am inclined to support my colleagues, Senators Higgins and Grace O'Sullivan.  I am aware of a site not too far from my home where the developer held back the last seven houses and has recently put them back on the market with the price increased by &euro;100,000.  These were houses costing &euro;700,000 which have gone up to &euro;800,000.  It was a smart move - a couple of weeks and he suddenly made a massive killing.  I also have personal knowledge of the forward buying that took place during the madness of the noughties, if one wants to call them that.  People who never put a brick on top of a brick bought large sites, got planning permission on them and then flipped them on.  The flip-on was where they made serious money.  The amendment tabled by Senators Higgins and O'Sullivan acknowledges that those kind of people simply cannot exist.  The effect of the proposed amendment would be that if one buys a site and gets planning permission on it, one must commence development before one looks for planning permission somewhere else.  That is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask.  I hope we do not have to put this to a vote.  I hope the Minister will reflect on it and come back on Report Stage with something that would meet the sentiments of the amendment.</p> <p>The other thing is the definition of viability.  I do not know how the Minister defines viability.  His view of what is viable and my view of what is viable may be very different.  I could have sites in one part of Dublin and I will leave them because there is not enough profit in them but if I go over to the other side of Dublin I can buy 100 sites and make a serious killing on it.  There is huge merit in this amendment and perhaps the Minister will reflect on it before Report Stage and see if he can bring something back to meet the requirements of the two Senators involved. </p></speech>

In the Dublin area alone, there are said to be 28,000 units.  That is a huge number so there must be some viability.  We need to get activity going as soon as possible and anything the Minister can do to expedite that would be welcome.  We tabled this amendment to expedite matters in order that we might get as many units as possible.</p></speech>

Senators referred to viability.  I am not the one who determines that because viability is essentially determined by the marketplace.  If houses are being built, there is viability.  If they are not being built - and regardless of how we define viability - there is a problem.  That is how matters have stood for quite some time.  For those Members who were not here earlier, I repeat that 12,500 houses were completed last year, some 6,000 of which were one-off houses in the countryside.  Of the other 6,500, almost half related to unfinished housing estates and apartment blocks being finished.  Only 3,000 to 4,000 new houses were completed last year throughout the entire country.  Three quarters of the way through the year, there were just 15 applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for planning permissions for developments of more than 100 units.  This was despite the fact that there is a need to build approximately 30,000 units per year.  We are at about one tenth of the way towards where we need to be.</p> <p>There are many indications that things are being ramped up and activity is commencing.  I am delighted that people are now talking about building large numbers of starter homes on the outskirts of Dublin for first-time buyers that will cost between &euro;200,000 and &euro;300,000 each.  It is the first time in a decade we have heard that kind of talk.  What I am trying to do now is ensure that we continue to swim with the tide as it starts to move in the right direction, as opposed to putting obstacles in the way of getting outcomes.  Essentially, this means building new houses in the right locations at the right price and of the right quality.</p> <p>Nothing irritates me more than people sitting on sites for the purposes of speculation, which is purely about a profit grab, increasing margins by forcing everybody to wait and allowing more pressure to build up in the property market to drive prices up further.  That said, however, we have had many conversations with local authorities, developers and stakeholders in this sector who refer to genuine obstacles to being able to build and open up sites.  That is why we are committing &euro;200 million to an infrastructure fund - most of which will be spent in Dublin and the greater Dublin area - in order to get viability on these sites by having the State take some of the infrastructure cost relating to opening them up.  We know there are some viable sites that should be up and running soon.  These are not owned by builders but by speculators.  They are owned by funds that are buying them because they know we have a pressurised market which is becoming more pressurised by the month.  Prices are going up and they are looking to buy, to speculate, to sell and to make a profit.  If possible, we need to get those entities out of the sector and the industry.</p> <p>There are also people who have been through bankruptcy and who are now setting up new construction and development companies, and trying to come back into the market and raise finance for projects.  Some of them have sites and some do not.  Some of those sites are more financially attractive than others in terms of getting the finance to be able to move ahead.  Most of these projects need financial backers from outside their own companies, whether that is through the conventional banking system, equity funds or other types of funding partnerships.  What funders will look at is financial returns in terms of the ability to be able to sell houses to pay for the funding of projects.  These are the realities that people do not like talking about but they are still the realities.</p> <p>My job is to ensure that we get affordable houses built at reasonable prices and that people are not speculating and hoarding land.  Undoubtedly, some hoarding is taking place in Dublin.  I look forward to introducing a vacant site levy so that people who are sitting on sites and doing nothing with them will have to pay a levy linked to the value of those sites.  Before Report Stage on Tuesday, I will look at how we can incentivise and encourage people to move on to building when they get planning permission, sooner rather than later, with both a carrot and a stick.  However, there are dangers to linking it to the potential viability or potential funding capacity on a separate site they may own.  That is all I am saying.  We are all trying to achieve the same thing here, which is to get zoned sites moving.  If we look at the increased activity that is happening, what we want to do is encourage and accelerate that rather than put obstacles in its way.</p> <p>My judgment on this, for what it is worth, is that we will end up with an unintended consequence from an amendment that has been tabled for all the right reasons.  I need to caution against that.  I am happy to have a discussion on this again in a few days but, as it is proposed at present, I think there are probably more problems than solutions attaching to the amendment.</p></speech>

Canada has introduced a levy for people who have empty properties, not necessarily sites.  I wanted to mention this to the Minister, who I am sure is aware of it, because it would encourage people not to have empty units.  Local councils would potentially be included in that so there might be a speeding up of the reuse of empty units throughout the country, especially in Dublin.</p></speech>

Developers and builders have been the most demonised people in this country in the past six or seven years.  They have all been categorised as the one group.  While there were some people who abused the system, the vast majority of them have been demonised by the public and the press.  They have lost confidence-----</p></speech>

The developers and builders have lost confidence.  The ones who got into trouble lost their properties and their homes.  The vast majority lost everything.  The vast majority of their properties are in NAMA or with vulture funds or the banks.  The ones who were lucky enough to escape and who may have sites have no confidence to recommence building.  I met five builders who told me that, in order for them to build, the minimum cost would be &euro;170,000 per house.  They cannot get that price.  These are the sums they have done in order to go to their bank managers to make proposals.  It costs &euro;170,000 because of planning fees, architects fees, VAT and costs relating to sewerage, water, roads, footpaths, public lighting, etc.  Unless builders are guaranteed they are going to get a minimum price, they will not take the gamble, even if they have sites.</p> <p>The Minister is correct.  We have to give confidence back to the house-building market.  While there is a good market for commercial building, the vast majority of house builders and developers got burnt.  They have lost confidence in building and none of them want to build.  That is why we saw just 13,000 houses built last year, 6,000 of which are in rural areas.  We have to give confidence to this market.  I fully agree with the Minister, who said he will return to this issue on Report Stage.</p></speech>

In the context of homes and all the rest, I am not going to lose any sleep over people like the director - I think his name was Dunne - who bought a house in Ailesbury Road for &euro;86 million without even seeing it because his wife said that &euro;86 million was what she would like to pay for it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a kind of madness around the place.

Some people may raise an eyebrow when I tell them that there are, according to the CSO, 40,000 vacant residential properties in Dublin tonight.  There may be people in sleeping bags in the doorways of some of them, although I hope they will be in shelters tonight.  We have a huge opportunity to bring vacant properties back into the system, which is why we have considered a series of well-funded proposals in the housing strategy to get councils to buy up vacant properties, to get the Housing Agency to buy up properties and to incentivise people to bring vacant properties onto the rental market.  However, it has all been a carrot approach so far.  It is a big step essentially to tax somebody for inactivity on a property he or she owns, and there are property rights issues and so on linked with that.  It is an interesting point and one which we should consider, but I do not want to raise a concern or expectation surrounding it today.</p> <p>Hoarding can be defined in many ways.  A person may own a site and have received planning permission to build 120 houses outside Castlebar ten years ago because property prices at the time made that an attractive business proposition.  Property prices may have collapsed by 50% in the meantime but they are now slowly increasing.  If it is to be considered hoarding that such a person holds on to a site and planning permission in the hope that the market may improve to make it a viable proposition at some stage in the future, I do not think we should punish him or her for that.</p></speech>

That is a somewhat dangerous space in which to be.  The House should consider what it costs us to build social housing.  I can think of a number of social housing projects where the houses, excluding land, have cost us &euro;170,000 or &euro;180,000 to build, whereas in many parts of the country we still talk about three-bedroom semi-detached houses selling for &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000.  We have a broken housing market at the moment, and we must recognise that.  The one thing we need to ensure in this legislation is that we do not make a bad situation worse in some parts of the country, including Dublin for that matter.</p> <p>I take on board Senator Norris's sentiment.  The Government will think about the proposal and see if we can put something in the Bill that attaches a consequence to someone who receives planning permission in respect of a site if he or she does not move on the site.  In other words, we want people in this new streamlined planning system who want to build straight away to benefit from the system, not people who seek planning permission now with a view maybe to selling on the site in five or six years' time.  I will consider the ways in which we might be able to work towards that objective.</p> <p>However, the consequence of the Senator's request would mean that reasonable developers who want to get on with planning and building houses on a site which they have purchased and which has zoning would be prevented from doing so because they happen to own another site that is less attractive or for which they cannot get finance for whatever reason.  That would be unnecessarily restrictive, and I think it would have a consequence that we may not want, even though I totally take on board the frustration about the matter.</p></speech>

I recognise and appreciate the Minister's engagement.  In his contribution he moved somewhat ahead to amendment No. 4, which we will discuss later and which addresses the consequences for those who seek planning permission under these measures.  I appreciate the Minister's willingness to engage on that amendment and hope that will expedite our discussion about it.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1 does not look to the future regarding those who access planning permission through this new process.  It urges us to use this moment, that is, the legislative moment and opportunity when the cards are in the hands of politicians - it is for politicians to decide - to leverage some action on the part of those who may, as the Minister has so eloquently described, be waiting for an ideal level of profit and may have a site that is financially viable for a builder but are waiting for it to give a greater level of return.  While there are measures for the future in amendment No. 4, to address current speculative land holding, I urge the House to use this moment.</p> <p>The Minister raised the danger of politicians deciding viability.  I suggest there is also a great danger if we leave it solely to the market to decide viability.  If we do so, the fact is that profit, be it for a speculative fund that may never have set foot in Ireland and may never have any intention of doing so or for anyone else, will be explicitly the main determining factor.  We need a balance in this regard, and I urge the Minister to work with us to find it.</p> <p>A valid concern was expressed that the outstanding planning permission might be in another part of the country.  Perhaps the Bill could be amended to look to where there is outstanding planning permission on viable sites in the same local authority area where the new fast-tracked planning permission is sought, using whatever definition we have for viable sites, and there are objective considerations we can bring in to determine that.  Such a constraint would ensure it is not a matter of whether it is located in a greenfield site that was bought at a certain point but that we are talking about building houses to address the same identified needs in the same identified areas that we are trying to target through this strategic development.  That is maybe a narrowing of our proposal which would give it a much more targeted focus.  It does not serve anybody if there are sites for which planning permission has been granted in areas that are strategically important and where people want to live but which sites are still taken out of the picture, and I think the Minister knows that.  We are happy to withdraw the amendment at this point but we reserve the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While we reserve the right to reintroduce it on Report Stage, we also hope to have an opportunity to work constructively with the Minister and others across the House to tease out and take responsibility for the decisions we make, as politicians, to ensure the best possible outcomes, not for one particular industry but for citizens.

This simple amendment differs from amendment No. 3 in that it proposes an independent review.  The Minister has repeatedly stated before the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and also in this Chamber that the legislation is subject to a sunset clause.  It is, to paraphrase him, a temporary little arrangement to get us over a hump, namely, the crisis in housing.  I suggest an independent review of the operation of these provisions.  In this regard, Deputy Grace O'Sullivan and I are not at loggerheads with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which has proposed a departmental review.  I do not believe in departmental reviews because the Department should not be the jury and jury in its own cause.  This would not make sense given that the Bill was initiated in the Department.  In saying this, I am not being critical of the Department, which is made up of good public servants.  They too must be part of the review. </p><p>I do not want Members to bellyache later if problems arise and they have declined to support the amendment.  This is an opportunity to have an independent review of the process by 2019, which is a reasonable proposition.  The review must be tight and concise and consult all stakeholders, including county councillors, chief executives of local authorities, executive staff members of councils, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which is a critical part of this process, and officials in the Department.  It is only right and proper that the Minister have an input also.</p><p>The review should produce a report to be presented to and discussed by the Oireachtas.  This process will involve a learning curve and the review is an opportunity to learn.  Unforeseen issues will come to light in the first few applications made under this legislation.  It is reasonable, fair and sensible to have an independent review of the scheme commencing in 2019.  This will give everyone an opportunity to examine the scheme and learn from the first three years of the process in terms of how to improve and change it.</p><p>I have no doubt the scheme will be extended.  If it is a success, the Minister will make the case either to extend or make it permanent.  We cannot predict that far ahead in terms of politics because the political dynamic three years from now will be wholly different.  It is incumbent on us, however, to provide for a review mechanism.  This is a reasonable proposal and I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il Senators to meet us halfway on it given that they are also proposing a review.  I believe we can agree on the need for an independent review as opposed to a departmental review.</p></speech>

We sought a review through the Oireachtas but also one which was independent through local authorities and citizens.  At the end of the day, the scheme will operate until 2019 and if it is successful, it will be great for people who need homes.  We have discussed planning, an area in which many mistakes have been made over the years.  It is important that the fast-track planning mechanism which will be in place until 2019 is reviewed at its conclusion and that everyone participates in that review.</p> <p>The biggest issue we have is enforcement and additional staff will be required for this purpose.  The biggest issue facing local authorities is enforcement in housing estates, from lighting to footpaths to works that need to be done.</p> <p>I hope the Bill is passed because many people are unable to find homes to rent due to a lack of supply.  We need to give this legislation a chance until 2019 when we will find out if it has been successful.  It must be a success because two families are becoming homeless every day, which is uncalled for.  Lack of housing is a major issue and the Seanad has a duty to ensure there is a sufficient supply of housing.  The scheme must be reviewed at the need of 2019 and the review must involve Oireachtas Members, local authorities, councillors and communities.  We must be able to decide if the scheme has been a success.  </p></speech>

It is essential to have an independent review of the new mechanism.  An issue arises with the amendments to the extent that one proposes an independent review, while the other calls for a departmental review.  My instinct would be to go for an independent review. </p> <p>The Minister has not made a sufficiently robust case for leaving local authorities and councillors outside strategic planning.  I will not regurgitate the arguments we made on this issue.  Sooner rather than later, however, we may see evidence that a role for local authorities will need to be built into the legislation.  </p> <p>In principle, it is very important to review legislation regularly, particularly legislation such as this which will be crucial in the provision of housing nationwide.  My instinct tells me that an independent review would be the best approach but I am open to persuasion on the matter.</p></speech>

Without such a review, we will be at nothing.  We must measure not only whether the targets have been achieved, but also whether they have been achieved in the best way possible.  An independent review will help deliver information for the public and avoid concerns that there is some form of bias at work.  Independence will provide an element of fairness and this type of review would differentiate itself from one involving authorities that may be implicated in the process.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>

At 5.30 p.m. yesterday, I got notice from the Minister's office that he wished to decline the Second Reading.  Micro-beads and micro-plastics are of great concern not only here in Ireland but also across Europe and the world.  I cannot believe that only hours before its Second Reading, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government serves notice that the Bill will not be read a Second Time.  That shows lack of leadership and management because this Bill has been on the Order Paper for the past number of weeks during which time the Minister, and the Department, had every opportunity to consult with me if there was any part of it he felt was not above board.</p> <p>This Bill was prepared by a colleague of mine, Aengus &Oacute; Corr&aacute;in, who is from the Minister, Deputy Coveney's county of Cork.  We looked at the Bill in terms of making it straightforward and its objectives easy to achieve.  We recognised that there are many other issues on the Minister's agenda but this is an issue on which momentum is building already across Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy, which are already proceeding with legislation to ban micro-beads and micro-plastics in the marine environment.  The fact that legislation is already under way in those countries I felt, being a new Green Senator in the Seanad, that we could bring forward a straightforward Bill on this issue and get a ban introduced as soon as possible, which will be to the benefit not only of the marine environment but for the common good.</p> <p>Currently, in supermarkets, corner stores and pharmacies there are bottles of product on the shelves for exfoliating, which I do not do much myself, shaving creams and toothpastes which contain tiny beads of plastic.  They are in multiples of cosmetic products on every counter in Ireland.  What happens when people use facial cream?  Those small, round plastic beads go down the drain because the infiltration system does not stop them.  Trillions of these micro-plastics are seeping into our lakes, rivers and seas, which is shameful.  Molluscs, cockles, mussels, crustaceans such as shrimp and other little fish ingest this plastic into their systems and then die because they have no nutritional value.  If caught in nets, they end up on Senator Norris's or Senator Alice Mary Higgins's plates, and they ingest them.</p> <p>We are concerned about this issue.  Science is showing that pesticides are attaching to these micro-beads and micro-plastic so when we drive our cars, some of the diesel fumes attach to the beads.</p> <p>There is no nutritional value for the species ingesting these micro-beads and micro-plastic.  There is the potential of a detrimental effect on our ecosystems and the lives of different creatures, be it fish, crustaceans or whatever.  We cannot allow that to continue.  Every time someone exfoliates or puts cream on their face, these little particles get into our marine environment.  We are causing that problem.  This is pollution at a very basic level.</p> <p>The reason I referred to Canada, the US, Holland, the UK and Italy is because momentum is building in those countries in terms of addressing this problem.  It is on that point that I query the Minister.  He stated that this Bill is not rigorous enough.  It is a start.  If we always sit back and wait until we dot every "i", we will lose time.  That is why I am so upset that the Minister has literally shut down the debate.  He is stopping us having the Bill read a Second Time and moving it forward.  That is undemocratic and fundamentally unfair.  This is something that should have happened without objection.  If the Minister believed in putting forward an amendment or if Fianna F&aacute;il, whose members are sitting on the opposite side of the House and with their huge interest in the environment-----</p></speech>

They say they have a major interest in the environment.  It was only the day before yesterday that it came to our notice that Fianna F&aacute;il wanted to table a Bill on the issue.  Is that the reason Fine Gael has decided to jump on board?  We know the Labour Party also considered tabling a Bill.  When I moved the Bill on First Stage I know there was a general feeling of consensus across parties that these micro-plastics are bad for the environment and that this would achieve momentum but it has been stopped dead in the water.  We are losing time while these particles continue to be washed down our drains.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope that the Minister may reconsider his move.  I fully intend to work with whoever will make this Bill happen because there is general consensus that these micro-beads and micro-plastics are polluting the water.  </p><p>In 1986, I had the good luck to be in Antarctica for six weeks on board a Greenpeace ship.  I will never forget sailing into Antarctic waters.  We expect the polar regions to be pristine, because they are the last wilderness, and I was shocked to see plastic bottles floating around in those waters.  Is that what we want in Ireland?  Do we want to contribute to this kind of plastic waste in our oceans?  Our country took leadership and banned plastic bags and charged a price if anyone wanted to buy one.  We became for a time the beacon of Europe and the world because people saw that as a very positive measure.  This Bill should get a further hearing and we should once again take leadership and be seen to do the right thing for the marine environment, the rivers, the lakes and the human species.  </p><p>There is research under way in the United Kingdom on the impact of micro-beads and micro-plastics on the marine environment.  The Minister told me this morning that when bringing forward a Bill like this we should inform the European Commission.  That is his job.  When legislation is prepared, if any authorities, in this case the European Commission, need to be informed it is up to the Minister or the Department to do that.  That is a totally unsatisfactory excuse for not reading the Bill a second time.  I ask the Minister to consider enabling this Bill to go forward and not to disable the process.  He should not slow down the process any further.  We have all agreed that micro-beads and micro-plastics need to be banned from our environment.  Let us get going and leave this Bill as it stands in place and receive a second hearing.  Short of that, I offer the Minister every constructive help to ensure that we ban the manufacture and sale of micro-beads as soon as possible.  I would rather that my Bill, which is relatively simple, go forward to Committee Stage for amendment.  If the Minister insists on killing it and continuing to enable and allow pollution every second of the day into our rivers, lakes and marine environment, that will be a big error because we are continuing to create more problems in our environment and not working towards solutions.  I ask him to consider what I say.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s passion for, and deep knowledge of, marine ecology and environmental concerns.  She made this a priority as soon as she entered the Oireachtas.  It entered the Order Paper some considerable time ago.  There has been immense co-operation from our group with the Government in discussing when it might be taken.  We have moved the date of this Private Members' business slot to accommodate the Government.  We have endeavoured at all points to ensure constructive dialogue.  It has been deeply and well signalled as an area of concern.  We have heard concerns expressed across the House about micro-beads and micro-plastics and their impact on the environment.  While I may not have had the time on the seas that my colleague had, I have seen, as I am sure many others have, the horrible testimonies and videos of the devastating impact of these micro-plastics, a throwaway element in many products, on marine ecology.  It seems extraordinary that the Government would seek to block the reading of this Bill a second time.  As I understand it, in the amendment, which we might hear although I am still hoping it will be withdrawn, legal concerns are expressed.  I highlighted on the Order of Business the way that these legal concerns are being put forward now yet on this very day an appeal to the European Parliament that the investor dispute resolution courts which raise serious concerns in respect of the EU treaties be referred to the European Court of Justice.  We have not heard resounding support from the Government for the referral of these investor courts to the European Court of Justice simply to check their legal compatibility.  If we are going to invoke arguments of legal compatibility, we need consistency in that regard.  Moreover, we are confident that the precautionary principle, a fundamental principle in EU law and practice, does absolutely justify the measures in this Bill.  Even if that were not the case, there would be plenty of time to deal with it.</p> <p>If this had been taken in good faith, surely we would be considering an amendment from the Government to remove section 2, relating to the manufacture and sale of micro-beads.  Instead, we have an order from the Government to kill the entire Bill, including sections which relate very directly to our domestic authority, for example, the water analysis.  Is it the view of the Government that there should be no Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, analysis of, and sampling from, coastal waters?  Is it the view that there is a problem if we monitor the level of this in our waters?  Does the Government have a problem with section 4, which calls for an environmental analysis?  If there is such consensus in the House, from Fianna F&aacute;il, who with the exception of the Acting Chairman are unfortunately not here today, and Labour which has expressed concerns about it, let us move ahead with the other sections of the Bill, the environmental and water analyses, and section 6, which gives power to the Minister to make orders in this area.  If the Minister is serious about this area, I ask him to withdraw his amendment and work with us towards Committee Stage and the many positive and constructive elements of this Bill. </p></speech>

This Bill banning micro-beads is a small but important one.  I was very much looking forward to debating it today and seeing it progress to Committee Stage.  That the Government has now moved to block this Bill is grossly unfair and is a clear effort to silence debate on this important environmental issue.  I do not think it would be possible for any Senator to argue that micro-beads are not an environmental disaster.  These micro-plastics are a very damaging example of plastic waste and have a very detrimental effect on our marine environment.  If Ireland truly wishes to project a green image internationally it is clear that banning them from cosmetic and other products should be a high priority.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we are all in agreement that micro-beads and plastics are objectively negative and harmful, how can the Government justify an effort not to ban them?  Its reference to Articles 34 and 35 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union does not stand up as a justification for not allowing the Bill to pass Second Stage.  As a number of EU countries have already banned or are in the process of banning these damaging plastics, it is nonsense to say we must await EU-wide measures.  If we all agree that micro-plastics are bad and that EU rules do not pose an insurmountable barrier to the progression of the legislation, how can the Government justify its amendment?</p><p>The Bill was introduced in the Seanad on 26 October and the Government has had almost one month in which to raise concerns about it.  Even when Senator Grace O'Sullivan indicated to the Bills Office and the Leader's office that this legislation would be taken in the Private Members' time of the Civil Engagement group, we still heard no objections.  It is particularly unfair and unacceptable that we received notification at 5.30 p.m. yesterday, less than 24 hours before the Bill was due to be debated.  In the Civil Engagement group we take what we table during Private Members' time very seriously.  We strongly consider the best possible issue to feature in consultation with our civil society partners.  Our contributions in this Seanad have involved some of the most worthy actions taken by the House since my election, including Senator Alice Mary Higgins's motion on the CETA and Senator John Dolan's motion on disability rights and housing.</p><p>It is incredibly unfair that one of our few chances to choose what we debate in this Hose has effectively been taken from us.  It is obvious that the Government is preventing progression of the Bill owing to the recent publication of a very similar Bill by Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is clear that the Government is allowing political expediency to trump its commitment to protect the environment.

While I do not doubt the bona fides or intent and passion of Senator Grace O'Sullivan and others who have spoken about this issue, it is already national policy that we work towards banning micro-beads and the dumping of plastics, particularly micro-plastics into our marine waters.  Without wanting to sound patronising or lecture, I urge Senators not to take offence just because the Government does not accept their Bill.  They are doing a job of work in raising awareness through this debate in the Seanad.  They have already done this in bringing the Bill before the House.  However, the Minister and his officials have already indicated that they are working towards a wider ban on micro-beads by working with our EU partners and the European Commission.  I was an Opposition Senator for almost five years, during which time we introduced many Bills in the House.  Ironically enough, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government at the time was former Deputy John Gormley.  None of the Bills was accepted, but we did not take offence because sometimes Opposition Bills will inform or urge the Government to take action.  I, therefore, urge the Senators not to take offence just because Government is opposing the Bill.</p><p>The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is a former Minister with responsibility for the marine.  Like Senator Grace O'Sullivan, he has been participating in marine sports and other marine interests throughout his life.  I come from the same county as the Senator.  While I do not have the same background in marine activities, I take a deep interest in them.  No individual or party has a monopoly of green interests; I certainly have such an interest.  However, we might have different views on introducing legislation to address the deficits.  This is one area in which there is a deficit and the Government is committed to taking action to deal with it.  The Minister has indicated in correspondence and otherwise to Senators that he is working with EU partners and the European Commission to introduce legislation in 2017.  He has indicated - I say this with no disrespect - that the Bill is flawed and that it does not go far enough in some areas.  While it covers personal care products and cosmetics, it does not take into account detergents and scouring agents.  More thought and consultation with stakeholders are required to ensure these areas will be included, leading to more effective legislation when finalised.  Further thought needs to be given to regulation and sanction, while engagement with stakeholders is also required.</p><p>I urge Senators not to take offence.  They have support in the House and more support than they believe from the Minister.  With continual engagement in coming months, a more effective Bill will be introduced that will take into account the concerns of the proposers of the Bill before the House.  My colleagues and I will work to ensure this because we all have an obligation to ensure we have a sustainable environment on land and at sea.  We have made strong progress in recent years in that regard.  Senators have alluded to the plastic bag levy and the smoking ban.  We can make further progress in areas such as waste management and on how best to sustain the environment.  I, therefore, ask Senators not to take deep personal offence, as they seem to be taking.  In parliamentary politics the Government will often oppose in order to try to enhance legislation.  In the first instance, the Senators have started a debate that is warranted and created awareness of micro-beads which are a terrible ecological affliction on the environment, which we all want to work towards eradicating but in more complete legislation that will be brought before the House in 2017.</p></speech>

While we strongly support a ban on micro-plastic beads, we are anxious that the legislation to introduce a ban be conclusive.  Studies have shown that micro-beads can be ingested by marine animals, leading to physical harm, including reproductive toxin effects.  There is also evidence that micro-plastics are entering the human food chain and potentially damaging human health.</p> <p>The Bill is poorly drafted and a number of its provisions have not been properly thought through.  Its scope is not wide enough to reduce micro-plastic marine pollution caused by micro-beads.  This is because it would only apply to cosmetics and body care products but not to detergents and scouring agents.  Fianna F&aacute;il will introduce its own Bill on the issue which will have wider scope and provide a stronger more robust legislation framework.</p> <p>In the USA a ban on micro-beads in cosmetic and personal care products is due to be phased in in the coming years.  There have been calls for a similar ban in the United Kingdom and the European Union to address what is considered by most experts to be a damaging and an entirely unnecessary source of micro-plastic pollution in marine environments.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Bill is in breach of Articles 34 and 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to the principle of the free movement of goods.  Ireland should support a ban at EU level.  The European Commission is due to commence consideration in early 2017 of a ban on micro-beads.  Engagement at EU level should not preclude us from proceeding with a national ban; however, under EU law consultation would have to take place with the European Commission first.</p> <p>The Bill does not set out a robust legislation framework or a realistic enforcement regime.  In particular, weak enforcement mechanisms are set out in the Bill as no office would be tasked with investigation of production bans.</p> <p>As this is all new to me-----</p></speech>

I know he did not send a letter to Senator O'Sullivan at 5.25 p.m. yesterday.  It strikes me that at the 24th hour, or the 23rd hour and 59th minute, the Department suddenly woke up and realised that the Bill was to come before the Seanad the following day and that it had not had the time to consider it.  It had been so tied up in housing and all the other issues.  The Bill suddenly landed on its desk.  What would the Department do?  It would shoot the Bill down.  How would it do it?  It would get the two bigger parties to agree that it would not see the light of day.  What has happened is a disgrace.  The Bill could be read a Second Time, and there is plenty of time to table all the amendments the Government wants to encompass anything it wants on Committee Stage.  However, as somebody said this morning, the old bed is warm between the two parties.  They are enjoying each other's company.  The coalition is alive and well, although Fianna F&aacute;il does not have the ministerial salaries to go with it.  It would be disgraceful if we were to accept the Government amendment.  We need to rock on and get in behind the Green Party on this.  If changes are needed, they should be made on Committee Stage.  We should be mature about this.</p> <p>I am mindful of one thing tonight.  There is talk of a better Bill being introduced.  Sir Humphrey's famous words were "in the fullness of time and at the right juncture".  In the fullness of time and at the right juncture, we will have a Bill, but God knows, it will probably be 20 years by the time it sees the light of day.  The Minister of State should take his courage in his hands and say he will accept the Bill and table amendments-----</p></speech>

They should reflect on how we manage our business and get things done.  I give credit to Senator O'Sullivan for the Bill she brings before us and the aspiration within it, which we support and want to see enacted.  However, to achieve the result we all want, a process must be undertaken and gone through.  The last thing we want is to have the end result thwarted, the Bill declared unconstitutional or the result not achieved, as articulated by many Senators in the House today, including those opposite.</p></speech>

It is important to recognise that much work has gone into the Bill.  Those of us who support its ethos want to see the right result.  We should try to arrive at and achieve the end result.  In fairness to the Green Party and Senator O'Sullivan, for whom I have much admiration, we want to see a Bill that is constitutional and that can arrive at the result she and all of us want.  However, if we talk about new politics and want to see things done, one cannot do things erroneously, by mistake or without getting to the right result.  Sometimes it absolutely baffles me, Senator Craughwell, when I see some people coming in here to grandstand, play to an audience and then leave, knowing full well that they cannot get what they want.</p></speech>

Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised issues, and the Minister came in and addressed them.  The Minister is willing to come to the House, debate and negotiate.  I regret, and I mean this genuinely, that we did not have an opportunity prior to today to iron out properly with Senator O'Sullivan any difficulties the Minister had to ensure the passing of the Bill.  Nonetheless, I hope we can arrive at a conclusion that will be mutually beneficial to the Green Party and the Minister.  My point is that, of all the Ministers to come before the House, Deputy Coveney has demonstrated a willingness to work and a flexibility to get things done, whether with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, Sinn F&eacute;in, Independents or the Green Party, and that should be put on the record of the House.</p></speech>

It is like an episode of &quot;Callan's Kicks&quot;; it is unbelievable.  This is the welcome to the new politics of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael coalition that the Independent Senators are being given.</p><p>This is a very serious issue.  We have seen recently across Europe and North America a growing awareness of the dangers that micro-beads pose to our environment.  After debate, the United States, Canada, the UK and six other countries have all come to a conclusion that legislation should be introduced to end the use of micro-beads.  It is amazing that we are all playing catch-up with the United States on an issue of environmental damage being caused through activity by large companies.  Micro-plastic debris in marine environments is growing in volume.  It is likely to have a range of environmental impacts.  There is evidence to suggest that micro-plastics are entering the human food chain.  On the basis of current evidence, micro-plastics and seafood are not currently thought to represent a risk to human health, although uncertainties remain.  Micro-plastics come from a number of sources such as larger pieces of plastic breaking down over time and industrial scrubbers used to blast-clean surfaces.  A small percentage of marine micro-plastics come from micro-beads and other micro-plastics used in a variety of cosmetic and personal care products such as scrubs and toothpaste.  As has been mentioned previously, these particles of plastic can enter the environment when consumers rinse them down the drain.</p><p>A number of companies are voluntarily phasing out micro-plastic in some cosmetic products in the EU.  Some environmental organisations have been calling for a legislative ban on the use of micro-plastics in some cosmetic products.  They believe that this will be a simple way to speed up industry efforts and to tackle an unnecessary source of micro-plastic pollution.  A recent research report commissioned by the European Union recommended that more information be collected to help determine whether a ban is required and whether the industry is responding adequately to the issue.  The European Commission is currently considering whether additional measures are needed to address the problem.  We favour of a micro-plastic ban in cosmetic and personal care products.</p><p>The micro-bead campaign has also provided useful statistics on the amount of plastics currently in our oceans.  According to it, 86 NGOs from 37 countries are supporting the campaign.  Already, 117 different manufacturers that produce 446 brands have promised to remove plastic micro-beads from their products.  On the campaign's website, it is possible to follow whole waves or clumps of plastics moving around our oceans, just as weather systems do.  The European Parliament Research Service has also carried out research on the issue.  Most of this points, as I have already stated, to increased levels of plastic and the unknown effects it will have on the food chain.  My colleague in the Northern Assembly, Caoimhe Archibald, recently voiced Sinn F&eacute;in's support for a ban.  She said concerns have been raised about the build up of plastics in oceans, their effect on fish and other marine life that may mistakenly eat them and also the potential for them to enter the food chain.  She was told by the relevant Minister that departmental officials will work with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the other devolved administrations on the detail of proposals and legislation to be introduced.</p><p>The micro-plastics that are ending up in our streams, rivers and oceans are now entering the food chain because they are being consumed by fish and shellfish.  As of yet, there are no conclusive studies on the health impact this will have on humans.  However, studies conducted by Uppsala University in Sweden demonstrated that fish exposed to an environment polluted with micro-plastics will consume the plastic in preference to zooplankton.  At the very least, this will affect the nutritional quality of the fish in Irish waters.  However, the study also showed stunted development and cognitive deficiencies in the fish that consumed plastic compared to those in a clean environment.  This indicates a significant risk both to the health of consumers and the survival of fish stocks.  My colleague in the European parliament, Lynn Boylan, MEP, has been critical of the overall Irish Government response to the issue.  Reflecting on the failure to act in a national manner and to look to Europe to take a line they can hide behind, she said:</p><blockquote>This is typical guff from the Irish government who are as usual trying to export their excuses for inaction to Europe when the simple truth is that they don&rsquo;t want to take any action themselves. ... If the government had bothered to do their homework, they would know that the European Commission has already said to the British government as recently as August that it can proceed to introduce a ban on micro-beads, explicitly stating that &quot;a ban on certain substances on environmental grounds could also be compatible with the internal market&quot;.  ... On top of this, France has already passed a law that will ban the sale of exfoliating cosmetic products containing solid waste particles from January 2018 whilst Sweden and Denmark are also in the process of preparing to move on this issue as well. </blockquote> <p>She continued, &quot;I call on the government to spend less time on weak excuses and instead follow the example of these countries and come forward with a legislative proposal to ban these unnecessary micro-beads in cosmetic products.&quot;  Therefore, a protracted consultation process before banning could result in significant environmental damage in the meantime.  We agree this needs to be tackled at an EU and international level but taking action nationally would still go a way towards protecting marine resources at a local level.  However, the period of research and consultation to decide how to go about banning micro-beads could make a large difference in the amount of environmental damage.</p></speech>

I would like to lance that one if I might.  the Labour Party has carefully considered the position of whether EU law would prevent member states from taking action on the issue.  Articles 34 and 35 of the treaty set out the principle that as a single market is an area without internal borders, restriction on the movement of goods are not allowed and the free movement of goods should be guaranteed.  Undoubtedly an Irish ban on the sale of products containing micro-beads would have the effect of restricting certain imports.  However, Article 36 of the treaty goes on to say that "The provisions of Articles 34 and 35 shall not preclude prohibitions or restrictions on imports ... [that are] justified on grounds of ... the protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants".  The EU treaty directly acknowledges that national measures can be taken to protect the environment and this undoubtedly is one of those measures, as has been very well put by my colleague Senator Grace O'Sullivan.</p> <p>In December 2014, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium and Sweden issued a joint statement to EU environment Ministers calling for an EU ban on micro-plastics in cosmetics and detergents.  A January 2016 research report, commissioned by the European Union Commission, looked at what EU mechanisms were available to reduce micro-bead pollution from cosmetics.  That report concluded that introducing a ban on micro-beads at EU level would be more complicated than the law used in the US and Canada.  The report said that it was unclear as to whether any of the existing directives and regulations that had been identified would be suitable.  In light of this hesitancy at EU level we believe that domestic action is necessary and appropriate.  The Government cannot hide behind EU law in this instance.  It is true that our proposed legislation amounts - on the face of it - to a trade barrier but there is a well-established procedure for dealing with this if the mindset was there within Government and within its coalition partners in Fianna F&aacute;il.</p> <p>The EU Transparency Directive sets up a procedure obliging the member states to notify the Commission of all draft regulations and products before they are adapted in national law.  The notification triggers a standstill period of three months.  The Commission and the other member states can use this time to examine the notified draft regulations to determine whether or not it complies with the EU treaty and the principles of the free movement of goods and services.  If there is no reaction the draft can be adopted after the three month standstill period has expired.  This is exactly the procedure that the de facto T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin had to follow when he introduced the ban on smoking in the workplace.  There was a standstill period for the new rules and then they came in to full force and effect.  The EU Commission can block the proposal if the draft legislation concerns a matter where the EU itself proposes to act.  This is clearly not the case on micro-plastics.</p> <p>Fine Gael should stop pretending, or hiding behind EU law.  The fact is that a last minute phone call took place by Deputy Timmy Dooley throwing the dodie out of the pram, he wanted the credit for himself, and an extremely good piece of legislation from the Green party, supported  by the Labour Party - even though we had our own Bill in the mix - is now being shot down.  The pair of you should be ashamed of yourselves.</p></speech>

Unfortunately the Leader has left the House after criticising other Senators for doing the same thing.  With regard to the environment, we had our own problems and the Green Party had battles with Fianna F&aacute;il on climate change and climate change legislation in getting it onto the Statute Book.  Unfortunately it was not successful.  The Labour Party had those battles also when we were in Government, with the former Minister, Commissioner Phil Hogan, on climate change legislation.  Thankfully, Ireland was one of the first countries in the EU to put climate change on the Statute Book, which was brought in by us with Fine Gael.</p> <p>My colleague has outlined Article 36 very clearly and the conditions in which this Bill can move forward.  We have a clear choice.  We can lead by passing this Bill or we can follow.  We can lead to protect our environment or we can wait and cause further damage.  We can lead to protect the health of our citizens and show leadership to the rest of the EU - and the world -  by passing this legislation this evening.  We can lead to protect our rivers, lakes and oceans or we can wait and do further damage.  This is a time when this country needs to show clear leadership.  We are an island nation with the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the Irish Sea on the other.  We know very clearly how plastic can damage the environment.  We do not know the level of damage micro-beads can do.  We know they stay in the environment, that fish can eat them and they damage the wildlife.  We know also that micro-beads can act like a sponge to pick up dangerous chemicals which are then transferred into the food chain.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for bringing the Bill forward.  I very much reject the Government's amendment and I want the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

At least we have extracted that amount of information from the Minister of State, for which I thank him.  It is helpful.</p> <p>To be honest, I only heard about micro-beads in the past six months.  I had no idea that there were tiny pieces of plastic used in everyday cleansing agents and so on.  I am surprised and alarmed by this.  Like other Senators who have spoken about their travels around the world, I have travelled to remote parts of the Caribbean - uninhabited islands - and seen shorelines covered in blue plastic bags from all over the world.  It was horrifying.  The beads are small and visually unobtrusive but subtly dangerous.  Companies introduced them in their products without any concern for the downstream effects.  They are now waking up to the problem and it is welcome that a number of them have acknowledged the danger.  Colgate Palmolive phased micro-beads out in 2014, while unilever phased them out in 2015, as did Boots.  L'Oreal, a large cosmetics company, will have phased them out by the end of next year.  That represents a 50% decrease in levels.  The beads are spherical micro-plastics and used in scrubbers and so on.  Interestingly, they were originally based on natural materials until the companies discovered that it was more efficient and easier to produce them mechanically in large quantities in factories.  There has been a shift towards plastic and away from natural ingredients.  They are also composed of larger plastic units that have been broken down on the ocean bed.  Micro-beads comprise a small proportion of marine micro-plastics, estimated to be 1% to 4%, but this equates to 2,400 to 8,000 tonnes of plastic entering the marine environment per year, which is a hefty amount.</p> <p>Perhaps I am wrong, but I understand the Netherlands has already introduced these provisions.  It was certainly calling for this as far back as 2009.  In June 2014 Illinois became the first US state to ban the manufacture of products containing micro-beads.  On 24 March 2015 the Canadian House of Commons voted unanimously that the Canadian Government should take immediate measures to add micro-beads to the list of toxic substances under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act 1999.  A series of serious political actions have been taken around the globe.  In our neighbouring country I understand there has been a technical hitch in introducing the legislation, but more than 350,000 people have signed a petition to have micro-beads banned. In 2015 the UN environmental programme called for the eventual phase-out and a ban on the use of plastics in cosmetics and personal care units.  There is a growing chorus calling for a ban on the use of these materials.</p> <p>The Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Pollution is known as - I hate these acronyms - GESAMP.  It reviewed the evidence on micro-plastics and found that the research was relatively new.  It is clear that we need additional information and research, but that should not delay the introduction of this type of legislation.  One of my colleagues humorously referred to micro-plastics landing on my dinner plate.  I am afraid that they are so small I would just gollop them down.  I probably would not notice them at all.  It states in the document that the annual dietary exposure for European shellfish consumers can amount to 11,000 micro-plastics per year.  This strikes me as something that could do damage, but GESAMP states there is a gap in education.</p> <p>We should press forward with the Bill.  I hope there has been some communication between the various ministerial Members - all except the one directly responsible, of course - who have attended the House today and the framers of the Bill in order that it may be left on the Order Paper and allowed to go through.  No damage would be caused.  If fatal flaws are found in it, they could be dealt with at a substantially later Stage.  No one is fooled by the idea that it is being delayed for technical reasons because of non-compliance with EU regulations.  My colleague, Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has burst that bubble.  It is just not true.  The evidence has been given by the Senator.  The Government, therefore, does not have that fig leaf.  It is repulsive to find, once again, that important legislation is being delayed for party political reasons because a collection of dogs in the manger do not want to give credit to the Green Party, but that is not unusual.  I prepared a Bill on the direct provision system that would have solved all of the problems, but it was held up because-----</p></speech>

It is disappointing.  Senator Paudie Coffey made a point about respectful engagement across the Chamber.  It is important.  People are looking at the Seanad and seeing how we conduct ourselves.  The past few days have been disappointing.  Inevitably, we get angry, annoyed and disappointed.  It is because we are passionate about the subjects we come here to discuss and represent people on.  The Senator made a valid point.  While our engagements may not be manifested in direct legislation, amendments or regulation, they may feed into it.  This is where we need to change.  The people have spoken.  They want the Seanad to be here.  The quality of the debate is higher here than in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, dare I say it.  The engagement is constructive, most of the time.  This is an important point.</p> <p>The Bill proposes to prohibit the sale and manufacture of products containing plastic microbeads and to monitor and report on the levels of microplastic and microbead pollution on the Irish coastline, waters, flora, fauna and Natura 2000 sites.  It is very reasonable.  As I was coming into the Chamber, there were two televisions on, one showing the D&aacute;il and one showing the Seanad.  Deputy Catherine Martin was speaking in the D&aacute;il and Senator Grace O'Sullivan, the first Green Party member to be elected to the Seanad, was speaking here.  It is not often that two Green Party members are speaking in two Chambers in this building at the same time.  It reminded me again of the significance and importance of the Green Party and its contribution.  While all parties claim to have green credentials, the Green Party has done great service in a very difficult time by returning to these political Chambers and being very effective.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has returned to his chair.  I have not spoken since he left, which is a coincidence in itself.  The Minister timed it well.  With no disrespect to any Minister of State, I appeal directly to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, Mr. Nice Guy, as everybody tells me, to let it go in good faith.  It should go to the next Stage.  The Minister should not block it.  Again, I pay tribute to Senator Grace O'Sullivan for her impassioned debate on "Morning Ireland".  She captured her enthusiasm with the subject and her frustration at how the Bill has been blocked and stymied.  It came over very clearly.  I do not know whether the Minister was listening to it on his way here.  I was driving here.  The Senator was very committed to it.  It is an environmental issue.</p> <p>Certain Senators have chosen not to be here to engage in the debate, and this is one of the clear features of the Seanad.  During the past six months it has been an eye-opener for me to see how few Senators want to come in here and engage in real, meaningful politics.  We talk about new politics.  I do not believe there is new politics.  I believe there is a new reality, that one has to do business.  The members of the political establishment - I do not mean the Minister personally - would not do any business if they did not have to in the new scenario.  It is disappointing.  The Minister has the power to do it here, now.  I appeal directly to him, sitting in the Ministers' chair, to allow the Bill to go to the next Stage and allow people to have a meaningful engagement.  It is all about consultation and meaningful engagement.  We spoke about other issues earlier.</p> <p>I do not care who brings in the legislation on microbeads, and neither does Senator O'Sullivan.  We just want good legislation.  The Minister, his Department and all parties knew the Bill was coming.  They are not here with amendments.  Where are the Government Members who have such enthusiasm for the environment?  Why are they not here proposing amendments?  The Minister needs to answer.  Why are the Government Senators, who were elected and who were determined to be here, not here contributing with amendments?  Why are the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators not here?</p></speech>

I was in the other House listening to Senator O'Sullivan's Green Party colleague speaking on the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2016.  We are going to do this.  There are fundamental problems with the microbeads Bill, which I will outline.  This does not mean I do not share the view that we need to ban the use of microbeads and implement a series of other measures to protect the marine environment, which we are committed to doing and which we will do within months.  This is not going to go on ice.  I will happily involve Senator O'Sullivan in the process.  I know something about the Senator's background regarding understanding and protecting the marine environment, which is where she comes from politically.  There are others in the House who care about the marine environment, and I happen to be one of them.</p> <p>I am not going to pass legislation that we are going to have problems with in our efforts to resolve the issue.  The Bill has triggered my Department.  On this week's agenda, we must deal with a proposal to ban microbeads, which is something I did not know much about, although I know a lot about marine litter and plastics.  This week I launched a new green flag module around global citizenship and marine litter.  I was previously the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There are approximately 6.2 trillion particles of litter in our oceans.  That is 1,000 particles for every person on the planet.  There are approximately 100 million tonnes of marine litter in our oceans.  This is having a devastating consequence on marine ecosystems everywhere.  In the middle of the Pacific ocean, there is a garbage patch that is twice the size of Texas.  This rubbish has gathered there as a result of ocean currents.</p> <p>I have had, and will continue to have, progressive conversations with European Commissioner Karmenu Vella, who is deeply committed to the issue.  We will introduce legislation next year, to deal with the issue, which I have learned much more about due to the proposals in the legislation.  Our legislation will also deal with some of the broader issues regarding dumping at sea and some of the measures we can take, such as designating areas at sea as marine conservation zones, which we will do next year, as well as moving on the issues the Senator is pinpointing in the legislation to ban the use of microbeads in cosmetic products.  I am happy to do it, we have signalled we are going to do it, and we have already signalled that we want an EU-wide ban.  I ask the Senator to please accept my bona fides.  I am not seeking to stymie it.  It was frustrating for me to look at social media, where I am being attacked on the issue, as if I am blocking it or undermining what the Green Party is trying to do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not the right thing to do.</p></speech>

I reassure the House that I, as Minister with responsibility for marine environmental protection, and the Government generally recognise that microbeads used in cosmetics, body-care products generally and also products like detergents and scouring agents are potentially harmful to our river and marine environments.  Indeed, Ireland has held a formal position that we wish to see microbeads banned throughout the EU.  Over recent years, scientists, experts and policy makers have become increasingly concerned about the levels of waste or marine litter winding up in our seas and oceans.  As Senators are aware, it can be found in every aspect of the marine environment and ranges in size from large objects such as fishing nets or shipping containers to micro and nanolitter particles.  However, the extent of the marine litter problem and the harm it causes to the environment are not fully understood at this time and are subject to ongoing research.  Nevertheless, it is clear that this is an issue we need to address and, at the very least, we need to do so under the precautionary principle, about which Senator Grace O'Sullivan has spoken.  Marine litter also causes socioeconomic harm by affecting tourism and consumer confidence in seafood, but the core issue here is that it is destroying an eco-system that we have a responsibility to protect.</p> <p>Plastic is a particular problem for the marine environment.  It does not biodegrade and persists in the environment for a very long time; many lifetimes in fact.  It can break down into secondary microplastic particles through erosion which is evidence that both large plastic items and microplastics are being ingested by marine fauna with undetermined consequences for them and the creatures higher up the food chain who eat them, including ourselves.  Microplastics are also entering the marine environment in other forms including microfibres and artificial fibres worn off clothes during washing.  However, a certain amount of marine microplastic litter is caused by plastic microbeads, which are used in cosmetics, body-care and cleansing products, detergents and surface cleaning agents, entering the marine environment via wastewater discharges into rivers and estuaries.  Such microbeads cannot be easily removed by treatment of wastewater.  In fact, it is virtually impossible to treat it according to my understanding.</p> <p>Microbeads might only represent a small fraction of the microplastic litter entering the marine environment, but they are a particularly pernicious product in the sense that they are ready-made microplastics which cannot be removed once they reach the marine environment.  Microbeads cannot be regarded as a major human necessity.  They are often present merely for decorative purposes.  As some Members will probably know better than I, microbeads are used as exfoliating or scouring agents.  A wide array of established safe and biodegradable organic particles or natural mineral alternatives are readily available.  The relevant industries are fully aware that the tide of international opinion is turning against the use of microbeads on account of their potential to cause harm to marine ecosystems.  They are already banned in Canada and the proposed US and UK bans are due to commence in 2017.  A number of EU member states, of which Ireland is one, have formally stated that they seek such microbead bans across the EU.  Thus, industry is already turning to other alternatives.</p> <p>The fact that marine litter is a transboundary issue means no one country can solve the problem on its own.  While a domestic ban by a population of 5 million in isolation may send a positive message, banning the use of microbeads by a population of over 500 million would be much more effective.  However, I recognise that there is a value in sending a positive message with a domestic ban.  If we are going to do this, we have to do it properly.  It is my job to ensure that we do it properly rather than to try to do something to support a colleague I happen to think has the right view.  As a legislator, my job is to ensure that I take legal advice and take the correct approach.  I have taken some initial legal advice on the issue and my primary concern in the first instance is that a national ban could place Ireland in breach of Articles 34 and 35 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which provide for the free movement of goods, unless a process is put in place to allow us to do it.  Furthermore, under Directive 2015/1535 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on information society services, which is an "EUism", if I may use that term, there is a requirement for Ireland to formally notify the Commission that we intend to introduce such legislation.  Introducing a Bill like the one being proposed today prior to such notification would place us in breach of the directive and open to immediate and probable successful challenge.  As such, it is not possible for us to introduce such a Bill at this stage.</p> <p>Even if it were possible, there are other flaws in the Bill that I have a responsibility to highlight.  For a start, it is more limited in ambition than our current policy position.  It does not cover detergents and scouring agents, which can also contain plastic microbeads.  The problems with the Bill are not confined to that issue.  If they were, we could address them by way of amendment.  For example, the Bill does not appear to provide any investigative or enforcement powers.  The penalties laid down are disproportionate and out of step with recent legislation.  The specification of a fine of up to &euro;10,000 per item could mean that a shopkeeper with a carton of 100 bottles of eye make-up containing plastic glitter for sale could be liable for a fine of up to &euro;1 million.  I do not want to create a drama about that but I note that there is a process here by which we need to test the legislation to ensure that it is right.  The Bill does not provide the Minister with sufficient principles and policies to make regulations and the monitoring programme it proposes is far too broad in scale to be either useful or scientifically justified.  The advice I have is that the legislation proposed would simply be unworkable, costly and ineffective and I have an obligation to let the Senator know that.</p> <p>Nonetheless, I see advantages in Ireland leading by examples on microbeads.  With this in mind, the Government will develop proposals to ban microbeads nationally in the context of a wider marine environmental Bill to be published next year, which will also provide the legislative basis for a network of marine protected areas, as I mentioned earlier and as required by the marine strategy framework directive, and make necessary amendments to the Dumping at Sea Acts.  We will consult the relevant stakeholders in advance of this, draw up our justification for a derogation under Single Market rules and notify the Commission as required.  In conjunction with this work, we will continue to lobby for an EU-wide microbead ban at the earliest opportunity.  As I stated earlier, marine litter, like climate change, is a transboundary problem and we will only be able to start to solve it by concerted international action underpinned by research and supported by awareness raising activities.  In advance of that, I intend to write to the Commission in the coming days to notify it of my intention to proceed with a ban on microbeads, going even further than the ban proposed by Senator Grace O'Sullivan this evening.  We are going to follow through on this.  I mean that.</p> <p>The Government recognises the need for measures to prevent microbeads entering the marine environment through wastewater discharge.  We welcome the principle and acknowledge Senator Grace O'Sullivan's sincere effort in progressing this important issue.  I recognise that this can only realistically be achieved by a ban on their use in cosmetics and the other products we have mentioned.  I have heard Senator O'Sullivan on the radio and seen the frustration and the eagerness to progress the legislation.  I take that on board and because of it I am making a commitment today to write within a few days to the European Commission to inform it that we plan to proceed with a ban.  We will start the process we need to trigger to ensure that when legislation is introduced it is not challenged by the industry in a way that undermines our efforts.  If we do that collectively, we will have done a pretty good job.</p></speech>

The Bill was introduced several weeks ago and something possibly could have been done in the meantime.  As for the notification to the European Commission, again, the Department could have exercised that right and it could be under way as we speak.  It is pertinent we move as fast as possible with this measure.</p> <p>Senator Paudie Coffey earlier spoke about the importance of issues.  I am new to this political system and have not come from a local authority background, unlike Senator Paudie Coffey and others.  Coming in here, however, I understood my job was to be part of a process to introduce and scrutinise Bills.  As a newbie, I did not expect to have all the tools in the bag.  Accordingly, I am relying on consultation and support.</p> <p>What Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said earlier literally threw the Minister's legal advice out of the window because Article 36 squashes the Minister's argument.  Yesterday at 5.30 p.m. was a little late in the day to come forward with the notice of the amendment.  It indicates the Seanad is not really being listened to in time.  We can put forward legislation but Fianna F&aacute;il is not listening.  That was clearly evident from Senator Jennifer Murnane-O'Connor's contribution.  She clearly was not prepared for this issue.  The Minister and the Department were also not prepared for this.  That leaves me feeling incompetent and that I am surrounded by incompetence.  I do not like that.  I hope that in my time in the Seanad that I will work and collaborate with everybody.  When it comes to issues such as marine pollution or housing, I am absolutely committed to work as hard as I can and to consult with other Members to get a good process.</p> <p>The Minister might claim we were not prepared enough with this Bill.  I think we were and we could have got this together.  Our duty is to introduce and scrutinise legislation.  With amendments from the Minister and Fianna F&aacute;il, we could have proceeded to Committee Stage.  As a new Senator, it would have enabled me to see the process while moving the momentum forward.  There is international momentum on this issue too.</p> <p>The Minister asked us to accept his bona fides on this.  I would like to know when the consultation date will be.  There are so many crises in the country under the Government's leadership.  If I do not get a date, it will go down the Swannee, nothing will happen.  It will be put on the long finger and kicked to touch.  I am looking forward to the Minister getting the notice letter to the European Commission.</p> <p>In the meantime, I feel disheartened that we could not have made progress within the Seanad system.  I did my part in introducing this Bill and getting it to Second Stage.  The Department had it on the table for weeks on end and could have scrutinised it and consulted.  However, I had no phone call or no knowledge of the Department's intention.  I do not accept what the Minister put to me yesterday.  For that reason, I would like the support of my colleagues to put this to a vote.  With that, we will see what comes out.  The Minister gave me due recognition and he knows I will work tirelessly with him to ensure we ban micro-beads and micro-plastics from the marine environment.</p></speech>

Surely there would be no problem with having an independent review.  The Minister has clearly said it is a temporary arrangement and we know that he has the power to extend the date.  I am not trying to curtail his extension of the period to five years or whatever other period he would have in mind; I am simply suggesting there be an independent review.  I am not suggesting it be a departmental review but a meaningful review that would allow the Minister, his officials in the Department, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and members of all parties and none to contribute.  The Minister has repeatedly said that when the matter is discussed at various fora there will be a learning curve and teething problems and that we will have to iron out bits and pieces.  There will be hiccups because, by its very nature, it is something that is new.  It would, therefore, be fair and reasonable for him to agree to have an independent review that would add strength.  I reiterate that people should feel involved in the process and they would feel involved if the Minister was to indicate that he was happy to have an independent review.  I hope he will agree to same.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.672" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#XX01100"><p>What did Senators and the Minister of State talk about?</p> <p>After the three-year period expires, there will be an option under the legislation for the Minister to extend the period for a further two years.  The measure will be subject to lot of scrutiny to see whether it has been effective.  There will be many opportunities for the Minister to attend debates in both Houses.  I have been here three times to debate the topic of housing.  Therefore, I am slow to introduce the concept of an independent review unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.  There will be a good understanding on the part of the Minister - whether it is me or whoever will be in my place - of whether the measure is working.  It will be the prerogative of the Minister of the day to use his or her judgment in deciding whether it should be extended by a further two years.  We are talking about a further two years, which means a maximum period of five years.  It will then fall.  There will be appropriate political scrutiny.  Any Minister worth his or her salt will make a case for an extension.  I sense we do not need to put in place another formal independent review process when both Houses will have an opportunity to scrutinise the measure which I suspect will happen long before the three-year period lapses.  I envisage being here next year talking about whether the number of planning applications is up, whether developers are using the facilities being provided for and how Bord Plean&aacute;la and the local authorities have responded to the measure.  I have a lot of sympathy for Senator Victor Boyhan's other amendment, but on amendment No. 2, I am slow at this stage to commit to having an independent formal review process as we will be able to judge the effectivenes of the new measure after it has been up and running for a period.  I am not sure, therefore, that the amendment is needed.  A Minister might well decide to enhance the case for an extension, but that will be a judgment call for him or her to make in a couple of years time.  I do not mean to be unhelpful, but what I have outlined is fair.</p></speech>

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has launched with great fanfare a new consultation document on openness and transparency.  Talk of open engagement means nothing and rings hollow.  I want the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and his officials to be part of an independent review.  Ministers will not stand up and talk about having a review.  The plan is the Minister's baby and his political reputation rests on it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister is happy to do that and he knows it.  That is fair enough.  It is the Minister's commitment and it is the Minister's Rebuilding Ireland programme.  It is about his vision for himself in terms of his political station at this point in time.  He has a lot hinging on this.  Of course the Minister is not going to feel that way.  In a healthy democracy, a Minister might say that he or she favours an independent review of himself or herself and of his or her officials.  I accept that the Minister feels the way he feels.  I reserve the right to table the amendment at the next stage.  The Minister is shaking his head and he will have the same old response at that stage.  Let us not start with talk of new politics again, because this is not new politics.</p><p>I wish to be helpful and I wish to move on, because we are going to be here for a long time dealing with this.

The original provision for extending planning permission was that substantial work must be carried out on foot of the permission.  Separate weaker criteria for the extension of permissions were introduced as a result of the bursting of the housing bubble to enable permissions to be held until economic conditions changed.  There is no justification for allowing a fast-track permission to be held in reserve for years and years.  This is a use it or lose it amendment.  If we are serious about providing housing, planning permissions need to be acted on and not held back.</p></speech>

Again, the legal advice I have received on this amendment is to check the wording, because there is one element that we need to cover.  If somebody does start building, but for some reason there is a problem, for example, if the estate is substantially completed and runs out of planning, what we do not want is a half-finished estate either.  There needs to be a provision for an extension in that circumstance.  However, if the building has not begun at all after a five-year period, as I said earlier, I do not see why we should be facilitating a streamlined decision-making process for developers who do not bother to use the planning permission once they get it.</p> <p>If the Senator agrees to withdraw it, I will introduce an amendment to the same effect with the addition of making the exception for estates that are substantially completed to ensure that we do not end up with a half-finished estate and having to go through the planning process for a year.  I think that would be crazy.  Certainly, this is a stick that we can use.  If we are introducing a streamlined decision-making process for planning that can reach decisions on developers' applications in 25 weeks, we are doing so because we want the developers to build houses on those sites.  If they do not bother doing that, or if they cannot do that for the next five years, then they should probably not be using the fast-track process at all if there is no intention to build in the foreseeable future.  We want this system to be used by people who want to turn sites into homes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For that reason I am happy to support what Members are seeking to do in this amendment, with the minor addition in regard to sites that are substantially completed, so we do not have unfinished estates going back for planning permission. </p></speech>

I think it has been constructively taken.  The amendment is clearly designed to deal with the concerns we raised earlier in regard to speculation, ensuring that where speedy planning permission has been granted, we do not see a significant number of applications being granted and then house building being drip fed over a long period.  Our amendment would ensure that those who seek planning permission under this new process will be those who intend to follow through and build.  It would facilitate a managed return to a normal and full length planning process in the future.  We do not want to see planning applications for buildings in the next five to 30 years going through a process without the level of scrutiny that would obtain in normal circumstances and become the new blueprint for planning in Ireland.</p><p>It would be very positive if the Minister were to work with us to see how this amendment might be fine-tuned in order to ensure that all those who get planning permission under the process set out in this Bill will follow through and build within five years and not seek extensions, except where the building plans are substantially completed.  We had thought that was covered already in terms of where plans had met the conditions set out in section 42 (1)(<i>a</i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  That was an attempt by us to ensure the extension could be granted where there was a question of substantial completion.  We are happy to work with the Minister to fine-tune that and ensure the Government feels able to accept this amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.762" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#CCC00400"><p>I move amendment No. 8:</p><blockquote>In page 8, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:&quot;(viii) information as to what percentage of the proposed development will meet the definition of &quot;universal design&quot; as set out in section 52 of the Disability Act 2005, as well as plans to ensure the accessibility of any proposed development to amenities and services.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>I will be brief because it is getting late.  </p><p>I am heartened to hear that measures are in place to ensure people will not be sleeping rough in Cork, Dublin or any town in Ireland because they do not have a place to go.  The aim of the universal design amendments is to make sure the speedier planning process which we understand is necessary to ensure there will be enough housing available will not overlook the need for developments to be as accessible as possible.  Universal design, as set out in section 52 of the Disability Act 2005, is considered to be the standard design which is accessible to all.  We should ensure the greatest possible percentage of buildings meet the universal design standard.  Under the 2005 Act, &quot;universal design&quot; means:</p><blockquote>the design and composition of an environment so that it may be accessed, understood and used&mdash;(i) to the greatest practicable extent,<br /><br />(ii) in the most independent and natural manner possible,<br /><br />(iii) in the widest possible range of situations, and<br /><br />(iv) without the need for adaptation, modification, assistive devices or specialised solutions,by persons of any age or size or having any particular physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual ability or disability,</blockquote> <p>They include people with dementia.  There are 600,000 people with disabilities in Ireland and we need to create a housing stock that will enable people to enjoy their right to choose where and with whom they live on an equal basis to their non-disabled counterparts.  This fundamental decongregation policy which is underlined in Rebuilding Ireland will enable people to age in place, rather than having to move to specialised or specialist units because of their increasing fragility or immobility.  We need to be thinking of the future when we are building housing.  I am reminded that Denmark has not had to build a single nursing home since 1987 because of its progressive policy on integrated housing and care.  If we pay attention to universal design when we are building stock in order that we will not have to retrofit after the fact, we should be able to avoid having to solve other problems when people's health and mobility issues change.  I hope we will have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities by the end of the year.  It will place an obligation on the State to take appropriate measures to ensure accessibility in housing and other areas.  The amendments would go some way towards ensuring these issues were given adequate consideration.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to take them on board.</p></speech>

At a time of such great dependence on the private rented sector for housing, many people with physical disabilities or who are aged or have mobility issues are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable housing.  I have come across a number of such cases in the Galway area, particularly within the private rented sector.  For that reason, the principle underpinning the amendments is absolutely laudable.  I join Senator Colette Kelleher in hoping the Government will ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities sooner rather than later.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the amendments and I hope the Minister will be able to take them on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.764" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#CCC00600"><p>I would like to speak briefly in support of the amendments and join Senator Colette Kelleher in giving a sense of from where they are coming.  We spoke earlier about strategic housing development and strategic planning.  Demographic planning must play a vital role in that strategy as we move forward, given that 18% of citizens will have a disability at some point in their lives.  We should recognise that universal design serves, fits and facilitates the use of homes by people of all ages.  This family-friendly approach gives people, as they grow older, the option of spending all of their years in their own home without being moved.  We have an opportunity to get it right from the beginning in order that we will not have to depend on adaptation grants.  I know that the Government has stated its intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  If these measures are to move forward, they really need to be reflected now.  We do not want to have to try to retrofit the legislation afterwards to ensure we are meeting the highest standards and our commitment to the rights of people with disabilities.</p> <p>I would like to spell out what our intention is in proposing these three important amendments which we hope the Government might take on board.  We have tried to identify three points in the process.  The Minister might say these factors are already taken into account, but it is important for them to be set out and enumerated explicitly in order that the information will be given.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 8 seeks to ensure a developer who is proposing to build a development woud have to give An Bord Plean&aacute;la information on "what percentage of the proposed development will meet the definition of 'universal design' as set out in section 52 of the Disability Act 2005".  In addition, it proposes that developers would have to set out their "plans to ensure the accessibility of any proposed development to amenities and services".  We have included this because we consider it is the kind of thing that could fall by the wayside if it was explicitly provided for in legislation.  We want to ensure the plans fit in with the wider strategy on social inclusion.  </p> <p>In amendment No. 9 we are proposing that "considerations, related to sustainable development, universal design and accessibility to services as set out in section 52 of the Disability Act 2005" be included in the information provided by a developer for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>Amendment No. 15 is crucial because it proposes to amend section 9 by requiring An Bord Plean&aacute;la to consider and take on board "an assessment of housing needs of people with disabilities in the relevant area, and whether the level of universal design set out in the proposed development will appropriately increase the available housing stock for people with a disability in that area, with due regard to the Disability Act 2005" when it is deciding on planning applications under this legislation.  I know that we are not yet considering section 9, but it is my understanding these amendments are being discussed together.  It may seem like we are proposing an additional obligation or responsibility, but I suggest it is very much in line with the Government's existing commitment to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and, therefore, appropriate to be set out as one of the considerations.  We might not have an opportunity to debate this proposal in detail when we reach section 9.</p> <p>I urge the Minister to ensure consideration of universal design will not simply be a box-ticking exercise when applications are made by developers.  We want to provide that those assessing such applications have a responsibility to give due consideration to the extent to which housing proposals meet the needs of real people with disabilities who comprise almost one fifth of the population.  The amendments would ensure developers and those assessing development applications would know they had this responsibility, as set out in the legislation.  I hope the Minister will support both parts of this two-part process.  If those making applications know that the level of universal design will be considered when determinations are being made on the success or otherwise of their applications, they will take seriously the requirement to include detailed information.  I urge the Minister to consider accepting, or working with, the amendments at both stages in the process.</p> <p>I would like to make a final point about the amendments.  They follow on from a motion on housing and disabilities which was proposed by the Civil Engagement group and passed universally by the House.  I know that the Minister took part in that debate.  This is not an issue to which we are coming for the first time.  We are trying to be consistent with the commitment that was underscored by all Senators to ensure the right of people with disabilities to have their housing needs met will be a central and mainstream aspect of our approach to this issue.  I appreciate that additional measures might be put in place.  Given that we are talking about large-scale developments of 100 units or more, it is possible that the landscape will be shaped for many years to come by the planning permissions that will result from this process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We want to ensure we are not simply seeking an addendum later but building it in from the beginning.</p></speech>

The Minister is aware people are living longer.  The biggest issues that local authorities have are housing adaptation and mobility grants, stair lifts and housing for the elderly.  With this plan, particularly as it relates to developments of over 100 units and new builds, must every home have a bathroom downstairs?  Local authorities are seeking much funding for people with disabilities or elderly people as a downstairs bathroom is now a must, particularly as people are living longer.  Will all new builds and particularly those in the local authorities have a downstairs bathroom?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2016-11-23a.767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2016112300002#DDD00300"><p>Amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 15 collectively propose insertions relating to the considerations of universal design, sustainable development and accessibility to services as set out in section 52 of the Disability Act 2005.  The concept of universal design centres on achieving a built environment that can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people, regardless of age, size or disability, is something we all support.  All new buildings, including social housing units, must comply with the legally enforceable minimum performance standards set out in the building regulations for 1997 to 2014.  In this context, the building regulation Part M amendment of the 2010 regulations and the accompanying technical guidance document for access and use, which came into effect on 1 January 2012, set out the minimum statutory requirements applicable to new buildings and existing buildings where new works and material alteration or material change of use is proposed.</p> <p>In essence, Part M of the building regulations aims to foster an inclusive approach to the design and construction of the built environment.  The Part M requirements may be regarded as a statutory minimum level of provision but the accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and consider making additional provisions where practicable and appropriate.  The latest iteration of Part M of the building regulations initially coincided with the general downturn in economic and construction activity and its positive effects on access and its use in the built environment should now be seen more widely as the economy recovers and continues to take hold and, more important, as construction activity increases and moves to a more sustainable footing.</p> <p>As the issues proposed by the Senators are already covered in the existing building standards regulations and associated technical guidance, it is not appropriate or necessary to include provision for these matters specifically in the Bill.  As suggested, these are matters more appropriate to building control and standards legislation rather than planning legislation.  I understand the point made by the Senators in that sometimes we need a belt and braces approach.  The thinking is although these elements are required by the building standards, regulations and guidance document, if we require developers to have this as part of their applications, they might be forced to think about the issue and prioritise it.  The only problem is if we start down that road, there is a series of issues under building standards documentation and legislation that we could decide must be part of the planning process.  What the Senators are asking for is already required and as long as there is a proper inspection service to ensure it is followed through, we do not have much to worry about.  It is not right to essentially put what may be a very important issue into legislation when it is already fully covered.</p> <p>I am not proposing to accept the amendments.  That is not because I do not agree with their proposals, as I do very strongly.  Many developers may argue that if they did not have to do X or Y, they could build houses more cheaply, etc., but although the standards and progress that has been made in regulations make houses more expensive to build, it should become the norm.  We have not really seen the building regulations take effect to the extent that they might have if we had not seen a building collapse, as they came at more or less the same time.  Now we will see a dramatic increase in the number of social housing and private units built and the building regulations will simply be a standard part of the process that builders and developers must comply with.  The issue is enforcement and inspection rather than pretending to do something already covered by putting something into the legislation that is not needed, given it is already catered for in other legislation.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister's points.  There may be legislation but enforcement and inspection after the fact is an issue.  This is an opportunity to provide enforcement and it is important that a signal be sent.  Will the Minister comment on our amendment No. 15 to section 9?  The Minister may argue the obligations are on builders and developers but what I am asking for relates to when a number of elements have been set out for a decision by the board.  For example, these could be an environmental impact assessment, natural impact assessments and consequences for proper planning and sustainable development.  There are a few elements there and potential scope to make it explicit for the board in considering these applications.  This affects whether we press for a vote.  Even if the Minister was not keen to accept our amendment, does he see scope to incorporate the issue at points, for example, where there is consideration of "the likely consequences for proper planning and sustainable development" in an area.  Is there scope to incorporate some reference to the rights of persons with disabilities in the State's obligations, the question of universal design or existing legislation?  This relates to areas for consideration by the board in its decisions.</p> <p>We have our proposal for section 9 but it would be very useful for us to know if the Minister is amenable to considering some way to incorporate the issue.  There are two pages relating to operation so there is scope to insert this in some shape or form.  We are talking about a significant section of the population.  It would be consistent with the Government's strategy in this area to find some way to incorporate the issue into the decision process.</p></speech>

Is that aspirational or is there a certain percentage involved?  The developments with more than 100 units are going to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

There is a financial cost to that but there are also quality-of-life and accessibility issues involved.  We are exploring the question of design variants within local authority housing estates and mixing single-storey units, double-storey units, etc., to try to cater for different needs, including those of the elderly and people with disabilities.  Although the design of houses and accessibility have improved significantly in terms of turning room in bathrooms and toilets and the width of doorways, other things can be done to provide a diversity of design to cater for different needs.  The core building regulations are required to be followed in all buildings.  These are things not just required to get planning but to build a house or a housing unit.</p></speech>

The accompanying technical guidance encourages building owners and designers to have regard to the design philosophy of universal design and to consider making additional provisions where it is practicable and appropriate to do so.  There is a basic standard in the regulations and a guidance document that encourages design to reflect universal design philosophy.  I will examine the three amendments to see if there is an indicator that we can include to encourage this to be considered.  I need to check whether such a thing would, in legal terms, need to be taken into account as part of the planning consideration, as opposed to the building quality consideration.</p></speech>

If we are bypassing some of the local authority considerations, it is crucial that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has this knowledge, namely, some sense of housing needs.  That is a planning issue, not regulation.  If there is a large number of older people in a particular area, for example, there may be a major need for universal design.  If it is a student development, what proportion of the student body is likely to have a need for disability designs or other access?  A strategic assessment of housing needs is part of planning.</p></speech>

We need to ensure we do not end up with stocks of houses that are not suitable.  In my neck of the woods, there is housing in the old Our Lady of Lourdes Park in which nobody will live because a sufficiency of thought was not put into people living in that area.  There were no bus routes provided, for example.</p> <p>In fast-tracking there is a danger we will create housing but not housing that will last into the future.  I gave the example of Denmark, where thoughtful planning leaves a stock of housing for people who become older, more infirm and more immobile and for people with existing disabilities.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la may not have the same focus on that as a local authority.  There is an elderly population in Raheny because that is how the suburb developed.  In other parts of Dublin, there are younger populations.  We need to be sensitive to those demographic profiles so that we have a housing stock that lasts into the future rather than fixes a problem for today.</p></speech>

There are two distinct issues.  The housing authority carries out a housing needs assessment and local planners should be aware of what these are.  I actually think we need a new housing assessment for every housing authority in the county.  Planning and sustainable development are key for the board.  This particular Bill relates to fast-tracking planning for a few years.  The proposals are valid but I believe councils are already aware of the issues from their own housing assessments of the past.</p> <p>The question is how to dovetail the need in the context of Part 8 and council developments.  They are clearly not delivering but the Minister is correct on this point.  This is about planning and sustainable development.  The other issues can be addressed through co-operative housing, joint ventures and social housing involving charities and other bodies.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 13 substitutes a new 8(4)(<i>b</i>) in the section relating to the report the planning authority must make to the board in respect of an application for planning permission for a strategic housing development.  The principal change in the paragraph is set out at (i), which relates to cases where the planning authority recommends that permission be granted for the proposed development and empowers it to recommend conditions it feels should be attached to the granting of a permission.  The Bill, as published, provides that it is only in the case where the authority recommends refusal of permission that it may recommend conditions to be attached to the granting of permission should the board decide accordingly.  The new paragraph also refers to the recommendations of a planning authority in this regard whereas the text in the Bill, as published, refers incorrectly to the decision of a planning authority in this context.</p><p>In other words, what we are doing here is empowering local authorities to give a recommendation in the positive or the negative after the nine-week consultation process and to attach conditions if they decide to suggest a recommendation as opposed to the scenario with the previous wording whereby they could recommend conditions if they were recommending a refusal but set out conditions should the board recommend a grant of permission.  We are trying to reflect the concern that local authorities should have an impact on the process whereby at pre-planning consultation, where there is a statutory nine-week period, recommendations as part of the file would go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for full consideration and decision.  The capacity is now there for local authorities to give recommendations around acceptance or refusal as well as recommendations around some of the conditions that should be attached.  It is a positive move.</p></speech>

He says he is empowering the planning authority.  We need to be clear what we are talking about when referring to the planning authority, which is the executive of the local authority which is, in effect, the planning authority.  We are not talking about elected members here.  There is no ambiguity about this; it is the executive.  It should be remembered that the executive does not always agree with the elected members and <i>vice versa</i>.  Many elected members have challenged executives on planning decisions and put their hands deep into their pockets to do so.  Members have overturned decisions, which I am not sure the Minister is very aware of.  I might try to pull out some statistics to show the Minister tomorrow on a number of key applications elected members appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to successfully overturn their own planning authorities.  It is an unusual thing, but it has happened.  I have done it myself.  We have actually overturned our own planners decisions and put our money where our mouths were to appeal them.</p><p>I have confidence in the board and have no problem with it <i>per se</i>.  This is about the executive.  Can the Minister confirm that in talking about the planning authority, he is referring to a recommendation of the executive, not of the elected members?  I have no difficulty once we are clear that is what the Minister is saying.  It is why I have been saying there should be an additional mechanism to allow elected members to make their own submissions in their own right.  There is no better person to articulate one's views than oneself.  If this was going to a big debate in a planning authority with 40 members, one would never get consensus or understanding.  One would not be able to make head nor tail of the minutes.  I am sure the Minister is clear, but he might just state that he is talking about the executive, which is to say the officials of the authority.</p></speech>

We got the news earlier today that he passed away.  Many Members may actually know him.  He was a great man and a really good guy and it was a big shock for everyone.  I convey our condolences to his family, colleagues and friends.  It was a big shock for all of the councillors to whom I spoke.  I neglected to mention it earlier.</p> <p>In a similar vein to Senator Boyhan, I have concerns and seek clarification around this question of an authority's opinion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2363"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2363&amp;amp;pid=TrevorOClochartaigh&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a growing concern in local authorities with the changes brought in under Putting People First and the reorganisation of their structures that even more powers are being taken away from local councillors while opinions such as this will only be sought from the executive.  There may be situations where the councillors might not be aware of what opinions have been put forward in a report until after the fact when they examine an application.</p><p>That is part of the reason we would have concerns about this section.  We still do not see an argument as to why the standard planning process has failed in any manner in strategic developments of over 100 houses.  We have concerns in this regard because, no matter how good the members of the committee in An Bord Plean&aacute;la who will be assessing a planning application, an element of local knowledge is brought to bear.  Sometimes it may be a thorn in the side of executives that local councillors bring that information to the table about specific developments.  It is a valid part of the whole process of trying to find a plan which will sit properly in an area.</p><p>For example, in Galway, councillors were constantly told there were no moneys available for this, that and the other.  An executive decision was made between Galway City Council and Galway County Council to buy an airport worth &euro;1 million at the time, however.  The councillors had not realised those moneys were available in the council.  In many cases, a local authority executive can make decisions about which councillors have no idea and they get wrong-footed on it as a result.  Local authority members are elected on behalf of the people.  This highlights the concerns we have with this section.</p></speech>

Craughwell, Grace O'Sullivan, John G. Dolan, and Michael McDowell, deals somewhat with this issue.  When the debate started earlier the Minister gave a commitment that, on a case-by-case basis, councillors would be consulted by the local authority executive and their views would be taken on board.  Therein lies the difficulty, namely the term "taken on board".  From the Minister's amendment, it seems it will be the executive that will write up the report to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, having taken on board the concerns of the councillors but not necessarily putting anything about them in it.  Is this just a box-ticking exercise?  If the Minister introduces an amendment on Report Stage or accepts amendment No. 14, will we just be going through the motions of placating councillors?  Are we really taking away the democratic process in place already?  This is my concern about the whole Bill.</p> <p>For 25 years, I have heard local authority officials, with the greatest respect to them, agree with everything councillors have said only to then put down something completely different in writing.  This is my concern and I would like the Minister to comment on it.</p></speech>

We need to start to have an honest conversation here.  Councillors have to be afforded an opportunity to have their say as representatives of the public, just like any member of the public should have an opportunity to make an objection or an observation to a planning application.  Of course, we need to go beyond that because councillors represent large numbers of the public.  Chief executives, as part of the process, and the planning authority should inform councillors and seek their views, if they want to give them, on large-scale planning applications.  That is the way some local authorities work at the moment.  A planning decision is not a decision for a councillor.  A councillor obviously asks questions about an application and ensures it is consistent with zoning decisions, and LAPs, local area plans, county development plans and so on.  That is the kind of scrutiny in which councillors are involved in all the time.  They can continue to have that role.</p> <p>However, the way some Members are talking it is as if councillors make planning decisions and we are taking that away from them.  We are not.  A planning authority, instead of making a decision in a local authority, would make a recommendation at the end of the nine-week consultation process which would be detailed.  It will be a little like what they do at the moment when they are assessing a planning application and make a decision at the end of eight weeks or seek further information or whatever.  They would make a recommendation before the application formally goes to the board.  That is a proper process of consideration.  The recommendation of the planning authority would have to be taken into account by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as it is at the moment if the board is asked to appeal a decision.</p> <p>I am trying to ensure there is a role for councillors in having the kind of say they have on large-scale planning applications being considered by a council for decision and that they would have a similar input in the context of the consideration under this Bill.  I am not trying to take anything away from councillors.  The planning authority, instead of making a planning decision that will go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la if it is appealed, will be making a recommendation knowing that it is automatically going on to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a formal consideration.</p> <p>I understand the other debate, which is separate, around the devolution of power to local authorities and councils, as well as many of the issues which they have had to deal with in the reform process of the past several years.  This is not about the diminution of power for local authorities.  This is about large-scale residential projects which require a planning decision.  We are trying to streamline the decision-making process where the local authority has an important function, where the planning authority at local authority level makes a recommendation and can make recommendations around conditions that should be attached or that there should be consideration of those conditions being attached.  It then goes on, under a statutory period, to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a formal decision.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also involved in the preplanning process to ensure local knowledge is carried through from the preplanning process to the formal consideration process.</p> <p>That is a much more comprehensive approach than is currently the case.  When there is an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la from a local area, it may not have that kind of preplanning consultation knowledge around the local issues which apply.  It simply looks at elements such as county development plans and so on.  The reason I did not bring an amendment on how we include councillors in the process was because I wanted to hear what Senators had to say on this issue.  Senator Victor Boyhan in particular has been talking about this issue for quite some time.  We want to understand exactly what Senators are looking for and try to reflect that in an accurate wording.  As for amendment No. 14, I do not believe we are a million miles apart on that.</p> <p>Senator Denis Landy keeps raising this issue about us cutting out councillors or reducing the role of local authorities.  It must be remembered this applies to only a tiny percentage of planning applications and it is only for the big ones.  Even with those applications, there is still a strong role for the planning authority at local level in making a recommendation which will influence the final outcome with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This is what happens anyway.  We will try and put an obligation within that system to inform and consult councillors if they want to make a comment on that.  Ultimately, planners are paid to make planning decisions and recommendations, as well as attaching conditions to those recommendations.  It will be the planning authority, ultimately, which will do the report.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The contributions from councillors, who represent the local community will certainly be factored into a report, but the planning decision and recommendations must come from the planning authorities. </p></speech>

However, this is slightly different because there is no third party appeal mechanism to this process.  The Minister talks about a small number of applications, in the region of 50, but this low number of applications will be for a large scale development.  I know that developers are lining up to apply for planning permission under this system.  The Minister may not realise that the scale of the proposed development will run to 80,000 houses.  The Minister will be punch drunk with excitement if this all goes right and I will be the first to join him and say it is great.  I believe, however, there is no third party appeal mechanism.</p> <p>At present, the public come to councillors for a range of reasons.  Councillors raise issues during the planning committee meetings, and they are the custodians of the county development plan.  I am a former member of a local authority and like most councillors would meet the planners in an open, transparent and formal way at a planning meeting.  We would be constantly doing battle to remind the planners of their obligations.  Planners do not get all decision right, and neither do councillors or Ministers.  We are human and make errors, but as councillors are the custodians of the county development plan, they make the case as representatives of the community.  The Minister may not know, but many councillors up and down the country make submissions on planning applications and pay the fee of &euro;20 to the local authority.  I can think of four independent councillors in Cork who have taken serious issue with the environmental impact of a planning application and put their hand in their pocket and registered their concern by paying the fee of &euro;20 to appeal the case.</p></speech>

The executive does not always represent the elected members.  Once the executive sends its decision, the elected councillors have no right of appeal.  They cannot go back to the board and say that the decision is not correct.  Elected councillors of the local authority have no right of audience with An Bord Plean&aacute;la once the executive commits its views to paper and submits them to it.  Councillors do not have an opportunity to correct or rectify something that has been said by the executive.</p></speech>

The only recourse of the citizen, as has been eloquently pointed out by Senator Boyhan, is the local elected representative, who will give an account of what has happened.  The public will let the councillors know at the next elections whom they felt let them down or worked on their behalf.  Unknowingly, the Minister put his finger on the nub of the issue a couple of minutes ago, when he said this is not a devolution of power.  The Bill is not about devolution of power but the recentralisation of power.  He is taking the power from the people and their local councillors and giving it to a body, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I have discussed the issue <i>ad nauseam</i>at this stage.  I do not see the logic of it.  The Minister is taking the process from the local authority to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, without making it democratically accountable.  We are then looking at democratic redress through the courts.  The Minister has not stood up the case he is making for this change, based on delays or otherwise to any great degree.</p><p>In response to my question, the Minister spoke about the 78 weeks it takes for a planning decision, but he still has not given reasons that this new process will make it better.  The Minister said that practically every large development was appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but that is not the case.  The records show that is not the case.</p></speech>

The large scale developments that we are trying to encourage take a long time to get a decision.  If one compares the 25 week process, as proposed in the Bill, to a 78 week decision making process that we know is the case from the 15 cases that I have looked at, it is a significant improvement.  Senator Boyhan spoke about a line of developers who are looking to use the new system because they believe it will work.  Is that not exactly what we are trying to achieve?

We are ensuring that local authorities have a real say in the process of assessment and consistency with local area plans.  Most of the bad decisions in regard to houses in the wrong places, such as building on flood plains and so on were zoning decisions as well as planning decisions.  The zoning decisions were taken by councillors.  Mistakes were made that should not have been made and councillors are still responsible for deciding where houses go.  The only thing we are discussing in this House is the density, design and quality in terms of all the planning considerations that have to be taken into account.</p> <p>Local authorities through the local planning authority make strong recommendations through the pre-planning process, which will be for a statutory nine week period, and it will impact on that.  Councillors and anybody else can make an observation once the formal application goes in and they can make an objections once the formal application is lodged - just like they can do during the current process.  We have a crisis that we need to address.  The normal planning procedures are not delivering large scale housing decisions at present.  We are trying to change that for a temporary period to try to get momentum into the housing delivery market to address the issue of supply.  It is nothing more or less than that.</p> <p>Let me assure Members because I have been on Cork County Council, the largest county council in the country, and I have been through a development plan process.  I have been in and out to planners in terms of one-off housing applications and larger applications, trying to make sure they fit in with the environment and the zoning and all the rest, as have Members, but let us not paint the issue as something that it is not.  I am not trying to bypass anybody.  I am trying to get an appropriate response to what many people in this House and elsewhere have referred to as a housing crisis, where young people cannot get access to homes they can afford to buy, because they are not there.  One of the ways in which we are trying to address it is by getting large scale developments up and running, to get decisions that can make that happen sooner rather than later.</p> <p>I appeal to Members to work with me in that spirit, rather than trying to see something in the Bill, which is not intended, such as to undermine democracy or to bypass anybody.  That is not what we are trying to do.  If we were simply to invest in the existing planning system, I do not see and we have looked at this in a very intense way, how one can make decisions in 25 weeks that involve an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I do not see how it can be done.  We have introduced a system that An Bord Plean&aacute;la accepts it can do.  We have been speaking to chief executives of the local authorities, and I have also been talking to a great many councillors, to try to gain acceptance that, for a temporary period, we need to get things moving again.  It is in the interests of local authorities to deliver houses quickly in the areas where there is most pressure.  I am sorry if I sound a bit defensive but we have had this conversation over and over again in this Chamber and I think it is important that there is a fair reflection on what we are trying to do with this element of the legislation.</p></speech>

Two of my sisters live on flood plains.  One lives in fear every year because the water gets as far as her front door but has not yet crossed it.  The other watches it in a field behind her house, coming close to her.  There is no getting away from the fact that some of the zoning decisions were almost as criminal as were some of the planning decisions.</p> <p>What the Minister is trying to do here is genuinely good stuff.  He is trying to do something about housing and we want to support him.  At the same time there is a genuine concern on our part that we do not bypass the people who should have the local knowledge, the local councillors.  I will not dwell on the fees issue.  The Minister understands why we are making that point.  We are not trying to obstruct him but to assist him and to make sure the Bill passes smoothly over the next couple of days and that he can get on with the job he wants to do.  He should please not take our criticisms or comments as in some way politicising this.  It is genuinely trying to move things forward and to make sure that when this is all over and done with we will not be accused of dropping the ball on our side.</p></speech>

I am not sure how many are for developments of over 100 units.  The Minister might not have those figures to hand but I am sure several of them are.  The argument that the local authorities have been holding up the process still does not wash with me.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the lack of an appeal process and we have not touched on that but it is important to raise and discuss it.  To turn the argument on its head, most of the debate has been around the fact that An Board Plean&aacute;la will pass all of these applications very quickly but it may turn down applications for developments.  That happened in Connemara with the N59, where a decision was favoured by the local authorities, public representatives and communities but An Bord Plean&aacute;la turned it down.  People were dumbfounded and do not know why the decision was made.  There is no appeal process, so there has to be a new application.  This is a similar situation.  There may be a development that the local authority, public representatives, community and developer are in favour of but for some reason An Bord Plean&aacute;la may say "no".  There does not appear to be an appeal process in place.  How would an appeal be handled in that situation? </p></speech>

There are many aspects of this Bill that I would like to change and that I would do differently.  We have to consider the serious matter we are trying to address.  We are in the midst of a housing crisis and some of the issues being discussed are hair-splitting.  We come in here every morning for Commencement Debates and listen to people whinging and crying about housing and homelessness but if we want to address this, why not give it a push?  I know there are serious concerns, which I and everyone else here have talked about, but some of the stuff that is being repeated and rehashed here is not productive.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan, for example, has a great knowledge of planning issues and Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh was on a council for years.  Like others here, they understand the mechanisms of planning and how slow it is.  The Minister is trying to speed it up and bring in large sites that have not been in use or considered for planning because all these guys went bust.  At least if we have the planning for houses there is some chance they will be built.  We can squabble about many of the details as long as we want and hold up this Bill but it would be a very sad day if this Bill dies because it is timed out and many will have egg on their faces if that happens.</p></speech>

We have rehearsed some of the issues around fees for objections and so on.  We will do something on that.  There is a separate Bill wherein there are recommendations in that regard.  We will follow through on that.</p> <p>The question on the lack of appeal deserves an answer.  That goes for many sections in this legislation.  This provision only applies to large-scale housing developments because the majority - not all, as Senator Landy mentioned - of large-scale residential planning applications get appealed or objected to by someone at An Bord Plean&aacute;la level, and that is where an application ends up for final decision anyway.</p> <p>In this measure, we are trying to streamline a process whereby local authorities, through the local planning authority, effectively make a positive or negative recommendation, including on conditions, that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will then take into account as part of the nine-week pre-planning process before undertaking the formal assessment process to make a decision.  There is a built-in double check, as it were.  There is an initial recommendation and the formal assessment and decision.  There will be an opportunity for councillors to have their say during the pre-planning process and there will be an opportunity for them and the public to make an objection and observation when the formal planning assessment is being made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>We are trying to take a belt-and-braces approach, one that is not much different than a planning decision being made and then appealed, that is, it is formally examined twice.  Under this measure, a decision will be informally examined the first time and formally decided on in the second stage of the process so that we can have a statutory process that goes from consideration to decision within a 25-week period.</p> <p>I take the point about appeals.  Anyone who says that there is always the option for a judicial review is giving a nonsense answer.</p></speech>

Under a judicial review, one can merely legally challenge the fairness of the process, its consistency with legislation, etc.  I do not ever make that argument.</p> <p>There is a belt-and-braces approach being taken to the planning decision and there is a localised and intensive consultation process.  Even before that, there is a pre-consultation process with the local authorities that developers will have to be a part of.  If they are not, they will not get far in this process.  The nine-week and 16-week periods will follow.  It is like a planning decision process that arrives at a recommendation rather than a decision that goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for a formal assessment and decision.  Given the limited number of applications that we will receive, this approach gives the process credibility in terms of the integrity of decisions, but it is a temporary intervention in the planning system so as to allow for the developments that need to get moving in areas like Dublin, Galway, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and, to a certain extent, Kilkenny, Clonmel and so on.  We need more ambition from developers, higher quality applications that can get through this process and a construction industry that starts building houses for people again.</p> <p>Senators are right to raise concerns about appeals, but when they consider the detail of what is involved, they will see that there are two serious assessments of the planning application.  The first is at pre-application stage, which results in a planning authority making a recommendation.  Then there is a formal decision-making process through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Given the pressures that we are facing, this belt-and-braces approach is acceptable.</p></speech>

The process outlined in the amendment is already happening, in that members are briefed on some applications, taken through the drawings, told the rationale, etc.  A memo is taken by the planner in question.  I can speak for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the local authority with which I am familiar.  The suggestion is that minutes will be taken, but a council meeting of 40 members could last for hours.  How can the remarks of 40 people about different matters be represented?  The minutes must be approved at a further council meeting.  Many councils amend the minutes.  There is a great deal of debate.  Some councils are not even getting their ordinary business done.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's elected members have not been able to debate a motion or their own business in the council chamber for 12 months.  That is extraordinary, but it is a fact.  Councillors can be briefed on applications and those with an interest can make written submissions to the board.</p><p>There are two elements to this.  The Minister must tick a few boxes in terms of openness and transparency.  The amendment requires a statutory &quot;council meeting&quot; because many modern local authority meetings are webcast.  There is a public gallery and members of the public can attend and see the craft of politics, with elected representatives on the floor teasing out the issues.  That would be open and transparent.  The local and national media are allowed into every council meeting.  There would be oversight mechanisms for the public and people could engage in the process.  The Minister needs to strengthen oversight in this legislation, because that is one of its weaknesses.  We should increase the ability of elected members to do their work.  I will await the Minister's response on this matter and I am mindful of what he said about fees, but surely he could tell us what he is thinking about the latter.  He does not have to be tied to the idea.  Come on.  Get real.  He is talking about engagement at one level and-----</p></speech>

With respect, I have been working on legislation for much longer than the Senator.  We all need to be fair to the Minister.  As Senator Davitt stated, we are in this House expressing our concerns about the housing crisis on a daily basis.  This is but one measure in this legislation to deal with and streamline large-scale housing applications in large urban areas that are under the most pressure, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  That is from where the applications will most likely come.</p> <p>The Minister listened to the debate and indicated that he is willing to consider many of our concerns about engagement with councillors at an early point in the pre-planning stage so that their concerns, views or submissions can be taken into account by the CEOs and the executives of councils and, in turn, submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is a reasonable approach for the Minister to take.  He is listening to what Senators are saying.  However, we should not over-egg the pudding.  We should have respect for the system and the process.  We must be careful that we do not involve councillors in any way in decision-making relating to a planning application process.  After all, Ministers, Deputies or Senators cannot be involved in such processes.  We need to tread carefully.  We should involve councillors but, as I suggested earlier, the appropriate forum would be in terms of the municipal districts.  Where a large planning application is submitted, the councillors the relevant area would be called to a meeting, which would be minuted, where their observations and views could be submitted and then forwarded to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is a reasonable avenue that the Minister can take on this and he has indicated that he is willing to do so.  We should work with him.</p></speech>

As some of my colleagues who co-signed the amendment are not present to support it, I want to indicate our support for it.  It is a constructive amendment.  My concern - it is important that this be understood - related to the one-way dynamic of briefing.  As it has been described, however, if the briefing is going to take place at a full council meeting, there will be an opportunity for discussion.  I stress that it will be a discussion and not a decision.  It is not introducing a new obligation in terms of sign-off but that a briefing and an opportunity for discussion will be available to the public to engage with and see the information available.</p> <p>This is a reasonable amendment that would deal to some degree with the concern and discomfort about members of the public being able to see that their representatives work on these issues.  Houses will spring up, so to speak, and people will go to their local representatives to ask about that.  They should be able to see the information that is available to their public representatives and the feedback that might be given in a normal council session.  I do not believe that would delay the process unduly because I understand the Senator is not looking for a decision to be required, rather a briefing and a discussion.</p></speech>

If a development of over 100 houses has a large element of social housing, who will be responsible for its long-term maintenance?  Some councils take estates in hand or take responsibility for their management.  That incurs an ongoing cost to a local authority.  That is an element local councillors would be concerned about because it will impact on their future budgets.  Is there not an argument in favour of this type of meeting taking place so that local councillors can take into consideration the ongoing budgetary implications for them as a council of developments that are taking place?</p></speech>

The only issue is whether we have the wording right in terms of legal drafting and so on.  In fact, what is being sought in this amendment is less than what I was talking about doing earlier.  Essentially, it is stating that there will be a formal council meeting.  I presume it will be up to the council to decide the form of that in terms of whether it will be municipal districts or whatever.  Actually, there are no municipal districts in some cities, rather the equivalent of that.  It might be a special housing committee or something like that.  We need to get the terminology right to allow councils decide the appropriate mechanism for them, but there are a couple of principles on which this amendment is right.  First, it needs to be a public meeting so that the public in the gallery will have an opportunity to see the minutes being taken and who is saying what.</p> <p>Second, this is an opportunity to brief the elected members on the strategic housing development and the planning application.  I had proposed that we would go beyond that and also ensure that the views given would be reflected in the report to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I take the point about difficulty with that but what we do not want is to go through a process of approval of minutes and so on.  There is a danger that will delay the entire process.  We do not want motions on planning proposals formally coming from councillors, which would need to be debated with minutes taken, calling on the Minister to come before the council to explain policy or something like that.  This is a planning process and as in any planning process the councillors, particularly for large-scale applications such as these ones, need to know what is going in their area.  They deserve to be briefed comprehensively by the planning authority in their area.  Obviously, the conversation will be reflected in the report that goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>I am committed to this amendment.  If it would be helpful we can accept it today and look at amending it slightly, if the Senator wants to do that, or he may wish to withdraw it and allow us come forward with our own wording.  Either way, I am happy to support it.</p></speech>

This is an issue about responding to a genuine concern that has been outlined by many Members, particularly Senator Landy, who is not here now, to ensure that respect is given to local councillors in terms of ensuring that they know what is going on.  He has just come into the Chamber.</p> <p>One of the issues raised the last time we debated this was about the public having access to information on what is contained in planning applications.  Currently, if a local authority is considering a planning application, any member of the public can ask for the file to see what is going on in their area.  We are committed to ensuring that in any of these applications, if and when they go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the public will still be able to access the file to see what is going on because I understand the IT system that will allow people to do that online will not be in place for another six or eight months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2016&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the meantime we will have to make sure that a file physically exists in local authorities, for the public to be able to see it, if they want to make an observation or objection to Bord Plean&aacute;la during the process.

First, a statement of the number of strategic housing development applications that it has determined within the 16-week period specified in section 9 or such other period as has been prescribed under subsection (10).  Second, such other information as to the time taken to determine such matters as the Minister may direct.</p> <p>The revised subsection (12) proposed to be inserted into section 9 includes additional information to be included in the board's annual report.  In this regard the annual report will now have to specifically state the number of payments made by the board to applicants in accordance with the provisions in subsection (13) arising from a failure to decide on the strategic housing development application within the 16-week period specified in subsection (9), or such other period as may be prescribed under that subsection or subsection (10), together with the total amount paid by the board in such payments.   </p> <p>All of that is a technical way of saying that within the board's annual report there is a section in this Bill that requires An Bord Plean&aacute;la to pay a penalty if it does not make a decision within the statutory timeline outlined in the legislation.

First, to show that I am confident An Bord Plean&aacute;la will deliver.  Second, I wish to make it known publically that we are serious about delivering the targets that we have set in the legislation.  Otherwise we have deadlines with no consequence if they are not met and that is not credible.</p> <p>Amendment No. 17 relates to subsection (13) of section 9 that provides for where the board fails to make decisions on an application for permission for a strategic housing development within a 16-week period, as specified in subsection (9), or such other periods as may be prescribed under that subsection and becomes aware that it has so failed.  The board shall proceed to make the decision notwithstanding that the period has expired.  In such a situation the board shall pay to the applicant a sum equal to the lesser amount of &euro;10,000 or three times the fee paid by the applicant in respect of his or her application for permission. </p> <p>The amendment removes an incorrect reference in paragraph (d) in the prescribed fee for an application for permission for a strategic housing development.  Such fee will in fact be determined by the board subject to the approval of the Minister.  The amendment also substitutes an incorrect reference to the planning application fee paid to the planning authority in subsection (13)(d) and corrects this to refer to the planning application fee paid to the board.  The second amendment is a correction but both amendments refer to the consequences of not meeting the targets that have been set out in the legislation.</p></speech>

Is there recourse in law for the applicant besides a penalty?  I think the penalty is farcical.  Where will the board get the money?  It is no penalty to those who are now going to be charged in the special unit.   What happens if an applicant chooses to take legal action against the board for not making a decision within the prescribed period?  Has the Minister an opinion on the matter?  Has he received legal advices as to whether there is an avenue open for applicants to take a legal case against the board for not meeting the time stipulated?  Can he comment on the matter?  I do not know whether he has checked the matter with the Attorney General.</p></speech>

The board will go on to make its decision after the 16-week period, as outlined in this section, but there is a consequence in terms of the fine.</p> <p>The Bill also provides for a public consultation period if justified that will push the decision well past the 16-week period.  In the normal course of events, considering these applications, I am very confident that the board will have the resources to make a decision and will do so within the 16-week period.  It is important that there is some public consequence to the board not making a decision.  We have given a commitment to respond to an emergency situation and that is what we are doing with this legislation.</p> <p>The Senator is right that board members will not pay the money.  The money will be funded through my Department but the board will not want to see a fine paid.  It is important to have an incentive and I am confident that the board will meet the target.  The provision gives us a lot more credibility if there is a consequence.  I take the point made by the Senator.  The provision gives a bit of teeth to the requirement to make a decision within the timeframe outlined.  </p></speech>

For the purpose of further implementing EU Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, this section allows for a determination in advance of making a planning application as to whether an environmental assessment is required.  This involves screening for an environmental impact assessment in respect of a proposed development of a class specified in regulations made under section 176 of the 2000 Act.  The chapter also provides for EIA screening in respect of appropriate assessments, also required under the EU directive, to be carried out at the same time.</p> <p>This section followed a conversation with the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Se&aacute;n Canney, who is trying to streamline the planning and approval process for many of the flood relief projects that are needed in different parts of the country.  The question of whether an environmental impact assessment is actually required depends on the environmental complexity of the project and if it is not necessary we need to move ahead and get permission without having to go through what can be a lengthy EIA process.  It is a practical measure and, in the same way as I am trying to get housing moving, the Minister of State is trying to get flood relief projects, to which we have allocated a lot of money, to move through the system.</p></speech>

At the moment, councillors can amend or reject a Part 8 development through a normal vote at a council meeting.  For reasons which may not have been explained to us, the Minister is proposing to change this provision.  If the Minister gets his way the exercise by the elected members of a council will require a special majority of all members of the council, not simply a majority of those present at the meeting.  In circumstances are councillors were ill or otherwise unable to attend a particular meeting, this undermines the democratic operation of the council.  It tips the balance in favour of executive power and undermines the reserve function held by the elected members.</p></speech>
