I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Ireland has always played a part in international peace and stability missions.  The Department of Foreign Affairs currently has 11 Irish mission members seconded to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as part of the special monitoring mission to Ukraine.  They have been on this mission for the last seven years.  The 11 secondees receive no remuneration from the State.  Instead, they are paid a board and living allowance directly from the OSCE.  There are a number of problems with this.</p> <p>First, Ireland has the distinction of being the only state which does not pay its secondees in Ukraine.  For example, UK members are paid a salary on top of their board and living allowance.  For the last seven years, Irish secondees have been paid no salary and, therefore, have made no PRSI contributions.  When they return to Ireland, they will have a major gap in their PRSI contributions with all the attendant consequences for accessing unemployment benefits and the State contributory pension later in their lives despite having been employed.  The Ukraine mission is considered a high-risk mission and while an additional small daily stipend is paid to Irish secondees by the OSCE for those in very high-risk areas, the Irish State pays nothing.</p> <p>Second, members of the mission have been trying to raise this issue with the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs since 2016 and no answers have been forthcoming apart from stating that it was under review.  It beggars belief that it has taken the best part of five years to make such a decision.  We are either going to pay them or not.  The very least the State could do would be to dignify their question with an answer.  The case submitted in 2016 had the support of both the ambassador and the assistant secretary general in the Department.  I am aware the case was submitted by Ambassador O&rsquo;Leary to the Secretary General and the Minister on 4 November 2016.  Subsequently, the case was submitted to the management board meeting of the European neighbourhood and policy division, ENP, on 11 July 2017.  This made a very reasonable suggestion that monitors be given a payment of either &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 per month, to a maximum of 12 monitors.  The case provided a detailed rationale for a payment, including how out of step Ireland was compared with other EU and non-EU counterparts.  I have heard anecdotally that the Department of Foreign Affairs believes there may be a legal issue in ring-fencing payments to this cohort, but other nations do not have the same problem.</p> <p>Third, I have a very serious concern about the lack of support being given to these secondees who remained in place on the mission during the most serious pandemic this world has ever seen.  I find it upsetting that no one from the Department of Foreign Affairs contacted these Irish citizens at any stage over the last two years to see whether they were okay.  Again, this contrasts sharply with the experience of mission operatives from other states, who received high-level or direct engagement from the sponsoring authorities in their countries of origin.  This included being contacted during the pandemic regarding their safety, as well as directly arranging their repatriation.  I cannot imagine how these loyal and faithful Irish people feel when their international colleagues were treated so well by their countries, while all the Irish team received was a deafening silence.  We are very quick to say how proud we are of those who represent this country overseas on peacekeeping and stability missions, but it would appear we are not so quick to treat them with the common decency and respect they deserve.  We should, as a nation, be ashamed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

My officials are making arrangements to have some brought here as soon as possible.</p> <p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir as an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a ard&uacute; i dtosach an tsu&iacute; inniu.</p> <p>The issue of remuneration or benefits for Irish citizens working for the OSCE special monitoring mission to Ukraine is under review by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I expect that a conclusion will be reached this year.  Currently ten Irish citizens are working in the special monitoring mission to the Ukraine.  Ireland contributes directly to the OSCE and the OSCE special monitoring mission budgets but, like many OSCE participating states, we do not offer additional payment packages to Irish citizens directly recruited and employed by the OSCE.  </p> <p>Irish citizens can apply for two categories of overseas positions.  Contracted positions offer salaries and other allowances and benefits that are similar to those offered under the UN Common System.  The other category of post includes payment from the OSCE of a boarding and lodging allowance, currently &euro;125 per day, and a package of life and disability insurance.  The employment is limited to the duration of the mission mandate and is renewed formally every year.  Some special monitoring mission members, that is, those serving in Donetsk and Luhansk Oblast, also receive an additional &euro;30 in hazard pay.  The OSCE covers the cost of travel from Vienna to field missions and travel expenses for a return trip home once per annum. </p> <p>The recruitment process is handled by the OSCE and Irish citizens have a clear choice of applying for contracted jobs or for positions that provide a less comprehensive package of allowances.  For those Irish citizens interested in working overseas, the Department and the EU jobs system provide many opportunities and a variety of potential positions.  The Department runs a rapid response core roster of highly skilled professionals deployed at short notice to humanitarian emergencies for a period of three to six months.  The Department also deploys Irish citizens to the EU Common Security and Defence Policy missions.  Those positions are remunerated with a stipend provided with an allowance living costs and reimbursed for a number of expenses.  </p> <p>Irish citizens applying for positions with the special monitoring mission to the Ukraine, or any other positions within the OSCE, have all the conditions of employment outlined prior to the application process.  The rules are transparent and the Department, when approached, is very clear about the lack of remuneration or allowances from it.  There are many different approaches taken by the OSCE participating States, ranging from comprehensive to more basic.  The majority of states pay nothing in addition to their citizens working for the OSCE and so there is no common approach from EU member states on this issue.  Nonetheless, the Department is once again considering possible ways of providing additional benefits to Irish citizens working for the OSCE special monitoring mission to Ukraine and will make a decision in that regard in the coming months.</p></speech>

He and I have often discussed PRSI and I know that he is committed on this issue.</p> <p>I ask that he has the decision expedited as quickly as possible.  I understand that people know what they are getting into when they sign up for these jobs, but they sometimes do not realise the full impact it will have on their future lives, particularly in regard to PRSI.  The Minister of State has given a commitment to see to it that a decision is made.  I appreciate his time on this matter and I thank him for coming to the House today to address it.  He might contact my office when he is made aware that a decision has been made.</p></speech>

A number of the affected people were in touch with me directly on my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  This month, I had a meeting with the OSCE Secretary General, Helga Schmid.  I was delighted to note that there a number of Irish people at senior level throughout that organisation.  It is an important organisation, with a lower profile than it should have.  </p> <p>The Senator mentioned a particular mission in the Ukraine.  We know how important and dangerous that can be.  The importance of the contribution of Irish citizens is widely recognised and the conditions of employment of these organisations vary.  I have been contacted by some of the individuals affected and they have informed me that the conditions of work may not be satisfactory or competitive.  This matter is being reviewed.  I am confident that a decision will be taken in the coming months.</p></speech>

As long ago as 2018, the probability of the Drimnagh primary care centre was being mooted and referenced in published articles.  In December 2019, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and Minister of State, Catherine Byrne, announced the primary care centre for Drimnagh on the site of the Mother McAuley Centre and they projected a timeline of final design in 2020, with construction to commence in 2021.  I accept that in the meantime all of our lives and everything about us was hijacked by Covid.  However, primary care centre is overdue for the community of Drimnagh.  They welcomed that it was to be located locally and that they would have a focus and place to go to where all of their healthcare needs could be met.  The demand for this centre still exists.  The population of Drimnagh is large.  As I speak, there are hundreds of apartments under construction in the Drimnagh area, with many more in the planning process, all of which will increase that population.  Any delay to the provision of the primary care centre will have a major impact on their lives.  A primary care centre is part of the necessary and integral provision of services, infrastructure and supports within any community.  </p> <p>The facilities that were promised for the Mother McAuley Centre were to be located on the site of the demolished HSE health centre.  The proposal includes a rebuild of the Alzheimer's unit, a community centre and cr&egrave;che and the construction of a state-of-the-art primary care centre.  Last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, brought us up to date on the significant strides forward in dealing with the long waiting lists in the provision of care to children with additional and special needs.  Primary care centres are necessary to her plans and the plans under the programme for Government in addressing the needs of children.  If the Drimnagh primary care centre is not built, speech and language services, and services for all of the other multidisciplinary therapies that are required for children prior to going to school, will be delayed.  In our major steps forward, there will be a blackspot in primary care centre provision such that children will have to move outside their areas for service provision.  It is necessary that we move this project on as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Shortly after my appointment this time last year, I wrote to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, seeking an update on this matter.  It is a big deal and an urgent need in the Drimnagh community.  I wrote to him in July and I received a reply at the end of September.  The reply confirmed that the project is on the books, but it also referenced the phrase, "it is a dynamic process".  I have had sleepless nights in relation to that phrase.  I understand Covid, but a dynamic process indicates to me that this is going to be stretched out for some time to come.  That is not okay.  This is an urgent need in the here and now.  </p> <p>The Minister of State representing the Minister.  I would appreciate an update on this matter.  The people of Drimnagh desperately need to hear it.</p></speech>

The primary care centre programme not only continues to be a key anchor in the longer term reform of the health sector, but also aligns with the objectives of Project Ireland 2040.  Primary care centres have a key role to play in delivering the vision for a reformed health service set out in Sl&aacute;intecare, by facilitating the shift from acute care to primary care and supporting the provision of a range of multidisciplinary services in local communities.  In this regard, it is important to note that primary care centres provide accommodation for services beyond those commonly identified as primary care, including: community mental health services; disability services, as the Senator indicated; environmental health services; accommodation for Tusla; ambulance rapid deployment points; and civil registration.</p><p>There are clear benefits in bringing healthcare professionals together to operate as a multidisciplinary team, out of a purpose-designed, well-equipped and high-quality modern facility.  They can act as a single point of access for the community to healthcare services and resources, while also becoming a focal point for local health initiatives.  A total of 14 primary care centres have been delivered by public private partnership.  Where appropriate accommodation is not available, new primary care centres are being procured through lease agreements and through Exchequer capital funding.  The majority of primary care centres will continue to be developed by means of operational leases.</p><p>Regarding the Senator's specific question, the Drimnagh primary care centre will be located on the existing site at Curlew Road.  Funding has been allocated to progress the appointment of a design team, and the tender process for the services of a design team has commenced.  Services to be provided include older persons day-care services alongside public health and community nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dietetics, and counselling.  These services will be integrated with the proposed on-site GP service and will provide an integrated service to the public under one roof.</p><p>At present, in order to meet the primary care needs of the local area it is the intention of the HSE to use the new Armagh Road, Crumlin primary care centre and the Rialto primary care centre, both of which are operational.  In addition, the Old County Road health centre and the Limekiln health centre will be retained as satellite units.  To reiterate, funding has been allocated to progress the appointment of a design team, and the tender process for the services of a design team has commenced.</p></speech>

I would appreciate it if she has any update on a timeline of when the people of Drimnagh can walk through the doors to go to see their GP and avail of the services which are crucial to the community there.</p> <p>There are extensive changes going on in Drimnagh.  A group representing all the residents' associations, which calls itself Dynamic Drimnagh, has fantastic ideas for the area.  In the context of the creation of Drimnagh village we may need a complementary service to complement the primary care centre.  There is probably room for discussion with the group in the near future.  I am delighted with the news and any update on a timeline would be really appreciated.</p></speech>

In fairness, she pointed to Covid and the challenges we have had.  I do not have a specific timeline or dates but Senator Seery Kearney will appreciate the importance of the fact that the funding has been allocated to progress the appointment of the design team and that the tender process for the service has commenced.</p> <p>The construction programme for primary care centres will continue throughout the period of the national development plan.  We all know what an important role they play in communities.  The HSE has been successful in developing a network of primary care centres.  We now have 142 primary care centres operational throughout the country.  In line with national requirements of appraisal, design, planning, tender and construction, this programme will continue into the future, including the development of a primary care centre in Drimnagh, as I have outlined.</p></speech>

We saw that the leaving certificate classes of 2020 and 2021 both experienced enormous difficulties.  It was through the leadership of the Department and the Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, that we were able to reach an accommodation.  I pay tribute in particular to the work of the Irish Second-Level Students Union which engaged very closely with the Minister and her officials in a spirit of collaboration in order to reach an accommodation for this year's leaving certificate.  Well done to all of those who managed to survive this year.</p> <p>Those who were in fifth year last year experienced significant disruption.  A lot of students are concerned about the fact that the curriculum may not be covered by the end of the year.  Even though teachers made valiant efforts to cover the course remotely, some students had difficulty being online all of the time due to insufficient broadband and home environments may not have been supportive.  The online learning experience is not as good as that in the classroom.</p> <p>It is important that there is clarity as soon as possible and certainty that the students who will sit the leaving certificate next year know what they will face over the academic year 2021-22.  They require clarity on what is happening with the leaving certificate next year, what allowances might be made and what supports will be put in place for students.  Will there be adjustments to the exam?  I am aware that the Department is in discussions on this matter.  The hallmark of the Department's engagement to date has been to place students at the centre of this process and to ensure that the welfare and education of students is to the fore.  They have lost out on a hell of a lot, including aspects of their education.  As legislators, we have an obligation to try to ensure that they are supported in whatever way we can during their leaving certificate year, but in particular that they have clarity on the type of exam they will face and what supports and allowances will be made.</p> <p>I am very conscious that the Government has expanded the number of places in higher education and also in apprenticeships, which means that for the leaving certificate classes of 2021 and 2022 there are more post second-level school opportunities than ever before.  However, the Minister of State will understand the enormous worries that those who are entering into sixth year now face, having lost out on so much over the past year.  I hope certainty will be provided this summer before those students go back to class in September so that they and their teachers know what they will face in the following academic year.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for raising this very important issue.  As he is aware, this is a matter under the remit of the Minister for Education.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She is acutely aware of the disruption caused to students as a result of school closures resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.  From 11 January 2021 until their return to school all students, including fifth year students who are due to sit their leaving certificate examinations in 2022, engaged in a programme of remote learning with their schools.  The public health restrictions which resulted in the closure of schools in March 2020 highlighted the absolute necessity for schools to be agile in providing for continuity of schooling in the future.  <br/><br/>As a contingency measure against the possibility of partial or full school closures, the Department of Education provided a suite of guidance materials, agreed with the education partners to enable schools to mediate the curriculum safely for all students in a Covid-19 context.  These materials are available at <i>www.gov.ie/backtoschool. </i>They include information on well-being supports, coping with uncertainty and managing stress and anxiety, which have been developed by the National Educational Psychological Service to support students.  <br/><br/>The webpage has links to more individualised supports for students to access, should these be needed.  The Department also worked with the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure the most appropriate services and resources are clearly signposted for students.  These resources are updated regularly and provide links to a number of other support websites for students and young people. <br/><br/>The nature of distance learning which was necessitated during the unprecedented closure of schools last year and early this year required educators to take on a range of approaches to support their pupils' continuity of leaming during that period.  Schools and teachers demonstrated great innovation in adapting to the situation in using digital technologies and online learning platforms for teaching and learning. <br/><br/>Extensive guidance and supports have been made available by the Department and its support services to support schools to plan for the transition to online and remote learning.  As part of a circular issued by the Department, it became a requirement for schools to have in place a communication-learning platform that supports them to respond in the event of a partial or full school closure in the future, including the facilitation of live or recorded video lessons where practicable.<br/><br/>As I say, there are a number of different elements to this guidance.  I have to say to the Senator also that I have a personal interest in this matter as my own son is doing his leaving certificate in 2022 and he is in fifth year at present.  He has already started the senior cycle and the fact that the national advisory group is meeting tomorrow on this and other issues is very important.  The advisory group I expect will make recommendations based on the loss of learning and I note all of the comments made by the Senator in respect of the students being placed at the centre of this process and many of them - and I have seen this with my son and his schoolfriends - have lost motivation and confidence.  Those who struggle and have had difficulty in particular subjects have found it extraordinarily difficult to catch up.  Indeed, whether the curriculum will be finished or not is something that will be considered by the Department.  I am comforted, however, by what the Minister for Education has said in this regard and the fact that the advisory group is meeting tomorrow.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas.</p></speech>

I obviously wish her son and the 60,000 other students who are going into leaving certificate year the very best in the year ahead.  I know that the advisory group is meeting and that there is student input but the earlier that certainty can be provided to that student group, the better.</p> <p>There has been, as the Minister of State has rightly pointed out, a great deal of anxiety.  Students have felt that they have lost out on aspects of the curriculum.  It is going to be difficult to get the motivation back and some have have learned in a different way.  </p> <p>I appreciate that there are many complex issues here and that schools have been doing their best but it is very important that before the academic year starts students are informed about the exact supports that will be in place and what will happen in 2022, and that they are consulted throughout this process.

The fact that there has been a detrimental effect on fifth year students means that we very much need that clarity as soon as possible, preferably before the school term starts in September.  As you know, fifth year is the start of the senior cycle.  I have seen my son and his friends struggle with the amount of months of the senior cycle that they have missed.  They are asking me on a daily basis what is happening and whether we know if accommodation is going to be made for the leaving certificate next year.  The fact that we have student representatives on the advisory group is a good thing, along with parents, teachers and other groups.  All of that will feed into making the proper decision that is required in this instance during these unprecedented times.</p> <p>Again, I extend my best wishes to all the leaving certificate students finishing up today.</p></speech>

Indeed, it has provided an income floor to farmers across the country through its supports and many farms would not survive without farm payments .</p> <p>Ireland has unique farm systems.  It has farms that are small, mixed, large and intensive, arable, grassland, hill and commonage, and with designated and Natura 2000 lands.  The challenges presented by a new CAP to satisfy all of these various farm types was and is immense.  At the heart of demands for reform were fairness, quality and viability.  Farm organisations such as the Irish Farmers Association faced a difficult balancing act as the issue of convergence raised concerns about farm viability.  The Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association were supportive of full convergence.  All of this in the context of convergence means a redistribution of moneys within the farming sector.  For those farmers who will win, there will, of course, also be farmers who will lose.</p> <p>A deal had been reached at the Council of Ministers that will go before the European Parliament for ratification.  I ask today that the details of what has been agreed be set out on the floor of the Seanad.  The negotiations up to this have recognised the increasing and correct demands by society for a greener CAP, a  more climate-friendly farming model, that the value of carbon-rich soils such as such peatlands be recognised, for eco-schemes and green interventions.  It is important that while peatlands have been rightly recognised as carbon stores, they continue to be seen as a crucial part of eligible farmland.  There were concerns in the run-up to these negotiations that peatlands would be discontinued or be ineligible as farm areas.  That could not happen and I acknowledge the work of the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association for their work on highlighting that and the work of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, for his interventions on that.</p> <p>I also welcome the income of &euro;60,000 that has been agreed as part of these negotiations.  This is important in recognising that CAP is not just about supporting larger farmers and that putting a cap in place will set a tone and a bar as to payments.  It will also recognise that farms are of various land types, quality and sizes across the country and the new CAP has recognised, to a degree, the importance of redistribution, convergence and providing a basic payment for all farmers irrespective of the challenges they may face.  It also recognises the unique role that our commonage, hill, disadvantaged, Natura 2000 and protected lands play in society.  If one looks at the range of areas, from blanket bogs to the unique landscape of the Burren, these are all recognised as part of a new CAP.  These supports are important to protect farm viability in these areas and to keep farmers on the land.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Perhaps that is not recognised.  Without farmers, the Burren would not be the Burren.  Without farmers, our blanket bogs in Connemara or elsewhere would not be as they are.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Kyne for raising this important issue.  I am pleased to announce that after three years of negotiation, a final political agreement on the main elements of the next Common Agricultural Policy was agreed by the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday.  This has been a long and challenging negotiation.  The overall agreement will provide member states with flexibility to take account of national circumstances as they implement the new Common Agricultural Policy.</p> <p>It has been clear that the next Common Agricultural Policy would aim to support farmers undertaking greater environmental actions.  Some 25% of the direct payment envelope will now be dedicated to eco-schemes.  These schemes will support farmers to undertake additional environmental actions.  Work is under way on the preparation of these proposals and for Ireland, a key objective will be to create eco-schemes that will engage as many farmers as possible to effectively deliver environmental change.  There will be new conditionality requirements including a good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, for the protection of wetlands and peatlands, as the Senator referred to.  Ireland has been clear throughout the negotiations that the standards to be set for GAEC 2 cannot prohibit agricultural activity on these lands and I am pleased to state we have secured this in the final text.  Member states will be able to define their national standards for each GAEC, tailoring them to specific local needs and characteristics.  Ireland's Pillar 2 measures already include a high level of support for environmental actions and this is expected to continue in the next CAP.  Farmers have clearly demonstrated their desire to undertake such actions and they will be offered appropriately designed schemes.</p> <p>The Commission's original proposal included a number of redistribution elements and the European Parliament equally has strongly supported compulsory redistribution.  This is a complex issue and the farming bodies have different views on it.  Under the next CAP, a set redistribution of 10% has been proposed.  The proposal agreed will also allow member states to consider if there are other ways of achieving the redistribution needs identified nationally and to demonstrate this in the national CAP strategic plan.  This type of flexibility is important.  We need to have time to consider this complex issue nationally.</p> <p>The proposals will also provide member states with broad flexibility to implement capping of payments.  Ireland has sought greater flexibility in this regard throughout the negotiations.  The proposals provide for 100% capping for any payments above &euro;100,000 and for the ability to further reduce any payments above &euro;60,000.</p> <p>The process of internal convergence which exists in the current CAP will continue bringing every farmer up to a level of 85% of the national average entitlement value.  Young farmers will continue to be supported under the next CAP.  An amount equal to 3% of the direct payment envelope will be allocated to support them.  Ireland already provides considerable national support for young farmers through the taxation system which provides strong support for transfers and farm partnerships.</p> <p>Under the new CAP, farmers and other beneficiaries receiving direct payments who do not implement proper employment conditions as set out in the relevant EU legislation may be subject to an administrative penalty.  This is the first time that EU agricultural legislation will include a social dimension.  In reality, very few Irish farmers employ external labour and there will be a two-year lead-in period before commencement to allow for implementation of the new proposals.</p> <p>The new CAP will also change to a more performance-based model.  There will be a greater emphasis on the results and outcomes from the expenditure and this will bring greater clarity with regard to the considerable achievements of the CAP policy.  For some time, especially as we move forward with the preparation of the national CAP strategic plan, we have been engaged in a process of intensive national consultation.  This will continue and intensify as we develop our plan.  It is vital to have this national engagement.  I believe that farmers are ready and willing to engage.  It will be our job to explain all of the new possibilities for farmers and to encourage them to participate in the new schemes in the next CAP.  I believe that all parts of the farming community will be ready to participate in this debate in an open and transparent way.  The market and consumers want farming and food production to meet higher environmental and climate expectations and the next CAP will be ready to help farmers with this challenge.</p></speech>

It is a significant change from what farmers have been used to over the last years.  I have concerns about the design of the eco-schemes.  It is important that no farmers are left outside that.  There were concerns about the recent results-based environment agri pilot programme, REAP, which excluded commonage and Natura land.  It is important that any eco-scheme does not discriminate against those.  They have every right and provide much more biodiversity that should be rewarded as part of an eco-scheme.  I welcome and acknowledge the work on peatlands because there was significant concern that peatlands which have been actively farmed would be excluded from being eligible for payment.  Due to the work of Government, that has been changed.  I acknowledge the work of the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, on that issue.  I thank the Minister of State for his reply.</p></speech>

I have had positive engagement with the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, most recently during a visit to Connemara.  There is acceptance and willingness to participate in schemes that will benefit biodiversity in particular.  We have set highly ambitious targets for nature in the EU biodiversity strategy.  Farming communities are willing to play their part in that.</p> <p>The Senator referred to the Burren.  The work being done by Brendan Dunford and the BurrenLIFE programme have been instrumental in informing results-based payment schemes that will be part of the design of the next CAP strategic plan.  I am confident that we will achieve a high level of protection of nature and good results-based schemes for farmers in the west of Ireland and right across the country.</p></speech>

My county is impacted both with regard to employment and those who used the bog as a source of fuel for their homes.  We were happy when Kildare was one of the counties where the retrofitting pilot project was to be rolled out.  Eligible residents in four different parts of Kildare, in local authority estates, were chosen for this roll-out.  Their homes were to be retrofitted to increase their energy efficiency.  That would reduce costs associated with heating their homes.</p> <p>There has been significant frustration with the first programme rolled out in my home town of Rathangan.  Residents are incredibly disappointed that the retrofitting programme they were promised is not the one that they are receiving.  Originally, a commitment was made to residents that the funding would support retrofitting, including the replacement of windows and doors which, in this housing estate, which is not new, would be important for energy efficiency.  The residents have now been told by Kildare County Council that the funding for the scheme is not sufficient to fulfil those commitments.  The fact that the doors and windows are now not included in the scheme has seen interest in the scheme fall by one third.</p> <p>We all know that draughty windows and doors are a significant source of heat loss.  It does not make sense to retrofit a home, cause significant inconvenience to the family living there by turning their home upside-down, and then leave the old doors and windows in place.  This fund was made available to people through the just transition.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is vital that the programme is delivered as promised and that the scheme meets the expectation of all of the residents within the particular housing estates that were chosen for it.</p><p>Will the Minister of State clarify who is responsible for the inconsistency?

The scheme in that area was the first to be put in place.  It is also about those in Derrinturn and Athy in County Kildare.  Will the Department fully engage with Kildare County Council to ensure the promises made to the people of Rathangan and to the residents of the three other schemes are fully delivered?</p></speech>

The midlands retrofit pilot project is an important part of the just transition programme, which needs to be facilitated in the context of Bord na M&oacute;na's exit from peat and the direct impact that is having on the midlands.</p> <p>The counties that were most affected by reductions in peat harvesting were included in the programme, namely, the eight counties of Kildare, Offaly, Westmeath, Longford, Laois, Roscommon, Tipperary and Galway. As part of the just transition proposals for the midlands, budget 2020 provided an additional &euro;20 million to fund energy efficiency upgrades to local authority houses in the affected midland counties.  The pilot scheme was focused on ensuring the energy efficiency upgrade of a minimum of 750 local authority homes in the midlands.  It prioritised the upgrading of larger batches of homes in distinct, compact geographical areas and sought to build on the heretofore shallow retrofit programme in which local authorities were engaged in a deeper retrofit to achieve a B2-cost optimal building energy rating, BER, and promote the use of heat pumps where appropriate.</p> <p>My Department worked with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, the national retrofit task force and the relevant local authorities on the design and roll-out of the pilot programme.  Unfortunately, the programme was interrupted by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  That was further exacerbated by the shutdown of construction in 2020 and the further shutdown in the early months of 2021.  With the lifting of the construction shutdown, the pilot programme is now back on track and the expectation is that the targeted minimum of 750 local authority homes for retrofit under the pilot programme will be completed in 2021.</p> <p>As of now, four homes have been completed, a further 60 are on site, 217 are at contract award stage and 373 are at tender stage.  The remaining homes are under survey.  In respect of County Kildare specifically, 91 local authority homes are being progressed for retrofitting.  The schedule of eligible works under the programme includes the replacement of windows and external doors where it is required to achieve the required heat loss indicator and to ensure the home is heat pump ready and can achieve a BER rating of B2-cost optimal.  All decisions on the homes selected for the programme or the works to be completed on each home are a matter for the relevant local authority.</p> <p>I give a commitment that we will engage with Kildare County Council specifically on this issue.  I have the schedule of works with me, which commits to the replacement of windows and doors, as required, to bring the homes up to a BER of B2.</p></speech>

He mentioned the delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, which are completely understandable.  I accept his Department will engage with Kildare County Council on the matter. The Minister of State mentioned the 750 local authority homes in the midlands across the eight counties included in the programme.  If a third of participants have dropped out, as we have seen in the area of Rathangan, then only 500 local authority homes will be part of the programme.  The Minister of State noted that in Kildare, 91 local authority homes are being processed for retrofitting.  With the dropouts, what figure is reduced to 60.  That is not good for a pilot project.</p> <p>The Minister of State has spoken of trying to achieve a B2 BER.  That is not going to happen if windows and doors are not replaced.  I take on board the Minister of State's point that the Department is fully committed to replacing doors and windows.  There is an anomaly, because Kildare County Council is asserting the Department has capped the funding and it will not be able to replace doors and windows.  However, the Minister of State has stated today that according to the Department, the replacement of doors and windows is very necessary.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State come back to me after he was engaged with Kildare County Council and update me on the results of that engagement?  It is vitally important, not just for this project but for all of the other projects, that there is an effective and efficient roll-out.  I hope we see also a roll-out of grants for retrofitting in respect of private homes.</p></speech>

I have stated that the replacement of windows and doors, airtightness and the taping of sealant to windows is part of the programme.</p> <p>The issue needs to be resolved between my Department and Kildare County Council.  It is our objective to achieve the maximum level of participation possible if we are to meet our climate targets and to deal with issues of fuel poverty throughout the country and the just transition programme.  It is vitally important we achieve maximum participation of households in the scheme.  I also confirm to the Senator that grant schemes will be announced for private dwellings later as part of this programme.  It is vitally important we get it right.  I will take the points raised by the Senator back to the Department and seek a response.</p></speech>

Senator Chambers and I raised this issue on the Order of Business and the Leader suggested that we jointly raise a Commencement matter.  I am representing both of us.  I know the issue is one Senator Chambers feels passionately about for her own county of Mayo.  For me, it is about climate, the economy of the north west and joined-up thinking on transport.</p> <p>I believe, fundamentally, that we can have a rail link and a greenway that goes along the western rail track.  I ask the Minister of State to seek to progress phases 2 and 3 of the western rail corridor development.  The most recent report on this project, authored by Dr. Bradley, is 200 pages long.  I hope the Minister of State has read it.  I am sure he has.  The report has highlighted many discrepancies and inaccuracies in the EY report on the western rail corridor that was commissioned by the Department.  West on Track, a group of volunteers from counties Galway and Mayo, looked at the EY report in February, as the Minister of State might recall.  The group found there were 324 numerical errors, 31 typos and 23 errors of fact, some of which were very serious, in the report.  The latest report by Dr. Bradley shows that the capital costs of the reopening are 50% lower than those quoted in the EY report.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State outline what the Department is going do to on this issue and how we can move forward?  The development of western rail corridor is not just about how many people are there currently.  It is fundamentally about taking a transport-first and town-centre-first approach to planning.  The transport needs to be put in place to deliver the planning and development the Government wants.  It is very much Green Party policy that if there is rail and that rail is viable, it should be developed first.  Otherwise, we will see a continuation of sprawl, which we do not want.</p> <p>I know the Department is putting funding into the double-tracking of the Athenry to Galway rail link.  The western rail corridor would link that double-tracking with Claremorris and the Mayo-Dublin line.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From many points of view, therefore, this is important.  It is important to the economy because tourists come to Galway.  How do we move them up to the north west?  We have three regions in this country, and the north west is the only one that is designated as a region in transition economically by the EU.  The other two regions are seen as doing very well economically and the north west is not.  Many will disagree with how well some of the regions are doing, but this is a European standard.  If we want to get the industry and the tourism, we have to put in place the infrastructure.  Quite apart from that, this report showed there would be 5.5 million km less in road trips per annum by 2030.  Therefore, from a climate point of view, we would see a reduction in the number of cars.  We would also see a 2.8 million km per annum reduction in HGV traffic because that line could take a lot of haulage.</p><p>I would love the hear what the Minister of State will say about this, how the Department will rectify the errors and the moving forward with phases two and three.</p></speech>

As Senator O'Reilly quite rightly said, this is about town centres, sustainable transport, balanced regional development and tackling climate change.  This is an important matter.</p> <p>As the Senators will be aware, the Minister is a firm believer in the positive potential of increased and expanded sustainable mobility options, whether walking, cycling, bus or rail.  The Senators referred to a new report on the western rail corridor, a copy of which I understand the Minister received in the past few days.  This report is the third such report published this year on the corridor, although it is the first produced by those campaigning for a reopening of the line between Athenry and Claremorris.  As one might reasonably expect from a campaign group, the report is positive about the potential reopening and the benefits it might bring.</p> <p>As I said, this third report on the western rail corridor was published this year.  The first report was the EY report referred to by the Senators.  That report was commissioned by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and conducted by EY consultants with the assistance of specialist engineering experts.  It was commissioned in line with the decision of the previous Government and was a financial and economic appraisal of the potential reopening of phases two and three of the western rail corridor.  I understand there have been some criticisms of the EY report, as Senator O'Reilly stated, particularly by those campaigning for a reopening of the western rail corridor, who, in turn, commissioned this most recent report in response.  However, there was, in fact, an independent review commissioned by the Department of Transport upon its receipt of the EY report and prior to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, bringing the issue to the Government last December.  The second report, known as the JASPERS review, was carried out by the agency known as JASPERS, which was established by the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to assist member states in making investments in European regions such as the west of Ireland.  The JASPERS review concluded that the findings of the EY report were not unreasonable.  Specifically, as regards the projected cost and demand, the areas of the EY report that have been criticised by this new report, the review found them to be within reasonable ranges, although perhaps based on a design solution and an operational plan that might be considered overly optimistic.</p> <p>More important than that, however, are the four key observations of the JASPERS review which are fundamental to the future development or otherwise of the western rail corridor and indeed our rail network generally.  The JASPERS review noted that the proposed reopening of the western rail corridor did not address any identified social or transport constraint, did not fit with any broader strategic framework for the development of rail in Ireland, did not contribute towards our climate action challenge and would not attract EU funding in its present form.  In response to these issues, the Minister has committed to an all-island strategic rail review to examine all aspects of inter-urban and inter-regional rail on the island of Ireland, including lines such as the western rail corridor.  The review will also consider where it might be appropriate for high-speed or higher speed rail on the network.  In addition, it will examine the role of rail and freight and how best to decarbonise Intercity and inter-regional rail services.  It is this strategic rail review that will provide the strategic framework for the development of rail in Ireland, identify the social and transport constraints that rail can help to address, set out how to move towards net-zero railway in the future and ensure that our rail investments are fully aligned with EU policy in this area.  I understand the review will commence very shortly, and the Minister looks forward to its completion.</p></speech>

The main issue I have with the EY report, which he has outlined in part, is on what premise it looked at the western rail corridor.  Fundamentally, public transport is about a public good, and that is what the reopening of the western rail corridor and the advancement of phases two and three are about.  This is about a public good, a social good and a benefit to the planet.  We need not necessarily to put aside all economic constraints but we do need to look at transport as being not about how much money we can bring in but about how much of an economic development, quite apart from the line itself, will be brought about by putting in place this rail line.  It is not necessarily always about the number of passengers but rather the number of passengers the line will bring in and deliver in the future.  It is also, as I said, about how many fewer car journeys we can expect from this line.  I look forward to the review.  I hope the Minister will engage more on this over the coming months.</p></speech>

I am of the view, as is the Minister, that the strategic rail review will be conducted on an all-island basis, will identify those needs the Senator has spoken about and will be carried out with the support of the Northern Ireland Executive to provide a much more holistic overview of what is required.  It will seek to address the shortcomings identified in the JASPERS review and will mean that individual projects put forward later for consideration can be linked back to a strong strategic framework.  Importantly, it will also identify how we will move our inter-urban and inter-regional rail services off fossil fuels and towards a decarbonised future, as we must do by 2050.  It will also examine the potential role of freight rail, which the Senator mentioned and which is critical.  The points made about balanced regional development towards that social gain that will be accrued from having an expanded rail network in Ireland are critical.  I am confident that the review being carried out by the Minister will seek and identify those objectives, particularly for the west.</p></speech>

For those non-Japanese speakers of which I am one, that is basically &ldquo;Hello, how are you?&rdquo; in Japanese.  That is to mark today which is the last day of the leaving certificate in 2021.  Japanese is the last exam subject to be taken.  It has been a difficult and arduous year for those leaving certificate students.  They have shown terrific resilience throughout the last 18 months.  They deserve not our gratitude, but our best wishes for what lies ahead of them.  There are two important dates for them which I want to mention, namely, 1 July 2021 the last day for a change of mind for the Central Applications Office, CAO and 8 July 2021 the last day for Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, applications.</p><p>On what they have to look forward to, we were all taken aback when we heard what NPHET proposed to Government.  Indeed, the Government has a difficult task ahead in regard to its Cabinet meeting today.  I immediately thought of those young people doing their leaving certificate and those who were looking forward to jobs in hospitality during the summer.</p><p>If we implement what NPHET recommends, what about all of those young people who were hoping to have jobs in hospitality?  Will they be able to get those jobs, if it is insisted that only those who are fully vaccinated can avail of indoor dining, hospitality, and entertainment?  If that is the case, we need to look at bringing the vaccination programme forward for our young people, so that they can avail of the summer work they need and indeed the hospitality industry needs hen it has the opportunity to reopen.  We wish them well.</p><p>I want to raise the issue of the 200,000 vacant homes in Ireland.  I congratulate Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, on the work he has carried out on voids with local authorities.  However, more needs to be done on vacant homes.  One way we can do that is by including second-hand homes in the first-time buyers' grant.  We know the importance of the first-time buyers' grant but it is only for new buildings.  That is wrong and we need to change it.  We also need to change it for couples are divorced and who may not be able to avail of this.</p><p>The last item I want to mention is the national peatlands project I mentioned last week on the Order of Business.  This week I want to mention a pending application for planning from Bord na M&oacute;na for exactly the same area.  It is for 50 wind turbines at 220 m in height.  This is in an area through which we are bringing the blueway.  We have Lullymore Heritage and Discovery Park and the Umeras peatland park is coming up.Bord na M&oacute;na is talking about introducing this in an area where two private companies have put in for planning permissions and have been turned down.  The people in the Rathangan area are not going to roll over and accept this.  We are going to fight this with every bit of our being.</p></speech>

He has been fair, fun and approachable and I can ask for no more.</p><p>I want to raise the matter of Farmleigh estate.  Farmleigh estate has 78 acres at the edge of Phoenix Park.  The house accommodates dignitaries when they come to visit, but the grounds are open to the public.  Last year, I was able to convince the Office of Public Works, OPW, to extend the opening hours from the gates opening at 10 a.m. with last entrance at 5 p.m. and the gates closing at 6 p.m.  I was able to get it to extend those hours because of Covid-19.  We are working from home and stuck at home and our outdoor spaces have never been more important.  However, our outdoor spaces are still and will remain important.</p><p>I ask the OPW to facilitate keeping the gates of Farmleigh open as part of the outdoor summer again this year and maybe even going forward.  Since May, I have been working on this.  I have faced some resistance from the officials in the OPW.  I have now raised it with the Minister of State with responsibility for Office of Public Works and the Department of the Taoiseach, as they are both stakeholders.  I hope there can be some movement on that.  I know there are issues of rotas and of security, but those things can be overcome.</p><p>There is welcome news for people who have been planning their weddings for July.  They will be able to go ahead with 50 people.  I ask that there is clarity as soon as possible for couples who are due to be married in August.  They are going through the same angst.  I recognise this is a worrying morning for the hospitality sector, which is bearing the brunt of restrictions.  However, let this be a reminder that we still do not have specific sectoral guidelines for weddings.  They are tucked in under the reopening of hotels and bed and breakfasts.  Anyone who has gotten married will tell you that there is much more to a wedding than a hotel and bed and breakfast, if at all, because so many people get married in other venues.  At the moment, couples and planners are sifting through different guidelines, whether for churches or for other ceremonies and on whether one can having singing or music.  In hospitality, do the same rules apply around tables of six?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Hotels versus marquees is a big question.  Do the same restrictions apply?  What are guidelines and what are rules?  From talking to people, there is variance in their interpretation of the rules.  Given the precarious position we are in and that weddings today are getting the green light for July and that this is one day in people's lives, this needs clarity.  The last thing anybody wants is that a wedding turns into a super-spreader event and that could have a knock-on effect for all the other couples and suppliers dependent on these events.</p></speech>

While we are engaging in a bogus debate about the non-existent future influence of the Religious Sisters of Charity and procedures at a future national maternity hospital, the negligence, and the heartlessness of the existing secular medical establishment has been very much on show but received practically no comment in these Houses.  I am referring, of course, to the tragedy of the death of Christopher Kiely as a result of a misdiagnosis of trisomy 18 and negligence by the National Maternity Hospital and the Merion Fetal Health Clinic.  People were warned about the possibilities of such medical mishaps but contrast Christopher's tragic death with the tragedy of what happened to Savita Halappanavar.  In that case, a mistake in the handling of her care gave others the opportunity to claim, wrongly, that it was an overly-restrictive law that had led to her death.  This is a case where a rushed, overly permissive, carelessly heartless and negligently applied law, cost a child his life and broke the heart of his parents.  One of the tragedies was the near operatic levels of certainty with which the consultant obstetrician in the case told the parents of Christopher, that there was no hope of survival after the initial chorionic villus sampling, CVS, test.  Then there was the misrepresentation of the confirmation of the eventual results when they said it was theoretically a small chance that he did not have trisomy 18.  The parents were left to find out for themselves just how obvious it was that he did not.  There were further outrages, including the lack of an apology and the profit motive of Merrion Fetal Health Clinic which offered a couple a discount if they took the initial harmony test on the same day at the scan.  There is also the fact that the guidelines, hastily prepared, were not followed.</p> <p>The family believes that the current practice not to wait for the results of the chorionic villus karyotyping analysis, where genetic anomaly is suspected in the case of a normal scan needs to stop.  There needs to be a public inquiry.  How many other parents have lost a child because of this type of misdiagnosis and reckless haste since the new law came in?  The idea that voluntary hospitals can be subjected to an independent inquiry by the Government is dishonest rubbish when we know there have been inquiries into the church and abuse, when the church is not under State control either.  It needs to be said that those who are worried about the new law introduced people to the Houses of the Oireachtas who spoke are feeling pressurised by doctors where anomalies were being diagnosed.  There were warnings about the possibility of such mistakes in these cases.  However campaigning journalists, activist and perhaps profit-seeking doctors and reckless politicians contributed to a situation where we have a non-scrutinised law.  The very least we can do for the memory of Christopher, and in support of his parents who have asked for changes in the way these practices are carried out, is to have an inquiry.  The Minister of Health needs to be able to tell people in how many cases this kind of misdiagnosis has happened and what is being done to ensure that it can never happen again.  We all, but especially those who rushed through this legislation, need to reflect on what they have done.</p></speech>

Last Wednesday, the Joint Committee on Health was told by the HSE chief executive, Mr. Paul Reid, that the HSE could not direct individual hospitals on restriction and guidelines because that was a matter for local hospitals.  I have been dealing with parents across Galway who are very disturbed that each hospital can define for itself what being in labour means, so in some, it is 4 cm dilation.  I do not understand why a public service that the State is paying for cannot roll-out the same guidelines across all our maternity hospitals.  There is no difference between a woman, a baby and a partner in the west and a woman, a baby and a partner in Dublin.  We need to have equality across the island.  Will the Minister for Health ask the HSE how, with the funding the State is providing, we can insure equality of care across the island, particularly in relation to maternity services.  It is simply not good enough that we went out with an announcement that the restrictions were lifted and two days later we found out that was not the case.</p> <p>I met with the College of General Practitioners last week.  I understand that while courses are being put on on women's healthcare, the State is not providing any funding whatsoever for those.  I spoke in the House some weeks ago on the menopause and a debate that was taking place across the airwaves.  It is our job as public representatives to bring that into the Oireachtas and into the political sphere and to exert pressure to ensure that women get everything they need.  We need to ensure that we are adequately resourcing GPs and those who are providing their training because every woman who goes into every practice needs to be sure they are getting the same information.</p></speech>

I will not speculate on the causes of the fire but it is essential that the Department ensures that funding is made available for this community centre to be restored.  It is right beside St. Theresa's Gardens where regeneration is happening.  It is an essential community centre in a very disadvantaged part of the inner city, which helps people from young to old, those at risk of leaving school early, the old folks groups and the majorettes.  It is essential that it be brought back to use as soon as possible.  I have previously raised how housing and regeneration projects are built without the Department making available community infrastructure to support it.  This is a real opportunity for the Department to put its money where its mouth is and fund the restoration of what is a great community centre.  That whole area will be regenerated and built on in coming years.</p> <p>There is speculation and reports that indoor dining will be delayed for those who are not yet vaccinated.  When I think of Ireland, I often think of how much we scapegoat our young people, particularly during this pandemic, in public discourse.  It ranges from socialising outdoors to claiming the PUP without previously working enough hours.  Now it looks as though we are penalising young people for not being vaccinated.</p> <p>It is important that we maintain the social solidarity we have had over the last year and a half.  We were all in this together.  Young people had their lives up-ended, whether it was in regard to how the leaving certificate was conducted or those who went on to third level not enjoying the first year.  It would be bad faith for there to be a two-tier reopening of society just because younger people have not yet been reached in the vaccination programme.  I have no problem with a two-tier approach for people who choose not to be vaccinated.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, I have a problem when a whole cohort for vaccination has not been reached.

I want to raise the morally indefensible stance of the Government on the issue of intellectual property rights for vaccines.  World leaders at the G7 summit two weeks ago proudly proclaimed they would give 1 billion vaccines to poor countries across the world, and that will be welcome if and when they are delivered.  However, the world needs 11 billion vaccines.  To put it in context, the people of Cornwall where the G7 summit took place outnumber those vaccinated in the 22 poorest countries in Africa.  That is the stark injustice and inequality we are facing on this issue.  I note from Oxfam if we took the increase in the wealth of the ten richest billionaires on this planet - not their wealth just the increase in their wealth - it would be enough to vaccinate everyone in the world and remove them from poverty.  There is something very wrong going on and I have to be direct at this point.  I am disgusted by Fine Gael&rsquo;s attitude to this issue.  Its MEPs refused to support a motion calling for the intellectual property rights on vaccines to be removed.  One of them voted against that proposal.  I am glad colleagues from all parties at the Council of Europe supported the call for the intellectual property rights to be removed.</p> <p>I must highlight some of the spurious arguments that have been made, including by our T&aacute;naiste.  The first is there is no idle vaccine production capacity.  That is not the case.  Companies in Israel, Canada, Bangladesh, South Korea and Pakistan have all tried in vain to obtain the rights to increase production of Covid-19 but the EU and the Fine Gael Party in Ireland have stood against them.  The second argument is the global south does not have the capacity or know-how to produce more vaccines.  That is a line peddled by the T&aacute;naiste.  That is absolutely not true.  Manufacturers are making safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines and medicines in South Africa, India and Brazil and there is plenty more qualified capacity we can draw on from Bangladesh to Senegal to Vietnam.  A further such argument is quality cannot be assured, which is a red herring.  There is no evidence whatsoever to support that.  What we are dealing with here is evidence-free arguments from the Government.  The reality is the Government is standing with big pharma against the people of the world regarding the most important issue facing the people of the planet right now.  </p> <p>I want to ask people when the history of this Covid epidemic is written if they want to have it on their record that they did not call for the intellectual property rights to be waived in order that we could get vaccines to the people who need them across the world.  Is that the stance they are prepared to take?  I call for an urgent debate on this matter.  It will not wait until after the summer recess.  We need to have answers from each member of the Government parties as to why they have not stood up and called for justice for the world in the face of the greatest crisis.  We all know no one is safe until everyone is safe.  It is common sense.  If we can defeat this virus, we need to make sure the world is vaccinated and yet it is a matter of record and regret that this Government, particularly the Fine Gael Party, is standing in opposition to the actions needed right now across the world.</p></speech>

It is important to remember as we celebrate that LGBTQI+, Traveller and Roma people have always been with us.  It is important to remember activism and support must be intersectional.  The national action group for LGBT+ Traveller and Roma people understands that.  It needs to be supported in the vital work it does.  This national group is supported by most Traveller organisations.  All the organisations recognise a need for supports and services to be provided in a specific way through working with LGBTQI+ Traveller and Roma communities.</p> <p>When organisations say there is a need but do not have the resources to support LGBTQI+ people, the Government needs to step in.  If a young Traveller LGBTQI+ person comes out and is put out of their family home, who will give them a job?  Where will they get accommodation?  What are their options?  It is important to say this is not an issue for the Traveller community alone but Travellers face other barriers that add to the pain.  It is hard being a member of the Traveller community.  It is harder when one is a member of the community and is LGBTQI+.  Where is their lifeboat?  The response to those questions must be mindful of Traveller history and culture.  I know Travellers who had no problem coming out to their family and being accepted within the Traveller community but they did not feel accepted within the LGBTQI+ community.  They felt the rainbow did not extend to them because they were not only a Traveller but a member of the LGBTQI+ community and the intersectionality that goes with that.  I call on the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, to support this national group.  The Government announced last week that &euro;700,000 would be made available for LGBT+ services.  I ask the Minister to support the national action group for LGBT+ Traveller and Roma people. </p> <p>I would like to follow on from what other Senators said and congratulate the Cathaoirleach on being a year in his role.  I have found him to be fair and a very good support to me.  I would like to thank every Member of this House and the D&aacute;il for all their support in the past year in helping me to come to terms with understanding how the Oireachtas works.  I would also like to thank Oein de Bhairdu&iacute;n and Colette Kelleher for all the work they have done on the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill.  It will come before the D&aacute;il this Thursday.  I ask all Members of the D&aacute;il to support it.  It is vital we do not only recognise Travellers in a tokenistic way, as we did in 2017.  Thursday is an opportunity to value young Travellers within our society in the education system and give my child and other Senators&rsquo; children the opportunity to learn about Traveller culture.  I call on every Member of the D&aacute;il to take part in the debate and support this Bill on Thursday and in that way to have meaningful representation and meaningful value of the Traveller community and Traveller children.</p></speech>

It has been my first year as an Oireachtas Member and he has been a great support.  I found him to be fair and approachable at all times.</p> <p>Moving on, the hospitality sector is again in crisis this morning.  Regarding the proposals being considered by Cabinet, having been involved in the hospitality sector throughout my life, it certainly seems those of us in the sector are being scapegoated.  We have been hammered since March 2020.  It was proposed there would be full resumption of business next Monday.  More than 40% of the population is fully vaccinated across the country.  In excess of 70% of people have received their first vaccination.  Now at this eleventh hour, NPHET thinks it is suitable to change the roadmap.  There will always be a certain level of risk.  The risk will not be zero for the foreseeable future.  What we need to decide is where is our vaccination bonus.  People need to take personal responsibility.  We are asking the hospitality sector to police itself.  What about all the staff in the sector?  Where will they stand in this process?  It is extremely difficult.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are talking about tens of thousands of jobs.

What we need this evening is a clear and precise message.  We need to consider more than NPHET.  We need to stand up, be strong and make a decision.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of driver theory tests.  The way they are being treated is disgraceful.  People who are scheduled for tests go to the testing centre to find out it is closed.  They have not been notified that their test has been rescheduled although they should be.  I am calling on the Leader to contact the Minister for Transport and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to ask for an amnesty regarding driver theory tests for young people in particular.  The sons of farmers and agricultural contractors, those looking for new jobs, those who have new jobs and people going back to college will not be able to do what they normally do or what people before them did with regard to those activities because they will not be able to drive because they will not be able to do their driver theory test.  We are told that departmental staff are working from home in many cases and that working from home is going well, so it beggars belief the Department cannot come up with a solution when it has had months to do it.  There is no answer to this other than an amnesty regarding driver theory tests.  I ask that, as a matter of urgency, the Leader contacts the Minister and the Taoiseach regarding this issue.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight an issue many businesses, particularly those who buy online, will face from Thursday.  From 1 July, VAT will be charged on all goods imported from any country outside of the EU, including the UK, irrespective of value.  Of course, in Ireland, VAT on most goods and services is 23%.</p> <p>Another issue I wish to draw attention to is carbon gas and its dangers.  Radon is a radioactive gas linked to 300 cases of lung cancer each year in Ireland and, after smoking, it is the second largest cause of lung cancer, with one third of the country classified as a high-radon area by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The EPA and Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, mapping shows that nearly half a million people are at risk of having high levels of radon in their homes.  Radon gas seeps into homes through small cracks and gaps in foundations or openings of service pipes.  As it has no colour, taste or smell, it can only be detected through a radon test.  It costs around &euro;50 for a test kit.  A fan-assisted sump, which can cost up to &euro;1,500, can be installed in a day by a contractor to reduce radon levels by over 90%.  However, there is no grant available to cover the cost of the test or installing a sump.  The cost to our health system of treating lung cancer caused by radon is many times more than the cost of offering free sumps to high-radon homes and the human impact is incalculable.</p> <p>The Government published a national radon control strategy in 2014 followed by a second five-year phase that launched in 2019 with a focus on prevention and awareness through testing.  This is a hidden and issue that is not spoken about and needs urgent attention.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to come to the House to give us an update on the progress made and whether he has considered providing financial support to local authorities for radon remediation works?</p></speech>

I know he was a very happy person this day last year.  I was slightly less happy as it was the first day the Seanad was sitting that I was unable to participate in, but who was to know that I would be back within a year?  It is good to be back.  I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his year in office, which has been a very difficult year.</p> <p>On the day that is in it, it would be remiss of me not to echo the sentiments and build on much of what has been said by Senator Crowe, a publican who knows far more about this than I do.  I know many people in the restaurant trade and pub trade, especially the Dublin pub trade.  So many of them have contacted me.  I have been talking to them, seen stuff on Twitter and heard stuff on the radio.  It is such a devastating day for them - another devastating day.  Dublin pubs that do not serve food have been closed since 13 or 14 March last year, which is nearly 470 days at this stage.  This is devastating for their financial existence but also for their mental health and their staff.  While the proposals might be well intentioned in terms of allowing people to do things if they are vaccinated, I do not believe they are workable.  I do not think the HSE has the spare resources after the cyberattack to set up a system.  I do not think it is fair to ask publicans and their staff to police whether someone has been vaccinated.  People who have not yet been vaccinated would feel very disgruntled.</p> <p>We are the only country in Europe that does not allow indoor dining.  We will let people fly to other countries to dine indoors but we are not letting people do it in our own country.  We need to think about this very quickly and decide that we will try as much as possible to give people in the industry a break and trust they and the people going into these establishments know what they are doing; that they will maintain social distancing, wash their hands and wear their masks when they are not at their tables; and that there will be table service.  It is such an important industry and the people involved in it are such hard-working members of our communities.  We need to make sure this industry is given respect and to acknowledge all the work it has done.  NPHET has a place and I welcome everything it has done but this is such an important industry.  I ask the Government to consider seriously trying to reopen this industry safely as soon as possible but not to be divisive with vaccinated versus non-vaccinated people.</p></speech>

It is our one-year anniversary.  It is one year since 29 June 2020, we are in the same seats in the Convention Centre and it is fantastic to be speaking here as a voice representing the west.  It has been an incredible year.  We have seen what has happened in terms of a pandemic and lockdown.  For all of us new Senators,  it is a very different world.  I have had the chance to speak in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il Chambers, which was an amazing privilege.  It is a privilege to have been nominated as a Taoiseach's nominee and a Fine Gael nominee to represent Roscommon and Galway.</p> <p>As Fine Gael spokesperson on further and higher education, research, innovation and science, I have had the opportunity to fight for schools in my local area.  They include the new building for Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa and St. Teresa's Special School, which is getting two new classrooms for students starting in September.  It has also been really exciting to see the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, which includes GMIT.  This is making Mountbellew a brand new university campus town.  We know that Technological University of the Shannon has already been granted technological university status.  This means, it is hoped, that we will see brand new campuses targeted for Roscommon and east Galway.</p> <p>The investment to date has been great.  The campaigns in which I have been involved include the cycleway, which is very important for south Roscommon and east Galway.  We have opportunities with the green route through Cornafulla and Athlone into Ballinasloe out to probably Caltra, Ahascragh and Mountbellew.  There is also the blue route coming through Ballinasloe and out to Kilconnell, Woodlawn, New Inn and Athenry.  It is hoped this decision will be made at the end of this year.  We have seen fantastic investment in roads and job creation involving great jobs in Roscommon town, Westcare Homecare and Harmac Medical in Castlerea, and Chanelle Pharma in Ballinasloe.  It is wonderful to have seen investment, even in these hard times over the past year.  I am really looking forward to the year ahead.  I know it will be exciting but also I am sure there will be some tough times ahead.  I look forward to representing and being a voice for the west.</p></speech>

We have had that issue where people have turned up to do the test and have not been notified that the place is closed.  I concur with the Senator's proposals.  </p> <p>I welcome the increase in capacity proposed for sporting events.  I hope it could be introduced by this weekend.   We have a large number of championship games on and it would give an opportunity for the public to travel and support their home counties.  </p> <p>I will speak on the hospitality industry, as others Members have.  As tourism spokesperson for Fine Gael in the Seanad, I have empathy for people in the industry, given what they are hearing this morning.  These businesses have been closed in the region of 15 months.  Over recent months, we have seen how successful outdoor dining has been.  Some businesses are open and grant schemes have been put in place but those that have not been able to open have been waiting for 5 July and now it looks like that will be put back further with no definitive date given.</p> <p>We have people travelling to Northern Ireland for their holidays because they cannot dine where they wish.  NPHET states in its proposals that it is not opposed to vaccinated people eating indoors.  We need to look at the possibility of that proposal.  We need to take control.  There are tens of thousands of people in the hospitality industry in restaurants and pubs and they are entitled to make a living, which they have not been able to do over the last 15 months.  We need to take a serious look at this and put definitive dates in place for when they can open their businesses.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator Burke that there is a big problem with driver theory tests.  It is not just the sons of farmers and agricultural contractors but also the daughters who have concerns about the delays.</p> <p>I have been fortunate in recent weeks to take part in a big fundraiser and awareness-raising campaign in County Wexford around motor neurone disease organised by Vanessa Davey, Rory Cassidy and others.  There are other such initiatives, including by Malcolm McGrath, who has cycled 1,000 km.  They are doing it to raise awareness of a most debilitating and horrible disease.  The work is being carried out quite often by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, IMNDA.  We need to recognise this disease to a far greater extent and have greater support and investment in research to tackle it.</p> <p>The IMNDA is a well-run charity.  Unfortunately, that cannot be said for every charity.  I draw the House's attention to the report of the Charities Regulator around ChildFund Ireland.  It is another charity which has abused public trust.  It received over &euro;8 million in taxpayers' money over the last decade through Irish Aid.  Even though in 2017 a warning was given that 64% of the annual grant was being spent on salaries and administration costs, ChildFund Ireland continued its activity.  This comes in the wake of B&oacute;thar and the bags of cash we saw recently.  The problem is that, where a minority of charities behave in this way, it brings the whole charity sector into disrepute.</p> <p>The Charities Regulator has spoken out on this.  We really need to clamp down on the abuse of fund-raised money and taxpayers' money by a small minority of charities.  Some of the stuff that appears in this report is outrageous.  There are examples of the chief executive staying in five-star hotels in Dubai for three days.  That does not give the public confidence in those charities.  It does not give the taxpayer confidence in the money that is made available to them and damages the reputation of charities.  We need to strengthen legislation to deal with those who abuse public trust.</p></speech>

I welcome the announcement of more spectators being able to come to matches.  Last week in my county of Tipperary there were only 200 at the Waterford-Clare game.  It is a massive stadium and I urge that those changes come in this weekend for the match in Semple Stadium between Cork and Limerick.  We can surely host more than 200 people in an outdoor setting that can accommodate over 40,000 people.</p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly brought up maternity restrictions and a lack of full understanding of what is happening.  We have been told by the Minister that all maternity wards are in line.  We are told by Paul Reid that he cannot dictate running and management of all maternity hospitals.  An expectant mother or partner who goes on the HSE website and looks at each of the 19 maternity wards in the country sees they are not aligned.  Every hospital is slightly different.  One talks of coming in established labour; another says one can come in on arrival.  The guidance is totally different and that is just on the website.  In terms of how they manage it outside of that, who knows?</p> <p>I refer to the announcement today on possibly extending time.  I ask the Government to give real guidance on holy communions and confirmations.  Many of them are happening across my county and they need guidance and clarity on what will happen.  Letters have been sent out to the Cashel-Emly diocese recommending they should be delayed until September.  The Waterford-Lismore diocese I am in is told they are okay to continue.  We need clarity for all of these.  Parents and kids need to have it if it is okay.</p></speech>

Today is a great day for me and an incredible way to mark my first year in this House with the announcement of the funding to bring the Narrow Water bridge project to tender.  As someone from the area, I have seen that things have not always been so simple in the Cooley Peninsula and on Carlingford Lough.  Long gone are the days of gunboats on Carlingford Lough and British army patrols stopping us at Narrow Water going about our business.  Today's announcement is a symbol of belief.  Finally, someone outside the area has belief in my region.  This bridge is more than a piece of infrastructure.  It is about bringing the North and the South together, leaving the tragedy, heartache and pain behind and looking towards the future of what this great island can be.</p> <p>I thank An Taoiseach.  He has been dedicated to this project.  We have heard him on endless occasions talk about his and Fianna F&aacute;il's commitment to this project going back decades.  Finally, we are at the next stage of the project.  It brings back opportunity to this entire region, North and South.  Omeath has struggled with tragedies, disadvantage and being left behind for being in the Border region.  Today is a really good day for the Cooley Peninsula.  I urge Senators to visit and see what the place looks like before the Narrow Water bridge, and what it looks like afterwards.  It is a good day for County Louth.</p></speech>

She and many of her colleagues have campaigned long and hard on that initiative, which is a welcome one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-29a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062900002#P00100"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his understanding.  I was tied up with a Zoom meeting.  As the Acting Leader well knows, many students, last year and this year, through no fault of their own, have been unable to find summer work at home or abroad and have had no choice but to resort to accepting the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  Unfortunately, that payment is now working against them in the context of their SUSI grant for this year because last year's PUP income is being added to the family income.  In many cases, this is putting them over the threshold under to attain the SUSI grant.  Those in this cohort have probably suffered more than anyone throughout the pandemic.  They have suffered a loss of opportunity and a loss of contact with friends, and they have been under enormous pressure.  In many cases, the money was not saved.  It was spent on online shopping and various bits and pieces in the expectation that it would not count as part of overall household income.  This is putting an intolerable burden on students' parents.  In many cases, the parents have also been on the PUP or have been on a reduced income and have gone through so much.</p> <p>I appeal to the Acting Leader to intercede with the Department of Education regarding the higher education grant to try to ensure that the PUP will not be regarded as part of a family's income in the awarding of the SUSI grant.  It is a one-off payment.  The pandemic was a one-off event.  We have supported so many sectors of society.  We now have a job of work to support students, particularly those on lower incomes who would normally be provided with a SUSI grant and whose PUP might push them over the threshold by a couple of hundred euro and, in some cases, make their return to college impossible.  It will certainly cause enormous pressure for some families.  I ask that we engage with the Department to see whether there is a way around this debacle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-06-29a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021062900002#P00200"><p>I, too, take this opportunity to congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his anniversary.  He has done a wonderful job.  He has been very fair in the Chair and has brought about many innovations in his work.  I congratulate all Senators who were elected to this House a year ago or whose first day in the House was a year ago.</p><p><i>Kon'nichiwa</i>to Senator O'Loughlin.  She is correct about the pressures and stresses that leaving certificate students and many others have endured over the past year regarding the reopening..  So many of them took up jobs in the hospitality sector, including in caf&eacute;s, restaurants and pubs, throughout the country, particularly in the height of the summer during the tourist season.  Such positions are now in doubt.  I will touch on this later.</p><p>The Senator also referred to voids.  At various stages, funding has been given to local authorities to bring voids back into use to provide homes to people.  She also touched on the issue of Bord na M&oacute;na and the difficulties associated with planning applications and permissions for projects that are perhaps deemed worthy but conflict with the wishes and views of local people, such as wind farm projects.  It is a difficult one to assess.  The planning process is robust in that regard.</p><p>Senator Currie touched on Farmleigh House and Estate.  I congratulate her on her work on in this regard and on the opening hours in 2020.  I hope she will succeed in this regard in the coming year.  There has been a renewed connection with the great outdoors over the past year, obviously within the 5 km radius and within a wider radius when the restriction was lifted.  That is important.  I commend the Senator on her ongoing work with the Office of Public Works.  She is correct on the need for clarity on weddings.  A wedding day is a very important one for people throughout the country.  It is a special day.  I will not say it happens only once in a lifetime because it may happen more often but generally the first wedding is important to many people.  The Senator is also correct that people need clarity on numbers and the sectoral guidelines.  I hope that can be provided later.</p><p>Senator Mullen talked about the tragic case of baby Christopher Kiely and the issues of the National Maternity Hospital and the Harmony test.  What can I say?  It was an absolute tragedy.  It should not have happened.  Irrespective of what I feel, I can only imagine how the parents feel today and how they will feel every day about the case.  As with any tragic case, lessons have to be learned about future tests, results and retests because there are monumental consequences.</p><p>Senators Pauline O'Reilly and Ahearn talked about the issue in the maternity hospitals and the ongoing restrictions or uncertainty regarding partners' access to women giving birth .  I am a member of the health committee.  We had Mr. Paul Reid and his team before us last week.  Most members raised the ongoing uncertainty regarding the restrictions in many maternity hospitals across the country.  They asked how labour is defined.  An expectant woman has every right to have her husband or partner present during labour, or at whatever stage she wants.  She needs physical support and it needs to be provided.  I said last week that there should be no ifs or buts.  The health committee received email testimonies from people who were, after a scan, presented with the most difficult and heartbreaking news alone and without a partner present.  That is terrible; it should not be happening.  Covid or no Covid, that needs to change.  There needs to be certainty on that. </p><p>Senator Moynihan referred to funding for a community centre in her area that was damaged by fire.  I am not sure about the position on insurance but I raised with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the T&aacute;naiste the absolute need, during the national development plan review, for a community centre fund for new builds in rapidly growing areas and for restoration and improvement works at many community centres in respect of which the local authority has not the required finances or the community cannot be expected to fundraise.  It is an area on which I have been pushing.  I would welcome the support of colleagues in pushing the Government over the coming weeks in advance of the development plan.</p><p>Senator Moynihan also talked about indoor dining being delayed and the scapegoating of young people.  The Government has difficult decisions to make today on indoor dining.  The advice of NPHET has to be considered.  It is going to be a difficult decision based on what occurred when we ignored health advice in the past, yet the public is making the absolute demand that indoor dining be allowed.</p><p>Senator Gavan raised intellectual property rights for vaccines.  The European Parliament voted in support of investing in manufacturing capacity, resolving issues with production and supply bottlenecks, including in respect of increasing the supply to the African Continent as an alternative.  What was being suggested was a good sound bite and might have been deemed to be a quick fix but it was not agreed by the parliament that there was a better approach.</p><p>I agree with Senator Flynn's comments on Gypsy, Roma and Traveller History Month and the LGBT Traveller community.  I will certainly pass on her comments to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.</p><p>Senator Crowe, my colleague in Galway, has, in fairness, been a strong advocate of the hospitality and pub sector over the past year since his election.  He mentioned the vaccine bonus and the roadmap.  We have to ask when and where it is all going to end.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have the Delta variant and, possibly, the Delta plus variant.  Who knows what variant we will have in the autumn or next year?  It is likely that Covid variants are now with us and will become as common as the flu.  This a very serious issue that we face.  The business community and the hospitality sector have faced enormous pressures over the last year and continue to do so.  It is possible another delay will be announced today, depending on the Cabinet decision.  It is a very stressful time for these sectors.  I acknowledge many Members have concerns about this issue, including employment, the viability of future businesses and the impact at the height of the tourism season.  I certainly wish Cabinet well in its deliberations on that today.</p><p>Senators Burke, Carrigy and Byrne talked about driver theory tests and asked me to liaise with the Minister for Transport and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, on the matter, which I will do.  I have had representations from people in that boat who have been unable to take the test.  One individual even had a job offer on the Continent but could not get the driver test in time and so could not take it up.</p><p>Senator Keogan talked about radon, the importance of radon testing and a grant.  A grant towards the cost of kits and radon sumps is a good idea.  As the Cathaoirleach mentioned, she might raise it as a Commencement matter and possibly get a more comprehensive response, but it is something that is worthy of a positive answer.</p><p>Senator Horkan also talked about the restaurant and pub trade, the devastating impact of pandemic restrictions on that sector and the need to trust people in the industry to reopen as soon as possible.  I concur with his comments that there should be a reopening as planned.  It should obviously be a controlled and restricted reopening with all the social responsibilities we have got used to over the last year.  As I said, Cabinet will be deliberating on that today.</p><p>Senator Dolan gave a very enthusiastic commentary about her role over the last year as a strong advocate for Galway-Roscommon, the west and the education sector.  She touched on the technological university, her work on school accommodation and her advocacy for greenways in her community.  I wish her well in her continued deliberations and congratulate her on one year in the Seanad.</p><p>Senators Carrigy and Ahearn touched on sporting events.  Again, I am sure that topic will be discussed at Cabinet today, but we see the crowds at the European Football Championship and, on television at the weekend, a small number of people at our championship matches throughout the country.  It seems obvious to me but, again, I am sure Cabinet will be deliberating on that today, hopefully with a positive outcome.  Senator Carrigy also touched on the reopening in the context of people now taking holidays in Northern Ireland because of it.  While we want to see cross-Border tourism and all of that, it is at a cost to businesses in this country because they continue to be closed.  As I said, Cabinet will be dealing with that today.</p><p>Senator Byrne touched on motor neurone disease, which is a very important and worthy topic.  I congratulate him on his advocacy in that whole area and wish him well in it.  He touched on the charity sector and the excesses in a small minority of charities.  Irish people are very generous in giving to charities both here and abroad.  Many people give in the belief that when they do so, whether it is &euro;10, &euro;20 or whatever, it is going to a good cause and making a real difference.  In most cases, it is.  Many charities around the world, and throughout the country, do so much good work in such areas as cancer, heart disease, hospice care and motor neurone disease, as we touched on.  Then we have examples - I will not name them - of charities that have let themselves down and let the charity sector down.  It is a huge area.</p><p>Senator Ahearn touched on sporting events, maternity restrictions and communions and confirmations.  Again, various bishops have made their views known in their dioceses but, again, there should be one rule, supported by Government, on whether it is in everyone's best interests to delay.  That should be decided today as well.</p><p>Senator McGreehan talked about the Narrow Water bridge project going to tender as a symbol of belief in North-South being together.  I agree.  I am not very familiar with the project, or with the area I am ashamed to say, but from what I know it is a great example of the two parts of our island coming together in co-operation.  It is something that is great to see.  We want to see more of that progress and co-operation and no return to anything that we know too well from our past.</p><p>Senator Dooley talked about the important area of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, as it relates to qualification for Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  I have been dealing with individuals on this matter as well.  It should be raised and I will raise it with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  In many cases where, for example, a student who received a much smaller amount of money for part-time work in previous years, and is now receiving the &euro;350 PUP, there should perhaps be some sort of waiver, or disregard, of the portion of the PUP above what they would normally be receiving, if that makes sense.  If the PUP is putting a family over the threshold for payment that is placing a huge burden on students and their parents.</p><p>I thank all the Senators for their contributions.</p></speech>

It is important that this legislation has passed, albeit seven or eight years too late.  I can never, for the life of me, understand how it takes so long to transpose European directives into Irish law.  This is a commonsense piece of legislation that is agreed by everybody.  Going forward, if there is one lesson from this it is that we need to be doing these transpositions into Irish law a great deal more quickly.  The directives are created for a good reason and the time delay was certainly not necessary and was regrettable.</p> <p>That said, the legislation is greatly welcomed.  The euro has served this country and the European Union well.  We have to do everything that we can to protect the integrity of the euro.  This legislation certainly embellishes the protection of the integrity of the euro which is something that has to be welcomed.  The European project, in spite of Brexit, will thrive and we will see this occur post-pandemic.  This project has knitted together and has acted very much in solidarity during the pandemic.  The European Union has moved in unison.  The European Union will never be stronger when we rebuild our continent post-pandemic.  We need to do everything we can to protect the components, the currencies, the people, the citizens and the integrity of European project.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas. </p></speech>

Do any other Senators indicate their wish to contribute?  I call Senator Gallagher.</p></speech>

I will not delay proceedings but I wish to acknowledge the work put into this by the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, since he came into office.  Notwithstanding the delay referred to by Senator Conway, I am delighted that we are in this position today and that this legislation has now passed both Houses.  I thank all who contributed to the debate during its passage through this House.</p></speech>

I also want to thank the Cathaoirleach, Senator Daly, on the one-year anniversary of his holding of this office in light of the very significant amount of legislation that has been brought through the Seanad in the past year in a difficult period.  This was primarily due to his stewardship and I congratulate him on that.</p> <p>I also want to thank the Senators again for facilitating this legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Houses.  Senator Conway is correct in that there has been significant delay in the transposition of directives.  When I was appointed to this position  last September there were six long-standing Bills that needed to be transposed.  Thanks to the good work of the Seanad in facilitating me, this is the fourth of those six to be passed.  The other two are going through pre-legislative scrutiny this week and I expect that these will also be passed in the autumn.  I agree with Senator Conway&rsquo;s sentiments that when we catch up, which we will do by the autumn, there should be no further falling behind.</p> <p>I thank my officials who have done a tremendous amount of work to ensure that we have been able to get these four pieces of legislation passed into law.  The Counterfeiting Bill 2020 is another step by the Government and the Department of Justice in tackling criminal activity.  It is a technical Bill but one of great importance in continuing our efforts to weaken criminals who are trying to undermine our State and European Union through the use of counterfeit notes and other actions.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and the Seanad once again.</p></speech>
