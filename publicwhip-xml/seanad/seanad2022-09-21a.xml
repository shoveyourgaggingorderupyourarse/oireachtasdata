    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#A00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this matter.  I ask for an update on a significant issue in Bantry at present relating to the mental health centre there, which is a very important part of the campus of Bantry General Hospital.  A reduction of nearly 40% in beds in the acute wards is proposed.  We are looking at a reduction from 18 to 11 beds.  This is a very significant issue for the entire region.  As the Minister of State is very much aware, given her west Cork roots, Bantry hospital is in the centre of the three peninsulas there.  It covers a massive geographical area.  The need for this acute unit to be fully operational is very much required.  The proposal by the Mental Health Commission to reduce capacity from 18 to 11 beds, which is a 40% reduction, would have a major impact on the ability to have an appropriate mental health centre based in this part of west Cork.  In many ways, it is a bizarre situation that there is a possibility that two arms of the State will go to court over this matter in the next few weeks.  It is very unusual that the HSE could take the Mental Health Commission to the District Court to look for a stay of execution, if I can use that terminology, regarding this unit.</p> <p>We need to see clarity on this issue.  Will we have a scenario where, unfortunately, the HSE will go down the route of going to the District Court and engaging in a legal process with another arm of the State regarding the availability of acute mental beds in Bantry General Hospital?  The long-term plan is also very important.  What will be the long-term plan to deal with issues of personal space and the new model of care that is required?  That is a major issue.  Bantry General Hospital has seen significant developments over the past few years.  The Taoiseach was there only a few weeks ago to open another unit.  Significant sums, amounting to millions, have been spent there in capital investment.  We now need to see a plan urgently put in place to cover this part of the campus.</p> <p>I ask for clarity from the Minister of State regarding this part of the campus.  What are the long-term plans for Bantry General Hospital in respect of the centre?  We need to have 18 beds and appropriate personal space there.  It is not appropriate that two arms of the State would go to court to fight over what should happen.  There are a lot of questions.  I hope I will get some answers from the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#A00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  As some Members will be aware, the Mental Health Commission has made the decision to put a restriction on the registration of the mental health care and recovery approved centre in Bantry General Hospital, given its concerns over the size of residents' bedrooms in the centre.  I will touch on Bantry General Hospital.  I visited it three or four months ago.  It is the most fantastic facility.  It is the most remote level 2 hospital in the whole country, serving a huge area of west Cork.  I know west Cork very well; my father came from Drimoleague.  I am very familiar with the area.  On the day I visited the hospital, I was very impressed with the fact that it was an old-style hospital doing everything, including looking after older people and those with mental health issues across the whole sector.  It is a very important facility in west Cork.  I acknowledge the support that all Oireachtas Members have given to that facility over many years.</p> <p>I have been aware since August that the Mental Health Commission was in consultation with the HSE regarding this particular situation.  As the Senator said, this decision would mean the centre's total number of registered beds would reduce from 18 to 11.  That is a massive reduction in bed capacity.  The centre, which is located on the grounds of Bantry General Hospital, provides residents with acute care - it is important to note that it is acute care - rehabilitation and recovery supports for their mental health difficulties.  It serves the local west Cork area, including areas around Skibbereen, Clonakilty, Bantry and beyond.</p> <p>The HSE advised me last Friday afternoon of its intention to appeal the Mental Health Commission decision to put a restriction on the registration of the mental health care and recovery approved centre in Bantry General Hospital.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As this is now a matter before the District Court, it would not be appropriate for me, as Minister of State, to discuss the specifics of this particular case, but I can speak to the issue more generally.  I will continue to liaise with the HSE to ensure all decisions and actions taken in respect of the centre are made with the best interests of the residents in mind, both from a health and safety viewpoint and in the context of the provision of appropriate treatments.</p><p>Mental health remains a key priority for me and the Government, and we are fully committed to the delivery of high-quality, person-centred, recovery-oriented mental health services.  Our long-term strategic aim for our mental health services is to provide a consistent, high-quality service for anyone in need of support for their mental health.  It is our responsibility to ensure the provision of high-quality mental health services that are fit for purpose.  The Government acknowledges that mental health services must constantly evolve and develop to ensure they are in line with international best practice and regulatory requirements.</p><p>The national community mental health operation office is working closely with community healthcare organisation, CHO, 4 regarding compliance issues, most of which, I must emphasise, are premises related.  The issues relate not to care but to the premises.  CHO 4 has a comprehensive capital plan to accelerate the development of new inpatient units, and the national office is working with it to secure funding in this respect. </p><p>My understanding is that the only avenue for the HSE was to appeal the Mental Health Commission's decision to the District Court.  The HSE maintains that it cannot afford to reduce the number of beds and notes that, in the context of regulation 22, there are no specifics with regard to the size of bedrooms.  The HSE believes the imposition of the condition could have broader implications for many other approved centres in that particular CHO area and within CHO areas nationally.</p><p>That is the current situation.  At present, there is capacity for 18 residents in the centre.  As I have said, many of the patients have acute and enduring mental illnesses.  The centre is their home from home.  Therefore, it is very important that we, and I, as Minister of State, make sure that there is capacity in specific areas for mental illness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#B00200"><p>The Minister of State makes a very interesting point about the knock-on implications of this judgment.  The judgment could be the catalyst for a complete change in capacity across the entire sector and the country.  It is a massive issue for us.  It is a real worry now that, because of the decision of the Mental Health Commission, there could be a reduction in acute care across the country.</p> <p>On the issue of going to court, it is bizarre that two agencies of the State are taking the legal route.  I would still hope that communications can continue between the HSE and the commission, so that they do not actually have to go to court to resolve the issue.  There must be a meeting of minds in order that we might come up with a solution, if possible.  The long-term issue of what is to be done with the unit in Bantry is still a worry for me.  We have seen significant investment in Bantry.  As the Minister of State said, it is a wonderful unit.  We need to put a capital plan in place.  Perhaps the Minister of State could elaborate, either today or at a later date, on how we can get money to invest in the campus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#B00300"><p>I thank the Senator for the way he has addressed this issue.  I am conscious that the centre is home for many of the residents in Bantry.  As I have said, in CHO 4 the chief officer and the area lead for mental health have put in place a comprehensive plan, which I have seen, in relation to capital projects across counties Cork and Kerry.  That is the first point.  The plan is being given consideration by the health business services estates.</p> <p>The second point is that this relates to the national implementation and monitoring committee, which I put in place after Sharing the Vision was launched two years ago by my predecessor, the former Minister of State and Deputy, Jim Daly.  One of the conditions of Sharing the Vision was that there would be a national implementation and monitoring committee to ensure that we are all doing our jobs.  One of the first things I asked the committee to do was conduct a bed capacity review of mental health beds across the country, because it is really important to know what challenges we are facing in specific areas.  That work is under way.  I look forward to having that report.</p> <p>I guarantee that this issue is very high on my agenda.  It is extremely important that there is communication between the HSE and the Mental Health Commission.  That communication will continue.  The last thing I want so see is a court case, but at the same time I have to be very conscious that to lose seven beds in that particular hospital would have a detrimental impact on residents in the area, and also could have a knock-on effect elsewhere.  I, as Minister of State, must ensure that we have capacity for these people who have mental illnesses and enduring mental health difficulties.  They need the support of the State.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#B00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to discuss this important topic.  My concern is around the rent-a-room scheme.  There has been so much encouragement for people to join the scheme.  I come from County Limerick, where there are three third level institutions.  This morning I received a response from one of them to say that unfortunately, they have no accommodation for the number of people on the waiting list.  It is a really serious issue.  We, as a Government, have announced that people can earn up to &euro;14,000 tax-free under the rent-a-room scheme.  That is fine.  However, many older people have approached me about the matter.  They have considered joining the scheme, but they are concerned about their medical cards.  Specifically, they are worried that joining the scheme would affect their entitlement to those cards and that they would lose that entitlement if they went slightly over the threshold.  To me, this is a no-brainer.  There is a cost-of-living crisis and people are afraid to turn on their heating.  They are worried about their bills and the increasing energy costs.  For older people who may be medical card holders, joining the scheme would create income for them in the cost-of-living crisis.</p> <p>Many of the people to whom I refer are widows or widowers who live on their own.  The scheme would enable them to have company at home.  It would also help to address the student accommodation crisis.  It is not going to solve the overall problem, but it will go a long way towards it.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Department of Education are very much in favour of the scheme, but the Department of Health has said nothing.  That is really why I am raising the issue today.  I believe that the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and his Department need to come out in support of the scheme.  I know that the Minister of State is here to deliver the message on behalf of the Minister.  I really acknowledge and admire the work that she does.  I believe that the scheme is a win-win for all and look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#B00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Health, but can I just say that from my own perspective, as Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am of the view that the rent-a-room scheme is invaluable in light of the challenges we have in the context of accommodation and the pressures that exist.  It is also invaluable from the perspective that an elderly person who is living alone could decide to rent out a room under the scheme.  Having the company and companionship is important.  I spoke to a recently bereaved gentleman who told me that he had taken in a family of two adults and two children from Ukraine.  He said that to see clothes hanging on the washing line again gave him such a lift.  The rent-a-room scheme is Government policy, so everyone is very supportive of it, but it is really important.  It can provide access to income for people who are challenged financially.</p> <p>As we know, eligibility for a medical card is provided on a statutory basis under the Health Act 1970 and is based primarily on means.  As of August this year, there are over 1.5 million medical card holders and in excess of 530,000 GP visit card holders.  Therefore, more than 2 million people are availing of support from the State in relation to their health.  The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is able, without undue hardship, to arrange general practitioner services, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure.  The HSE medical card assessment guidelines outline certain incomes that are not included within the medical card assessment process, primarily social welfare payments and some compensation payments deemed not assessable.  The focus of the Minister for Health continues to be on ensuring the continued operation of an appropriate and effective medical card system, which aims to provide support and access to health services when needed.  If an applicant's income is above the limit for a medical card or GP visit card, they may still qualify for a discretionary card.  The HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income threshold where they face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Social and medical issues are also considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing a general practitioner or other medical services, which deals with people who have access to a medical or GP-only card.</p><p>On the Senator&rsquo;s specific question, my understanding is that current rent-a-room tax relief allows people to earn up to &euro;14,000 per year tax free if renting out a room or rooms in their home to private tenants.  As we have said, this was also a call-out from the Minister, Deputy Harris, to students who are finding it difficult to access accommodation.  Income from the rent-a-room scheme is not currently exempted from the medical card assessment process, as the Senator noted.  A proposal to exclude income derived from the rent-a-room scheme from the medical card assessment process needs to be reviewed in detail to determine and consider the range of policy, legislative, operational and financial implications involved.</p><p>I assure the Senator the Minister for Health endeavours to ensure that the medical card system is responsive and sensitive to people's needs.  The Department of Health keeps medical card issues, including the current medical card income thresholds, under review and any proposals are considered in the context of any potential broader implications for Government policy, the annual budgetary Estimates process and legislative requirements arising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for the comprehensive response.  I am a little disappointed because the Minister has not stated that he will carry out a comprehensive review but rather that a comprehensive review is required.  He has not committed to anything and that is really disappointing.  In this day and age, when students do not have accommodation and when older people face increased costs of living, the Minister needs to review the policy and bring forward a proposal.  I ask the Minister of State to revert to the Minister and urge him to reconsider his response on this issue.  That is the right thing to do.  I have outlined the facts and how it would be a win-win situation for all.  We as a Government are encouraging people to rent a room and to attend college, yet this is an impediment.  These are such small sums and I am sure that if someone were to exceed the limit, he or she would not do so by thousands of euro.  The Minister needs to indicate he will review the issue, rather than just say it requires a review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#C00300"><p>I again thank the Senator for raising the issue and will take on board the points she made, which I will feed back to the Minister.  As she will be aware, persons aged 70 or older are assessed under the over-70s medical card income thresholds, which are based on gross income.  Income from the rent-a-room scheme is not currently exempt from the medical card assessment process.  This issue not only lies with the Department of Health but also with the Department of Finance.  On what the Senator said about a proposed review, it is important that a review happen in order that we can see what kind of cost would be involved.  Some people might only slightly exceed the threshold, but allowing people to earn &euro;14,000 tax free might incur a huge cost on the State.  The only way we can find that out is by reviewing the matter, so I will certainly feed back the Senator's comments.  The rent-a-room scheme is very important and it could offer important support to older people who are living alone.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#C00600"><p>There is no doubting the Minister of State's strong work ethic and I thank her for taking this matter.  In early July, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy published a report that was very well received by the three Ministers to whom it was relevant, namely, the Minister for Health, who is the lead Minister on the issue, and the Ministers for Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  They made recommendations that can be broadly put into two categories, the first of which was the ethical future of international surrogacy and the need for legislation in the State, and a framework was suggested for that.  The second related to a retrospective provision for children who have been born via surrogacy, or for those who are on the way via surrogacy, to ensure there will be a legal relationship between those children and both of their parents.</p> <p>Surrogacy has a long history of various entities telling the State that we need to take action on it, from as long ago as when the Taoiseach was Minister for Health in 2005, when the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction recommended that we legislate for surrogacy.  Numerous court decisions, including of the Supreme Court, have found that the State needs to legislate in this area.  In 2012, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Alan Shatter, issued guidelines for international surrogacy, not least because of the citizenship element of it.  In 2017, the assisted human reproduction Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny, out of which a recommendation was made to legislate for international surrogacy.  The Conor O'Mahony report on the child protection implications of international surrogacy was published in 2021, after which the Oireachtas joint committee commenced its work on a tight timeline because its members were conscious that the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill had gone to the D&aacute;il, where it is now awaiting Committee Stage under the Department of Health.</p> <p>Well over one thousand children do not have a legal relationship with both of their parents, be that a second father or, in the main, women who do not have a legal relationship with their own child.  That leaves them in a precarious position whereby if the father of the child, who needs to be the biological father, becomes seriously ill and perhaps faces death, the child will be left with no legal parent in the State.  There are cases before the courts seeking clarification and, bizarrely, the State is defending those cases and paying legal bills for discovery at a time when there are numerous reports stating that we need to legislate for surrogacy.</p> <p>There are situations of marriage breakdown.  In the past couple of weeks in particular, I have had sight of solicitors' letters from the father of children to the mother reminding her that she has no legal standing and that if she relinquishes the claim on their family home, she may be given access to her children.  Children are being weaponised because of the State's failure to legislate for surrogacy and for children born via surrogacy.</p> <p>We need equality for these children.  Regardless of the means of their conception and birth, they should have equality and a right to a legal relationship with both parents before the State.  We were led to believe that amendments were to be brought in on Committee Stage of the health Bill that would address this.  I appreciate that both the Departments of Health and Justice need to act on this, but we need action and we need to know a programme will come in such that before Christmas, the legislation could be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I acknowledge, and thank her for, all the work she has done in regard to surrogacy.</p> <p>The undertaking of surrogacy arrangements in other jurisdictions raises complex ethical questions concerning areas of law that intersect the remits of several Departments, as the Senator noted, namely, the Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, as well as the Department of Health.  Accordingly, and on foot of Government approval of proposals from the Ministers, Deputies McEntee, O&rsquo;Gorman and Stephen Donnelly, the special Oireachtas Joint Committee on International Surrogacy, of which the Senator is a strong member, was established on 9 February.  As she pointed out, the committee published its first report on 6 July, which included a total of 32 recommendations.  On behalf of the Ministers and the Government, I reiterate their gratitude for the work of the committee and the completion of its report in such a timely manner.</p> <p>Following the publication of the committee's report, through a structured and collaborative engagement process, the Departments of Justice, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Health are reviewing the report's recommendations, along with other relevant matters, with a view to determining an appropriate policy position and suitable next steps.  It is crucial the relevant Departments complete a robust and thorough examination of all the issues, including the findings and recommendations of the committee's report, given the range of complexities involved and the rights of the various parties involved in surrogacy arrangements.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is also important to recognise that there is no international consensus or multilateral instrument on this issue at the moment, notwithstanding that the expert group appointed by the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference on Private International Law is due to report in 2023 following the conclusion of its ongoing formal study of the private international law issues being encountered.  There are also highly divergent views within the EU on this issue, with a number of member states prohibiting all forms of surrogacy.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Ministers and Departments are committed to progressing as quickly as possible the development of policy proposals along with any required legislative proposals, while respecting the key principles of protecting the rights of all children born as a result of cross-border surrogacy arrangements and safeguarding the welfare of surrogate mothers.  I think that sums up the key points.  This detailed consideration is ongoing and the Departments are meeting frequently to actively work through the pertinent issues with the aim of producing an agreed policy paper shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#D00200"><p>To say I am not impressed by that response is mild, to be perfectly honest, and with due respect to the Minister of State, who is merely the messenger.  That the Departments have a view to developing a policy paper is a wholly inadequate and absolutely unacceptable response.  There are children in this State who have the right to the two parents, that is, the mother they have only ever known and their second father in the case of same-sex couples.</p> <p>Last weekend, I had to fill in a form for my daughter that described me as her "guardian".  She has not known any other mother.  I am her only mother - she would not have been conceived if it were not for me.  She would not be alive were it not for me.  Unfortunately, I could not give birth to her, but the idea that I am her guardian is unacceptable.  That situation will expire when she is 18 and bring with it a whole heap of other difficulties regarding next of kin.  It will impact our relationship for the rest of our lives.  It is absolutely and utterly unacceptable that at this stage, after all the work that has gone in, all the Departments are doing is developing a policy position.  That will go down incredibly badly with the surrogacy community across the country.  This relates to thousands of people who came out and expressed their views and disenchantment with the Government and its absolute abdication of its responsibility to the citizens of this State.  It is absolutely appalling that we are not in a place where actual amendments to that Bill are not being drafted and that the Departments are still talking about it.</p></speech>

I can understand her upset and frustration.  It must be borne in mind, however, that policy and legislative proposals that may arise following the completion of the Department's examination of the committee's recommendation will require consideration and approval by Government.</p> <p>The Senator will be aware that, overall, there are significant challenges to be addressed in respect of policy and legislation, but also in the context of operational matters including the role of regulators, the courts and all parties involved in international surrogacy arrangements.  It is complicated by the fact that there is an acknowledged absence of any international framework for subsequent challenges associated with overseeing practices and services in other jurisdictions, including having assurances that surrogacy arrangements are of the highest ethical standards and prioritising those who may be most vulnerable to exploitation in international surrogacy.</p> <p>The limitations that arise in this regard are also acknowledged by the committee in the report.  However, there is a clear commitment to developing policy and legislative responses to the numerous complexities and difficulties which arise for us to achieve a robust and ethical framework for future international surrogacy arrangements and provide certainty for all those concerned.</p> <p>I will feed back to the Minister the Senator's disappointment at what she feels is an unacceptable response.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#D00700"><p>Yes.  The Minister of State knows I have enormous respect for her work but I am rather worried that she is the one who is in here answering a question on transport.  We fear and already suspect that the answer may contain the same level of obfuscation to which our colleague referred.</p> <p>We are talking about the east coast railway that runs from Dublin to Rosslare and which runs through the Minister for Transport's constituency.  As part of the east coast railway infrastructure protection project scheme review that was carried out by Irish Rail because of the fears of damage caused by coastal erosion and climate change to that particular track, it is now estimated that infrastructure works to simply keep the track open and survive will cost up to &euro;230 million.  This is something that has not just been signalled in the short term; this has been raised on a regular basis over the long term.</p> <p>If we are to look at shifting significant numbers of people into using rail transport, particularly from counties Wexford and Wicklow, then we must ensure that we have a reliable rail service.  We already know that the Rosslare rail service is not a priority for Irish Rail or the Minister because we are not getting the additional carriages that are being rolled out on the system.  If we do not have the infrastructure, however, we will not have a train track on which even the old trains will be able to run.  This report was carried out this summer.  We need to know, to be able to give assurances to commuters, that the rail line will continue in the long term and yet we have not heard from the Minister for Transport whether that level of investment will be made available.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#D00800"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  Senator Malcolm Byrne outlined our concerns with regard to the Minister of State's response to this issue.</p> <p>The Dublin-Rosslare east coast route has probably suffered from the least amount of investment over the 200 years of its history since it was delivered.  It has great potential and provides an opportunity to take people off the road but we are not availing of it.  The recently released report stated that we need an additional &euro;230 million just to maintain the track that is in place before we try to deliver any additional services.  In fairness, with regard to commuters from counties Wicklow and Wexford, once a person leaves Greystones there is an almost non-existent service.  I got into my car at Wicklow this morning at 7 a.m. and got to Leinster House at 9.15 a.m.  There was only one train that left Wicklow during that period.</p> <p>Not alone are we talking about investment to try to maintain the rail route; we need significant and far-reaching investment to provide serious train potential for our commuters.  If that is what we believe in, we need to invest in it.</p> <p>The current proposed draft policy with regard to the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area does not do justice to Wicklow once a person leaves Greystones.  The line from Wicklow, Rathdrum, Arklow and then on to Wexford is not getting the level of investment that is required.  It needs to go further.  We need to start talking about putting in lay-bys and double tracks where trains can pass one another freely.  We are wasting our time investing &euro;230 million unless we go that step further.  The greater Dublin transport strategy does not go far enough in what it is proposing.  We need significant investment if we are going to move people out of their cars and onto the train.</p></speech>

In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is currently in the D&aacute;il taking a Private Members' motion on the cost-of living challenges and different issues.  He was <i>in situ</i>as I was leaving the D&aacute;il Chamber.  On behalf of the Minister for Transport, I thank the Senators for the opportunity to address the issue before the House.  It is not my area of expertise, to be fair, but I will read out the response.</p><p>Coastal railway construction and maintenance have always been challenging and throughout its history, interventions have been required to protect the line from impacts on embankments, water coming over the line and coastal erosion.  I understand that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has over many years managed the coastal defence of the Dublin to Rosslare line and monitors the coastline erosion rates at key points along the railway on an ongoing basis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 2015, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, along with Wicklow County Council, co-funded significant erosion mitigation emergency works at The Murrough near Wicklow railway station.  These works were prompted by an erosion event that almost resulted in the loss of a section of railway line.  This joint collaboration was very successful and prompted the need to undertake a much larger multi-agency study of coastal erosion along this stretch of coastline.</p><p>A steering group was established with representatives of larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Wicklow County Council in February 2018, which agreed to undertake a coastal erosion study in accordance with OPW study requirements.  It was agreed that larnr&oacute;d Eireann would take the lead role for the tender process to procure a specialised consultant to undertake this study.  Within the scope it was envisaged to generate a high-level coastal erosion model for the scope area and then assess the results.  Each risk area would then be examined to establish the best solution to be installed, if any.  On foot of the consultant's review, a significant body of work was expected on receipt of the final report.</p><p>With the frequency and severity of impacts increasing, with climate change causing more impacts in the past 20 years than in the previous 100 years, larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has proactively commenced a major climate resilience programme to ensure the long-term protection of major sections of the Dublin to Rosslare rail line from the effects of climate change.  Following the climate resilience studies undertaken by larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in 2018, the east coast railway infrastructure protection projects, ECRIPP, was developed to ensure an effective preventive approach to the protection of the line.  ECRIPP is funded by the National Transport Authority under the National Development Plan 2021-2030 and through a range of interventions along the route, with a particular focus on the area between Merrion Gates in Dublin and Wicklow town, it seeks to secure the future of the line for generations to come.</p><p>The Minister is advised by larnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that detailed design and planning works, including environmental assessments and statutory submissions will be delivered under the first phase of the programme, for which Jacobs has been contracted as multidisciplinary consultants.  Options such as breakwaters, beach nourishment, onshore revetment strengthening and other interventions will be subject to detailed design in the first phase of the programme, which will also focus on planning and approvals.  As well as the requirement to protect rail infrastructure, noting that a number of locations are designated with special area of conservation and Natura 2000 conservation status, the protection of the sensitive environments involved will be central to the philosophy of the project.</p><p>I trust the Senators can see that this matter is being taken very seriously and that remedial action is under way.  I am not sure whether it answers their specific questions, but I take on board the point Senator Casey made that he left Wicklow this morning at 7 a.m. and got here at 9.15 a.m., yet there was only one train on the track during that time.</p></speech>

It is a little more hopeful, given that there is work being done and at least a plan has been put in place but, before anything else, we must ensure there is funding for the plan.  It is about being able to guarantee commuters that we will have a rail line in place because the report this summer said the rail line may not be in existence by the end of the decade if remedial work does not happen, and so it must happen.  As Senator Casey has said, it is about more than simply improving the rail line, it is about the delivery of quality of service.  We do not believe that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been doing that for commuters and travellers in Wexford and Wicklow in recent years.</p></speech>

I know she is only the messenger.  I served on the council when the event occurred in 2015, which goes to show that we are not taking the east coast rail line seriously if it took a severe weather event to create an emergency intervention to protect the line.  We have known all along that the rail line on the east coast is vulnerable and we have done nothing about it.  It took a storm event to get the issue resolved in 2015.  Unless we deliver in this regard, realistically, we are wasting our time.  We must protect the rail line and we must develop additional services on it.

If we are serious about climate change, rail infrastructure must be important.</p> <p>I have further news.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been monitoring this line and the effects of coastal erosion on it for many years.  Noting the increase in severity and frequency of erosion impacts, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has developed a series of infrastructure protection projects known as the east coast railway infrastructure protection projects.  ECRIPP, which has indicative costs of &euro;230 million, was included in the National Development Plan 2021-2030.  It is planned that it will be delivered over the coming seven years under a series of work packages for each location, including Bray Head to Greystones north beach, Newcastle to Wicklow, Dalkey tunnel to Killiney station and Rosslare.</p> <p>Apart from ECRIPP, there is ongoing funding for the protection and renewal of the rail network, otherwise known as the infrastructure manager multi-annual contract, IMMAC.  The IMMAC is a requirement of EU and Irish law and is a five-year agreement under the Minister for Transport.  The current contract covers the period from 2020 to 2024, inclusive.  I reassure Senators, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that measures are being taken to protect and maintain the rail network generally and specifically with regard to the Dublin to Rosslare rail line.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will engage with local authorities, regulatory bodies, local communities and interest groups to ensure this programme is delivered in a sustainable and cost-effective way.</p></speech>

It is a great day for Malta, which celebrates its independence on this date since achieving independence in 1964.

We are also neutral nations and members of the UN Security Council.  Our diplomatic relations were established in 1990.  It is a long-standing relationship built on our common membership of the European Union.  Our friendship grows stronger and we thank Malta for its support for Ireland during the very difficult and ongoing Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>We have sporting links as well because, in the city of Floriana, there is a football club known affectionately as Tal-Irish, the Irish, due to the fact the Royal Dublin Fusiliers were based there in the 20th century.  They had a green and white kit that they donated to the local team, which still wears those colours to this day.</p> <p>The excellent relations between Ireland and Malta were further strengthened by the visit of our President to Malta in May.

I have a family connection with Malta insofar as my mother's great aunt was a Little Sister of the Poor who went out to Malta aged 16 years, believe it or not, and was in the convent in Hamrun near Valletta.  I visited her grave some years ago.  It was a tremendous commitment on her part but it was also a very sad story.  She left Ireland as a young woman at 16 years and she never returned.  At some stage in the 1950s or 1960s, a group of our family were emigrating to Australia and the boat they took was to stop in Valletta.  There was great excitement as a package was prepared for a Sr. Louis Charles, as her name was.  She went down to Valletta to meet the boat but, unfortunately, there was a storm and the boat was unable to dock.  It was a terrible sadness at that time.  The boat continued and she never got to meet anyone from her family again.  It shows that, going back, the links between Malta and Ireland are very strong.  I have heard people say we are the only English-speaking country left in the EU, but of course that is not true.  It is great to see another English-speaking nation join us here today.  They are very welcome.</p> <p>In the context of the EU, colleagues here are members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.  It is responsible for the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, in Strasbourg.  This week it elected S&iacute;ofra O'Leary, the Irish judge, as the president of the court.  That is a tremendous honour.  S&iacute;ofra O'Leary is a very accomplished European lawyer and has a proven track record on the court.  It is very welcome that the honour has been bestowed on the Irish judge on the court and that she would be elected president.  It is important to point out the ECHR goes beyond the borders of the EU and to the Council of Europe.  It is an incredibly important body.</p> <p>One of the most important things we have done in Ireland in recent times, which I very much welcome, is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has moved to join a case against Russia under Article 16 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Russia has been excluded from the Council of Europe because of its illegal actions in Ukraine, but there was a six-month window which ran until last Friday within which actions could be taken against Russia in the European court for breaches of the convention.  I called in the House on 25 May last year for Ireland to initiate or join such a case.  I am delighted the Minister, Deputy Coveney has now done that and we will be part of an action taken by a number of European states against Russia for its egregious breaches of the convention against Ukraine.  We know the history of that conflict.  We have had Ukrainian MPs here and some of us have visited Ukraine.  It is entirely appropriate and laudable that Ireland would join that action and put down a very clear marker that we in no way accept the validity of Russia's actions which were compounded this week by Mr. Putin's support for sham referendums in the occupied territories in Ukraine.  I welcome that action by this country.  It is part of our proud tradition as part of the Council of Europe.  I congratulate the president of the court.</p></speech>

I have had the opportunity to visit Malta on the area of inclusion in sport, the Special Olympics and the Paralympics.  I know the Maltese have a very strong and proud tradition of excellent inclusion in their country.  I also add my congratulations to judge S&iacute;ofra O'Leary.  She is not only the first Irish person to hold the post but also the very first woman to hold the position of president.  We are all incredibly proud of her.  She is a very strong leader over in Strasbourg in the European world of justice.</p> <p>The National Transport Authority, NTA, has just released the new timetable to come into effect from 11 December, with additional train services in Mayo, Carlow and Tullamore and the commuter belt.  Newbridge will have 12 extra services, which will be very welcome.  They are very important to us.  There will also be additional services between Hazelhatch and Pearse and Grand Canal Dock stations.  I contend we need to have the extra services to Grand Canal Dock starting before Hazelhatch.  It is very important Newbridge and Kildare have the opportunity.  I got the train this morning.  There are only two of those particular trains and only one that would suit if someone had to be somewhere for 9 a.m.  There is a consultation on this on the NTA website.  It is open until Sunday, 3 October.  It is important the public gives its feedback and keeps pressing for the extension of the short hop zone to that area.</p> <p>I also raise the issue of modular housing.  All our communities and towns have been under a lot of pressure with housing, and at the same time they have shown a very strong welcome to the Ukrainians.  There is a pilot scheme of modular housing for Ukrainians in five counties.  I am not opposed at all to modular housing.  In fact, we should have been looking at them long ago for our own housing situation and for students.  However, I really object to the manner in which they are happening.  Two pilot sites have been chosen in Kildare.  There will be no planning process whatever.  Kildare councillors have just come through a very detailed process of the county development plan.  It is wrong when all that is ignored and there is no room for third level submissions.  It is the wrong system and the Minister needs to look at that.</p> <p>The Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel, ONE, looks after ex-military personnel and does incredible work in our communities.  We are very lucky it has a full-time centre in Athy.  Newbridge has a considerable concentration of former military personnel.  The St. Conleth branch in the Curragh camp has to leave because the premises is not suitable.  It is crucial we provide a place in the town of Newbridge.  It is basically an advice centre combined with a community-type men's shed.  The Department of Defence should help support it along with Kildare County Council.</p></speech>

I had the privilege of meeting them with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs committee yesterday.  I echo the Cathaoirelach's words and those of the other Senators on that.  They are very welcome.  We are friendly countries with a lot of cultural ties and many political issues in common.  It is great to have everyone here and I hope this will start a period of further friendship between our two great countries.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Leas-Chathaoirleach:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I echo the words of our Cathaoirleach.  I hope the rest of their trip is successful and that they have a safe journey back.</p><p>I return to the list of speakers.  Next is Councillor Sharon Keogan, my neighbour from Cavan.  I could hardly ignore a Cavan woman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#J00200"><p>I was elected as a Senator, but as the Leas-Chathaoirleach addressed me as "Councillor", that is fine.  I echo the welcome to the Maltese delegation.  I visited Malta this summer.  It is the most beautiful country.  If Senators have not been there, please go.</p> <p>I raise an issue regarding the Covid-19 inquiry.  At the end of August, both the UK and Northern Ireland established independent Covid-19 inquiries examining the response to the pandemic by Boris Johnson's Cabinet and the Northern Ireland Executive, respectively.  Ireland is nowhere to be seen.  Why is this country's leadership so afraid of accountability?  I first raised this issue in the House as far back as July of last year.  I knew then that the far-reaching and sweeping measures being adopted by the Government at the National Public Health Emergency Team's suggestion-order would demand retrospective appraisal and critical analysis.</p> <p>I reiterated the call for an inquiry in January of this year and we finally got the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste to spill the coffee and address the matter, with the former, amid much humming and hawing, making a promise to carry out an evaluation of how the country managed Covid-19.  Eight months on, that pledge seems to been given the old Irish political treatment of do not mention the war, hope that people will forget and sweep the matter under the carpet.  After all, we are in a cost-of-living crisis now.  Why learn from one crisis when we can jump straight into another?  The Taoiseach said he would prefer if we use the term "evaluation" as opposed to "inquiry", as the latter implies there are people to blame.</p> <p>The former minister for health in France was under investigation over her handling of Covid-19.  Investigators have concluded that there are grounds for prosecution.  Only in Ireland could the Government implement two years of rolling lockdowns, restrictions and various other direct interventions in the lives of members of the public and then turn around and say no one is responsible for that.  It is the insulating effect of a whole-of-government approach, perhaps.  The UK inquiry is set to become the largest statutory enquiry in British legal history, with 20,000 submissions passed last month.  The chair has told Departments there to protect evidence, including WhatsApp messages, from destruction.  It is probably too late for that here.</p> <p>Postponing the establishment of our Covid-19 tribunal serves no one but those who fear it and what it will find.  Ignoring the need for it completely would be an abject failure on the part of the Government and an insult to the Irish people, who deserve answers based on hard, cold facts now that the cobwebs of Covid spin and narrative-building have fallen away.  There are questions that need to be answered. I am not sure if even Ireland's carpet is big enough to conceal what happened in the past two years.  Our Covid inquiry needs to be established.  I do not know who the Deputy Leader wants to bring in here to tell us what is being done, just as long as there is someone who can say that we will start the process and mean it.  Government needs to stop hiding in the dark because this will not go away.</p></speech>

It is a wonderful honour and huge personal achievement for her.  She is, as Senator O'Loughlin will know, a particularly nice individual and a lovely lady who is proud of her Irish identity.  Her father was Captain of the Guard here and a member of the staff for many years.  It is something of which all the staff of the House can be proud.  We need to move on.  I will make no further interjections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#J00400"><p>It would have been good to welcome our Maltese colleagues but I look forward to the day we can celebrate the independence of our island from Britain.  I commend Malta, as an island nation on the periphery of Europe, on its support during the Brexit negotiations and on being a leader in Europe and across the world in the area of LGBT rights.  Malta was the first country in Europe to ban conversion therapy in a Act on which I based the Bill I introduced here.</p> <p>Every day, young people and students are boarding overcrowded trains because they cannot find accommodation in Dublin.  Hospitality workers tell us they are taking a year out from their studies because they cannot afford to pay fees.  We listen to young artists and graduates who are making a cultural and creative life in cities around Europe, including Berlin and Glasgow.  Those anecdotes are not the exception.  Recent Red C research for the National Youth Council of Ireland suggests they are becoming the norm.  It found that more than 70% of young people aged between 18 and 24 are considering emigrating because they think they would enjoy a better quality of life elsewhere, 80% are fearful of the future, 50% report worsening mental health in the context of the cost of living and 40% are less happy than they were six months ago.</p> <p>Those fears and belief are not unfounded.  A recent report by the Residential Tenancies Board shows average rent for a new tenancy in quarter 1 of this year was &euro;1,460 nationally and &euro;2,015 in Dublin.  What future is there for Ireland if we do not invest in our young people and solve the housing crisis?  The National Youth Council of Ireland has called for investment in youth services and mental health reform in budget 2023.  There needs to be targeted action in this budget for young people to address the cost of living and prioritise progress in tackling youth homelessness.  I support the National Youth Council of Ireland's pre-budget submission and call on the Government to consider it and adopt the council's proposals.</p></speech>

That was a great exemplar of proper adherence to the time.</p></speech>

The first is one I am sure other Members of the House have come across in recent weeks.  It is the delay in exceptional needs payments through the community welfare officer service.  I recognise the important work that our community welfare officers, CWOs, carry out each day on the front line of this cost-of-living crisis.  Over many years, I am sure like others, I have worked closely with many CWOs for the benefit of those that need help most.  However, the community welfare service is changing and we need to debate those changes in this House before the community and welfare parts of this once great service are taken away for good.  On average, I am told, exceptional needs payments take four to six weeks to get to the CWO for decision.  This is not good enough, as I am sure we can all agree.</p> <p>There seems to be an attempt on the part of Government to centralise the service, introducing an unnecessary and delaying step where clerical officers first see the claims, rather than the CWOs, as was always the case.  There is now a centralised phone number which many people I speak to find it impossible to get through, and which advises in the first instance that those wishing to avail of the system should send an email.  This is difficult for many of those who have to avail of the system.</p> <p>I spoke in this House before the summer of the additional needs payment which was announced by Government and advertised by the Department.  This scheme and the ads promoting it seem to have disappeared and been abandoned by the Department.  We are now in a cost-of-living crisis and are told it will deepen yet the service many depend on is changing and not for the better.  I am sure many Members have developed great working relationships with the CWOs in their areas.  That relationship is under threat.  The service is not working.  Those CWOs left in the system are being put under great pressure to change practices that have worked in our communities for many years.  They need our support.  Most importantly, however, the service must continue to do what it says on the tin.  It is a community service to assist those who need it most.  It must remain rooted in our communities and not be centralised to major towns and cities.  I would appreciate an opportunity to debate this with the Minister.  I raised it this morning at the social protection committee, of which I am a member, but I think we need to debate it in this House as well.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Like my colleague, Senator O'Loughlin, I welcome the extension of train services to Newbridge.  The short-hop zone needs to be extended too.  We will continue to campaign for that.</p><p>The second issue that I want to raise is the youth travel scheme.  I welcomed this scheme in this House previously.  I also welcomed that it has been extended to private operators, which was great.  As my colleague, Senator Warfield, said, we have a student accommodation crisis.  Those who are attending third level education who are 17 or 18 years of age cannot avail of the youth travel scheme.  They are outside the scheme.  I have been contacted by many people, particularly those of 18 years of age, who are paying double the cost that a sibling who is two or three years older paid to go to college.  They have no other option because of the accommodation crisis.  I ask that the matter be raised again and for the youth travel scheme to be changed.</p></speech>

I will compensate her for yesterday.</p></speech>

Over the last two or three days, we saw on social media what happened in Cherry Orchard in Ballyfermot.  I want to put on the record that these young people are not scumbags, thugs or low lifes in society.  They have been failed time and again.  Their parents and their grandparents have been failed by the State, by previous Governments and, unfortunately, by this Government.</p> <p>Instead of this House and the media calling these young people names, we should invest in young people.  By calling them names and feeding into it, we drive young people further into poverty and away from society.  We should not do that.  I know Ballyfermot.  I went to school in that area.  With all my heart, I say that Ballyfermot is the loveliest community in all of Ireland, even though Senator Ruane might think it is Tallaght.  For me, it is genuinely Ballyfermot.  People would give you the coat off their back.  I ask that we invest in services, including the Ballyfermot Youth Service, the Ballyfermot FamiliBase and schools, to support young people.  I ask that we have a Garda presence in our communities to stop what is going on.  I know, as a person who was born and reared in Ballyfermot, that we are not all bad people there.  If we were not failed by the State and had good services put in place, with good outcomes and jobs for people in this area, we would not see what we have seen over the last few days.</p> <p>On another note, I welcome a young Traveller man who is on placement at the moment.  He is not in my office, because I am not good enough for him, but he is with the Ceann Comhairle.  He is there today and will be there next Wednesday.  I welcome the opportunity for young members of the Traveller community to have placements here in our Parliament.  His name is James Stokes.  He said to Senator Conway earlier that he is going to be the Taoiseach.  I hope that James will continue to go into politics after hopefully having a positive experience here in our Parliament.</p></speech>

Members of this House have congratulated her.  It is great to have the insight that her father worked here.  It brings us even closer to her.  I congratulate her.</p> <p>I add to what Senator Flynn said about the videos circulating on social media.  The ramming of a Garda car anywhere in the country is disgraceful.  These are kids who have been abandoned and neglected by us.  These communities do not just need more resources, although obviously more resources are welcome.  There is a cultural and socioeconomic aspect to this.  We need a deep dive into how we can support and help communities more.  Many structures are already in place.  Some are supported, but some are not.  I know my colleague, Senator Ruane, has called for a citizens' assembly on drugs.  While it is not as simple as having a citizens' assembly on drugs, that would provide a deep dive into our communities and how drugs affect families, communities, housing and education.  It would also look at addiction issues.  We need to go back to what is causing these problems.  It is not just drugs, but also education.</p> <p>When the DEIS programme was originally set up, it was set up to combat social deprivation in our cities.  I welcome the recent expansion of DEIS to rural areas, but I think that we might have lost sight of what DEIS was actually about.  It was about giving kids an equal playing field.  It is great that rural areas and other areas in Dublin have got DEIS status.  It has lost the focus that was there when DEIS was originally established.  We need to go back to our education system and see what supports we can give our young people.  No one can decide exactly where to live.  Obviously, we would all love to live in a big palace with every support possible, which is not possible.  We do not choose where we are born.  These children are not affected by additional issues.  They are affected by addiction, poor housing and a bad education system.  The Government can do something to give them a better education.  My message is that we should look at DEIS.  I would appreciate if that could be brought back to the Minister.</p></speech>

I come from a rural part of the country where tourism is really important to how we will sustain ourselves in future.  Other speakers have mentioned the talk in the media and in political circles about price-gouging and hotels implementing costs for rooms and food which are too high.  There is a difference between a family-run hotel in west Cork and a conglomerate based in Dublin.  That rural-urban divide in the prices needs to be taken into consideration in the debate.  Last weekend, I went to a concert in Croke Park.  We drove back to Cork because the closest accommodation we could get had a price range of &euro;500.  There is an issue with price-gouging in the capital city.</p> <p>If one looks at that scenario in other rural areas, whether Cavan, Mayo or Cork, I do not think that is the real issue here.  We need to focus on rural tourism and trying to get people into the regions, in places like west Cork.  We are affecting that by talking down our industry, which is a real issue.  By talking it down and saying there are issues with price gouging, when we do not have such issues, there will be a knock-on implication for the sustainability of rural Ireland.</p> <p>I met a group of hoteliers last Monday at 7.30 a.m.  It was obvious that some would be closing for three months next October, because that is their model.  A hotel in Glengarriff would not be open for 12 months of the year.  Those hoteliers are looking at a scenario where they bring in Ukrainians or they try to sustain their model to go back into tourism next year.  The debate about the 9% VAT rate has to take into account the context of where the hotel is and not tar everyone with the same brush.</p></speech>

I am always apprehensive about speaking on these issues because some people would like to think that we are condoning behaviour when we are not.  People can call out behaviour as wrong.  What happened in Cherry Orchard is wrong.  How we challenge that is a whole different story.  How we speak about and understand it is much more nuanced than one will ever see online or often even in this Chamber.  Some of the commentary I saw online stated that there are no repercussions or consequences for these young men.  Their lives and how generations have lived for years are the consequence.  We are living with consequences every single day when we continue to bury our loved ones and our family members, and when we continue to be destroyed by chaotic drug use, by death in our community and by violence in our community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our literal existence is often the consequence.</p><p>A garda coming into an estate or a potential day in court is not a consequence in comparison with what people are actually living within their everyday life.  Of course it does not matter because, to them, they do not matter and their future does not matter.  They have never mattered and their parents never mattered.  How can they even begin to engage with a justice system as something that will deter them from engaging in any sort of criminal or antisocial behaviour?  Their lives are already so difficult that it is not relative.  You or I might be afraid of ending up having to do a stint in St. Patrick's Institution or Oberstown Children Detention Campus or of going to court because our lives are nice, safe and happy and we have a lot to lose.  If you have nothing to lose, how can you even begin to think that a justice approach or asking for more garda&iacute; will solve the problem?  There is something very wrong with our society if people have nothing to lose.  That is what we need to look at and invest in.</p></speech>

They are at a crisis stage at this point in terms recruiting staff but even more so in terms of retaining staff.  Many members of their staff go to work for the HSE and have left them in the past number of years.  They have struggled to replace them and this is for a variety of reasons, cost being one.</p> <p>People who do not understand the private nursing home system ask why we do not just pay them more money, but they have a cap on how much they can charge people who are coming into a nursing home.  They are limited in what they can do.  We have a crazy situation whereby people who would have worked in private nursing homes were not able to avail of the Covid-19 payment that people who work in the public health sector received.  Yet, if they move into HSE role, on top of having a higher salary, they can get the &euro;1,000 payment because worked throughout Covid-19 and because they are now in HSE system they can receive the payment.  This is another attraction to leave nursing homes and to go to work for the HSE.  This is a real issue.  I have spoken to a number of nursing homes that are at their wits' end in terms of trying to maintain staff and recruit staff.</p> <p>We, as a Government, are prioritising childcare.  We have new system in place for capping the price of childcare, for increasing payments for people who work in that sector and for supporting businesses to maintain themselves.  We need to do something similar for private nursing homes in order to make sure that they can maintain the quality service they provide, which is really important in local areas such as that in which I live in Tipperary, and that people who want to work in the sector are not being drawn away to work for the HSE.</p></speech>

A number of workers from the Irish Wheelchair Association, St. Joseph's Foundation and EmployAbility are on strike today in Cork.  Tomorrow, workers in the Western Care Association in Mayo, Ability West in Galway and selected community employment schemes in Donegal will be striking.  The final group of workers taking part in this wave of strike action will be those employed by Enable Ireland in counties Cork and Kerry.</p> <p>Here are the stark facts.  For 14 years these workers have been denied a pay increase.  Interestingly, when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, it was happy to include these workers in pay cuts, but now, following 14 years of a denial of a pay increase, the Government is unbelievably saying that this has nothing to do with it.  That is even though every one of us in this room knows that the only way these workers can get a pay increase is through an increase in grants to the HSE.  This is the second set of strikes to take place because of the Government&rsquo;s refusal to engage with the unions involved, namely, my union, SIPTU, F&oacute;rsa and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation.  I have to ask for how much longer will these workers have to go on strike?  For how much longer will they be ignored?  These are the very workers that the Government was happy to applaud during Covid-19.  They are essential workers who do transformative work with people with disabilities, children with disabilities and the most vulnerable people in our society.  The Government was happy to applaud them, and now it turns its backs on them.  They have been 14 years without a pay increase.  That is shameful.  There is no excuse for it.</p> <p>I ask for an urgent debate on this matter.  I would like the Deputy Leader to make a clear statement calling on the Government to engage with the trade unions without delay because these workers cannot afford to go on strike.  We have the greatest cost-of-living crisis we have seen in decades, and these essential workers, who look after the most vulnerable in our communities, have been denied a pay increase for 14 years.  That is a disgrace.  I call for an urgent debate on the matter.</p></speech>

I ask the Deputy Leader to get the Minister for Education to come before the House as a matter of urgency.  The Minister was before the education committee earlier.  People understand the flexibility that was adopted by the Department of Health during the health crisis caused by the pandemic.  People cannot understand why we cannot have that same flexibility within the Department of Education in the context of school transport, which has been in crisis.  There are places such as Strade and Ballyvary that are in dire need of having the situation with school transport resolved.  Buses are available, but it would seem that the Department is not in any way flexible.  I have seen that over a number of years, not just with this Minister for Health but also with a number of his predecessors and successive Ministers for Education.  The Department of Education is in no way flexible regarding school transport.  I ask that the Minister come before to the House as a matter of urgency because what is happening is visiting great hardship on a large number of families who have a lot to put up with.</p></speech>

I did that consistently with people in my own hometown of Dundalk.  I met one teacher who made to points that hit home.  Her name is Muireann O&rsquo;Keeffe and she teaches at a school in Ravensdale in north County Louth.  The two points she made relate to the pupil-teacher ratio and to the real lack of availability of mental health supports for students.</p> <p>In terms of the pupil-teacher ratio, when we look at it the European average is approximately 1:20.  In this country, many classes contain 28, 29 or 30 pupils per teacher.  Naturally, that makes it difficult for students to get the quality of learning that they can get during a class lasting 40 or 45 minutes.  If we can reduce the pupil-teacher ratio to the optimum European average of 20, that would be incredible.  It is easy to stand here and state that we should do this or that, but it will take substantial investment.  The INTO is looking for approximately &euro;20 million to deal with the pupil-teacher ratio.  Although it may be difficult to do something, that is no reason to have a lack of ambition.  We should aim to get pupil-teacher ratio down as low as possible and as close as possible to the European average.  I hope the Minister will look at the matter in the context of next week's budget.</p> <p>The second issue relates to mental health supports.  Many teachers have to fill a gap in the context of the provision of mental health supports in primary and secondary schools.  A large number of them are not qualified to do so.  As a politician, I am visited by and deal with people in my office at home.  I am not a qualified social worker, so I understand how certain teachers feel.  One of the key things that the INTO and teachers are saying is that if there was a grant of &euro;20 grant per pupil in the budget, the overall cost would &euro;11 million.  That would allow for on-site counselling.  This is what teachers in my home of Dundalk and in County Louth - particularly Muireann O'Keeffe, with whom I had a detailed conversation - have been saying to me.  I would like to see some action on this matter in next week's budget.</p></speech>

First, I wish to congratulate Shannon Airport on being shortlisted as being an age-friendly airport.  That is good.  The airports in the west were both shortlisted.  I wish them both the best of luck with that, particularly as the services they provide to older people are phenomenal.  It would be good to see the other airports offering the same level of service.</p> <p>I also raise the issue of the &euro;1,000 pandemic payment for staff who work in the medical profession.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many people who worked in the HSE have received their money but not, seven months later, those working in non-section 38 organisations, private sector nursing homes and hospices or those working in private and voluntary section 39 organisations, eligible staff who work on-site in section 39 organisations or in long-term residential care facilities for people with disabilities or agency workers in the HSE and healthcare support assistants.  Seven months have elapsed and none of them have received their money.  My understanding is that a third-party tender to assess how to administer the fund was sought.  On 9 September, the tender closed yet there still has been no communication as to whether people will receive their &euro;1,000 payment.  The delay is unacceptable because these people have worked during Covid-19 and been included in the scheme.  It beggars belief why a third-party person was necessary to administer the scheme.  I have seen a copy of a letter that was sent to staff in which they were told to wait until the third party works out how the scheme will be administered.  It is totally unacceptable that these people await their &euro;1,000.  I ask the Deputy Leader to write seeking clarification from the Minister for Health because I certainly have not got any clarification. </p></speech>

One issue that is of critical importance to this country's long-term social and economic development is investment in further and higher education.  We know that the higher education sector has faced a funding crisis for a long period and earlier this year the Minister, Deputy Harris, quantified the scale of the need for investment at &euro;307 million.</p> <p>We anticipate that the budget will contain measures to help students.  We have pushed for significant improvements to the Student Universal Support Ireland grants scheme and the Minister is looking to cut student fees.  I want to be assured that any additional funding that is provided for the higher education budget to support those initiatives is not done at the expense of addressing the core funding issue.  What we cannot see is an announcement for an increase in higher education funding but at the same time, because of a cut in student fees, the real income is cut to universities and other higher education institutions.  It is important that we have a debate on the future of higher education and higher education funding in light of what happens in the budget.</p> <p>Yesterday, An Bord Plean&aacute;la approved the development of what has the potential to be Ireland's largest film studio at Borleagh Manor, which is located just outside Gorey, County Wexford.  I congratulate Mr. John Gleeson and Mr. Ivan Dunleavy who have been the two primary promoters of the project.  A film and television production studio has enormous potential and this country has a strong record in this regard.  Given the number of new studios that are being granted planning permission, these are very welcome measures and we need to support the entrepreneurs who are moving in that direction. </p></speech>

The National Ploughing Championships commenced yesterday and continues today and tomorrow.  Very many people attended yesterday and are there today.  I look forward to getting there tomorrow at some stage.  However, one needs to know where one is going because the event is so huge that it feels like a jungle due to the amount of stands and everything else.</p> <p>Many agricultural shows have resumed.  In County Galway, the Ballyforan Fair will take place next Saturday and the Ballinasloe Horse and Agricultural Show will take place on Sunday.  These occasions are crucial because they are family events.  There is so much for people to enjoy, regardless of whether one has anything to do with farming or agriculture.  These are great events because they are local community-driven events.</p> <p>I wish to highlight the Night &amp;amp; Day Festival at Clonalis House, Castlerea, County Roscommon.  It is a beautiful estate and grounds located close to the banks of the River Suck.  It is a stunning location for a festival in the west of Ireland.  The festival will take place on Saturday and Sunday with performances by bands like Villagers, The Zutons and Cathy Davey.  There are five stages, including a comedy stage and political stage so I look forward to seeing Deputies and Ministers attending.  On Saturday, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, will attend around 3 p.m. and, on Sunday, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, will attend.  The festival has so much to offer people be it music or current affairs.  Finally, I encourage people to think about coming to the west this weekend.. </p></speech>

In terms of certain videos broadcast online, people are to be condemned for their behaviour and condemned for ramming a Garda car and my thoughts go out to the garda&iacute; who were in that car.  At the same time, stigmatising a whole area and community as a consequence, and labelling the people of that community with the hashtags that have been seen on social media is equally outrageous.  It shows a complete ignorance about the real lived existence of people in these communities.</p> <p>I spoke about the following issue with our MEPs last night.  Yesterday I received an email from the St. John Bosco Youth Centre in Drimnagh, Dublin 12 to inform me that its gas contract will go out of contract on 22 September with a resultant price increase from 2.6 cent per unit of gas up to 17 cent initially, then 22 cent and yesterday, the rate increased to 27 cent per unit of gas.  The centre hoped to lock the provider into a contract at the latter rate so the centre's gas bill will increase from &euro;700 to &euro;4,500 a month.  Let me put that in context by saying that drugs task forces have not had their core funding increases since 2013.  That means they have cut back on the number of people who work and reach out into communities.  If organisations are being faced with huge increases in their energy costs, the number of youth workers and community services will be cut back.  If we view videos from any area then we must bear in mind the fact that there has been gross under-resourcing, which is a fact that I have raised with my own party and at Government level since February of this year. </p></speech>

For example, the society has called for &euro;600,000 to be invested in its national care centre to fund the great work that is done to provide respite to people and people who visit on a daily basis.</p> <p>I wish to point out that the physiotherapy that people with multiple sclerosis, MS, need is not like what one sees when somebody runs on to a GAA field with a bag of ice.  I mean MS sufferers require physiotherapy on a weekly basis and usually for a lifetime.  Therefore, I believe that the State should fund the vast majority of this type of support because it is needed.</p> <p>We all know about the campaign that calls for the recruitment of an extra 100 neurological nurses.  I think such recruitment should incrementally happen.  While I acknowledge that this budget will not provide for the recruitment of 100 nurses, we should at least go a significant way to providing some of these much-needed nurses to care for people and support people in their homes.  Such recruitment would be good because caring for and supporting people in their homes is a lot less expensive for taxpayers than long-term residential care.</p> <p>Tomorrow is Culture Night and I am delighted that in-person cultural events will take place the length and breadth of this country after the last two years of Covid.  I wish all of the participants the very best, particularly those taking part in County Clare.  I hope that the weather stays dry and that Culture Night is very successful.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will host events for Culture Night that will include a Ukrainian element that will act as a thank you from the Ukrainian community who now live in Ireland, done through the Oireachtas.  It is wonderful that Ukrainian people are coming in and will play a full and central part in Culture Night in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I suggest that a Commencement matter raised with the Minister for Health might be the route she should take to get a date for that.  There is no fear of accountability in respect of Government action on Covid.  We have fared extremely well compared with our close neighbours.</p> <p>Senator Warfield spoke about the need to address student accommodation.  There is a particular crisis in that regard, with many students travelling long distances.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is aware of the challenges.  I expect that he is working with colleges across the country to address them.</p> <p>Senator Wall spoke about the exceptional needs payment.  It is taking up to eight weeks in some community welfare offices to administer those payments.  Work is actively being done to reduce that timeline.  When someone applies for this payment, he or she needs it sooner rather than later.</p> <p>The Senator also spoke about the youth travel scheme and raised particular issues about it not applying to those under 17 years of age.  I ask that the Senator raise the issue with the Minister for Transport as a Commencement matter.</p> <p>Senator Flynn spoke about an important issue relating to Cherry Orchard.  She was joined by Senators Ardagh, Ruane and Seery Kearney.  I concur with the Senators' remarks.  My first thought when seeing what had happened was that it was clearly a deprived community with few resources over many years, with the incident in question being the culmination of all of that coming together.  I concur with the Senators, particularly Senators Flynn and Ruane, that we should desist from labelling people, that no child is born bad and that, if there are unacceptable actions, as there was in the ramming of a Garda car, we must ask why it ended up happening.  Those were important remarks.</p> <p>I wish James Stokes well.  He is working with the Ceann Comhairle and is a member of the Traveller community.  Senator Flynn alerted us to the fact that he hopes to one day become Taoiseach and she hopes that he gets involved in politics.  It is great to see the link with the Ceann Comhairle's office.</p> <p>Senator Lombard sought a debate on the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  The rate is under active consideration by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  We will get more details on that next week.  The Senator also alluded to a rural-urban divide in terms of price gouging.  There are particular difficulties and challenges for the hotel sector.  Expensive hotel prices are not confined to Dublin and we have seen expensive hotel prices in many tourist areas.  It is unfortunate that some of them were excessive.</p> <p>I will pick up on a comment that Senator Ruane made about the Cherry Orchard issue.  She stated that many of these children felt that they had nothing to lose.  It was a poignant remark.  As she stated, we are coming from a safe environment and we have nice lives with plenty to lose, whereas every day in the communities in question is difficult.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn spoke about the need for a debate with the Minister for Health on private nursing homes.  That is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  The Senator's request for a debate will go to her office at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about section 39 workers, who are on strike.  I spoke today with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is working on this issue and agrees that there is undoubtedly a need for a pay increase.  It is long overdue.  If these workers did not do the work that they did, there would not be disability services in most parts of the country.  I hope that our Government colleagues examine this matter seriously and address it without further delay.</p></speech>

Free school transport was signed off on by the three Government parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  The intention was good and many families have benefited to the tune of &euro;650.  However, there was undoubtedly extra demand because it was made free.  Some people took tickets when they did not need them and are not using them.  That poses a challenge.  If we are to continue the scheme next year, we must consider having a nominal charge so as to put a value on it and ensure that those who purchase tickets actually want to use them.  We will see a breakthrough in this issue in the budget's cost-of-living package.  Obviously, I do not know the details of that, but it is a top priority for the Government to address the school transport issue and alleviate those concerns.  My view is that we need to get rid of concessionary and eligible tickets.  Any child who wants a school bus place should be given one.  We want to get cars off the roads.  Facilitating children in using school transport should be the aspiration, not this concessionary and eligible nonsense that is causing challenges all over the country.</p> <p>Senator McGahon spoke about mental health supports, specifically the INTO's request for additional mental health supports in schools and reducing the pupil-teacher ratio.  While we have made great progress in reducing the ratio in recent years, we still have a long way to go.  Everyone would love to reduce it to 20 students per teacher, which is the aim, or even less.  That is where we need to go and it is a top priority for the Minister for Education.</p> <p>I concur with the remarks of Senator Maria Byrne, who acknowledged that Shannon Airport and Ireland West Airport Knock had been short-listed for recognition as age-friendly airports.  I can attest first-hand to the services provided at Ireland West Airport Knock.  When I brought my grandmother through it, the service was amazing and the people there could not do enough for us.  I have no doubt that Shannon is the same.  I wish them both well in the competition.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about the need for a post-budget debate on funding for the higher education sector.  That request will be made and I hope that the Minister, Deputy Harris, will be able to return to the Chamber after being here for many lengthy debates recently.  I am sure that he will be more than willing to return after the budget to discuss the funding of higher education.  It has been an ongoing saga.  Ever since the Cassells report, it has not been addressed.  We need to get to grips with it.</p> <p>The Senator also mentioned Borleagh Manor in Gorey.  The film industry in Ireland is thriving.  Some high-level celebrities have come to Mayo in recent times to film, for example, Ms Emily Blunt.  It is great to see locations like Borleagh Manor doing so well.</p> <p>Senator Dolan encouraged us all to go west over the weekend.  I concur with her remarks.  She spoke about the National Ploughing Championships, the Ballinasloe agricultural show and a new festival, the Night &amp;amp; Day Festival, which is taking place in Roscommon.  I believe it is the journalist, Mr. Craig Hughes, who is organising that.  I wish it well.  It is great to see other people setting up new festivals beyond the east of the country.</p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney spoke about Cherry Orchard, which I have addressed, and the consistent underfunding in deprived areas that lead to these social problems.  We wonder why they are happening but it is because we have not supported these communities and they have been left behind.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland and its pre-budget request for funding towards its national care centre and rehabilitative services.  He also wished those participating in Culture Night, including the Oireachtas, the best for the event.</p></speech>

The motion was taken and approved by the D&aacute;il last week.  This motion is before the House following approval by the Government on 27 July 2022 of my proposal to establish an independent office to lead an intervention at the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam.  The proposal was made following the signing into law of the Institutional Burials Act 2022 earlier that month.  The Act, which provides the underlying legislative basis for the intervention, allows the Government by order to direct an intervention at a site where manifestly inappropriate burials of people who died in residential institutions have taken place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->An order can be made when the criteria in the legislation are met and where a resolution approving the draft order has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>The draft order for approval today directs me, as Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to establish an office of director of authorised intervention, Tuam.  It sets out the functions to be performed by the director and the land in respect of which the director may perform those functions.  The functions assigned to the director provide for the director to oversee a phased forensic-standard excavation, recovery, analysis and reinterment of remains across the full available site in Tuam.  The order also provides that the director will carry out an identification programme as an additional function for this intervention.</p><p>The situation uncovered in Tuam is truly horrifying.  It has shocked people across the country and, indeed, around the world.  The interment of children's remains at the site is clearly manifestly inappropriate and the statement of reasons for making the order, which has also been laid before the Houses, sets out how the site meets the requirements in terms of the legislation.</p><p>As I have said before, what happened in Tuam is a stain on our national conscience.  It is incumbent on us to address the situation as soon as possible now that the necessary legislation is in place and I am grateful for the early opportunity to bring the motion before both Houses.</p><p>Subject to the House's approval of the draft order today, and the completion of environmental screening requirements for the site, the Government can make the order and the office can be established.  I am committed to appointing a director and starting the excavation at the earliest opportunity.  In order to ensure that work can start promptly, preparatory works have already commenced by my Department.  Environmental screening of the site is currently under way.  My officials have been seeking sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and liaising with the Public Appointments Service on the recruitment process for a director.  Officials are also engaging with the Office of Public Works regarding sourcing a suitable premises for the new office.  Preparations are also under way for the appointment of an advisory board to support and guide the director in his or her role.</p><p>It is anticipated that the recruitment of a director will take a number of weeks.  Once appointed, the director will then need to engage a range of appropriately qualified experts to undertake the excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis process.  Engineering works and the construction of on-site facilities will also be required in advance of excavation of the site, which is expected can begin in early 2023.  I commend this motion to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#P00300"><p>I thank the Minister for being here.  I thank the Minister most sincerely for all of the work that he has done in relation to this matter.  As the Minister has said the situation uncovered in Tuam is absolutely horrifying.  It has shocked people right across the world.  The Minister is right when he says that it is a stain on our national conscience.  In the past the Minister has said that he would address this situation as urgently and as quickly as possible.  Now that the necessary legislation is in place it is good that we have this motion before the House today.</p> <p>Of course, when we talk about Tuam we must pay tribute to Catherine Corless and her incredible work and tireless research.  When Ms Corless heard local stories about the graveyard and the grotto, she heard about children finding bones.  Ms Corless was very suspicious.  She was also cautious and nervous because people were not comfortable talking about this.  There was a huge silence.  As we know, Ms Corless started to research the maps of the home and the grounds.  People had originally thought that there was a crypt there but as we know now the map showed that, sadly, it was a sewage tank.  Nobody wanted to know but Catherine became more determined, more focused, more upset and more angry.  She was more determined to absolutely get to the bottom of this.  It was she who discovered that 796 babies had died.  We cannot say they were buried there but their remains were put there.  Catherine Corless really has done an incredible service to those 796 babies, their families, the people of Tuam and all of us.  We must thank her for that.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il absolutely supports the motion that the Minister has introduced.  It is very important that an intervention is proposed under the motion and the Institutional Burials Act 2022 at the site of the former mother and baby institution at Tuam to comprise a full forensic standard excavation, recovery, post-recovery analysis and, importantly, reinterment of the remains discovered at this sad site.  It is also proposed that this intervention would include an identification programme as provided for under Part 4.  This will involve the director overseeing a programme of DNA identification to establish the likelihood that there is a familial link between people who believe they have family members buried at a site and funeral remains that are recovered from that site.  This will bring great peace and solace to many who feel that they may have family members buried there.</p> <p>It is very clear that the remains discovered at the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam satisfy all of the conditions for the making of a Government order as set out under sections 7 and 8 of the Institutional Burials Act.  These criteria are satisfied because there is significant evidence of manifestly inappropriate burials at the Tuam site.  This is confirmed by the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes in March 2017.  Judge Yvonne Murphy has given incredible service on that commission.</p> <p>We all know the background to the Institutional Burials Act and the background with regard to Tuam.  As we know, there has been significant evidence of the inappropriate burials at the Tuam site.  This was confirmed by the commission of investigation and further elaborated on its fifth interim report, as well in the expert technical group report.  It had been proven that the 20-chamber structure in which the juvenile remains were located was built within a decommissioned wastewater treatment tank.  It most certainly was not a purpose-built burial chamber.  Soil analysis suggests that it was also used in treatment of wastewater.  The remains are uncoffined, and buried collectively and in a manner and location that is absolutely repugnant to common decency.  It would have been so considered at the time the burials took place.  There is no doubt that the burial site did not provide for the dignified interment of human remains.</p> <p>Proposals for excavation, recovery, analysis, identification and reinterment are clearly appropriate and respectful.  The site of the proposed intervention, which is the principal burial land, is owned by Galway County Council.  The works that need to happen on this land would not extend within the curtilage of any dwelling.  I am aware that there are some houses bordering the site and it is possible that burials may extend beyond the main site, but this legislation allows the director to carry out works within 2 m of the site boundary.  With regard to the dignity of persons buried within the land this excavation, recovery and reinterment in an appropriate burial site will provide dignity to the children interred there.</p> <p>I am very pleased the Minister has met with relatives of people buried at the site.  It is clear there is very strong support for what the Minister is proposing here.  There is also very strong support for the DNA-based programme to identify remains where possible.  Everything the Minister has put in front of us is welcome.  It is sad that we are in a situation where we must deal with something such as this but I commend the work the Minister and his officials have done and I really hope this will bring some peace, comfort and solace to the families of those involved, and to the people of Tuam.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#Q00100"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I thank them for their continuous work on what is a very important issue.  I also thank the Minister for setting out the order, as promised, as per his commitment during our discussions at various stages on this issue.  I found most helpful the statement of reasons for making the order attached, from which my colleague, Senator O'Loughlin, has just outlined some of the issues in summary.  I want to turn to a number of the other issues, but I do not want to use this opportunity to make this a complex issue because people need to understand it.  While there are potentially some concerns, I want to extend the positive aspects to it.  It is a good day.  It is an order that I will support in this House.</p> <p>As the Minister is aware, the Institutional Burials Act 2022 was signed by the President on 15 July 2022 and commenced fully by ministerial order on 15 July 2022.  The Act provided a legislative basis for intervention whereby the remains of those who died in residential institutions and who were buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner may be recovered and reinterred in a respectful and appropriate way.  It also provides for the identification of the remains and for their return to family members where possible and practicable.  I believe these measures are appropriate, compassionate and responsive to the overwhelming outcry of the many families and the relatives of those involved.</p> <p>I want to turn my attention in particular to Tuam and the site there, which is still owned by Galway County Council.  A number of questions remain for Galway County Council and, in time, they should be revisited as there needs to be an explanation.  I am conscious that the council was doing its work as part of a State response.  It was a State-backed and financed administration in terms of some of the work that was being carried out in Tuam.</p> <p>I again acknowledge the work done by Catherine Corless.  She was brave and courageous, and she believed that more had to be exposed.  A lot of questions had to be answered.  She kept her nose to the grindstone and she brought people with her.  She also lost people.  I was struck by a number of things when I went to Tuam to visit her during the summer.  On my return, I told the House about it and I spoke to the Minister.  I met a number of people.  Catherine clearly believed in what she was doing, but other people were silent.  They were embarrassed and felt in some way that this was bringing a focus on their community.  As I walked down to the chambers in the little garden in the second section, which many of us know from the iconic pictures we have seen on RT&Eacute; News and in other places, I could not but help think there was a silence there.  There were the creaking, rusty swings of a children's playground right next door - again owned by Galway County Council.  I met other people later that day who felt that somehow they could not talk about it.  Many people were connected to the site through work and family.  It was a very difficult time for many people.  I am not too sure if everyone will ever get over it.  There are secrets there in the hearts and minds of many people associated with this terrible travesty and we may never be in a position to fully share and talk about them.  I am conscious that we are dealing with the emotions, history and circumstances of a lot of people, some of which will never be explained.</p> <p>On my return from Tuam that eventful day when I spoke with Catherine Corless and her husband, I was conscious that one could not but be moved by walking on the ground there and hearing their stories.  I came back and I relayed the story to the House.  I also spoke to the Minister.  He gave a commitment on Tuam in terms of overseeing excavation, recovery, analysis and reinterment of remains that have been subject to manifestly inappropriate burial at the site of the former mother and baby home.  To be fair, he has carried that through.  He has allayed a lot of people's fears.  I thank him for his ongoing engagement with people in Tuam.  They speak highly of the Minister and his active engagement.  It has not been an easy task.</p> <p>I note in the memorandum attached to this order that: "The Government is satisfied that the remains discovered at the site in Tuam satisfy the conditions for the making of a Government Order as set out...[in] the Institutional Burials Action 2022" criteria.  That is clear and it is very important.</p> <p>It is a sad fact that it has been proven that the 20-chamber structure in which the juvenile remains were located was built within a decommissioned wastewater treatment tank and it was not a purpose-built burial chamber.  That is a fact.  The burials are uncoffined, buried collectively in a manner and location that is repugnant to common decency and would have been so considered even at the time the burials took place.  The burial site did not provide for dignified burial of human remains and proposals set out for excavation, recovery, analysis, identification and reinterment are clearly appropriate and respectful and should be pursued.</p> <p>The Minister embraced the issue previously.  He again mentioned that he has met with relatives of persons buried at the site, with whom I have also engaged, and it is clear from them that clear, strong support was articulated for a DNA-based programme to identify remains where possible.  That is difficult and challenging but DNA science is progressing and I believe it can be and should be pursued where practicable and possible.  The order the Minister brings before us today is another part of the unearthing and unveiling of what happened to the children in Tuam in State-sponsored care.  We owe it to them and the people of this country that we unearth the truth, given that so many children who were incarcerated in Tuam and in so many other places were disposed of in an inappropriate way.  We must unveil the full story.  It will only be part of it, but it is a journey we must continue, painful as it is, bearing in mind all the circumstances and all the people affected by these issues.  It is the right thing to do.  I hope that this work can be undertaken as soon as possible.</p> <p>I thank the Minister and the previous Minister who did a lot of work on this issue.  It is important to acknowledge that, and also the support of the staff in the Department.  They are a particular group of people who have carried the burden of so much of this work.  I acknowledge that and ask that the Minister would personally convey thanks for the support to them.</p></speech>

The sooner we get through this motion and get on with the excavations in Tuam the closer we will be to families having some sort of closure, which is long overdue.  I am mindful and grateful that this is the honouring of a commitment made in July.  It is now September and according to the briefing note, it will be 2023 before there are excavations on the site.  In the meantime, we will have winter and I am concerned about the possible further deterioration of remains during that time.  We must move as quickly as possible on this issue.</p> <p>We are talking about children in State-sponsored care.  Yesterday, we had representatives of foster carers and social workers before the Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality and Integration.  They talked about the shortcomings for children in State-sponsored care today.  We have the hangover of the State-sponsored care and the people who were marginalised and who suffered from an inherent bias and a condemnation of them by virtue of their birth.  Unfortunately, it is a sadly repeated theme, and it is quite shameful that it continues.</p> <p>It is an open sore for the families.  I am mindful of the people who came in during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Institutional Burials Act and the absolute anguish they were going through, wondering what was there - if their sister or other family member were there and whether they could be identified.  In that context we have the horrible vista for them that they may not get resolution given that the deterioration may be at such an advanced stage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Reading the reports of the commission, they contain stark statements that lack hope, in many instances.  I found myself quite moved when I saw the television pictures of work beginning in Tuam, and I am not related to anybody there that I know of, barring any secrets which are very possible.  From the families' perspective, to see the site opened and activity on the site will be traumatic.  It will be important that we have services, that we highlight the supports that are available and that we acknowledge that the entirety of the truth coming out has been trauma-inducing for them, and the continuing process is trauma-inducing.  That is just the people associated with Tuam.  Then we have all of the other mother and baby homes survivors and those for whom this process, while it is ongoing, is also going to be traumatic.  I think it will be incredibly important that we advertise counselling services and that we ensure that adequate and proper counselling services and supports are available for people.  I am mindful that in the coming weeks we will be debating the Mother and Baby Institutions Payment Scheme Bill 2022 in this House.  I am mindful that the media reporting, as we move through the legislation that is desperately needed, is trauma-inducing for the people who are survivors.  It is a shameful stain on our State.  It is horrific.  It is important that we move through the process quickly, but it does bring me to mind of the children here and now.  What is the present day version of this?  Who are the children who are currently being neglected by our state?  I will come back to that another day.  I support the motion.  I am anxious that we move through is as quickly as possible, so I will keep my remarks as brief as possible.  I welcome the motion and the commencement of the works.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#R00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.  This is a very long overdue step in addressing the legal rights of the individuals and families who died and were disappeared in institutional contexts for too long.  They are individuals and families who have been impacted by so-called historical institutional abuse and have been sidelined.  Indeed, while this is an important step forward, it saddens me to note that those who will be directly impacted continue to have to learn about developments through the press or newspaper articles.  However, this is a step forward.  On such an occasion, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the extraordinary work of those who have campaigned for this for many years now.  In addition to the individuals and families, it is important to acknowledge the tireless work of Dr. Catherine Corless, as has already been done today, Conall &Oacute; F&aacute;tharta, Elaine O'Loughin, the late Dr. Vicky Conway and members of the Clann Project among others.  I would also like to mention Patricia Burke Brogan, who recently passed away.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a hanam. I wish to highlight the work that she did in respect of institutional abuse, in particular, the play Eclipsed.</p> <p>While I understand this motion relates directly to the creation of the office of director of authorised intervention in respect of Tuam, I would nonetheless like to highlight the importance of an independent review and the commitment to an independent review that was made by the Minister last year.  While it is not for us to speak to the trauma that this will inflict on individuals and their families, it is important to recognise the crucial role that inquests have in contextualising and examining how or when a person has died.  While I fully acknowledge the unprecedented scale of the task, the societal importance of the deaths demand that the State's failure of citizens be corrected.  The Minister has proposed a new initiative to support survivors to tell their personal stories.  I am conscious of the impact that retelling a story will have on many who have already engaged in this traumatic process.  Is it, therefore, a misunderstanding of the wishes of individuals and their families?  </p> <p>I would also like to raise the point that there are many more institutions to consider in addition to Tuam, including 14 mother and baby homes and four county homes.  The Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes investigated only a fraction of the institutions through which unmarried families were separated and in which infants, children and women died.  Numerous institutional abuse survivors are still campaigning for all institutions to be included in the Government's measures.  I call on the Government to address that unnecessary exclusion and the distinctions which have been the hallmark into inquiries into so-called historical abuse.  All survivor sites and burials are worthy of equal treatment.  That warrants mention today.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#R00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I rise today in support of the motion which will see the establishment of the office of authorised intervention that will oversee the excavation, recovery, analysis, identification where possible, and appropriate reinterment of the infant remains located at the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam, County Galway.  This is a development which has been far too long in the making and comes as a great relief to the many survivors and relatives who have campaigned for the excavation of the site over many decades.  I hope that this will be a helpful step in terms of bringing closure and delivering justice to those survivors and relatives.</p> <p>While I rise in support of today's motion, I also must take this opportunity to express the significant concern I have in relation to the intervention, or otherwise, at other sites where manifestly inappropriate burials are understood to have taken place.  We know that Tuam is just one of many sites where inappropriate burials took place, and while the nature of the burials in Tuam is known to be particularly abhorrent, this is not to say that other sites should not be intervened in.  This matter was debated at length in both Chambers, including the fact that we were legislating not only for the intervention at Tuam, but potentially many other sites where inappropriate burials took place.  We were reassured at many stages throughout the legislative process that our concerns regarding what we felt were narrow criteria for intervention were unfounded.  Despite this, survivors and relatives learned earlier this month that the site of the Bessborough mother and baby home in Blackrock, County Cork, unlike Tuam, will not meet the criteria for intervention.  This has aroused profound disappointment and hurt in many survivors and relatives who believed in good faith that the Institutional Burials Bill would bring about the closure and justice that they and their families so deserve.  I recognise that there is a difficult balance to strike in terms of the rights of survivors and relatives and the wider public interest.  However, I do not believe the justification offered recently to survivors in respect of the decision not to intervene at Bessborough is robust enough.</p> <p>The justification offered was that an order could not be made to establish an office of director of authorised intervention "in the absence of identifying the burial places of children", as this did not meet the criteria outlined in the Act.  Given that we only very recently debated the Act, and had extensive discussions regarding what exactly those criteria should be, this justification is especially frustrating.  A few short weeks ago, it would have been possible for us to expand the criteria such that sites like Bessborough could have met the criteria for excavation.  Many amendments were tabled to the original Bill in an attempt to do so, but they were not accepted at the time.  We now must bear responsibility for the Act and the criteria for intervention provided for by it as legislators.  The Act itself is not an external cause.  We made decisions regarding the criteria set out within the legislation and we now need to take responsibility for those criteria.</p> <p>Those survivors and other stakeholders who would like to see intervention at Bessborough deserve a considered response as to why one will not take place.  We have to understand that from many survivors' perspectives, by denying them a thorough investigation of the site, we are denying them justice.  I just want to briefly read from the words of Carmel Cantwell, although I know the Minister will be familiar already with her letter: "All of us in the Bessboro Support Group and the Bessboro Commemoration Group want the truth to be established.  We want to respect every child and mother that died at Bessborough even if that means after an exhaustive investigation no mass burial site is found&rdquo;.  When speaking about the decision not to excavate the site, she simply said: "This is not justice."  I recognise the complexity of the Bessborough site, and the wishes of some survivors and relatives that do not want the site to be disturbed.  However, despite our best efforts, it seems that we are lacking a balancing of rights and perspectives of the various groups within this legislation.  I am not sure how we can say that the legislation is fit for purpose if the wishes of a huge proportion of survivors are being disregarded.  Indeed, Ms Cantwell asked, in response to the announcement about Bessborough, "What was the point of the Institutional Burials Bill?"<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While that may be quite disheartening for us to hear as legislators, this is the reality in terms of what affected people are feeling and we cannot dismiss that.</p><p>If we look to the principles of transitional justice outlined by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a topic that has been spoken about many times within this Chamber and also at committee, it illustrates how transitional processes should be &ldquo;context-specific&rdquo; and &ldquo;focused on the needs of victims&rdquo;.  I am concerned that the Act in its current form does not meet those standards with regard to Bessborough and other sites.  I would welcome any clarification from the Minister in terms of any formal processes the Department intends to make or put in place to tease out the complexities of the Bessborough site.  What avenues will be explored to attempt to balance the rights and wishes of survivors of Bessborough, including those who see a thorough excavation as the only path to justice?  What other methods are being explored to examine the site forensically without excavation?</p><p>I welcome today&rsquo;s motion and the establishment of the office of authorised intervention in respect of Tuam.  I would, however, appreciate any clarification the Minister might be able to offer in respect of the other concerns outlined.</p></speech>

I am also grateful for their support in bringing the Institutional Burials Act 2022 through this House before the summer so we have the legal framework in place to allow us to respond appropriately to the horrific situation in Tuam.</p> <p>What happened in Tuam is an intensely human tragedy.  The drafting of this legislation has also been an intensely human process.  Senator Seery Kearney spoke about the many survivors who appeared before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in terms of the very lengthy pre-legislative scrutiny process it undertook.  I know a significant number of Senators present were part of that process.</p> <p>I visited Tuam last summer and met with a number of survivor groups, as well as with Ms Catherine Corless, and heard their concerns in terms of the coroner.  Every single one of them identified that as an issue, which strengthened my resolve that this was an issue we needed to address, and did address, in the process of pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p>Recognising the complexity of the investigation and excavation that has to take place in Tuam, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Niamh McCullough, who assisted my Department in the drafting of this legislation and, in particular, the introduction of the requirement that is now set out in the legislation that the investigation must be to an international forensic standard.  Similarly, bringing in the section on post-recovery analysis of the remains is a whole new part of the process that Dr. McCullough suggested was necessary.  This allows us, without in any way wishing to speak crudely, to seek to reassemble the skeletons of these children from these incredibly delicate remains so that when the DNA identification takes place, we have the best chance of providing families with as many of the remains as possible.</p> <p>This forensic investigation will be one of the most technically complex that takes place in the world because of the location of the site and the situation of the incredibly narrow concrete chambers in which the remains are located.  That process will be difficult for the families of survivors.  The National Counselling Service, NCS, has been established and is available to all survivors of mother and baby and county home institutions.  It is a free and detailed service that is available up to 10 p.m.  I encourage all Senators, many of whom have much indirect engagement with survivors, to speak to them and let people know this service is available.</p> <p>I recognise that other sites have institutional burials associated with them and, of course, in the context of Bessborough, there is a lack of absolute clarity in terms of the location of the site.  As Senators know, I intervened last year at Bessborough when there was a planning application in respect of an area that is recognised as a site.  That was part of a process that established a protection for that site in terms of the rejection of that planning application but also a subsequent change of status of that site by Cork City Council.  Similarly, I visited Sean Ross Abbey this summer and met with survivor groups.  We are working with survivor groups on a potential survey to see if the burial area actually extends further than that which is marked within the wall, and if a forested area serves as part of the burial site as well.  We are looking at what supports we can provide in terms of other sites initially on the issues of protection and memorialisation.</p> <p>Senators are correct; when we look to the next step, it becomes complicated because unlike with Tuam, there are strongly divergent views among survivors in other areas.  We must recognise that and I think people do recognise that.  We must recognise that the intervention in Tuam is very significant and entirely warranted.  However, making that significant intervention at other sites requires engagement and buy-in across the survivor community.  As Senators know, there is provision within the Institutional Burials Act to review the processes of the Act.  As we go through this process with Tuam, we can understand better what elements have and have not worked and what changes we can make to the process.  I am always open to engaging in that process.</p> <p>Today, however, I want to thank Senators for their support on this order.  This is important as it allows us now to begin the process of hiring the director and looking to secure the site.  Senator Seery Kearney is absolutely right in terms of the importance of securing the site as quickly as possible and, hopefully, early in the new year, beginning the process of excavation to finally provide some answers and a sense of peace to the families of the Tuam victims.</p></speech>

I will make a few comments specifically on amendment No. 94, which seeks to amend section 66(1) by proposing that the chief executive officer would impose on a designated institution of higher education a requirement to take a remedial or other measure or measures in accordance with this section, if he or she makes a determination that they must have approval from the board.</p> <p>My concerns in tabling this amendment are that when we make unilateral decisions, we cannot always be cognisant of the impact of such remedial measures on some of the other areas we spoke about, such as gender equality, equity, race, access and so on.  We do not want to be in a position where a university receives any sort of financial penalty that it then passes on to the student population or the priority groups we talk about.  How do we make an actual impact assessment to make sure that does not happen?  It is about making sure that the board has an input, or at least some sort of assessment has to be given to the board, as to how those remedial measures would impact on the student body.</p> <p>My other concern relates to where the money actually goes.  Where does that financial penalty go?  We have not put in any sort of ring-fencing to ensure the money that is paid back to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, when a penalty has been paid, will then filter into those priority groups or targeted areas for which we are penalising.  That is why I wanted the board to be involved in that process.  It is so that decisions are not made in isolation that have a further impact on students and the work in a way we do not intend.</p></speech>

I very much get the point she is trying to make.  To be clear, as of now, the law of the land is that, under the 1971 legislation we are currently governed by, the CEO of the HEA can solely, on his or her own, pause funding.  There is currently no right of appeal.  The CEO of the HEA can decide today to pause funding and there cannot be an appeals mechanism.</p> <p>Under the legislation we are passing, as the Senator quite rightly said, there is now an appeals mechanism.  She is very much correct that that appeals mechanism should be cognisant of the impact the withholding of any funds has on the student population, especially vulnerable learners.  One of the reasons we are trying to pass this legislation is to have a funding framework in place to know where the public investment is going.  It is entirely possible, through the funding framework we have, to include where funding is meant to go to protect any such funding pots from any such sanction.  I have to set up the appeals mechanism to reflect on and try to encompass what the Senator said in making sure the appeals mechanism is cognisant of that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The idea about ring-fenced funding is interesting.  As the Senator and I discussed, we do it in respect of the Criminal Assets Bureau and dormant accounts and the pots of funding arising from both that can be distributed and directed to further advance Government and societal priorities.  I will engage further with the Senator on that matter in order to see if we can make progress on it.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister if, during the ongoing work, we can continue to have conversations in order that the intention behind these amendments will be reflected in those appeals processes.</p></speech>

The issue is academic freedom, how much it can be applied and how much an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s can do to deal with that issue.  The Minister will be aware of the issues that have arisen.  I am not talking about any specific institution.  We have to be careful about how the objects laid out in section 8 apply throughout the Bill.  In what way will an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s take serious action to ensure that we maintain academic freedom within universities, third level institutions and so on?  We are aware of the Confucius institutes that exist in universities throughout the world and the funding that comes with them.  We are also aware of the danger that any state, particularly China, can wield, either subtly or directly, through those institutions.  It is tremendously important that this Bill, the Minister's Department and an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s make sure they have robust procedures in place to ensure the academic freedoms and academic independence of all third level institutions, particularly those in receipt of funding from China.</p></speech>

Academic freedom is at the heart and core of this legislation.  It is protected by this legislation.  On the broader point the Senator is making, this legislation will provide the HEA and an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s with the ability to co-design codes of practice and guidelines.  That is really important for greater transparency in the context of a raft of areas relating to third level education, including private or third-party funding sources.  The Senator's point is well made.  Greater transparency in these areas is good.  This legislation enables that.  Once we pass the Bill, which has been talked about for many years, and get it signed into law, it will enable good work to start on codes of practice, guidelines and such.  I am happy to engage with Senator Ward and the Seanad on the matter.</p> <p>I thank Senator Ruane for tabling the amendments.  It was worth waiting for her contribution, as always.  I understand what Senators Ruane and Higgins and others are trying to achieve here.  We believe the insertion of this new provision is not necessary, because there is not a provision in the Bill to provide that the Minister or an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s has the power to compel designated higher education institutions to dispose of land or other assets or to change the primary use of land or other assets.  I took legal advice on this matter and the view was that the provision is unnecessary.  There is no identifiable provision or power of the Minister or an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s in the Bill that this avoidance-of-doubt provision is seeking to limit or displace.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister.  It is good to see him.  I am standing in for my colleague, Senator Warfield.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has engaged extensively, as have the Minister and others on the committee, with this sector in recent months.  It is clear that the management of every institution has accepted the need for the highest standard of transparency and accountability over public finances.  That is beyond question, and the Government will always have our support for any policy that achieves this, but there are many proposals in the Bill that reduce the autonomy of institutes without any clear relationship with transparency or accountability.  I have yet to hear or see a convincing justification for dictating such rigid governance structures, for example, the mandatory 19-member limit on governing bodies.  The Technological Universities Act 2018 allows for a governing authority of between 22 and 26 members.  The Minister has changed his position on the number since the general scheme of this Bill was issued.  It was initially to be 17 members.  Now, the right number on the governing authority is 19.  I put it to the House that the number keeps changing because there is no magic number and no one size that fits all.  The people best placed to decide the right size of governing authorities are the institutions themselves.  These are unpaid positions and every governing body has its own unique make-up and tradition, and the removal of the broad representation on the governing bodies will be a loss.</p> <p>It is unfair to say that this Bill will move the sector to a competency-based governance model.  Currently, governing bodies are made up of members from academic and non-academic bodies, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, alumni, local authority nominees, trade union representatives, employers' organisations and others.  This expertise is vital, particularly in more technical areas like financial reporting.  However, we should not limit the value of the contributions from a wide variety of people.  I welcome that there will now be three student members and one academic trade union representative.  However, the Minister should reconsider the rigid, overly prescriptive governance structures and adopt a fair approach that can be applied to everyone without damaging the unique characteristics and differentiated missions of the various institutions.</p> <p>There is no indication that more ministerial nominees will lead to greater diversity.  Previously, ministerial or external nominees have had a strong bias towards business and corporate appointments.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, made an excellent submission during the Bill's consultation process and pointed out that the academic institutions with the highest reputations and most effective track records worldwide were those that enjoyed the highest levels of autonomy.</p></speech>

We can all acknowledge that universities are often a microcosm of society.  The same applies to student politics.  We must respect the mandate of elected representatives involved in those politics.  The Minister has expressed his belief that that mandate is protected in the Bill.  We all have different ways of going about things, and use different language, to ensure that the democratic process within a students' union is protected and that students' elected representatives are their voice on the board.  With a number of our amendments, in particular amendment No. 108 and a number of consequential amendments, we can achieve what the Minister feels is already being provided for in the Bill.  There is no harm in cementing that so as to protect the integrity of the process under future Governments and university and board compositions.</p> <p>I will leave it there.  We have discussed at length both inside and outside the Chamber the importance of protecting students' elected representatives on the boards of management of governing bodies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#X00600"><p>Yesterday, the Minister spoke about wanting future legislation that deals with students' unions.  If the desire to move forward is to be credible and if we are to strengthen how we think about students' unions and their role, it is important that we not move backwards.  The Bill refers to a student member on the boards of governance.  There is a danger that this will be a backwards step.  The Universities Act refers to elected representatives of students' unions and the Technological Universities Act clearly refers to representatives nominated by students' unions under their own procedures.  Both Acts cover the majority of our higher education institutions and cement in law the clear message that the voices of students' unions or those nominated by students' unions will be included and that these will be informed by a wider concern for that whole cohort.  There is discussion about the board and it being competency based, but a key element of competency - or anything in terms of a board or governance system that works - is the principle of nothing about us without us.  Given that students are numerically the largest part of the higher and further education institutions across Ireland, it is important that their chosen representatives - their unions, whom they elect - be in a position to put forward that voice within the boards and within governance decisions.</p> <p>The Minister will be aware that we have made a number of proposals setting out ways in which we believe the Bill can address this matter.  I urge him to accept them.</p></speech>

Where the composition of these governing bodies is concerned, it is important that students be included and that the student voice be heard.  It has traditionally been a closed shop to students.  Senator Higgins referred to the principle of nothing with us without us.  It is true that the student voice needs to be heard.  It is important that students' unions play a key part within our university bodies.  There is always a healthy tension in trying to achieve a students' union's objectives, working through negotiation with the colleges.</p> <p>When this new legislation is in place, it will be a joyous day.  It will be landmark legislation for the third level sector.  The Minister is examining other legislation, which he referenced yesterday, but having the students' voices heard within the governing body is crucial.  When considering a governing body's composition, it is crucial that it work well together to achieve excellence for that technological university or traditional university.  We have a new and competitive landscape and the people on the governing bodies need to be of a standard to compete at that level.</p></speech>

There is not a magic number.  There is no magic number for many things in life, though, and we have to make judgment calls.  During this process, I have tried to show a willingness to engage on the number.  The Senator is right again, in that the number has changed as a result of that engagement.  That is because I listened, particularly to the voices of some students' union representatives.  There is someone in the Public Gallery who was a president of the Trinity College students' union, Ms Leah Keogh, who convinced me to change my mind about the number of seats that students' unions should have on the governing authority from two to three.  That was a sensible decision in light of the rationale explained to me concerning the difference between undergraduate and postgraduate students.  I hope that this example encourages people in general and shows that changes can be made and that they can influence and make a difference to legislation.</p> <p>Through the regulatory architecture that this legislation will put in place, we are trying to ensure that the governing authorities can set regulations over how they appoint their boards.  I wish to be clear, in that I have no interest in me or my successors hand-picking every external representative to a board.  That is not the purpose of this provision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The purpose is to have an external majority and to bring a skill set onto a board.  I do not think the Senator meant me directly but he said ministerial representatives tend to favour business.  The best managerial appointment I made to a governing authority was Noeline Blackwell.  The head of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre was my first appointment to a governing authority in UCD.  There is a great diversity of people willing to serve. </p><p>I said in this House last night and will say again, so there is no confusion on the issue, that county and city councillors have played and continue to play an important role in our governing authorities.  Legislation passed by this House and by many in this House and the other House in 2018 on the technological universities did not give councillors a voice on the governing authorities.  Under this new structure, regulations will have to be set as to how the boards are filled.  Those regulations will have to be agreed by the outgoing governing authorities, which include councillors, and signed off by the Minister of the day, who is currently me.  I assure city and county councillors that we value their role, contribution and expertise and will work through this in the regulatory process.</p><p>Transitional arrangements are in place where people on boards can be reappointed to finish out terms.  We will work through that.  I acknowledge that Senator Boyhan raised this issue on a number of occasions.  </p><p>I come to the amendments put forward by Senators Ruane, Higgins, Black, Flynn and their grouping in the Seanad.  I thank my colleague, Senator Dolan, for raising this matter as well.  It is a case of listening as a Minister.  I am clear in my policy intent that the representatives of the governing authority should be those elected by the students of that authority.  Contrary to what I see sometimes on social media and read on posters, I have no interest in hand-picking people to be student representatives on governing authorities.  That was never the intent but if it was, why not be explicit about it?  I am willing to be explicit about it because when an amendment put forward in this House aligns with my policy view, why not accept the amendment?  That is the constructive role Seanad &Eacute;ireann can play.  I thank the USI, student unions, Senators Ruane, Higgins and Dolan, and my colleagues here for their work on this.</p><p>I propose to accept amendment No. 108, which will replace the words "student members" with "student union representatives".  I hope that puts people's minds at ease.  It is a sensible thing to do and shows the value of this House and of working through and teasing through issues.  I propose to accept amendments Nos. 125 and 135, which are consequential.  If I accept that, it is making sure it carries through to the rest of it.</p></speech>

The amendment will simply insert the word "affordable".  Affordability needs to be at the heart of housing in this State and that needs to include students.  I do not know whether the Minister caught the interview with Sarah McInerney on "Drivetime" last week.  There are absolute horror stories of students, from overseas in particular, being charged up to &euro;900 a month to share a room with three others.  I do not think anyone would dispute the fact that affordability is a massive issue for student accommodation.  In fact, I think we would all agree student accommodation is in a state of crisis.  This is a sensible amendment for which I hope we can win the support of everyone on each side of this House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#Z02700"><p>So many more students are coming into our universities and college, which is fantastic, but the need for accommodation is crucial, as the Minister is aware, and the new technological universities will have powers in that regard.  In my area, I constantly try to highlight the rent a room scheme and the relief that is available, whereby people can rent out a room within their house.  We have to see how universities can link in with their alumni networks and graduates who might wish to give something back to their universities, which could be by offering a room in a house close to the campus.</p> <p>With the technological universities, we are driving more courses out to regional campus areas where students can be handled and taken in and where there is more capacity to build student accommodation.  The technological universities are a great way for us to look at how we ensure we have access to student accommodation by driving out some of the courses into those regional campuses from the heartlands of the universities themselves.</p></speech>

There is a technical reason I cannot accept it, which I will read out, and I will then comment on the substantive issue he and Senator Dolan raised.  The amendment would amend the definition of &quot;an institution of higher education&quot; under the Housing Finance Act to which the Housing Finance Agency, for the purpose of providing accommodation for students, can lend to include both designated institutions under the Bill and other institutions in receipt of core public funding with relevant consents.  The amendment is outside the aegis of my Department and, therefore, I am not in a position to make an amendment to my legislation on this occasion.  Moreover, while affordability is very important, we would also need to attempt to define it within the definition.</p><p>On the topic raised by the amendment, I clearly agree with Senators Gavan and Dolan on the importance of building student accommodation that is affordable.  I have been clear, and I reiterate, that I do not believe the current student accommodation strategy is where it needs to be.  I can stand here in this House and quote figures showing the increases in student accommodation this year and last year, which would be correct, but that would gloss over the fact the model is not working for students.  In this capital city and other cities throughout the country, universities and institutions have planning permission today to build student accommodation.  I got an agreement in July at a meeting of the Cabinet committee on housing that we would bring forward proposals as to how we, for the first time ever as a State, would invest public money in student accommodation, and the <i>quid pro quo</i>for that will be that it will have to be affordable.  Before we give over a cent of public money to a university to unleash that building potential, it will have to be affordable.</p><p>I agree with Senator Gavan on the purpose of the issue, but I am not in a position to accept the amendment for those reasons.</p></speech>

Where I live, in Limerick, is probably no different from any other major urban centre.  I have been inundated, as I am sure all public representatives have, with communication from desperate families and parents trying to find accommodation for students.  Some of the prices being quoted are truly shocking.</p> <p>While we will agree to disagree on the amendment, I welcome the Minister's comments regarding the renewed focus on this issue, which I am sure all of us will keep a close eye on.</p></speech>

It also valued the role of Owen Keegan, the chief executive of Dublin City Council.  We also have the situation in other universities.</p> <p>It is a pity and a lost opportunity.  I am disappointed and sorry for the Association of Irish Local Government, which submitted a very detailed and comprehensive paper.  I acknowledge its hard work in making a strong case to have local authorities included on a statutory basis.  This House and the D&aacute;il have not agreed to it.  Ultimately, it has not been agreed by anybody, which is disappointing.  I take on board what the Minister said about the new regulations.  We had an opportunity.  Last night the Minister talked about bringing more people on and having more inclusivity.  In the statutory legislation, this Bill, we have specifically excluded an automatic entitlement of our local authority members.  That is a lost opportunity.</p> <p>I have worked closely with people in the University of Limerick.  They acknowledge the role of Limerick City and County Council councillors in preparing the university's master plan.  Much of that was covered in today's newspapers.  We have lost an opportunity and have failed to respond to the Association of Irish Local Government which mandated us and respectfully asked us to include it in this legislation.  That decision has now been made and there may be another battle on another day.  I wanted to put my disappointment on the record of the House.</p></speech>

I thank the Irish Universities Association, the Union of Students in Ireland and all the student unions for their input to improve the legislation.  It is positive that an amendment has been passed in the Seanad today.  The Civil Engagement Group tabled over 100 amendments to the legislation, which is what this Chamber is for.

Even though we may disagree with parts of the Bill which we think could be improved, I acknowledge the work of the students' union.  Today it has won the legal right in respect of boards which has been enshrined in legislation.  I finish on that positive note, notwithstanding other stuff on which we disagree.</p></speech>

I sincerely thank the team of officials who have worked on the legislation.  I thank Tanya Kenny, who is sitting with me, &Iacute;de Mulcahy, Stuart Morris and all the team in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p> <p>This is particularly significant legislation because apart from the substance of it, it is the first that my still relatively new Department has had passed.  I thank Seanad &Eacute;ireann for unanimously passing the Bill.  Not one Senator called a vote on the Bill.  I thank all the Senators for passing the Bill in its entirety today.  I thank everybody who has engaged with the Bill.  There has been very extensive engagement.  Senator Ruane mentioned a number of the groups, including the IUA and the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA.  I am afraid to name other groups in case I leave any out.  I also acknowledge the USI, individual students, individuals in governing authorities, and the chairs and presidents of governing authorities.  It would be awfully unusual if there was not a very detailed and robust debate on a Bill relating to the third level sector.  There have been points of disagreement and points of agreement.  It has led to a much better Bill.  We have amended the Bill on many occasions during its passage.</p> <p>In particular, in the area of the Irish language, the Bill is stronger than it was when it started out.  We made really good progress on the Irish language on Committee Stage in the other House.  I thank the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, the Office of the Attorney General and the Bills Office here.</p> <p>The last time we passed substantive legislation on how we govern the higher education sector was in 1971.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 1971, Ireland was a different place.  We were not in the European Union and there were 20,000 full-time higher education students in Ireland.  There are now over 200,000 full-time higher education students in Ireland so we are in a very different place and it is right and proper that we have modern legislation in place.</p><p>I want to assure people that this legislation is empowering in the sense that there is an awful lot of work to do once it passes.  There is work to be done on the regulations, on the composition of the governing authorities, on the city and county councillors and on guidelines, codes and practices we can put in place to have a truly transparent and modern higher education system.  There are also some immediate things the passage of this Bill will allow us to do, including allowing SUSI support for the issuing of scholarships for the first time and allowing St. Angela's College in Sligo to join the new technological university up there.  It will also allow us to develop new apprenticeships in the area of agriculture and farming, which is particularly significant as it is the week of the National Ploughing Championships.</p></speech>

While section 32 remains an important instrument in the oversight of the IAA, much of its intent is now addressed through oversight by EASA.  As such, the policy view in crafting the Bill was that a longer audit interval of five years was now more appropriate.  However, I have heard the concerns raised by Senators and have proposed an identical amendment to the Senator's amendment No. 3<i>e</i>to move the five-year period back to a three-year period.<br/><br/>Section 66 amends section 32 of the Act to explicitly provide that the Minister may, if she or he considers it appropriate, publish a copy of the report of the technical and safety examination.  While the intention was always to publish the report, it was considered that there may be limited instances where it may be appropriate that the Minister should have the discretion to withhold the publication.  However, I have heard the concerns raised by Senators and I have proposed amendment No. 3<i>fa</i>, which removes the Minister's discretion to withhold publication and requires the Minister to cause a copy of the report to be published on a website of the Government.<br/><br/>While I do not propose to accept amendment No. 3<i>f</i>as drafted, I believe amendment No. 3<i>fa</i>addresses in full the concerns raised by Senators.</p></speech>

The Minister should have the discretion to appoint the chief executive of the IAA for a period up to but not exceeding seven years.  The Bill provides for significant institutional changes to how aviation is regulated in Ireland.  It is creating a complex stand-alone aviation regulator.  Therefore, it is imperative that the chief executive be appointed for a suitable period that allows for focus on the long-term development of this important regulator.  That may require a time horizon longer than five years, that is, up to seven years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As such, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 3<i>i.  </i><br/><br/>Regarding amendment No. 4<i>a, </i>the existing text of section 77 provides that a committee of the House may request the attendance of the chief executive or a relevant officer of the IAA to account for the performance of the authority's functions at any time.

First, having the Minister appoint a chief executive officer to the IAA when the Minister does not have aviation expertise within his or her Department is a matter of great concern.  In fact, I am deeply concerned about anything that goes on in the Department of Transport at the moment while we are without aviation expertise.  We have hashed this out over and over again, over several months, and notwithstanding the fact that the air traffic investigation unit has pointed out the need for aviation expertise within the Department, the Government still has not appointed an aviation expert.  It strikes me that we are bringing in consultants to assist us with various issues within the Department and the Minister or Minister of State may contract in consultants to mitigate risk but what they cannot do is contract in responsibility.  The responsibility stops at the Minister of State's desk or at the Minister's desk at any given time.</p> <p>A seven year term is very long in any business.  If we end up getting a bum steer at some stage, we will be stuck with that person for seven years.  It is extremely difficult, notwithstanding the fact that there is an opportunity there for the directors to act, in this world to remove a CEO once he or she has been appointed.  The period of time involved is too long and that is why I proposed a five-year term.  Again, I go back to my concern about the lack of aviation expertise right the way through this Bill.  That is not the Minister of State's fault.  She is just the person fronting up this Bill but at the end of the day, it will have her name on it for eternity, as the person who brought the Bill to and through this House.  I have deep concerns and I will keep expressing those concerns.  There are no aviators in the Department of Transport so we are relying on the people for whom we are writing the legislation to advise.  The regulators are regulating themselves for all intents and purposes and I have huge difficulty with this.</p></speech>

His departure was a surprise and the fact that he is potentially moving to Wizz Air poses different questions.  The issues of concern to me are not really related to Senator Craughwell's point.  Mr. Dalton Philips has stepped down as the chief executive of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, and we now have a new interim appointee.  I wish her well in her position.  She is a former financial controller and is a very competent and capable person.  Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile is leaving the IAA and there will be an interim appointee to replace him too.  At a time when our aviation sector is in a very precarious position, I am concerned that we are losing corporate knowledge of significant status.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton and congratulate her on the appointment of Ms Paula Cogan to the board of Cork Airport.  My apologies, she was appointed to the board of the DAA but I wish she was appointed to the board of Cork Airport.  I thank the Minister of State for appointing Ms Cogan to the board of the DAA for a number of reasons, some of which are related to the points made by Senator Craughwell.  First, the appointment of Ms Cogan brings a person of significant status to the board.  Second, her knowledge and understanding of the tourism sector, the aviation industry and the strategic importance of Cork Airport to that industry cannot be overstated.  It is significant.  Ms Cogan comes with a wealth of corporate experience and is also the former president of the Cork Chamber of Commerce.  Her appointment by the Minister of State is an enlightened one.  I do not want be patronising but it is a wonderful appointment for Cork because Ms Cogan will bring to the board of the DAA not just a Cork perspective, a business perspective or a woman's perspective but a brilliant perspective that will enhance the operation of the DAA.  I thank the Minister of State for Ms Cogan's appointment because we have a real need to understand the aviation sector.  </p> <p>To be fair to the Minister of State, she was very proactive during the summer on aviation-related issues.  We have significant challenges, not least with Aer Lingus.  I know I am digressing and I will not digress further but will return to that matter later.  We have huge issues with Aer Lingus in how it is behaving towards the people of Ireland and, in particular, the people who use Cork Airport.  </p> <p>I stand primarily to say that I am concerned about the loss of corporate experience and wisdom while also rejoicing in the appointment of Ms Cogan to the board of the DAA.  </p></speech>

Not everybody in the country knows that the DAA also manages Cork Airport, which has been the left-out-of-the-room cousin for a very long time.  I very much welcome the appointment of Ms Cogan to the board and thank the Minister of State for that.</p> <p>Regarding the Minister of State's response to the questions I asked earlier, when will the Public Appointments Service, PAS, recruitment campaign begin, how long it will go on for and from where will the interim CEO-designate be appointed?  Will it be, as was the case with the DAA, a staff member from within the IAA?  Given that Mr. &Oacute; Conghaile's is not the only resignation from the IAA or the only loss of a senior member of the authority and given the disillusionment among staff at the loss of our most senior investigator, is the Minister of State worried about the resignations that have occurred in the last couple of months?  What plans does she have to address these issues so that nobody else leaves the IAA?  </p></speech>

In terms of the complexity around a stand-alone aviation regulator and what is envisaged here, having that window of up to seven years would be important given the importance of the role and the restructuring, which is what this Bill is all about.  Again, the term does not exceed seven years which is important to state.</p> <p>In response to Senator Doherty's questions, the PAS process will begin shortly.  There will be an advertisement on the PAS portal and an executive search as well.  There are two processes under way to recruit a replacement for the CEO and it will be up to the board to put in place an interim CEO as that process gets under way.  I acknowledge the importance of having somebody with great experience to come into this role.  I thank Mr. Diarmuid &Oacute; Conghaile for his service.  He is a person of great experience and professionalism and Oireachtas Members would have seen that at meetings they had with him over the past 12 months.  He has huge expertise behind him and I would like to thank him for the work that he has put into this so far.  Senators can be assured that my absolute priority is to get a very capable replacement for him, which is why we are running an open competition.  We want somebody who can bring the IAA through this transition and onto a new phase, in line with best practice across the EU.</p></speech>

We do not have anybody in the Department who has aviation expertise to assist in the short-listing of any curriculum vitae that might arrive in applications for the job.  We do not have anybody on the State appointments commission that I am aware of who is an aviator who can attest to or test the qualifications of those coming before an interview board.</p> <p>Can the Minister of State tell me if the Department is going to employ an aviation expert?  Are we going to constantly deal with contracted-in people who really have no responsibility to the State at the end of the day?  Responsibility lies within the Department.  I have a huge concern that we are working our way through this Bill safe in the knowledge that there is no aviation expertise available independent of the IAA that I am aware of.  We are putting through legislation for the IAA and its staff seem to be the people who are advising on it.  For me, it is flawed the whole way through.  I understand that the legislation has been handed to the Minister of State and she has been told to work it through the House, but there is a long-term responsibility.</p> <p>There is a standing Air Accident Investigation Unit report and it looks to me that the recommendations of that report are just being cast aside and we will continue on the way things were.  Four people are dead.</p></speech>

A different approach may be appropriate where it is necessary to have expertise to assess the conduct of the functions of the IAA.  The normal approach, for example, to the preparation of draft legislation is that proposals are drawn up by Department officials with responsibility for policy.  The Department officials are expert, having built their expertise through their career experience and skills development in public administration, and the acquisition of subject-specific knowledge.  Policy decisions are made by Ministers on the advice of officials.</p> <p>Almost invariably, proposals for legislation are subject to a consultation process.  We have had huge consultation in regard to this legislation, giving rise to inputs from stakeholders and interested parties that fall to be considered by officials in the first instance and, where appropriate, by Ministers.  Additional expertise was contracted to advise on the provisions in respect of this Bill for search and rescue.  As Members know, the Bill was drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.</p> <p>To reiterate, this Bill is principally about reforming structures to separate regulatory and commercial functions, rather than recreating the regulatory framework for aviation.  The vast majority of aviation regulation derives from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, regulations.  As Members know, I have also consulted with the Attorney General on the issues raised by Senators.</p></speech>

I understand what the Minister of State says when she talks to us all the time about the expertise that is available in the IAA.  Two things have come together rather unfortunately in the middle of this Bill; one is my amendment and the other is the impending departure of the CEO of the IAA.  Surely to God the IAA experts cannot advise the Department on the short-listing of the next CEO, which means it goes to a contractor to provide that because it does not have any other expertise.  Are we really going to hand responsibility over to some contractor to appoint the next CEO, or to advise the Department on the next CEO that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will appoint?  It does not sound right, if the Minister of State gets my drift.  I would much rather that we had an employee who was there and who the Minister could trust, and who-----</p></speech>

In fairness to them, they have asked us to speak to the section given their concerns.  The Minister of State might provide some clarity for them because, in fairness to her, she deserves to have her piece heard because we have heard one side from the retired members.  I know that the Leas-Chathaoirleach has said that the amendment is out or order because it is a charge on the Exchequer.  However, the retired members refer back to the 1993 Act and the whole issue of the transfer so I hope that we can get clarity on that.</p></speech>

To be honest, when I read the Bill I did not see the anomaly that the retired members have shared with us.  I cannot understand for the life of me why we would take people's benefits that they have accrued over a lifetime of service.  In addition, just because we are organising or re-organising to make this Bill more efficient it seems that we would interrupt those benefits and put people on a lesser scale.  Why and what is the logic for doing so?  Is there any movement so that we can assure that the people who have served the State in the Department of Transport for many years do not get maligned by what potentially is happening in the Bill that I did not see before today?</p></speech>

Employees should be no better nor no worse off under the new arrangements.  The Bill provides safeguards regarding this and ensuring this has been a key objective for my Department.</p><p>It is currently the case that the IAA may grant pension increases from time to time following authorisation from the Minister for Transport, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, any such increases are discretionary in nature.  Decisions around providing such discretionary pension increases are based on the IAA having sufficient funds being available.</p><p>There are other important considerations when examining pension increases, namely, the affordability and sustainability of the increase, and the impact that such an increase may have on funds of the pension scheme itself.  Additional considerations on providing for a pension increase also include the solvency of the scheme, scheme rules, the risk profile of the scheme and, as referenced earlier, the ability of the original employer to meet financial obligations arising from pension increases should the need arise.</p><p>On a regular basis the scheme actuary must certify that the scheme meets the minimum funding standards.  This tests whether or not the scheme holds sufficient assets to meet accrued benefits if it were to wind up on the valuation date.  Pension increases on a non-discretionary nature, as proposed in this amendment, would significantly increase the risk of a scheme failing the minimum funding standard.  Such failure would require that the funding proposal is put in place under the Pensions Act 1990.  A funding proposal could result in a combination of increased member contributions, increased employer contributions and-or benefit reductions to move the scheme back on track.</p><p>To be clear, section 114(2) of the Bill does not expressly provide for pension increases to Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, staff.  What section 114(2) of the Bill does is make it clear that any existing terms that allow for discretionary increases survive restructuring.  This amendment, which appears to have no precedent across the commercial semi-State sector, would see a cohort of employees becoming better off due to changed terms and conditions following the establishment of AirNav Ireland and the reconstituted IAA.  The amendment runs counter to the long-standing established practice in terms of superannuation and State agency restructurings, and could carry increased risk of a scheme failing the minimum funding standard with the commitment implications, as outlined.  As such I cannot accept amendment 3<i>ia</i>.</p><p>I wish to state that there are currently 443 pensioners who are beneficiaries of the plan.  The company has requested more detail from its actuarial advisers on the matter of increases to pensioners, which will inform decision-making under the process being chaired by Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  As Senators will know, Mr. Mulvey has been appointed to carry out a pensions review.</p></speech>

Annexe 12 of the Chicago convention concerns the establishment, maintenance and operation of certain rescue services by ICAO contracting states.  Annexe 16 of the Chicago convention concerns environmental protection measures undertaken by ICAO contracting states.  The Schedule to the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 sets out the annexes to the Chicago convention on civil aviation for which the IAA has functional responsibility.  <br/><br/>Amendments Nos. 3<i>j</i>and 3<i>k</i>amend section 71 of the Bill and, thus, section 78 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 to clarify that the Minister may, by order, assign functional responsibility for part of an annexe to the Chicago convention to the IAA.  Amendment No. 7<i>a</i>amends Schedule 2 to the Bill and, consequently, the Schedule to the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 to make it clear that the IAA has functional responsibility for the rescue co-ordination centres and rescue sub-centres aspects of annexe 12 to the convention.  In essence, this restates the position originally provided for by SI 171 of 1995 and SI 172 of 1995.  Related to this, I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to amend section 14 to assign an additional objective to AirNav Ireland to make it clear that it has the <i>vires</i>to provide aeronautical rescue co-ordination for search and rescue services.  <br/><br/>Amendment No. 7<i>b</i>amends Schedule 2 to the Bill and, consequently, the Schedule to the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993 to provide that the IAA has functional responsibility for all aspects of annexe 16 which concern environmental protection measures, with the exception of volume 4 which addresses the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation, CORSIA, which will remain with the Minister.  Relevant national agencies, including the EPA, engage with my Department in respect of Ireland meeting its obligations under volume 4.</p></speech>

Where non-compliance with an ICAO standard is identified the audit will identify the reason for non-compliance and report on whether a difference to the standard has been notified to ICAO and if not when a difference will be filed.<br /><br />(c) The audit shall also identify those cases where Ireland is not in compliance with ICAO Recommended Practices, the reason for the non-acceptance of an ICAO Recommended Practice, and whether and when Ireland will adhere to the ICAO Recommended Practice.<br /><br />(d) The ICAO Compliance Audit for any year will be presented to the Minister and published by the IAA within the first three months of the immediately following year.&rdquo;.   </blockquote> <p>This amendment proposes that there be an audit trail.  The amendment would insert a new section to deal with the IAA's oversight of compliance with ICAO rules.  From that point of view, it would leave us in a situation whereby we would have an annual report.  If there are deficiencies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what is required of the ICAO, then those deficiencies would be highlighted and identified, and remedial action could be taken immediately in order to put things right.  From that point of view, it would strengthen the Bill and make for good accounting and reporting.  I ask the Minister of State to consider accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

What open and transparent method will the Minister of State or the IAA employ other than an annual review which we have been told we will get every three years?</p> <p>I do not wish to hark back to previous debates, but the report into Rescue 116 took a significant number of years.  Unfortunately, a significant number of years later agencies and Departments have not complied with its recommendations of the long-awaited report,.  That does not instill much confidence that the new agency that is fundamentally responsible for every aspect of air navigation safety will report in an open and transparent way without this amendment.  Can the Minister of State reassure us that we have another mechanism whereby we can, on an annual, or much more frequent basis, get reports?</p></speech>

I reported earlier in the year that there were about 44 recommendations from the AAIU that were outstanding and there was no answer whatsoever as to what had happened.  This is precisely what Senator Doherty is talking about, that is, reporting mechanisms.</p> <p>After I spoke about the fact that these matters were all open with the AAIU report, within a very short time they were all suddenly closed.  However, they were closed in an unsatisfactory way.  It is very clear that in one or two cases - I cannot remember them off the top of my head right now - the IAA and the AAIU had accepted that steps had been taken but those steps were not consistent with what was required as a result of the AAIU report.  </p> <p>This is why the reporting mechanism is important and we have to be able to go back to look at audits and satisfy ourselves that things that were recommended and omissions and problems identified are actioned rapidly and not just closed off for the sake of doing so.  From that point of view, I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment.  We could get on really well if we got one or two amendments through.</p></speech>

Ireland's compliance with ICAO standards and recommended practices is subject to audit by the ICAO under its universal safety oversight audit programme.</p> <p>In 2013, the ICAO refocused its audit problem to a continuous monitoring approach to states' safety oversight systems.  This continuous monitoring approach includes compliance checklists for standards and recommendations practices, SARPs, for all 19 ICAO annexes.  There are currently over 12,200 SARPs, which include the facility for the filing of differences by states through a web-based platform known as the online framework, OLF.  The IAA and the Department of Transport are responsible for updating the relevant annexes on the OLF, in accordance with the respective responsibilities assigned to them under the Schedule to the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993. </p> <p>Ireland's responses to ICAO's SARPs are subject to EU co-ordination.  This means that we must await a co-ordinated response to be developed and agreed at an EU level prior to submitting to the OLF.  The ICAO SARPs also need to be transposed into the regulatory framework.  In the vast majority of cases, this means the EU regulatory framework.  This is part of the European Union aviation safety agency, EASA, rule making programme.  EASA provides pre-filled ICAO compliance checklists to each member state to assess the status of the EASA regulations against the latest ICAO annexe amendments.</p> <p>The compliance checklists are subject to continuous monitoring by the ICAO.  As the ICAO annexe amendments and the EU regulatory framework are continuously evolving, the information in the continuous monitoring approach system is always in a state of transition.  An annual audit report of this activity would represent a snapshot in time and the associated information may be quickly out of date.  It should be noted that section 67 of the Bill requires the IAA to prepare and submit to the Minister by 30 April each year a safety aviation performance statement.  Section 67(3) requires that a statement to include details of the activities carried out during the relevant year and the outcome and follow-up from external oversight in regard to the universal safety oversight audit programme of the ICAO be provided.  Section 67(5) requires the Minister to lay the performance statement before the Houses of the Oireachtas within one month of receipt from the IAA.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Given these existing mechanisms, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 3<i>l.</i></p></speech>

There was recklessness on all parts.  Very recently, I saw a tweet from the operator talking about leadership in safety and aviation.  Leadership?  Four people lost their lives.  Let us not forget that.  That is what this is about.  It may be a snapshot in time, but it is about having those snapshots in time.  It is about regular reporting that can be addressed at any given time so that remedial action can take place.  We do not need to go back to a situation where there is confusion as to who is responsible for what.  Again, I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Both of those recommendations, which were incredibly serious and related specifically to the Department of Transport, are in the process of implementation.  I do not think that puts us in the eighth position in the world at all.  I certainly do not think it is something to be happy about.</p> <p>While I take on board what the Minister of State said about a snapshot, the frequency of transparent reports, rather than being out of date minutes or weeks after they are issued, would show a work in progress or, unfortunately, when we look at our record, a lack of progress.  Given our ambitions for safety in air transport and navigation in this country, we certainly should be far more ambitious, open and transparent than we have been to date.  </p> <p>While I appreciate that the Minister of State will not accept the amendment, I ask her for better assurances than what she has put on the record of this House, that in a piecemeal way we report back to International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO.  That does not gives us any transparency or show any progress to the recommendations for improvements in the industry.</p></speech>

They are in place.  This is a continuous process, as I said.  In addition, as part of this Bill, there will be a requirement for the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, to prepare and submit to the Minister, by 30 April every year, a safety aviation performance statement.  Section 67(3) requires that statement to include details of the activities carried out during the relevant year and the outcome and follow-up from external oversight in that universal safety oversight audit programme of ICAO.  There are assurances there on ensuring oversight is in place.</p> <p>They are the positions; they are the facts about Ireland&rsquo;s position on the ICAO league table.  The importance of this Bill, yet again, is to ensure that we continue to maintain and strive to improve our standards.  That is why it is so important that we progress with this Bill, which is seen as best practice.</p></speech>

I am sure that ICAO was having a look over our shoulder or was it?  If it was and we were so compliant, how the hell did we finish up in a situation where an operator was acting recklessly with its crews, a Department had no means of overseeing what was going on and the Irish Coast Guard, which was directly involved, was not observing what was going on?  I find it very hard to accept that the ICAO was very happy with Ireland.  It surely cannot have been happy with Ireland back in 2017.</p></speech>

Where does ICAO fit into that if it is keeping on an eye on us and we are so compliant with ICAO rules?  How did we finish up where we were?  How did we finish up where the IAA was confused as to its role with respect to the monitoring and control of the search and rescue?  How did we finish up with a situation where crews were reporting problems and the problems were ignored?  Safety issues were being ignored.  The Coast Guard had no oversight whatsoever of the contractor that was working for it.  The Department of Transport had no oversight of what was going on.  This is why the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU, recommended that the Government bring on board aviation expertise in both organisations.  We have not done that.</p></speech>

The IAA has accepted all of the recommendations of the air accident investigation report.  It is important to reiterate that.  I said this previously in this House.</p> <p>We all have the same goal, which is ensuring that we have best practice and best oversight.  We have EASA carrying out that oversight, as well as ICAO.  I wish to reassure Senators that oversight is there.  This is a constant, continuous monitoring compliance process.  There are continuous checks and a checklist for standards and recommendation practices.  It is part of EASA - the EASA rulemaking programme.  EASA also provides pre-filled ICAO compliance checklists to each member state to address the status of EASA regulations against the latest ICAO annex amendments.  In addition, there is the section 32 review that I spoke about earlier.  It will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and be presented to the Minister.</p></speech>

The two recommendations that highlighted the serious impact of the lack of expertise in the Department of Transport, recommendations Nos. 2021029 and 2021031 have not been complied with by the Department of Transport.  They highlighted that there was no expertise on the books in the employment at the disposal of the Minister, whoever that Minister happened to be.  That was not true in 2017 and it certainly is not true today.  In her responses, the Minister of State stated that both recommendations are in the process of being implemented and she will continue to contract aviation expertise as and when she needs it.  I just want to put on the record that is not compliant with the two recommendations that were made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#OO01300"><p>I understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s bona fides.  However, in our wildest imagination, we cannot possibly say that we were compliant with anything leading up to the crash of Rescue 116.  The air accident investigation report is damning of the operator, the Coast Guard, the IAA and the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.  As my colleague just pointed out, two of the recommendations that were made about aviation expertise have gone totally and utterly disregarded.  I have said this time and time again as we progressed through this Bill - you can contract out risk if you want, but you cannot contract out responsibility, and the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department is responsible.</p> <p>I would love somebody from ICAO to come in here this evening and tell me that they were very happy with everything up to 2017 in aviation in Ireland.  If they were, they are as bad as the people who were damned in the AAIU report.  This is not the Minister of State&rsquo;s fault as she was not in office at that time.  She should not try to defend it, because she was not in office.  She was not there.  The bottom line on it is that the report stands for everybody to read and it is damning.</p></speech>

The statement the Minister of State just made does not give me any confidence that any of the commitments given on transparency and reporting with regard to the other amendments we have just disposed with will give us any real reporting transparency when this Bill is passed.  It is an absolute untruth to say that the two recommendations have been taken on board because they have not been complied with.  I do not know what part of accepting a recommendation is true when the Minister of State has not complied with the recommendation nor taken care of what she was asked to do.</p></speech>

I do not know how the Minister of State does that.  There are four families out there who have lost loved ones.  Are we trying to tell them that there was a recommendation from the AAIU and we are considering it?</p> <p>In the case of any air accident investigation report anywhere in the world &ndash; they are featured on Sky TV every night of the week &ndash; recommendations are implemented within weeks.  This is 2022 and the recommendations date from 2017, they were known to the Department very shortly after the crash, notwithstanding the fact that much of this had to go through a legal process.  We still do not have aviation expertise.</p> <p>It is a very simple thing.  We are employing a CEO of the IAA.  We can advertise the post straight away.  Why have we not advertised for aviation expertise in both the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard?  Better still why have we not seconded in somebody from the Irish Air Corps, people are available, into both Departments, or pilots from Aer Lingus or wherever?  Why have we not done that?  I cannot imagine what the families of those who lost loved ones think when they see how we disregarded key elements of the AAIU report.</p></speech>

The Irish Aviation Authority may designate one authorised officer as the principal investigator.  Any reference to an officer is a reference to one or more officers as authorised.<br /><br />(5) As soon as is practicable after being appointed to carry out an investigation, the authorised officer shall&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) give the air carrier concerned notice in writing&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) where the examination concerned is being carried out in respect of a complaint, setting out the particulars of the complaint concerned, or<br /><br />(ii) where the examination is being carried out of the Irish Aviation Authority&rsquo;s own volition, setting out the matters to which the investigation relates,  </blockquote>and<br /><br />(b) afford to the air carrier an opportunity to respond to the notice under paragraph (a) within 7 days from the date on which the notice was given (or such further period not exceeding 28 days as the authorised officer allows). </blockquote> <b>63H.</b>(1) An authorised officer who has been directed under section 63G(2) to carry out an investigation may, for the purposes of the investigation&mdash;

<blockquote> 	(a) a period within which, or a date and time on which, the person the subject of the requirement is to comply with the requirement, and<br /><br />(b) as the authorised officer concerned thinks fit&mdash;

<blockquote> 	(a) is also required to answer fully and truthfully any question put by the authorised officer, and<br /><br />(b) if so required by the authorised officer, shall answer any such question under oath. </blockquote>(4) Where it appears to an authorised officer that a person has failed or is failing to comply or fully comply with a requirement under subsection (2) or (3), the authorised officer may, on notice to the person and with the consent of the Irish Aviation Authority, apply in a summary manner to the Circuit Court for an order under subsection (5).<br /><br />(5) The Circuit Court, on hearing an application under subsection (4), where satisfied that the person concerned has failed or is failing to comply or fully comply with the requirement concerned, may&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) make an order requiring the person, within such period as the Court may specify, to comply or fully comply, as the case may be, with the requirement, or<br /><br />(b) substitute a different requirement for the requirement concerned. </blockquote>(6) The administration of an oath referred to in subsection (3)(b) by an authorised officer is hereby authorised.<br /><br />(7) A person the subject of a requirement under subsection (1) or (3) shall be entitled to the same immunities and privileges in respect of compliance with such requirement as if the person were a witness before the High Court.<br /><br />(8) Any statement or admission made by a person pursuant to a requirement under subsection (1) or (3) shall not be admissible in evidence in proceedings for an offence (other than an offence under subsection (12)) brought against the person, and this shall be explained to the person in ordinary language by the authorised officer concerned.<br /><br />(9) Nothing in this section shall be taken to compel the production by any person of statements, records or other documents or other information which would be exempt from production in proceedings in a court on the ground of legal professional privilege.<br /><br />(10) For the purposes of an investigation, an authorised officer may, if he or she thinks it proper to do so, of his or her own volition conduct an oral hearing.<br /><br />(11) Schedule 3 shall have effect for the purposes of an oral hearing referred to in subsection (10).<br /><br />(12) Subject to subsection (9), a person who&mdash;

<blockquote> 	(i) on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or<br /><br />(ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. </blockquote> </blockquote>(13) In this section, a reference to a document or record includes a reference to copies of such document or record.<br /><br />(14) The powers conferred under this section on an authorised officer to whom subsection (1) applies are in addition to the powers conferred on such an authorised officer under section 63C. <b>63I.</b>(1) Where an authorised officer has completed an investigation, he or she shall, as soon as is practicable after having considered, in so far as they are relevant to the investigation&mdash;  	(a) any information, records or other documents provided to him or her,<br /><br />(b) any statement or admission made by any person,<br /><br />(c) any submissions made, and<br /><br />(d) any evidence presented (whether at an oral hearing or otherwise), prepare a draft, in writing, of the investigation report (&lsquo;draft investigation report&rsquo;) and give, or cause to be given, to the air carrier to which the investigation relates&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) a copy of the draft investigation report, and<br /><br />(ii) a notice in writing stating that the air carrier concerned may, not later than 28 days from the date on which the notice was served on it (or such further period not exceeding 28 days as the authorised officer allows), make submissions in writing to the authorised officer on the content of the draft investigation report. </blockquote> (2) An authorised officer shall&mdash;  	(a) as soon as is practicable after the expiration of the period referred to in subsection (1)(ii), and<br /><br />(b) having&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) considered the submissions (if any) made in accordance with subsection (1)(ii), and<br /><br />(ii) made any revisions to the draft investigation report which, in the opinion of the authorised officer, are warranted following such consideration,<br /><br />prepare the investigation report and submit it to the Irish Aviation Authority with any such submissions annexed to it. </blockquote> (3) An investigation report and a draft investigation report under this section shall be in writing and shall state&mdash;  	(a) whether the authorised officer&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) is satisfied that an infringement of a relevant provision or, as the case may be, a relevant obligation of the air carrier to which the investigation relates has occurred or is occurring, or<br /><br />(ii) is not so satisfied, </blockquote>(b) where paragraph (a)(i) applies, the grounds on which the authorised officer is so satisfied, and<br /><br />(c) where paragraph (a)(ii) applies&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) the basis on which the authorised officer is not so satisfied, and<br /><br />(ii) the authorised officer&rsquo;s opinion, in view of such basis, on whether or not a further investigation of the air carrier is warranted and, if warranted, the authorised officer&rsquo;s opinion on the principal matters to which the further investigation should relate. </blockquote> <b>Irish Aviation Authority to consider investigation report</b><br /><br /><b>63J.</b>(1) The Irish Aviation Authority on receipt under section 63I(2) of an investigation report, shall, for the purposes of the inquiry concerned, consider the report and any submissions annexed to it.<br /><br />(2) Where the Irish Aviation Authority, in considering the documents referred to in subsection (1), forms the view that further information is required for the purpose of enabling it to make a decision as to the existence of an infringement, it may, as it considers appropriate, do one or more of the following:  	(a) conduct an oral hearing;<br /><br />(b) give the air carrier to which the investigation concerned relates&mdash; <blockquote> 	(i) a copy of the investigation report, and<br /><br />(ii) a notice in writing stating that the air carrier, within 21 days from the date on which the notice was served on it (or such further period not exceeding 21 days as the Irish Aviation Authority allows), make submissions in writing to the Irish Aviation Authority in relation to such matters as the Irish Aviation Authority may specify in the notice;<br /><br />or </blockquote>(c) direct an authorised officer to conduct such further investigation into such matters as the Irish Aviation Authority considers necessary having regard to the investigation report and submissions (if any) annexed to it. (3) Schedule 2 shall, with any necessary modification, have effect for the purposes of an oral hearing referred to in subsection (2)(a).<br /><br />(4) Sections 63H and 63I and this section shall apply to a further investigation conducted in compliance with a direction under subsection (2)(c), as if the reference to an authorised officer in those sections was a reference to an authorised officer directed under subsection (2)(c) to conduct the further investigation.<br /><br /><b>Power of the Irish Aviation Authority to decide to impose administrative fine</b><br /><br /><b>63K.</b>(1) The Irish Aviation Authority, in considering&mdash;  	(a) whether to make a decision to impose an administrative fine, and<br /><br />(b) where applicable, the amount of such a fine, shall act in accordance with this section. (2) Where the Irish Aviation Authority has considered a report and any submissions in accordance with section 63J(1) and, as applicable, having regard to its exercise of any of its powers under section 63J(2) and the outcome thereof, it may decide to impose an administrative fine in respect of any violation by an air carrier of an applicable requirement.<br /><br />(3) The maximum amount of a fine that may be imposed in respect of a violation is 10 per cent of the turnover of the air carrier in the most recent financial year for which audited accounts are available.<br /><br />(4) In setting the amount of an administrative fine, the Irish Aviation Authority shall take into account the following&mdash;  	(a) the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement,<br /><br />(b) whether it occurred negligently or intentionally,<br /><br />(c) the degree to which the infringement endangered public safety,<br /><br />(d) any relevant previous infringements by the air carrier, and<br /><br />(e) the principle of proportionality. (5) The Irish Aviation Authority, as soon as practicable after&mdash;  	(a) a decision to impose an administrative fine is confirmed under section 63L(3)(a), or<br /><br />(b) the court decides, under section 63L(3)(b), to impose a different fine, shall give the air carrier concerned a notice in writing, requiring the air carrier to pay the amount of the fine concerned to the Irish Aviation Authority within the period of 28 days commencing on the date of the notice. (6) An air carrier shall comply with a requirement referred to in subsection (5).<br /><br />(7) All payments received by the Irish Aviation Authority under this section shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.<br /><br />(8) In this section and section 63L, a reference to a decision to impose an administrative fine shall be construed as a reference to a decision by the Irish Aviation Authority to impose such a fine.<br /><br /><b>Appeal against administrative fine</b><br /><br /><b>63L.</b>(1) An air carrier that is the subject of a decision to impose an administrative fine may, within 28 days from the date on which notice of the decision concerned was given to it under section 63K(5) appeal to the court against the decision.  	(2) The court, on hearing an appeal under subsection (1), may consider any evidence adduced or argument made by the air carrier, whether or not already adduced or made to an authorised officer or the Irish Aviation Authority.<br /><br />(3) Subject to subsections (4) and (5), the court may, on the hearing of an appeal under subsection (1)&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) confirm the decision the subject of the appeal,<br /><br />(b) replace the decision with such other decision as the court considers just and appropriate, including a decision to impose a different fine or no fine, or<br /><br />(c) annul the decision. </blockquote>(4) The court shall, for the purposes of subsection (3), take into account the matters set out in section 63K(4).<br /><br />(5) In this section, &lsquo;court&rsquo; means&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) the Circuit Court, where the amount of the administrative fine the subject of the appeal does not exceed &euro;75,000, or<br /><br />(b) in any other case, the High Court. </blockquote> <b>Circuit Court to confirm decision to impose administrative fine</b><br /><br /><b>63M.</b>(1) Where an air carrier does not appeal in accordance with 63L(1) against a decision by the Irish Aviation Authority to impose an administrative fine on the air carrier, the Irish Aviation Authority shall, as soon as is practicable after the expiration of the period referred to in that subsection, and on notice to the air carrier concerned, make an application in a summary manner to the Circuit Court for confirmation of the decision.  	(2) The Circuit Court shall, on the hearing of an application under subsection (1), confirm the decision the subject of the application unless the Court sees good reason not to do so.&quot;.&quot;.  </blockquote> <p>Perhaps the Leader will have something to say while I search for my notes.

The IAA has available to it graduated enforcement mechanisms to respond to the particular type of non-compliance it faces.  Its enforcement mechanisms scale up from restriction of a licence, suspension of a licence and revocation of a licence to criminal sanctions, including summary prosecution and prosecution on indictment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It should be noted that the IAA has the ability to withhold part or all of a licence for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, and has done just that in the past.  The withdrawal of particular parts of a licence in respect of instances of identified regulatory non-compliance relating to those parts of a licence is an effective and proportionate enforcement mechanism.</p><p>In general, administrative financial sanctions are more suited to economic regulatory roles than safety regulatory roles.  In addition, administrative financial sanctions, as opposed to criminal sanctions, may not carry the associated reputational damage in the eyes of the public.  In terms of speed of enforcement, a direct path to the courts is the most effective means of enforcement.  An administrative fines system more often than not serves to delay enforcement because fines are issues and disputed, and then the fines themselves send up before the courts.  As such, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 10.</p></speech>

The Opposition is trying to strengthen the reporting mechanism after investigation.  The purpose of amendment No. 10 is to insert a new Schedule.  It relates to oral hearings and the taking of evidence under oath, which has not happened before and would certainly give the IAA, particularly the investigative team, an enormous tool.  It would strengthen their hand with regard to what we are trying to do, which is to ensure that airlines, all licence holders and any of the carriers, be they commercial or operating on behalf of the Government, relay all the information.  The delivery of the information under both would make it far more serious and consequential.  I am curious as to why the Minister of State would not want to give the IAA the powers in question.</p></speech>

In essence, we are trying to ensure a pyramid system in the approach.  This entails an escalated form of enforcement.  There are level 2 audit findings and then level 1 audit findings.  An advisory letter is followed by a warning letter, the restriction of a licence, the suspension of a licence, the revocation of a licence and criminal sanctions, which would include summary prosecution and prosecution on indictment.  What we are trying to do is ensure that the IAA has the tools in its armoury to ensure it can enforce safety regulations, ranging from restricting a licence to taking a prosecution in the courts.</p></speech>

What is wrong with having oral hearings and taking the information under oath?</p> <p>With regard to the pyramid, we are actually trying to strengthen the system we already have.  The Minister of State knows from the reports that have been issued based on the penalties handed down by the current IAA to any of those in respect of whom there has been an infringement concerning their licences or activities have been tantamount to nothing more than a slap on the wrist.  The licence holders, who are the people we are governing in addition to the airlines, are calling out for a better pyramid structure that starts with serious consequences.  I am not talking about criminal sanctions.  If we ever got to a scenario where these were needed, I would hope that there would be no stalling.  We are tinkering around the edges here without actually having any real impact on the infringements that are happening week in, week out in our aviation industry.  Given that we are changing the system &ndash; the Minister of State referred to revolutionary changes within the aviation sector &ndash; and changing the position on commercial operations and safety regulations, we are going to carry on with the same old, same old, with the same pyramid structure we have had, which entails a slap on the wrist and an ould letter to tell you that you did something wrong.  However, there will be no financial or legal impacts and no infringement actions associated with one&rsquo;s activities, be they commercial or those of a licence holder.  What we are doing is creating a toothless system, except at the very top of the pyramid, which can entail taking somebody to court and closing an operation down.  That has not happened in the history of aviation in this country and is not likely to happen in the near future.</p></speech>

It has done this.  Also, the withdrawal of particular parts of a licence in respect of instances identified in the context of non-compliance relating to part of a licence is an effective and proportionate enforcement mechanism.  It is important to state that administrative financial sanctions are more suited to economic regulatory roles.  I can give examples of other Departments that have administrative financial sanctions.  These examples relate to economic regulation, not safety regulation, as is the case in the Bill under discussion.  Four examples of administrative financial sanctions in statute are section 10 of the Central Bank and Financial Services Act 2004; sections 52 to 56 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which pertain to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland; sections 5 and 6 of the Energy Act 2016, which concerns the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities; and sections 137 to 143 and Schedule 3 of the Data Protection Act 2018, which pertains to the Data Protection Commission.  These all relate to economic regulations, not to safety regulatory roles.</p> <p>Section 74  adds to the enforcement armoury of the IAA by providing for fixed-charge offences in respect of summary offences specified by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Justice.  This instrument is intended to assist the IAA in addressing the issue of the misuse of drones rather than the more compliant airlines sector.</p></speech>

For that reason, I will not be in a position to disclose any information relating to the procurement specifications or anything that is commercially sensitive or integral to this process.  In addition, I reiterate that the Government is acutely aware that all major procurements must be managed in a compliant manner and that, to that end, safeguards are in place to ensure that the process is undertaken in conformity with procurement law.  A representative of the Chief State Solicitor's office is a dedicated adviser to the Department's project team for this particular procurement process and is advising on the process for and the preparation of all tender documents, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  In addition, a procurement process auditor, with the express task of providing assurance to the Secretary General, as Accounting Officer, on the conduct of the procurement process, has been appointed.  The assurances provided by the auditor to date are published on my Department's website.</p> <p>As I have stated previously in this House, the provision of an effective maritime search and rescue service is critical to Ireland as an island nation with a strong maritime sector.  The sector depends on the reliability and professionalism of the Irish Coast Guard and all its component parts, including the Coast Guard aviation service, to offer a service which can deploy at a moment's notice to rescue people in distress and to bring them to a place of safety.  The Irish Coast Guard has a distinguished record in delivering search and rescue services and a wide range of other essential aviation services for many decades, including the co-ordination and management, as appropriate, of aviation services delivered by the Air Corps and civil operators.</p> <p>The next aviation service contract allows the Coast Guard to meet its obligations as prescribed in the national search and rescue, SAR, plan and the national oil and hazardous noxious substances, HNS, contingency plan as well as its capacity to support other State agencies, in particular inland search and rescue support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and provision of air ambulance services to the HSE, including day and night support to the island communities.</p> <p>The issues raised by Senator Craughwell have been comprehensively addressed during previous debates in this House and through direct correspondence with him.</p> <p>I assure the House that the competition for the next aviation contract will be run in accordance with the public spending code and procurement law.  It is imperative that a suitable contract be in place quickly to meet our obligations to protect lives, to support communities and the maritime sector, to deliver on the national search and rescue plan and to provide value-for-money services to the citizen.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for being here, commend her on the statement she has made to the House and welcome that we have commenced a formal procurement process for a new Irish Coast Guard aviation service.  The tender was amended earlier this year.  The procurement process is, as the Minister of State said, commercially sensitive, and I will not stray into that.  I understand that the Government is acutely aware of the significance and importance of this contract and this service.  I thank the men and women who serve at critical times, on occasion in awful conditions.  It is important we recognise that the pre-qualification questionnaire, PQQ, evaluation process has begun.  I am only sorry we did not have the base in Cork, but we will not go into that.  There are four bases in Ireland.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for being here.  We will get our contract signed.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State will be well aware, Senator Craughwell has been raising this issue and the concerns he has about the contract week in, week out.  The one thing that bothers me is not his tenaciousness but the fact that the more he digs the more he uncovers.</p><p>What really struck me, as a former Cabinet Minister, is the information that was uncovered and reported on in not only the <i>Business Post</i>but also <i>The Irish Times</i>during the summer that the business case was prepared by a member of staff of the same company that applied for the contract in the last round of the tender.  While that is absolutely outrageous, with Chinese whispers and all the excuses that have been given as to how one person in one office did not know what the other office was doing and how we kept them separate so there was no issue, I do take issue with the fact that Cabinet members were presented with the business case without being informed that the same company would potentially and, subsequently, actually apply for the tender.  That company did not get the tender, but that is not the point.</p><p>Did the Minister for Transport or his predecessor go back to the Cabinet members who sat around the table and ask them if they would have made the decision to accept the business case on which the tender was then procured and created, knowing full well that it was by a member of staff whose organisation was going to apply for the tender?  If that had happened around the table when I was there, I certainly would not have made that decision.  It is incumbent on us now to go back to the Members who were at the Cabinet table at that time and who made that decision, not knowing that the business case was drafted by an organisation that then would be or could potentially be applying for the tender, and to ask them to review the business case again.  That would put paid to the current tender.  Given that this agency and this service, which acts on behalf of the State, is so important, however - and we can see how impactful it can be, not least the other weekend with the rescue of the gentleman who got caught in the cave - it is incredibly important that there is absolutely no ambiguity around the awarding of a contract and no sense of suspicion, which has been created in recent months and clearly highlighted by three of our leading newspapers on the back of the information Senator Craughwell has uncovered.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that in the letter of 4 August, signed by the Minister of State and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, it is stated that, as Ministers, they are somewhat removed from the day-to-day execution of procurement processes and that they have engaged with their officials to understand and to reply to the issues I have been raising.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is the Minister of State happy to be subservient to her officials in supporting them in blocking Oireachtas oversight of this procurement?  Does she have regard to how taxpayers' money is spent?  Is she even the slightest bit concerned that her officials are proceeding with the procurement of Ireland's next SAR service without the in-house aviation expertise the air accident investigation unit, AAIU, recommended following the fatal crash of R116?  Is she aware that the UK has just signed a SAR contract for 18 helicopters for 12 bases, including fixed wing and drone support, for a total of &pound;1.6 billion for ten years, whereas her Department's tender currently stands to cost us &euro;1 billion for five helicopters for four bases, and possibly &euro;1.5 billion by the time the contract is signed?</p><p>Is she the slightest bit concerned that before the contract is awarded plans are being put in place to circumvent the AAIU recommendation concerning new flight time limitations imposed by the Irish Aviation Authority on SAR operators?  The letter of 4 August states that the new regulatory framework underpinning this also allows for any operator, new or existing, to apply for a variation from the maximum flight duty period of 12 hours, which would allow for a full 24-hour crew roster, with the approval of the IAA, subject to the development of fatigue risk management systems by the operator concerned.  Has her Department learned nothing from the reckless management of SAR which cost four lives?  Is she aware that the UK fleet includes six AW139 helicopters which her advisers rejected without one scrap of empirical evidence to support their opinion?  Can she tell the Irish public what experience the advisers her Department is using have in SAR?  According to my information, they are not, and never have been, SAR pilots and they are not SAR crew?</p><p>Let me turn to the business case and Frazer-Nash.  The letter of 4 August dismisses any potential conflict of interest involving Babcock's defence and security group, which may be bidding for Department's Coast Guard SAR contract.  It is my understanding that neither she nor the Cabinet were made aware that all companies within the Babcock International Group, including Frazer-Nash, use the same secretariat or that all Babcock companies, including Frazer-Nash, use the same address.  Was she or the Cabinet made aware that the directors of Frazer-Nash held directorships in Babcock companies?  I have the names here but I will not read them out.  One of the directors, however, has 59 directorships in Babcock as well as Frazer-Nash.  Another director has 13 directorships in Babcock companies as well as Frazer-Nash, a third has eight directorships in Babcock companies has well as Frazer-Nash, a fourth has two as well as Frazer-Nash, while the final director has one.  All five directors of Frazer-Nash are, or were at the time, in some way related to Babcock.  Am I correct in my belief that the initial business case when presented to Cabinet did not highlight the connection between Babcock and Frazer-Nash?  Were any precautions notified to the Cabinet in the document when it approved it?  If not, for what reason was that left out?  </p><p>I now turn to the 415-page submission of the Air Corps.  The letter of 4 August states that the Air Corps provided its own costings in respect of its hybrid option.  It was noted at the time that the Air Corps proposal was reliant on the procurement of at least two additional aircraft.  How were a possible two additional aircraft costed?  How does one cost that in a business case?  Was it two, three or four aircraft?  How many aircraft was the Air Corps supposed to be charged to have?  The August letter states that the AW139 helicopter type originally proposed by the Air Corps did not meet the requirements of the Coast Guard in terms of payload range and interoperability.  I have seen the three-page document produced by Aerossurance Limited which criticises the 415-page Air Corps proposal.  Not one scrap of empirical evidence is provided.  Nothing is provided to support its view.  Can the Minister of State explain how the aircraft that will form one third of the new UK fleet and is in use all over the world in SAR roles did not meet the Irish requirements?  What do we know that the rest of the world does not know?  Was the submission from Mountain Rescue Ireland in which it stated that it had difficulty with heavy helicopters being unable to land on soft ground in the mountains, as well as the risk in cliff rescue situations of casualties being blown off the cliff due to the downdraft of these heavy helicopters, taken into consideration?  I invite her to look at the video made by CHC which refers to the difficulties caused by downdraft and the damage it can do in a rescue situation.  Was the question of operating costs considered?  It is clear that the AW139 is a much cheaper helicopter to operate than an S-92.</p><p>The letter of 4 August states that discussions are ongoing with the Air Corps on SAR.  When were the most recent meetings, phone calls, letters or emails on this matter?  Does the Minister of State support the Secretary General of her Department when he makes the most outrageous and possibly libellous allegation against the members of the Oireachtas joint committee?  He stated in a letter that another source of risk is the possibility that a member of the committee may have a relationship with one of the participants in the competition and might put questions to the Department-----</p></speech>

Does the Minister of State accept that the Oireachtas and its joint committees have an oversight and governance role set out in EU Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on procurement, particularly under Article 83?</p> <p>Finally, in the most recent SAR contract the public was told that we were getting a fleet of new helicopters that would cost &euro;40 million each.  We did not get a fleet of new helicopters.  We got secondhand helicopters and they were not valued at &euro;40 million each.  All I will say to the Minister of State is that I have not heard a comment from her or her Department that has convinced me that we are going the wrong way.  The public has a right to know.  Why is it that we can never deal with issues of public procurement in a proactive way?  This is how we finished up with a children's hospital that was initially costed at &euro;600 million but will probably cost &euro;3 billion.  Why are we always looking back, with statements from Departments saying lessons have been learned and they will not let it happen again?  Quite frankly, this is a disaster.  It should go back.  The Cabinet should say to go back and start all over again.</p></speech>

I am not as familiar with the area as Senator Craughwell or some other Members are but I have been a member of the transport committee for the past year and am somewhat familiar with some of the concerns of Senator Craughwell.  I appreciate that the Minister of State is in a position where it is a live procurement process and she feels very much restricted in what she can say.  I totally get that.  People who are bidding on the process have a right to have a fair hearing and a fair process.  There are concerns, however.   There are certainly concerns that Senator Craughwell has raised repeatedly and I would like answers for him, and for us all, just to put those concerns to bed one way or the other.</p> <p>I want answers to the questions.  I certainly want an answer on the issue of how much we will allegedly pay for what we are getting compared with what is being paid in other jurisdictions for what they are getting.  It may be that we are not comparing like with like, but I do not know if that is the case.  I need to see a process that allows me to recognise there is a reason, such as it being 24-hour service, extra services being provided here or the UK's Royal Air Force being a much larger air force than our Air Corps.  I do not know.  Certainly the very sad event of the R116 tragedy brought into our minds just how important the Coast Guard is and how dangerous a job it does.  It is really important that, in as much as the Minister of State, the Secretary General and the Department can, they answer these suggestions, allegations, complaints and issues.  They should put the answers out there where they can so do, and say that certain matters are not true or are being misunderstood or misinterpreted.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not as much of a conspiracy theorist as some people but I am not suggesting there are not questions to be answered.  There are answers that I would like to hear.  Senators Doherty, Buttimer and all of us would like to hear answers to various questions that have been raised, even if it is just to say that there is nothing to see here.  The longer we hear that we cannot talk about or see something, the more that leads to people having less confidence in the process.  We are overpaying for a service.  It is a vital service but we do not want to be paying multiples of what we need to pay for it because that money is then not available for all the other services we need to provide.  I thank Senator Craughwell for continually raising the issue.  He knows more about it and is more involved, over a longer period, in it.  He is not doing it for the good of his health or just for the sake of it.  He has genuine concerns and inasmuch as a Department can answer those concerns, it should.  There are rules about procurement processes and contracts and so on.  I am not making specific reference to this particular procurement process but there are things that possibly could be addressed in a wider sense regarding what we are looking for and what was the background to it.  I do not suggest that anything bad is going on here but the most important thing is that we can nail it by saying there is nothing wrong here, we have shown it, articulated the points made in greater detail and answered on every question as much as we can.  I thank Senator Craughwell for putting this down as an item for discussion and I thank the Minister of State for her response.</p><p>I appreciate the difficult position the Minister of State is in.  We have been on the transport committee and have had back and forth with the Department about whether we could meet its representatives in private, in public, or at all, or whether the meetings would be minuted or not.  All these various topics have being discussed.  We are all looking for as much transparency as we can get for the benefit of everybody but most importantly for the benefit of the users of the service and the taxpayers who are ultimately paying for the services.  We want the best service we can get at the best value.  It is important we understand why our contract appears to be much more expensive than others.  That is not about this particular bidding process but there may be reasons our process and contract seem to be much dearer than the other one.  Maybe we are getting many more services in our contract but I do not know that and that is what we need to know.  We need to understand what is being asked for of the contract and the contractor, whoever they are, who ultimately does this.  I get that there is not an enormous field of people who are able to provide these services.  It is a relatively small number of people who have the wherewithal to provide this contract.  I appreciate in some of these global, multinational companies that there are many directors who are directors of other companies.  I am not saying that any of them are sitting around talking.  There are usually Chinese walls in companies to make sure stuff does not happen but we need to nail all that down and show the public, Senator Craughwell and anyone else who is watching and is concerned about it, that we have done everything we can do as a State to meet international best practice.  </p></speech>

He probably knows the subject much better than most of us but he is raising very serious concerns that warrant further scrutiny and explanations.  I cannot help but note the fact that this is a discussion about the privatisation of an essential public service.  It seems the Government parties will never get their heads around the fact that privatisation is a failed project.  We are in the middle of an energy crisis.  The carving up of the ESB into EirGrid, ESB Networks and Electric Ireland has proven disastrous and is preventing us now from delivering for households.  We went from having the lowest cost of energy to the highest cost of energy by privatising our electricity sector.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy, a subsidiary of the British-owned Centrica, was also privatised.  Its operating profits surged by 74% in the first half of this year but we cannot recoup them because it was sold off in 2013.  We sold off Aer Lingus, our airline, and look at the disaster we are seeing now in terms of the service it is offering to customers.  I could go on.  It is very clear that the Government today has not learned the lessons of previous Governments when it looks at privatising yet another public service.  A service such as the Coast Guard is fundamental to any State and to see that being privatised is a disgrace.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in public services and public ownership for the public good.  Apart from the fact that we always sell off our assets and our State silver in privatisation, we also do not seem to learn any lessons from the procurement processes of large projects.  The children's hospital has been cited as one such example where there is a bottomless pit of public money.  Sinn F&eacute;in representatives have spoken in the House on many occasions on ways to improve the procurement process; not only in terms of having better oversight and transparency, but also around having a social element to it and ensuring it is not just the lowest cost bidder that gets the tender.  When we are tendering out to procurement using public money, the communities in those areas should benefit.  We should not just look at the profit line but should take other factors into account as well.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell is right to raise the issue around the Secretary General declining to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee.  In setting out his reasoning, the Secretary General emphasised the importance of ensuring that tendering companies are treated equally and in a transparent, proportionate, manner.  It is hard to fathom how somebody can come to the mental gymnastics required to say that appearing before a Oireachtas joint committee would jeopardise transparency.  With all due respect, it is some feat of mental gymnastics to use that excuse.  The Oireachtas joint committee has an important role in the governance and oversight of procurement.  The EU directive quoted by the Secretary General, namely, EU Directive 2014/24/EU, which was used to defend not appearing before the committee publically is very clear about the function of oversight.  I do not know whether it was a mistake in using that directive as justification or they were hoping that people would not actually read the directive.  It states that where monitoring authorities or structures, such as the Oireachtas joint committee, are informed of or investigate information on specific violations or problems that "they shall be empowered to indicate those problems to national auditing authorities, courts or tribunals or other appropriate authorities or structures, such as the ombudsman, national parliaments or committees thereof".  Either the directive was not read or it was deliberately misrepresented.  The State has made several blunders recently in terms of procurement.  The emergency electricity generation also failed to deliver because of the procurement process.  Very serious questions have been raised and we deserve to have answers when we are spending public money, especially on something as important as the Coast Guard service.   </p></speech>

There are synergies there between the old elements of the Coast Guard service, particularly Rescue 117, which was based at Waterford Airport, the South Eastern Mountain Rescue and our ground crews across all of the bases in Waterford.  It is very important that we provide them with the best of equipment and facilities and obviously this new station is going to be hugely important in that respect. </p> <p>When I spoke on this particular issue last January, I said that I did not share the downbeat assessment that the base in Waterford would be lost.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was unfortunate at that time, in January, that Senator Craughwell took to Twitter, stating:</p><blockquote>	I see the tender is out.  Clearly, one station is not being renewed.  I expect Waterford is gone. </blockquote><p>It caused a great deal of unnecessary distress within my own community in Waterford and the entire south-east region.  I put on record my thanks to the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, and Government for moving to clear up the uncertainty that was put out there in the public domain in relation to the base at Waterford and the excellent service provided by all of crew members.  The Minister of State visited Waterford Airport only prior to the summer recess where she awarded winchperson, Sarah Courtney, a bravery medal for her excellent work along with the crews based out of Waterford Airport.<br/><br/>I do not envy the Minister of State her job.  She has a difficult task in overseeing what is a highly commercially-sensitive process.  I wish the Minister of State well in that respect.  Some of the points that Senator Horkan referenced, in terms of whether we are comparing apples with apples and oranges with oranges, like with like, are relevant here.  No doubt the Minister of State will steer the course in this process that will ensure that the best service possible is provided to the people who need it most and that that service will be available night or day, 24/7, 365 days of the year.  That is what we should not forget.  While value for money, of course, is very important for the State, fundamentally what is most important here is that we have a service of excellent quality that is able to rescue people in their hour of need.<br/><br/>The service that is provided across the four bases currently, Sligo, Shannon, Waterford and Dublin, is second to none.  I want to put on record my thanks to all of the service personnel in those bases for their excellent service.  I have no doubt that they will continue that over the next number of years.</p></speech>

She was with us this morning at the Joint Committee on Education Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and she also came to join us for our joint-Senator Commencement matter last week.  The Minister has listened to the representatives in this Chamber and she has probably heard, in both Houses, about the challenges that people throughout the country are facing.  </p><p>This programme is a fantastic initiative.  The intent was to reduce the cost of living for many families by reducing a cost that was &euro;650 per year down to &euro;500 per year and, eventually, to offer it to families for free this year.  Of course, we are all now aware of the challenges that have come with that.  We wish to acknowledge this has been a fantastic initiative.  The Minister has noted that &euro;300 million of Government spending already has gone on this initiative that has delivered free transport for more than 124,000 mainstream students.  Is there a separate category for children with special needs additional to this?  However, I know the increase on last year has been massive and 44,000 new families have come on board.</p><p>The fantastic thing here is that it makes our roads safer.  It makes pick-up and drop-off at schools safer, especially in rural areas where schools are on busy roads that could be in an 80 km/h zone instead of a 50 km/h zone.  It has an amazing impact.  However the reason we are here today and the reason Fine Gael Members have brought this motion is that we need to see solutions and additional funding put in place for the 6,000 children whose parents have applied for places, as part of the more than 130,000 applications and yet who have no possibility of access to tickets.</p><p>I have attended public meetings in the constituency in which I live for parents who are trying to get children to schools in Mountbellew, Ballygar or Ballinasloe.  I believe the reason that this has an impact on rural areas is the catchment area of smaller towns.  One cannot fill schools from the families that live in the immediate vicinity.  Many rural schools are pulling families from a catchment area of 15 km or 20 km.  That has a considerable impact on those schools.  We are looking at schools with 400 or 500 students at secondary level.  I have seen this as a greater challenge in post-primary schools in my own area.</p><p>In this Private Members' motion, we are calling for an increase of funding to meet the demand for school transport for those 6,000 children and students that have been left.  There is a major impact on parents.  We are dealing with calls from parents, who always had access, who are leaving their jobs, are dealing with immense stress and trying to deal with a number of children.  I have spoken already this morning about the level of expectation but one of the real challenges about what we have seen in the past month or so is this expectation by parents when they had the ticket previously.  There was a roll-over of applications and the process is such that they may only have received the notification in the first or second week of September.  I know that was due to the considerable number of applications.</p><p>The Minister, however, has noted she will look at engaging with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on this funding.  She has noted the budget that is coming out next week.  Fine Gael has raised this numerous times in our grouping.  I know that we are also engaging with the office of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to engage with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  It is urgent and vital that we find a solution.  This is a fantastic initiative that has brought benefit to so many but we have these families that have been left outside of the programme.</p><p>I acknowledge that the Minister has the school transport review programme that, it is hoped, will come to a conclusion by the end of this year.  I am sure there will be many new proposals in the programme but we need solutions now, not next year.  Families are struggling right now.  They are going day to day without knowing what will happen in the week or two ahead.  I take on board the criteria the Minister has mentioned but for many of these families, they have only discovered this definition of concessionary or eligible now.  They have always had access to these tickets.</p><p>In respect of this challenge around the definitions of eligibility and concessionary, we are coming across schools where they are at maximum capacity in first year, for example.  What are the opportunities for the P3 schools?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are delving into the nitty-gritty detail of eligibility criteria for families who are really struggling.  The intent of the Bill and that of the Minister, and the legacy she wishes this Bill to have, is that it will be groundbreaking in terms of taking cars off the road, safe routes to school for children and reducing costs, thereby making a major impact to families' income and household expenditure for the year that is in it with the energy crisis we are facing.  There is a legacy with this initiative the Minister brought forward.  We are asking that we find solutions for the remaining applications that are still outstanding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#ZZ00400"><p>I thank the Minister.  It is great to have her in the Chamber.  I formally second the motion.  This is an important debate we are having about the school transportation scheme, which is a unique scheme that helps many families throughout the State in getting their children to school.  It is part of their daily routine and structure.  It is a part of how communities operate in rural Ireland.  It is important we have an appropriate scheme that suits the needs of people.</p> <p>We took a major step forward in recent months by changing the criteria to make this free, which was a really positive step.  The big issue for us is that when those criteria were changed and the date extended, thousands of people subsequently looked to be on the scheme, the knock-on effect of which in my part of the world has been that children who traditionally had taken the school bus no longer do so.  I know of one family with four children, two of whom take the school bus while two do not.  That is a significant issue for that family.  They are trying to work around the scenario whereby they drop two children to the school and the other two children are dropped to the school bus stop.  These are significant challenges for these people.  These are working people who are trying to manage everything in life.  They are trying to manage their school and work timetables, and whatever time they have left for a social life is limited, to say the very least.  How can we put a scheme in place that helps everyone who is affected?</p> <p>I am aware a review process is taking place, and it is appropriate that it started in February 2021.  However, that review is an ongoing process and we need to see what will come from it in due course.  The issue that most affected this scheme in my part of the world was the changing of the date.  By moving that date forward, thousands of children were placed on the scheme, and because of that, children who traditionally would have got the bus because they fitted the criteria of having enough seats on the bus now no longer get that bus.  We need to find a solution to this.  Places like Ballinhassig, Rossmore, Minane Bridge, Nohoval, Dunderrow, Kilbrittain, Ballinspittle, and Newcestown are grossly affected by that.  How do we find a solution for children who are three weeks into the school term and are another four weeks away from the midterm break?</p> <p>I have a few cases I want to talk about.  Special school education is very important.  I am aware of a child who has been granted school transport, but because there is no escort available, three weeks later, the family is still driving their child 70 km every day.  A principal emailed me last night to inform me she has a similar situation in her school and that child has not come to school yet, three weeks into the school term.  I mentioned another case of two children getting the bus and two not getting the bus.  The big issue for us is when we will get the budget required to make sure we leave no child behind.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned she hopes to have negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in regard to the budget.  Will the Minister clarify whether that is for this or the next academic year?  I want to know when the budget she is talking about will become applicable.  Will that budget cover the cohort of children I have referred to?  I mentioned the two special education cases about which I contacted the Minister's office this afternoon.  She might look into those issues.  It is significant that there is a child who has not gone to school yet and another who is, unfortunately, waiting for an escort.  They are significant issues for those families, to say the least.</p> <p>The big issue is to try to find a solution in the current new term.  We are three weeks in with five weeks to midterm.  We need to have a timeline for when there will be a solution.  If there is not going to be a solution, we need to be honest in that and tell the children and families because they need to have structure in their life.  Whether it is grandparents, neighbours, or hiring a school bus privately, they need to know what the solution will be.  We have all received correspondence from Bus &Eacute;ireann saying it is not engaging anymore regarding finding additional transportation.  My worry is that if Bus &Eacute;ireann is not going to engage anymore to find that additional transportation, are we effectively saying the 6,000 children who, unfortunately, did not fit the criteria this year and do not have a place on the school bus, will not be accommodated?  If that is the case, could we make sure to have a plan in place for the children who are affected?  We need to know exactly what is happening.  That clarity would be helpful.  If it can be honestly said there will be no option or no hope, that needs to be stated.</p></speech>

I am a team player when it comes to my party and this Government.  I am a team player because of the way I was brought up, the sports I have played and everything else.  I will go out and defend to the bloody hilt, but this is one example of a policy with good intentions where we are seeing the unintended consequences of a decision we as a Government have made.  It is not good enough to say, not to put a spin on it, that we have put more people on busses and there has been an increase in this and that.  We need to be honest, as Senator Lombard said, and tell people we have left seven to eight thousand children off buses who had seats for the past number of years.</p> <p>I have a list of 60 children, and I am working day and night on it.  Bus &Eacute;ireann representatives have told me it is nothing to do with them.  The Department put out a call for free transport and, as a result, they are swamped.  I have been told I may go to the Department and try to get the people there to figure it out.  That is what Bus &Eacute;ireann at local level and our Oireachtas Bus &Eacute;ireann contacts are saying to us.  Once that was said to us, we have now had to bring it to this House through Commencement debates, through this Private Members' motion, and by raising it with Ministers - the whole lot.  We are at an absolute loss here.  We need to be honest and, instead of touting what a nice policy it was to give all these children free transport, say we accept what has happened, we are looking at fixing it, we realise we have created this situation, we will fix it by getting extra funding and we want to fix it in the coming weeks.  It is not good enough for these parents and children for us to talk about reviews that may happen in a couple of years or the concessionary tickets.  The issue about concessionary tickets, and I said this during the Commencement debate, is that we cannot abide by the same rules for concessionary tickets in previous years when the floodgates have been opened to every child in the country to have free transport.  It cannot be done.  We changed the rules and, as a result, we cannot keep the same rules.  I am not coming into this House to be negative.  I hope other Senators present who will have seen me over the past two years in this House will realise I am not the type of politician who comes into this Chamber to give a kick because it is easy so do that.</p></speech>

The number is not 78,000 because only 38,000 children in the country getting this school transport, not triple that.</p> <p>I am coming into the House not because I am frustrated but because I am upset.  We all have personal stories, and no doubt the Minister has the same issue in her constituency of Kerry, of parents who are going through serious issues, be they health or financial issues or whatever.  The last thing these parents need is to be worrying about a school bus ticket.  The last thing they need is to ask themselves how they are going to get to Dublin for work, get up at 6 a.m. and get their child in and out of school.  The stories I hear in my part of the world are tough to listen to.  I have never felt more at a loss as a politician in being able to do something, because in every other year where this has happened, we have been able to sort it out with the local bus station or Bus &Eacute;ireann.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It takes a bit of time but it gets done.  It has now washed their hands of this entire issue.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is now putting this back on the Minister and the Department.  That is what it saying to us as Members of the Oireachtas.  It is telling us to speak to the Department or to the Minister as they are the only ones who can fix it and that it cannot.  How do we fix it?  What is the plan?  It is about getting a clear timeline and a clear definition, for which Senator Lombard asked and saying that we want to fix this within the next four or five weeks.  If we can do that, great but clarity should be brought.  If we cannot get that clarity, I want to look those parents in the eye, be honest with them and tell them we are not going to be able to fix it this year.  I will take that and if it means I do not get elected to the D&aacute;il the next time or lose votes, that is grand but I am going to look these parents in the eye, be straight up with them and tell them we are either going to fix it or not.  What I will not do is continue with political lines saying we are looking at it and looking at reviews and research.  I refuse to do that.  I want to be honest with the people of Dundalk and the rest of County Louth, which is what I intend to do.  By bringing forward this motion today, I seek that clarity in order that I can go back to these parents, look them in the eye and tell them we are either going to sort this out with a timeline or we are not going to be able to do it on this occasion.  That is what I want to get out of this evening's debate.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1582" speakername="Norma Foley" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#AAA00200"><p>I thank the Senators for giving me the opportunity to address the matters raised in this Private Members' motion on School Transport.  Before I address the specific issues raised, I will provide an outline of the extent of the school transport scheme.  The school transport scheme was established in 1968.  It was created to facilitate access to primary and post-primary education for children, who because of where they reside, might otherwise have difficulty in attending school regularly.  I am deeply conscious of the immense service that the scheme provides for families around the country.  The scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus &Eacute;ireann on behalf of the Department.  In the 2021-22 school year, more than 105,000 children, including more than 15,500 children with special educational needs, were transported on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.</p> <p>To date in the current school year, there are approximately 124,000 children availing of transport on the mainstream primary and post-primary school transport schemes and approximately 17,3000 children availing of transport on the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs such that a total of 141,300 children travel to school on school transport scheme services.  Under the terms of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes, which is an important factor, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from and are attending their nearest national school and at post-primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest post primary school or education centre as determined by the Department-Bus &Eacute;ireann having regard to ethos and language. </p> <p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level will be continued for the 2022-23 school year.  Under these measures, transport will be provided for post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school and are attending their second nearest school and who applied by 29 April and registered for a ticket by 29 July.  It is important to emphasise that there are eligibility criteria regarding access to the school transport system.  That has always been the way, it was the way in previous years and it is the way currently.  The eligibility criteria have not changed.  </p> <p>Under the terms of the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs, children are eligible for transport where they have special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability and are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school, special class or special school that is or can be resourced to meet their special educational needs.  Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of special educational needs organisers.</p> <p>As the Senators will be aware, as an emergency cost of living measure, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2022-23 school year as part of a wider package of cost of living measures.  This created a saving of up to &euro;650 for parents at a time when measures were announced to reduce the cost to families for school transport services.  These measures were in addition to the reductions in the family cap that were announced by the Government in February 2022 to mitigate the cost of living and remove the cost of ticket charges for the 2022-23 school year.</p> <p>School transport ticket registration for the 2022-23 school year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications and registrations were received for mainstream school transport.  The online account management system, known as the family portal, which had been closed since registrations shut on 29 July, reopened on 25 August.  Where applications have been processed, the reopening of the portal will enable account holders to check the status of their application.  While the reopening of the portal also facilitates a late application process, it is very important for such families to note that the application deadline for 2022-23 was 29 April 2022 and that the deadline to confirm registration for tickets was 29 July 2022.  Any application completed after this date is deemed a "late application" and, therefore, many school transport services are already operating at full capacity.  Late applications will only be assessed after all "on time" applications have been processed and there is no guarantee of places for late applicants.</p> <p>Already, more than 124,000 tickets for the mainstream scheme alone have been issued to applicants for the 2022-23 school year.  At the start of the last school year, approximately 103,600 children were carried on mainstream school transport services, so in the region of 20,400 additional mainstream places already have been created.  The temporary waiving of fees has led to an unprecedented expansion of the scheme with many more eligible and concessionary applicants receiving tickets than ever before.  There has been an increase in tickets allocated across all counties with an increase of 18% in the number of tickets issued to eligible pupils compared to the start of the 2021-22 school year and an increase of one third in the number of tickets issued to concessionary pupils compared to the start of the 2021-22 school year.  That is an important factor.  There is actually an increase of one third in the number who have qualified for concessionary places on buses this year.  The funding required to waive the fee for families for the current school year and the funding to provide the additional services required to cater for the increased demand for school bus tickets is being provided by my Department.  Already this expansion has cost an additional &euro;40 million above last year's costings.  Notwithstanding this, I acknowledge that the huge increase in applications has led to frustration over delays in issuing and accessing tickets in some instances.  I can assure Members that Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to work intensively in all regions to process applications and to issue tickets.</p> <p>For this year and in line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022-23 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.  This notwithstanding, I am conscious that there are families who are not eligible for the scheme but who have depended on the service in previous years.  I am addressing this issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the budget.  </p> <p>My Department also continues to progress a review of the school transport scheme, which includes an examination the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it might adequately support the provision of services to students and their families.  The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs.  The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes will examine each element of the schemes and include eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use or provide transport services.</p> <p>Wider considerations relating to the operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review.  As part of the current phase of the review, the technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation, including running a public survey for parents, guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The group has also consulted with a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.</p> <p>One of the findings of the stakeholder engagement process is that the school transport scheme is highly valued by families and that families, particularly those living in rural Ireland, rely heavily on the scheme to get their children to school where there is a lack of public transport alternatives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Another key finding is that the scheme is viewed as a key factor in supporting climate change measures, and there was support for increasing capacity on school transport which in turn will reduce car journeys and congestion at schools and in towns.  While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the challenges of the pandemic and the impact of the current conflict in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the final phases will be completed shortly with recommendations on the future operation of the Department's school transport scheme.  The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as the review progresses.</p><p>With regard to the retirement age of school bus drivers, it is Bus &Eacute;ireann company policy that the normal retirement age for all Bus &Eacute;ireann staff is currently 66 years.  However, Bus &Eacute;ireann part-time school bus drivers and drivers nominated by private operators who operate services as part of the school transport scheme may continue to perform in the role, provided they hold the requisite license and satisfy an annual medical examination, until they retire at 70 years of age.  This policy and these criteria are applied to all drivers who provide school transport services on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann equally.  The age limit for school bus drivers was increased to 70 years a number of years ago.  While Bus &Eacute;ireann has informed the Department there is no plan to increase the age limit further at this time, the matter will continue to be kept under review.  I can assure the Senators that my officials will continue to engage with Bus &Eacute;ireann as they currently do with regard to all aspects of the operation of the school transport scheme.  In addition, quarterly strategic and monthly operational meetings will continue to be held throughout the year to discuss operational and strategic matters including financial matters, fleet and other resource requirements, scheme delivery and other such matters that arise to ensure continued and effective operation of this very significant scheme.</p><p>I would like again to take the opportunity to point out that the announcement was made as part of a cost-of-living provision for families.  It is a considerable saving for families, up to &euro;650 for many.  It was announced on the basis of the criteria that currently exist and that did not change.  The criteria that exist are that a primary school pupil lives 3.2 km from his or her school or that a post-primary school student lives 4.8 km from his or her nearest or next nearest school.  All of those who met the eligibility criteria have been provided for.  More than 124,000 of them have been provided for this year as opposed to 103,000 last year.  That is a significant increase of more than 20% additional capacity and it is also free of charge.  There is an issue with concessionary tickets for those who receive seats on the basis of availability once those who are eligible have been provided for.  This has not changed this year.  Those who are concessionaries, provided there is capacity, have received seats on buses this year and there has been a one third increase in concessionary tickets this year.</p><p>There have been issues with the school bus transport system.  I recognise that and I am the first Minister to instigate a root-and-branch review of the entire school bus transport system which specifically will address eligibility criteria.  Previous Ministers who served in my Department did not do so in past years.  I think it is important to remember that.</p><p>Equally in terms of addressing the issues for this cohort of children with concessionary tickets who are not eligible to be on the bus under the present scheme but have depended on it previously, I have opened discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in the context of the budget to see if there is scope to ensure that some financial provision can be made to alleviate the situation for families that find themselves in that specific situation, having previously been awarded concessionary tickets and having capacity available on a bus.  Those discussions are ongoing.</p><p>I would say to Senators that these are individuals and I do not take from the difficulty and challenge that it provides for families.  It is for that reason that I instigated an entire review of the process, recognising that there are other ways and better ways of providing the service.  That review has involved engagement with more than 8,000 parents, 2,000 students, bus providers, bus operators and our European counterparts to look at best practice in other jurisdictions.  The review is nearing completion.  In the short term, this measure was introduced to alleviate cost-of-living pressure on families.  I am in ongoing discussions with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, in respect of the specific cohort who currently find themselves outside the loop.</p><p>I want to refer also to a question around special education.  I appreciate the Senator raising that issue.  Those who are availing of the school transport scheme from a special education point of view do so and have consistently done so free of charge.  There may well be challenges in terms of recruiting staff.  I want to be fair and say to the Senator that this challenge in recruiting staff is not unique to the transport system at this time.  We are seeing similar issues in business and hospitality.  We are working through that with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Children with special educational needs are being provided for free of charge as was the case previously.  In fact there has been an increase in transport provision for children with special educational needs, due largely to the large number of additional classes that we have in place and everything else.</p><p>I thank the Senators for their ongoing interest and commitment in this area.  I thank them for the issues they have highlighted which are of great interest across the floor of the House.  I assure them that we are continuing to work on it.  We have had no choice but to abide by the eligibility criteria at this point.  There will be another opportunity to look at it in its broadest sense when the review is completed.  In the short term, for those who were outside the loop, who were not eligible this year and were concessionaries previously, where there is capacity, I am engaged with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, to see what scope there is in the upcoming budget.</p></speech>

The free school transport initiative was announced with great bells and whistles.  We expected great things.  Whenever anything is announced as a free service, I suppose the Minister has got to prepare for that and what it brings.  I am wondering what action the Minister took.  Did she acquire more buses for it?  Did she acquire more drivers?  The Minister knew that more people would be applying for the service, particularly in rural areas.  It seems to have been a severe let-down.  Were more staff appointed to the school transport section in Bus &Eacute;ireann here in Dublin?  They do not seem to be able to answer the phone.  They are not returning any emails at this time.  Inquiries are coming in from all over the country.</p> <p>This is not just a Meath issue, all over the country councillors are having issues with transportation.  The population increase with 52,000 more Ukrainians has obviously caused more problems for school transport provision as well.  Were any provisions made for that?  It just does not seem to have worked this year.  I do not know why but this year seems to have been worse than any other year that I have ever dealt with.  I know of a number of children who did get a bus pass, then it was taken off them.  There are seats on the bus but they cannot get on the bus as a result.  I know children who got tickets and they never even applied for them.  They would have applied in the first two years of their education, did not get it and then this year all of a sudden they got tickets in the post.  There is serious mismanagement in the service.</p> <p>The Minister did say she was going to be accommodating all the children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time this year and they will be accommodated on school services where they are in operation.  What happens if they are in operation and those buses are full?  Will the Minister put on extra buses in that area?  Is that going to be a possibility?</p> <p>I note the Minister did not mention the remote area grant today.  That grant is available, although a lot of people may not even know it is, for people who are living outside the distances of the school.  Is there any way the Minister could increase the payment rate on that grant?  Fuel has gone up.  The daily rate is currently &euro;1.30 for children living between 3.2 km and 4.7 km from the school.  If someone is 9.7 km away they can get &euro;5.10 a day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Is there any way the Minister can look at that grant and increase the daily rates, if possible?  That might take a little bit of pressure off parents as well.  That grant is paid annually.  Is there any way it could be paid each term?  In light of the cost-of-living crisis, is there any way these applications could be submitted after each of the three school terms?  That might also alleviate the pressure on parents somewhat.</p><p>Somebody spoke earlier about transport for children with special needs.  That is a serious issue.  There is one particular child in my town of Duleek and the bus driver comes from Monaghan to bring that child half a mile up the road.  It does not make sense to make such a trip twice a day.  We need to look at why that is happening.  There are local facilities and buses.  I do not know what the criteria are, but we need to look at that because it is an obvious waste of money.  There is no reason a bus driver from County Meath- or even a bus driver in County Louth, which borders Meath - should not bring that child to a school in the county.</p><p>The Minister faces challenges.  I am glad she is going to look after those children who have previously had places on buses and who have applied again.  Is the Minister of the view that the 6,000 students who did not meet the criteria last year will get places on buses this year?  That is what I really want to know.  Is there any way that the staff who run the school transport system on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann can be increased in some way?  Can more manpower be given to that particular service, specifically for the months of July, August and September, when it is under severe pressure?  It is unfair that the relevant section is not being properly manned in order to allow it to deliver a better service for parents, and for local and national representatives.  Ultimately, when one has the knowledge, one can communicate back to the individuals.  When one cannot get answers, however, people despair.</p><p>I wish the Minister well.  There has been a bit of mayhem this year, but I have no doubt that she will get the extra money required from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform next year and that the service will improve then.</p></speech>

We had a long debate on school transport this morning at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  We certainly appreciate the Minister giving of her time to debate this very important issue, which is relevant and important to so many families, students and communities right across the country.  It is important that we welcome both the motion and the opportunity to talk about the issues and challenges that exist.</p> <p>It is also important that we talk about school transport as a vital service.  School transport benefits tens of thousands of students and families right around the country, particularly when we think about the 124,000 pupils availing of the service this year, which is a 21% increase on the number who availed of it last year.  That is significant.  Obviously, we have to think about those 6,000 students who applied for places and did not get them in order to see how we can manage to ensure that they are able to get to school in a timely fashion, and with State support if at all possible.</p> <p>The scheme is important to everybody, but especially people in rural areas where there are not public transport options or alternatives.  In a way, the school transport place is as vital as a school place.  Organising a family is the same as running a small business in the context of ensuring proper timetabling, pickups and drop-offs.  It is an incredible help when a bus collects and drops off a student and is of great importance.</p> <p>I acknowledge all of the work the Minister has done in ensuring that cost-of-living measures were put in place in the context of the cost of going back to school.  In this House and the Lower House we have acknowledged the cost of going back to school for students.  That cost is contemplated within the &euro;2.4 billion package the Government has put in place.  Included in that package are measures to increase the back-to-school clothing allowance and provide the extra school meals.  Also, an additional &euro;40 million that has been provided for school transport.  This has made a significant difference for many families.  For some, the saving is &euro;650 a year or &euro;12.50 per week.  That is significant and has to be acknowledged.  Many parents have acknowledged it to me and to others.</p> <p>It must also be recognised that when the State provides public and school transport, the number of car journeys taken each day decreases.  That leads to improvements both in traffic volumes and the level of carbon emissions.  School transport has a very important role to play in that regard.  We need significantly more of this.  I live in a rural constituency and the Minister represents such a constituency.  We know the pressure points that exist at school drop-off and pickup points.  Those pressure points give rise to all of the traffic jams in our villages and towns.  Indeed, our local authorities have had to spend significant amounts of money on traffic calming measures.  If we had a situation where we had a demand-led service that responded to the needs that exist - disregarding the criteria that are there at the moment, which, I appreciate, will be part of the whole reform and review that I will mention later - that would be very important.</p> <p>There has been a significant increase in the number of tickets allocated across all of the counties.  We cannot forget that.  The Minister&rsquo;s commitment that Bus &Eacute;ireann will continue to process applications and issue tickets, as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport, is welcome.  There have been very bad delays in the issuing of tickets.  It is very regrettable that we are having this debate on 21 September and schools have been back almost a month.  All of these issues should be dealt with in July and August.  There should be certainty about transport for our children.  I hear about this matter from families and public representatives, not just in Kildare but also in other parts of the country.  Families have to make very difficult decisions.  People are cutting back on the number of hours they work, certain parents are talking about giving up their jobs or buying second cars in order to be able to ensure that their children get to school.  We must do something in this regard.</p> <p>The Minister has given a commitment in respect of those who are eligible.  We also need a commitment regarding those who have concessionary tickets, who had them before and in circumstances where some children within families have them and others do not.  That matter needs to be addressed.</p> <p>On planning, those who registered before 29 April should certainly have received their tickets in the first tranche.  We should not have a situation where some of those people have not received tickets and those who were late applicants have received them.  I appreciate that there always have to be late applications because of family moves, etc.  I am concerned about what certainly seems to be a lack of planning.  I would be interested in knowing a little more about the planning that was done in conjunction with Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>On the review of the school transport service, I thank the Minister for ensuring that this has been undertaken.  We certainly look forward to it being completed.  We will need to address all of the issues around eligibility and concessionary tickets.  This should be demand-led.  Every child who needs a place should get one.  We have to address issues like ethos because, at the moment, Educate Together schools are being left out of the process.  We have situations where parents, if they make a choice to send a child to a co-educational school as opposed to a single-sex school, do not have that choice in the context of transport.</p> <p>The bottom line is that a commitment has been made regarding eligible schools.  We need to have a similar commitment in respect of concessionary tickets.  Bus &Eacute;ireann needs to carry out a review in respect of buses that are not full passing by certain stops and regarding tickets that were issued but that were not requested in the first place.  The latter is adding to the problem.  I thank the Minister for taking the time to listen to us.</p></speech>

The potential benefits of a free school transport scheme are plain to see.  It is good for the climate, for air pollution, for schools and for families.  It is good in the context of the safety of pickup and drop-off points outside schools and it is good for parents because they have a convenient way of getting their children to school.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The term "management" has been used quite a bit during this debate.  If it was managed correctly, free school transport could be an excellent weapon in the fight against the cost-of-living and climate crises.  We know it is short journeys, in particular school drop offs, that add a significant amount to our carbon emissions.  They are the types of journeys we are trying to make non-essential for parents so they have alternatives and do not have to drive their children to school.  </p><p>As we have heard, management is important.  The way the Government has ruled out the scheme has been a disaster.  The Minister announced free seats without making sure that seats were available in the first place.  That has only led to chaos and more stress for families.  This was supposed to be a good news story for families to help ease their burden and all it has done is given a headache and extra stress to families.</p><p>A phrase used in conversations about public transport and cycle infrastructure is, "If you build it, they will come".  If we put in place the infrastructure and remove the barriers people will use the service.  Anyone who has a cursory understanding of economics will tell us that reducing costs will lead to an increase in demand.  That does not seem to have been heeded.</p><p>There are points in the Fine Gael motion that seem to be trying to shift the blame away from the Minister and pin it on Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We know from a parliamentary reply that the Government liaised with Bus &Eacute;ireann before announcing the decision, but it was only made clear to Bus &Eacute;ireann that the scheme would be free 30 minutes before the plan was formally announced.  The Minister has to accept responsibility for that and stop looking for others to pin the blame on.</p><p>Families across the country are outraged.  Those expecting to see savings of &euro;500 now look set to be heaped with additional costs as they try to find alternatives.  People who have been using the service for years have been left without a place, while other parents have lost out due to the unfair lottery nature of the scheme.  </p><p>The figures quoted in the Fine Gael motion raised a few eyebrows.  There is nothing technically wrong with them, as far as I can tell, but they paint a remarkably rosy picture of the situation.  The motion mentioned 44,000 new eligible students.  I would like to know how many of those new students are actually replacing students who graduated and how many are additional seats.  I figures I have show that 124,000 school transport places are being provided for the current 2022-23 academic year, while only 121,400 were provided for the past academic year.  That is an increase of only 2,600 places, or 2%.  Clearly, that is not up to meeting the reality of the demand.</p><p>The failure of the Government to harness the demand for buses has done damage to the wider climate movement.  When it comes to climate action, one of the key asks across the spectrum is free public transport, but the complete bungling of the free school transport proposal has set that back.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the goal of free public transport and is committed to increasing the capacity of the system to make sure it is done right.  We cannot just roll things out overnight if we do not have the bus spaces and capacity to deliver the service.  </p><p>The school bus debacle could have been avoided.  Obviously it is too late for that now, but we do not see the Government taking the steps required to address the problem.  Additional capacity is the only thing that can solve this and it is still not being sought for concessionary pupils who secured pupils tickets for this school year.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called on the Government to provide an additional 10,000 places to be funded on the school transport system in 2023 and for capital funding to be provided for the purpose of new school buses.  </p><p>That is why we have brought forward an amendment to the motion calling for those additional 10,000 extra places to be funded on the school transport scheme and capital funding to be put in place to provide for the purchase of new school buses, noting the age and quality of the current fleet of school transport buses.  I encourage all those who spoke passionately during this debate about the hardship parents are going through due to the failure to access bus spaces for their children to support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.</p></speech>

I thank the Fine Gael team for putting forward this important motion and using Private Members' time to discuss this issue.  I and a number of colleagues debated this problem in a Commencement matter with the Minister.  I welcome the chance to discuss this issue again.  This problem is still massive in my area of south Kildare, as mentioned by other colleagues.  Unfortunately, things are not getting much better for those who find themselves in this situation.</p> <p>I watched a piece on "Prime Time" last night and became even more worried about possible solutions than I was when I left this House after the Commencement debate last week.  I am not sure if the Minister's Department is hearing about the problems families, rather than individuals, are facing on a day-to-day basis.  Families are the ones who have problems and are upset by this.  Families are not thinking of giving up their jobs; rather they have given up their jobs in order to get their children to school.  That is that reality in Kildare and other counties.  </p> <p>When the Minister sat down with her Department to discuss this, did nobody think of those who had concessionary tickets and the fact that under the eligibility criteria for the scheme they would lose out?  Did nobody in the Department ask what those families were going to do?  That is the bottom line.  They are the people who are suffering.  They are ringing me and other colleagues in Kildare week in and week out.  They are crying on the phone to me because they cannot get a ticket and there is no solution for them.  </p> <p>We have to determine what we are going to do in the next couple of weeks.  Things cannot happen next year because the 6,000, 7,000 or 8,000 pupils mentioned by colleagues in the Fine Gael team during this debate are still without tickets.  They are still trying to figure out how they are going to get their children to school and they want to know whether the Minister or the Department have called Bus &Eacute;ireann and determined how many vacancies are on the buses.  The bus operators I have spoken to over the past number of days and weeks have told me they have not be contacted by anybody in the Department or Bus &Eacute;ireann to find out whether there is spare capacity on their buses.  We are now weeks into this crisis.  That is what is happening.  </p> <p>I have received calls from parents who have informed me that they are aware of students who have received tickets but are not using the bus, as other colleagues have said.  I am informed that a number of students who are no longer attending secondary school have received tickets.  Despite being in third level education, they received tickets for second level students.  Over the weekend, I was contacted by a school teacher who told me of two pupils who are no longer in her school.  She contacted me because a mother was crying with her as she would not be able to bring her children to school.  The teacher called me to ask whether I could point out during the debate that there are two vacancies on a bus in Kildare.  </p> <p>This is something that has been replicated time and again in the phonecalls I have received.  I could give the Minister personal stories as I did on a previous occasion.  I have raised with the Department an issue she asked me to raise during the previous debate and I am sure she will revert to me on that.  The bottom line is that those who had tickets for three, four, five or six years now find their children on the side of the road.  As I said during the Commencement debate, they are following buses with empty seats.</p> <p>I refer to the issue of 70-year-olds raised by the Minister.  She mentioned But &Eacute;ireann is keeping the matter under review.  That is not good enough.  The Minister for Transport extended the scheme to 75-year-olds this year, including ex-military personnel who can drive buses.  There are plenty of them out there.  This is about capacity and ensuring that the 6,000, 7,000 or 8,000 parents affected can get their children to school.  As I said, phonecalls need to be made and I ask the Minister to please start making them.</p></speech>

It is a good scheme when it works.  However, I know of families who were told on 15 August this year that they were eligible for the school transport scheme, yet five weeks on 12 children with special educational needs in new ASD classes in Dublin 15 do not have school transport.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There have been repeated calls to Bus &Eacute;ireann but people have heard nothing back.  These are children coming from Cabra, Navan Road, Finglas and Balbriggan.  In some cases, the distance is significant and they already have enough challenges to be dealing with without the uncertainty of having to worry about how they are going to get to school.  Thankfully, as of today, Bus &Eacute;ireann has finally confirmed that those routes have been approved for a four-seater and a seven-seater, which is great, but the school principal now has to start the process of recruiting the escorts, which could take any length of time.</p><p>As has been said, the system is very inefficient.  It is hard enough for families to access ASD classes without then having to face another hurdle of trying to get access to their entitlement to the school transport scheme.  The review is welcome but it cannot come quickly enough.  We need to see radical change to ensure we do not have such delays again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#EEE00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I apologise for being late to the debate as I was at another meeting when the Minister was speaking.</p> <p>The reality is this whole issue is about children.  It is not about concessionary or non-concessionary tickets but about children getting to school.  We are in a situation where the country is at full employment.  We need to be at full employment and we need people to fill these jobs in our economy, yet families are left in a situation where one parent has to give up a job.  I know of a family on a route to Moyne Community School where the father goes to the school at 6:30 a.m. and the child's mother looks after other kids who come from 7 a.m. to allow other parents to go to work.  Another family with three children who have been on a bus over the past five years now have no transport to school.  The Minister earlier this year visited Ballymahon Vocational School and Mercy Convent, two large progressive schools in the county that are now left in a situation where up to 14 kids have no transport to school, although they had that previously.  As both parents may be working, it leaves people in a very difficult situation.</p> <p>There are ways around it but, for some reason, the school transport office does not want to deal with it.  A point was made by Senator Wall in regard to the over-70s.  My family has a bus company.  My uncle is over 70.  His son can drive the bus to Moyne Community School, which is 13 miles away, but my uncle cannot drive it.  He has a licence, is medically fit, and could bring a school group from the school to Cork or Belfast in the same bus, but he cannot drive the 13 miles down to the school.  That does not make sense.  I know it is the unions within Bus &Eacute;ireann that are not allowing it but it does not make sense that somebody cannot drive 13 miles to a school when that same bus can pick up those kids and bring them to a basketball match or football match in the national stadium or wherever.  It is ludicrous, to be honest, and it needs to be looked at.</p> <p>I know of a situation where a company has larger buses.  The seats have been filled out for 53 but the company has a 57-seater and a 59-seater bus.  The school transport office will not let the company employ the larger bus, which could pick up the four kids on one of the routes that is short.  It is not listening, although I put forward that proposal.  That is an answer to one situation in one school.  It is just a question of bringing a bigger bus, not a second bus, but it is not being looked at.</p> <p>Somebody from the Department of Education needs to look at all of these individual situations.  There are answers to this issue.  At the root of it are the children.  We are reliant on these children getting a good education to come into our workforce and replace all of us in our jobs in the years to come.  We need to put the basics in place and allow them to get to school when there are answers to the problem, although it needs a bit of forward thinking.  I ask the Minister to take on board that simple point about the over-70s which has been mentioned.  I am sorry if the Minister dealt with this in her opening statement and I missed it.  It does not make sense.  I am giving that practical idea of somebody who is just over 70, medically fit, has a licence and can drive the whole way to Belfast in the same bus but cannot drive down to the school.  As I said, it does not make sense.  Where there are larger buses available that could pick up the shortfall in numbers, which would be at a very minimal extra cost, if any, that needs to be looked at.  We cannot have a situation where people are forced to give up their jobs or work shorter hours.</p> <p>I know is a difficult one for the Minister.  It was an excellent proposal to fund those who had been paying for transport over the years and it was targeted at them.  However, we need to think outside the box and come up with a solution to make sure those 6,000 kids have transport to school.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-21a.486" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022092100002#EEE00300"><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to discuss this.  She has been discussing it from dawn to dusk, given that early this morning she was addressing this issue before the education committee.  This is something that comes up as an issue at the end of every August.  Some of the criticism of the Minister was rather unfair.  It was interesting that at the education committee some members were saying the fact changes were made to the plan means this was not properly planned or thought out and the Minister was not taking responsibility.  I had to look back on debates in 2012 and 2013, when there were changes to the school transport scheme and the same accusations were being made against the then Labour Party Minister for Education, Ruair&iacute; Quinn.  Any Minister who tries to grapple with this seems to face particular challenges.</p> <p>What has to be acknowledged is that, first, the Minister has initiated a review of a scheme that has been in place and largely unchanged, bar some changes about a decade ago, since the 1960s.  Senator Boylan is right and I support the idea that we can we provide 10,000 extra places next year, but it has to be acknowledged the Minister has provided nearly 20,000 additional places this year.  Yes, there are problems with the scheme, but it needs to be acknowledged there has been a significant increase in the number of places being provided.</p> <p>As colleagues have pointed out, it does not matter if we provided places for nearly every child.  If it is your son or daughter or you are the student who does not have a place on the bus, then you are naturally going to feel under pressure.  We all know, as the Minister does, the pressures individual families are facing this year and the difficulties they have, particularly where there was a legitimate expectation of a ticket.  These are the difficult stories where kids who, up to transition year or fifth year, had the concessionary ticket all of the time and the parents worked on the basis they would apply early and get it, and then they suddenly find they have lost out.  We will see the details when the review comes in but I certainly think that where somebody has had a concessionary ticket for a number of years, a legitimate expectation has built up and, at the very least, they have to be given priority.  It is hugely disruptive when that legitimate expectation has been built up.</p> <p>I agree with colleagues about the position of drivers aged over 70.  We had the discussion with regard to pensions.  That is life and many people want to work for longer.  As Senator Carrigy said, this is not about driving an Expressway bus from Tralee to Dublin.  This is about small bus routes, which would suit many retired or semi-retired bus drivers.  I entirely understand that, for safety reasons, appropriate checks have to be carried out every year.  Surely, however, if a driver is able to pass all of the necessary tests to be able to drive the bus, then he or she could be allowed to do it, particularly as, in many of these cases, it is on a part-time basis and on a small route basis.</p> <p>There is a shortage of bus drivers in the country.  We also need to look at making bus driving an attractive career path and we need to encourage people to look at taking it up.  It is a difficult job but it is a rewarding career path.  Until we have automated vehicles, we are going to be relying on good bus drivers.  Part of our campaign has to be around encouraging people into that area.</p> <p>We all know the good environmental reasons and the reasons around ensuring people can go to work without having to worry about their kids getting to school.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We want to see a situation whereby effectively, anybody who wants to use the school bus can do so.  This is important, even in terms of preventing traffic idling outside schools and the resultant fumes.  I am sure every one of us in this House has also dealt with complaints about traffic jams around schools or inappropriate parking outside school premises so if we can provide a regular bus service, we can address all of that.  </p><p>When the review is published, and I hope the Minister will expedite the publication of the report, the Minister should come into this House to debate the findings so that we can move to a situation in 2023 where we do not face the same challenges that we face every August.  We all know of particular hardship cases and in the short term, I ask the Minister to continue to work closely with Bus &Eacute;ireann to find ways of getting pupils onto buses.  </p><p>The final point I would make is one that I raised this morning with the Minister.  Part of the challenge has been the introduction, for good reason, of a free school transport scheme.  There are people who signed up for the free scheme simply because it was free.  Perhaps a small, token fee should have been considered because it has meant that buses are travelling to schools with empty seats.  I understand that if all those places have been allocated then the seats cannot be taken up.  We need to consider charging a small, token fee to ensure there is intent to use an allocated place.  Obviously there are ways to support those who are disadvantaged but we have a problem with people signing up for a service that they intend to use rarely, if ever.</p></speech>

Indeed, one could set one's clock by it but this year the representations I have received in my offices in Waterford city and Dungarvan have been beyond anything I have experienced previously.  Some of this could have been avoided.  It is not just the odd case, here and there.  Families from every corner of Waterford have been in contact with me, from Clonea to Rathgormuck, Clashmore, Butlerstown, Kilmacthomas, Ballymacarbry, Knockanore, Aglish, to name a few.</p></speech>

I could say Villierstown, Modelligo and Colligan as well.  People from all those areas have been in contact.</p> <p>The fundamental error that was made here was reopening applications after the announcement was made that school transport would be free, which resulted in many students who had availed of concessionary tickets for many years being unable to avail of them.  These were families that were happy to pay for school transport.  That said, I appreciate and totally understand that the Minister made that decision in good faith to try to reduce the cost on families.  Nobody is questioning that but the difficulty has arisen from that decision.  </p> <p>On 5 September, I wrote to the Minister regarding a particular issue that kept coming up in my constituency office.  Unfortunately, I have only received an acknowledgement to date so I do not know whether the Department of Education is investigating the issue which relates to Yahoo email accounts.  Nine families in my constituency with children who are eligible for school transport made their applications on time but they never received any follow-up communication from Bus &Eacute;ireann to confirm their request for bus tickets.  Normally they would pay their fee and request their tickets but as that coincided with the announcement of free transport, these families thought, understandably, that they did not have to do anything further.  On realising that there was an issue, they made contact with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The company acknowledged that there was a problem with Yahoo email accounts.  This was also confirmed to my staff.  However, the company has subsequently said that it is the parents' responsibility to have valid email accounts but these families do have valid email accounts.  It is not their fault that there was some error on Bus &Eacute;ireann's side that resulted in emails not landing into their accounts.  I am certain that there are nine such families, at least, who have been affected by this issue.  They were advised to apply when the portal reopened but of course when they did, they were told that all places had been allocated and it was not possible to cater for them.  It is unconscionable that students who are eligible for school transport are being negatively impacted through no fault of their own.  Provision has to be made urgently for those families.  If it means putting on additional buses or additional capacity on certain routes, that has to be done.  This problem was not of their making.  These parents applied on time, in good faith and their children are eligible for school transport but are being negatively impacted.  </p> <p>Transport operators that have buses and additional capacity available have been in contact with me to say that Bus &Eacute;ireann is not engaging with them locally.  I ask the Minister to put a fund in place urgently to ensure that we can cater for as many students as possible.  All of us, including the Minister, know the issues out there.</p></speech>

It is refreshing that a senior Cabinet Minister would come to the House for a Private Member's debate and I thank her for that.  It is a very positive indication of her concern, notwithstanding the magnificent change she made to the school transport scheme at the outset.  I welcome the review and plead with her to expedite it.  In fairness, she has said in a number of interviews and during a Commencement matter debate last week in this House that it is important that the review is expedited.  The Minister has a very hands-on approach.</p> <p>In her speech the Minister eloquently referred to the number of new places but there are issues, as she knows quite well.  Senator Cummins raised an issue that the Minister can address by encouraging Bus &Eacute;ireann to engage proactively on the ground.  It is the agent, the voice and the face of school transport.  I compliment Senator Dolan on the motion before the House and on her work on this issue.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is the representative body.  It is a bit like the HSE and the Department of Health.  We get the flak but Bus &Eacute;ireann is the body administering the scheme.  It is important that the Minister speaks to the company directly.  </p> <p>The other point that has been made about age cohorts is important and change is needed in that regard.  It would be great if the Minister could address that.  The Minister is right to say that the school bus service is valued by those in rural Ireland who need and require such a service.  The service allows our education system to function and flourish.  As a schoolteacher myself, I understand the importance of school transport.  Indeed, for those students with special needs or disabilities, our school transport system is pivotal to their empowerment, their living and their flourishing.  We should not forget those very important students today.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for being here.  I  commend the motion to the House and thank Senator Dolan for submitting it.  </p></speech>

I am aware that she has been addressing it all day so I thank her for her attention and for the opportunity to discuss the school transport scheme.  I am glad that a review of the criteria is taking place but I call on the Minister to confirm tonight that included in that review is the criterion of ethos.  The school transport scheme does not allow children who are of no religious persuasion to avail of their nearest non-denominational school.  As transport currently is not provided to the nearest non-denominational school, children of no religious denomination are forced to attend their nearest school which could have a religious ethos.  Under the terms of the post-primary school transport scheme, children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 4.8 km away and are attending their nearest post-primary school, having regard to ethos and language.  Ethos, for the purposes of the scheme, refers to minority religions.  The 2022 census form offered "No religion" as the first option for the very first time.  In 2016, it was the last option on the list for those declaring religion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 2016 10% of people ticked the "No religion" box.  We do not yet have the figures from the 2022 census but we can be safe in the knowledge that it will be higher than 10%.  This is a particular issue in Skerries in north County Dublin.  Approximately 13 families who are of no religion send their children to their nearest Educate Together secondary school, which is Bremore Educate Together in the town of Balbriggan.  They have been told they are not eligible for the school transport scheme because it is not their nearest secondary school.  Their nearest secondary school has a Christian ethos and these families fundamentally do not want to send their children to a school with a Christian ethos.  These families are being discriminated against because they have no religion.  This is completely unacceptable in a republic.  The criteria for the school transport scheme are not fit for purpose in a modern Ireland.  I am very glad a review is taking place.  Will the Minister please confirm the ethos element of the criteria is under review?</p><p>Compounding the problem for families in Skerries who are sending their children to Bremore Educate Together secondary school is the fact that Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann service times from Skerries to Balbriggan are unsuitable for the start time of the educate together secondary school.  There was a bus on the timetable that somewhat suited the families but it has been axed.  The families sending their children to that educate together secondary school have no public transport option.  They are forced to use private transport.  This is completely unsustainable and discriminatory.  In her response will the Minister specifically refer to the ethos criterion of the scheme and whether it is included in the review?</p></speech>

I compliment Senator Dolan and her colleagues for tabling the motion.  It is fair to say that school transport issues have always been a staple of political life in August and September.  It has been at a much higher scale this year.  This is a consequence of the positive changes made to reduce costs for families, which are to be welcomed.  I commend the Minister and the Government on the decision.  In areas such as Moycullen, which is outside Galway city, students travel to attend secondary school.  Those in Moycullen predominantly go to Galway, with some going to Spiddal, Colaiste Cholmcille in Inverin or St. Paul's in Oughterard.  They have to travel outside their own community.  I am sure there are other examples around the country where people have no choice but to travel.</p> <p>In recent years an issue has been the closest school rule.  Changes have been made with regard to a second school, which have been positive for students who are close to a certain school but go to another school.  The changes made over recent years have been welcome.</p> <p>I acknowledge and commend my local Bus &Eacute;ireann inspector on engaging on issues and being available to answer calls on cases.  This might not be the same in all regions of the country.  The local inspector in my area is able to provide information on what Bus &Eacute;ireann might be able to offer as an alternative, providing bigger buses where possible or using a bus that goes to another school that is close by.  There are solutions.</p> <p>Driver age is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann but there is an anomaly.  As my colleague, Senator Carrigy, said, bus drivers over the age of 70 are able to drive to Belfast with pupils from a school but they cannot bring the same pupils from their own homes to school.  This is an anomaly and if it could be looked at it would provide a quick solution.  Even if it were for this year, pending the results of the review, it would provide a quick solution to the issue.  We need to move to a situation whereby a bus is available for all students free of charge for whatever school they want to go to, within reason.  The Minister has gone a long way towards this.  I hope that over the coming weeks she will get the resources to ensure this issue is solved for all of the students and parents involved.</p></speech>

I acknowledge this.  The area the Minister is from is quite similar to mine.  Kerry is quite similar to Tipperary in many political and rural ways.  This has been by far the biggest issue for the past month or month and a half.  For the parents of the 6,000 or 7,000 children throughout the country who have no place on a bus it does not look like the issue will be solved any time soon.  This is the most frustrating part.  They do not know.  They are on WhatsApp groups and they are all speaking about their own stories.</p> <p>I have heard of very difficult situations that people are in.  I know of a teacher in one school whose child goes to another school.  That teacher has to give up time at work to bring the child to school.  These are families that do not have other problems such as somebody being sick or other challenges.  Their children were able to get on a school bus for the past number of years with no problem.  They paid for it and there was no problem.  Now, because it is free, everyone is going on the bus.  These families would happily pay to get their children back on the bus so they could go back to their normal lives when they were working, the bus picked up the children and they knew they would get to school and home safely.</p> <p>We now have situations whereby a child is on a bus for one journey of the ten journeys of the week so for nine of those journeys there is an empty seat.  These buses drive past children who are waiting to go to school.  This is what is infuriating.  We can speak about how there are now 124,000 children on school buses, which is an increase on the number last year but it was expected.  The number of people who applied was unprecedented.  This was flagged with us very quickly when the announcement was made.  The announcement was made with a very well-intended purpose, which was to reduce costs for people at a time when costs are very high.  This is why the back-to-school allowance was increased.  These measures were taken to help people.</p> <p>School transport was very clearly going to be a problem.  The parents I speak to in Ballingarry, Drangan, Cloneen and Killenaule are going into their fourth week of waiting for clarity.  Can we give them this clarity?  The Minister speaks about having conversations with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, on extra funding.  Will this extra funding be for this year's students who are waiting to get on a bus?  It is infuriating for them.  People's lives have been turned upside down by a simple thing that can be solved.  They look at buses going past with empty seats but they cannot get their children them.  I ask that we give these people the clarity they deserve.  The measure was introduced for a well-intended purpose but it has caused unintended consequences for many people who did not expect them.  Through no fault of their own they are at their wits' end driving to and from school with their children every day.  I ask that we get answers as quickly as possible and get these children on the bus.</p></speech>

I thank her for staying for the entire debate.  Senator Ahearn summed up the whole issue very well.  I acknowledge, as have others, that the intention was genuine, good and egalitarian.  The Minister wants to do the right thing in a cost-of-living crisis.  All of this is fine but, as was well put by my colleague, we have some unintended consequences.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=21"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In essence, my situation is no different from that of anyone else.  I have an office in Cavan town, which is used by our councillors for their representations.  There are also direct walk-in representations and phone calls.  It has come up a lot.  The difficulty is that there is now a bus route in a country area with only about two or three children left who are either passed by the bus, as the last speaker said, or there is no place on the bus for them because of the extra numbers.  It is a particularly difficult issue to deal with because if two, three or four children on that bus route are adversely affected by the situation and are caught, how do you resolve it?  We cannot reasonably put another bus on that route.  We cannot have two really expensive buses on that route.  Do we get a larger bus or use a car?  What do we do?  I hope the Minister will get the funding to deal with it.  Small numbers and isolated routes constitute a very tricky issue to deal with in rural Ireland.  It is not a simple matter to deal with.  I wish the Minister well with it and I hope she gets the money and gets the issue resolved.</p></speech>
