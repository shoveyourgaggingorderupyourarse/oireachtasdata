The CAP reform negotiations that are currently under way were initiated in 2018 and Ireland had to make a submission by January 2020.  I have met many young farmers in my own neck of the woods and have spoken to people from various sectors and there are two main issues at play.  Farmers are opposed to any cuts and are concerned about convergence and redistribution.  This is particularly the case for active farmers and I engaged with the Minister on this recently.  Many different proposals are being brought forward and farmers are fearful.  They are afraid that if there are cuts to the CAP budget, it will have a detrimental effect on the farming community in Ireland.  Farming is such a difficult business at the moment.  We want to encourage young farmers to take over family farms but many farmers are in full-time or part-time off-farm employment.  Two important issues have been raised with me, the first being the mental health and well-being of farmers.  All of the talk about cutbacks is putting a lot of pressure on their mental health and well-being.  Many farmers have young families and are worried about how they can keep their farms going.  I would like to see mental health and well-being incorporated into our CAP reform submission.  The other important issue is farm safety.  Farm Safety Week takes place in July and now is an opportune time to raise the issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> There have been a huge number of farm accidents, and a lot of them have ended up in tragedy, which is very sad.  In 2019, there were 19 fatalities.  Up to mid-2020, there had been 14 fatalities, which is tragic.  Now is an opportune time, when CAP is being looked at, to give assurance to farmers.  They are the lifeblood of our culture in Ireland.   There are so many agrifood businesses that have been established from farms.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter.  I congratulate her on her recent re-election to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is great to see her back on the agricultural panel.  It is also great that one of the first topics she has raised on her return relates to such an important area of agriculture.  I thank the Senator for that.</p><p>The Senator is right that it is not just about farm safety, it is also about farmers' mental health and well-being, especially in these Covid times.  I am aware that it is hard on all of us and that everybody has suffered isolation.  The latter has had a greater impact on farmers, however, particularly those older farmers who live on alone.  Their main sources of socialisation outside of their work were, in general, going to the mart or to the pub, both of which were closed due to Covid.  Even going to a sporting event, be it a GAA game or a soccer match in the local village, was out, along with mass or services at the weekend.  All of these outlets were taken away from them.  Farmers spend a lot of time on their own, worrying about the weather, prices, etc., and, during Covid, there has not been a safety valve to relieve the pressure.  I am taking a number of initiatives to try to improve the position in this regard, including working with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Feighan, on the On Firm Ground initiative.  This will train advisers to help signpost supports for farmers.  I will go into those shortly.</p><p>The Senator is right to talk about the impact of farm safety and the overall numbers.  Agriculture gives employment to approximately 6% of the State's total workforce but it accounts for almost 50% of workplace-related fatalities.  We had a late notification in February for a death that happened last year, so now our numbers for the past year officially stand at 20.  Of those 20 people who lost their lives last year, nine were farmers over the age of 65 and three were children under the age of eight.  These figures are unacceptably high.  This is why the Government is determined to address the issue.  In that context, we set out very ambitious targets in the programme for Government.</p><p>I am the first Minister of State to be given dedicated responsibility for farm safety.  While farm safety is not an issue for the CAP negotiation process - the Council&rsquo;s agreed general approach to CAP reform does not reference farm safety - this does not mean that we cannot address it in the context of the next CAP.  The proposed CAP gives member states much more subsidiarity to design interventions, on the basis of their own needs, through CAP strategic plans.  Our strategic plan is being worked on at the moment.</p><p>In the context of the flexibility relating to CAP strategic plans and in the context of the programme for Government, which identifies the need to invest in enhanced farm safety and well-being measures under the next CAP, my Department is incorporating farm safety into the next CAP strategic plan for 2023&ndash;27, which is currently in development.  Putting together the plan will involve a number of stages, including: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT, analysis and needs analysis; needs assessment; intervention design; financial allocations; target-setting, including monitoring; and governance systems.  The draft CAP strategic plan will also be subject to an <i>ex-ante</i>evaluation, strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment including a public consultation on the draft plan and draft environmental report this summer.  This will be an opportunity for everybody to have their say.</p><p>I have, with my officials, continued to engage extensively with stakeholders on the future of CAP.  This process has been ongoing.  Further public consultations on the development of the CAP strategic plan are being considered and will happen.  I look forward to that engagement with stakeholders as we develop the plan, which as the Senator has said, must be submitted to the Commission by 1 January 2023.</p><p>The SWOT analysis and needs assessment process has identified health and safety on farms as an area that requires attention under the next CAP.  This is due to Ireland's unacceptably high level of farm fatalities.  It is my view is that all measures in the CAP strategic plan should have a health and safety element incorporated as appropriate.  I am working with my officials to develop measures in the next CAP to reflect that.  We can expect to see health and safety requirements feature strongly in our training programmes for farmers and advisers, as well as through the various measures from on-farm investments to livestock schemes and the rest.  I will expand on that further in my supplementary answer.</p></speech>

I was delighted to hear the Minister of State's acknowledgment that he is working with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Feighan, on the issue of mental health.  Stress has presented many mental health issues for farmers and I am glad the Minister of State acknowledged that.  Falling incomes, higher costs, which affect every industry, and increased regulations are a cause of stress, and I welcome the fact he acknowledged that.  I thank him for his commitment and look forward to hearing in the future his plans as they unfold.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#D00200"><p>The Senator is dead right.  I am delighted to hear her equate farm safety, well-being and mental health because there is no doubt they are deeply interconnected.  The agrifood strategy for 2030, which is currently out for public consultation, reflects that.  We talk about a food systems approach to agriculture in the future and the sustainability of all the systems, that is, not just environmental sustainability, which is crucial, but also economic and societal sustainability in order to allow farmers to continue to do what they are doing, make an economic return on which they can raise families, as generations before them did, and be able to do that without additional pressure.</p> <p>I am also taking other measures in the Department.  I secured &euro;1 million in the most recent budget in the context of the EIP on farm safety and the second phase of those initiatives is being worked through.  The accelerated capital allowance, approved by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, in the Finance Act has also helped.</p> <p>I am determined to see farm safety feature prominently in all aspects of CAP, where possible.  Any engagement with farmers from the Department and the arms of the State will continue to drive home the message in order that we can change the culture and significantly reduce the level of farm fatalities and serious incidents on farms.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#D00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, to the House.  As always, it is good to see her.  She always gives a very comprehensive response to Commencement matters or any other matter that might come before the House.  I raise issues with BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and bowel screening.  I am a former director of the National Treatment Purchase Fund - I do not know whether the Minister of State knew that - so I am very aware of the importance of waiting lists, how they are managed and the significance of screening for cancer.  Early detection means better outcomes for people struggling with the terrible disease of cancer.  There is also anxiety arising from having to wait for screening, which is not good for patients or anybody else.  I accept that Covid-19 has had a significant impact on waiting lists and our health services.  These three issues were covered in the Sunday newspapers yesterday, strangely enough, although I had tabled this Commencement matter a few days ago.</p> <p>There are substantial waiting lists and backlogs for BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and bowel screening.  The number of women who had a complete mammogram last year was just over 56,000, which was behind target by 128,730 patients.  The number of women who had one or more cervical smear test in primary care cases was 143,000, behind target by 111,000 patients.  As for bowel screening, there were 50,000 tests, yet this was behind target by 75,000.  Bowel cancer that is detected early can be treated very successfully.</p> <p>Doctors and patients have called for a strategy to tackle these backlogs in respect of cancer diagnosis and that is important.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The National Screening Service also says it is under pressure in terms of capacity and wishes to come back on target in respect of the stated objectives regarding issues surrounding analysis and diagnostics.  As the Minister of State is aware, there were over 5,600 GP referrals for cancer in March 2021 alone, compared with 2,234 in 2020 so the figure has gone from over 2,500 to over 5,500 in one year for one month.  Alarm bells must be ringing in respect of these issues.  Diagnostic services such as colonoscopies are critically important.  We know colonoscopy is the most accurate test for cancer of the colon and rectum and is proven to detect disease early so that the disease is treatable and curable and people can get on with their lives.  Diagnostics is really important.  </p><p>I am conscious that the three biggest challenges for the Government are health, housing and jobs.  The Government and all politicians on all sides of the Houses will be judged on how they perform.  I believe that without one's health, one does not need a house or a job.  Health is primary.  It is at the top of the matrix in terms of how we can deliver for our people.  I accept, understand and acknowledge the enormous pressures faced by the Government.  I am not here to blame anybody.  Like the Minister of State, I am here to get us back on track and I would like to hear what the Government has in mind in terms of getting these three critical cancer screening services back on track for the well-being of our people and our health service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for giving me the opportunity to update the House on this important matter.  There is probably not a house in Ireland that has not been affected by cancer.  I did not realise the Senator was a former director of the National Treatment Purchase Fund so he has a very good understanding of how it actually works.</p> <p>I am pleased to say that our three cancer screening programmes - BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelScreen - are operating.  All programmes were paused for a time in 2020 due to Covid-19.  While screening services resumed throughout last year, it was at reduced capacity.  BreastCheck was paused again in January and February of this year due to the Covid-19 situation and resumed screening on 8 March 2021.</p> <p>The National Screening Service has done a significant amount of work to mitigate against Covid-19 risks and support the safe resumption of services.  This has included the vaccination of front-line staff in screening services.  The latest data show a good increase in numbers screened during March and April.  In March, CervicalCheck screened over 45,000 women and the provisional data for April indicates that over 28,000 women were screened.  This is significantly above the target of 24,000 and I acknowledge the huge effort by CervicalCheck, primary care services and GPs and the laboratory services in achieving this level of activity.  The provisional April data for BreastCheck show that over 12,000 women were screened and in BowelScreen, over 24,000 invitations were issued.  Again, I acknowledge all  the teams in screening services and clinical pathways for their ongoing work to get screening back to full capacity.</p> <p>The focus of the resumption of cancer screening services includes the management of capacity across the whole of the screening pathway, which includes follow-up assessment and treatments so while invitations for screening were paused, it is important to note that follow-up assessments and treatment continued throughout the pandemic with a particular focus on urgent and time-sensitive cases.  </p> <p>In resuming screening, those who may be at highest risk of disease are being prioritised.  The Senator was quite right when he said that early detection is vital.  It is also important to emphasise that screening is a population-based measure aimed at healthy people who do not have symptoms.  People who may be between screening appointments or who are waiting for rescheduled appointments should contact their GP if they are concerned about any possible symptoms. </p> <p>In terms of funding, an additional &euro;10 million was allocated for cancer screening services to the HSE for 2021.  Many of the new developments being funded in 2021 will enable the management of screening service users with deferred appointments due to Covid-19.  One important initiative prioritised for 2021 is the development and opening of semi-permanent BreastCheck units in two locations in Donegal and Dublin later this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In light of all of this, I trust the public can be assured of the ongoing commitment to our national cancer screening programmes and to getting services back to full capacity as safely and as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for that.  I am particularly pleased about the confirmation of the services for Donegal today because there is a substantial level of concern about the issue in the county.  That is good news for the people of Donegal, for the people who represent them and for the people of Dublin.  This goes back to the fact that the delayed detection of late-stage cancers will mean fewer treatment options and not very successful outcomes.  This is the impact on people, in terms of their survival, and their families to which the Minister of State referred.</p> <p>I ask the Government, the Department of Health and the Minister of State's officials to keep this as an issue a priority, to review the national cancer strategy, to address any further shortcomings and to monitor developments on a month-by-month basis.  We must remain on the case and keep monitoring.  In another few months, if there is a reduction in the figures, we need to examine that.  Ultimately, I would like the Minister of State to publish a comprehensive capacity and workforce plan.  It is important that we stay focused on this issue and continue to publish the figures.  I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive reply.</p></speech>

The HSE and the National Screening Service are working hard to provide cancer screening in a safe environment and to get screening back to full capacity.  I take the Deputy's point and I agree with him wholeheartedly that we have to ensure that this matter remains a priority.  It is essential that we do so.</p> <p>As I outlined, the data for March and April show a significant improvement.  The National Screening Service continues to provide up-to-date information for the public on its programme websites, including regular updates with respect to Covid-19.  Due to the difficulties we are encountering in the Department of Health and the HSE because of the cyberattack, I encourage anyone who has an appointment this week to check the website, if possible, before attending because, unfortunately, many appointments have been affected.  It is awful when we are finally getting back on our feet that people who have been waiting for an appointment for quite a while might have it cancelled.</p></speech>

I also thank her for the work she does on behalf of older people and in the area of mental health.  It is fitting that she is here to discuss the menopause.  This matter relates to older women and those who are suffering from mental health issues because of a lack of understanding and awareness and many have either been misdiagnosed or have not had the proper diagnosis.  I know the Minister of State will be bring compassion and understanding to the matter.  I have not previously sensed or felt as much frustration, liberation or emotion as I have in recent weeks in the context of the discussions we are starting to have with regard to the menopause.</p> <p>We have had not only decades but centuries of not discussing something that 51% of our population experiences.  We know that women generally live one third of their lives post menopause.  The quality of that third of their lives very much depends on the support and treatments they receive during the menopause.  Some 80% of women have a difficult menopause.  I have read and listened to accounts of what large numbers of women have gone through, many of whom have opened up and told their stories and outlined their journeys.  That has been cathartic for these women in many ways.  I want to listen to all the recordings from Joe Duffy's radio show of the women telling their stories, outlining their journeys and expressing their sadness, anger and frustration at not being believed about what they were going through.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were stories of women who were put on anti-depression medication or being diagnosed with different conditions and referred to consultants and of people not understanding.  It is shocking that we are having these conversations at this stage.</p><p>We want encourage and support women and, of course, men to lead healthy and fulfilling lives at every stage of their lives.  We need to support women and we need to support men to understand what the women in their lives are going through.  We need to support our health professionals because far too many GPs and physiotherapists do not have the proper supports or training on what they need to do to support their patients.</p><p>It has been a breath of fresh air in many ways, even when looking at some of the Facebook groups such as The Irish Menopause and My Second Spring groups.  Reading and listening to these stories, I felt I had found my tribe.  I could identify with and relate to all of it.  The floodgates have </p><p>opened in terms of the menopause and I thank all the women who have been brave enough to share their stories.</p><p>Women are being misdiagnosed.  They have been denied treatment and given incorrect treatment.  We need to change that for women who will go through the menopause in future.  We need to ensure they get proper treatment and we have awareness programmes in place in health and education.</p></speech>

Sometimes Ministers can be asked to respond to questions in an area with which they are not especially familiar, but when it came to talking about the menopause, I was well qualified to answer.</p> <p>It is great to hear what has happened on the airwaves over the last couple of weeks.  Women have been given a voice and somebody to listen to them.  That was a huge part of it.  It was therapeutic that someone was there to listen.  It was also great for men to be given an understanding of how difficult it can be for women going through the menopause.</p> <p>The Government recognises that menopause is a key health issue for women in Ireland today.  Stigma and uncertainty persist for many women on an issue which will impact over half of the population and this has to change.  Work is under way to drive progress in this area.  This has been driven by the women's health task force, which was convened in September 2019 to improve health outcomes and experiences for women and girls.</p> <p>The menopause has been identified as a priority under the women's health task force.  A number of initial priority areas for action were determined by the task force in 2020, with the issue of menopause recognised and included as one of these priority areas.  This is welcome.</p> <p>In terms of treatment, most women will experience some symptoms around the menopause.  The duration and severity of these symptoms vary from woman to woman.  It is recommended that women who experience menopausal symptoms which they find difficult to deal with see their GP.  GPs can offer treatment and suggest lifestyle changes if a woman has severe menopausal symptoms that have a significant impact on her everyday activities.</p> <p>Discussion is under way between the Department and the HSE on the provision of potential additional support to this area and I will be happy to update the House on the matter once it has been approved and finalised.</p> <p>An important aspect to mention is that increased information and awareness has been a key ask heard from women on this issue.  This has been heard by the women's health task force, both through direct engagement with stakeholders and the national radical listening consultation exercise under way to capture women's voices and views of health in Ireland.  This has also been reiterated in recent media conversations.  I am happy to share details of activity, both under way and planned, which will address this ask specifically such as the inclusion of menopause as a topic within the new HSE online citizen health guides currently under development.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Menopause will be included within a women's health information repository site of trusted sources, to be developed over the coming months.  It will also be included as a topic in an education and communication campaign on specific women's health issues that is intended to be held later this year.  Women's health will be represented on the healthy workplace framework implementation committee that will be convened later this year.  This will help ensure women's health needs are addressed in this forum with particular reference to increased awareness of menopause within the workplace, which can be very difficult for some ladies.  I was listening one day to a woman who felt there was no understanding in the workplace of what she was going through.</p><p>I hope this has given the Senator some assurance that the Department and the HSE are fully aware of the importance of this issue for the women of Ireland, and that we are actively engaged to deliver positive change in this area.  I know the Senator will drive this issue in the Seanad.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, because he has already done quite a bit of work in the area of women's health and that must be recognised.  Education and research are central to removing the taboos and stigma around the menopause and supporting women going through their journey.  The Minister of State mentioned that the menopause will be included as a topic within the new HSE online citizen health guides that are currently being developed, and the women's health information repository site is important.  We have to keep talking about this.  That is key.  The women who are tuning in to this debate should keep talking, listening and sharing and we will keep talking here.  As chair of the women's caucus, this is something we will continue bringing up with the Minister.</p></speech>

Significant activity is planned for this year to increase awareness and access to information, which was a key ask from the women of Ireland.  As the Senator has said, it is only right and fitting to acknowledge the work of the Minister for Health, who is progressing these new initiatives.  While GPs can advise women who experience difficult menopausal symptoms on potential treatments and lifestyle changes that may benefit them, discussion has also taken place on the provision of potential additional supports in this area.  I will be happy to speak further on those once they are finalised.  Both the Department and the HSE are very much engaged and committed to driving progress in this important area.  I again thank the Senator for inviting me in today to speak on this very important issue.  I have no doubt that the voice of the women's caucus will be very loud in progressing this matter.</p></speech>

It is such a relief for people at the moment to be able to visit friends and neighbours in nursing homes.  I know that from my own experience.  I thank the Minister of State and all the people working in that sector.</p> <p>My question relates to the proposed primary care centre in Fethard, County Tipperary.  Fethard has been identified by the HSE as the preferred location for the development of a primary care centre.  A site directly adjacent to Fethard town park has been scoped and approved by the proposed primary care centre developer.  This development is greatly welcomed as it will allow for increased economies of scale and the creation of a co-located campus with mutual health and well-being benefits for all.  However, there seems to be a lack of progress lately.  The HSE has been quite slow in progressing primary care centres in the south east, which includes Fethard.  I understand that all works have been slowed and bogged down because of Covid but can the Minister of State give assurances that this is still a priority for the Department, and for her in particular?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Primary care centres play a vital role in rural areas and towns.  Fethard is a prime example of an area and hinterland that would benefit greatly from having a primary care centre.  The Minister of State is based not far from the area, so she knows Fethard is a small town with a population of approximately 1,500, with a good hinterland.  Successful work has been done on a range of issues in the town.  A primary school has been extended to add two new classrooms, the secondary school has a large extension of 14 new rooms, so we now have almost a new school beside the existing one, and funding of &euro;2.6 million was secured from the rural regeneration fund for Fethard town park.  All of these developments are in the same part of the town.  It is in a perfect area, which incorporates education, well-being and sport.  The jewel in the crown, the development that would finish the whole project, is the primary care centre.</p><p>There is so much work going on in Fethard.  I do not know of any other area, in County Tipperary or beyond, where so many community groups have been involved in the projects.  They include Holy Trinity National School, the town's secondary school and community playschool, Fethard GAA and rugby clubs, the scout group and the community council.  Some 27 groups have come together to work with Tipperary County Council, the Cashel and Emly diocese and Coolmore to build a centre of excellence for well-being, sport, community and education and everything is progressing nicely.</p><p>We have had some difficult number for building and progressing projects, which is of course understandable.  However, things are starting to move now on the 23-acre site, which includes the secondary school, primary school and town park.  As such, some information on progress for the primary care centre would be the icing on the cake for a fantastic community of people who give back an awful lot to their area and, most important, work together for the benefit of the region.  Any indication the Minister of State could give in this regard would be greatly appreciated.</p></speech>

He described a vibrant community supported by many community groups and also the importance of the new proposed primary care centre for Fethard, County Tipperary.  I welcome the opportunity to provide an update to the House.</p> <p>The ongoing development of both community and primary care is the core of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  This Government is committed to ensuring people are provided with the care they need as close to home as possible and have access to the wide possible range of health and social care services within their community.  In support of this national goal, south east community healthcare is working to develop primary care centres across the region.  In February 2019, a schedule setting out the next stage of primary care development was drafted and priority sites in the south-east were identified.</p> <p>One of the five priority sites was the area of Slieve Ardagh and west County Tipperary which includes, as the Senator mentioned, Fethard, Killenaule, Gortnahoe and Ballingarry.  As the area is rural, with a number of small towns and villages, it was considered from both an operational and HSE estates perspective that the development of the new primary care centre should be located centrally insofar as is possible.  Following consultations, Fethard was agreed as the proposed site for the new centre.  Expressions of interest were subsequently advertised in November 2019 and the process of engaging with developers commenced.  I understand two developers have expressed an interest and that local GPs have also signed up in support of the Fethard centre.  It is the intention that some existing GP practices will be aligned with the Fethard primary care centre, while GP practices in other local towns and villages will be maintained.</p> <p>I am pleased to be able to advise the Senator that HSE estates is reviewing the schedule of accommodation and expects to be in a position to issue relevant documentation to developers before the end of May.  This will allow developers to finalise the design and bring the opening of the centre one step closer.  This is a very welcome development as the centre will bring vital services to the Slieve Ardagh and west County Tipperary area, providing modern, purpose-built accommodation and acting as a single point of access for health and social care delivery.  The primary care team will include GPs working alongside public health nurses and other healthcare professionals, including occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This team will also link in with the wider community network services, including dental care and hearing specialists, among others.  The Government is committed to continued investment in the development of primary care centres nationwide, in both urban and rural areas.  These facilities have a crucial role to play in enhancing and expanding capacity in the primary care sector to deliver high quality, integrated care to people in their own communities.  I am sure the centre in Fethard will come to be seen as a valued community asset.</p></speech>

I thank her, in particular, for saying that relevant documentation to developers will be issued before the end of May.  That takes us one step closer and it is the major step towards getting everything moving.  I thank the Minister of State for her engagement and work on this matter, and her help in pushing it along.  There are many things going on in the Minister of State's Department, including the cybersecurity issue we heard about last week and, with that in mind, I thank her for prioritising primary care centres.  As she said, the Government is committed to prioritising primary care.  I can see that in Cahir.  A primary care centre opened in Cahir approximately two or three months before the onset of Covid-19.  GPs and public health nurses in that primary care centre do not know where they would have been had they been in their old facility, nor how they would have coped.  The comparison between the challenges they face and the challenges they would have faced if they were not in a primary care centre is like comparing chalk and cheese.  It is massive for Fethard and the surrounding areas that they will have a primary care centre in the future.  I thank the Minister of State again for her work and for her commitment that the next stage will happen at the end of May.</p></speech>

As I have said, the development of primary care centres is an important part of the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  These facilities provide a single point of access to health services and offer a means of supporting people to live independently in their own communities for as long as possible.  That is what I aspire to every day - the right care in the right place at the right time, including the correct wrap-around supports for older people so they do not have to go to an acute hospital for support or that their entry into a nursing home may be delayed because they can get the appropriate supports at home.</p> <p>Good progress continues to be made in the development and roll-out of primary care centres across the country.  Some 142 are now operational, with 14 of them opening last year, despite the challenges posed by Covid.  A further 15 are at different stages of the construction or equipping process and are expected to open in 2021, with a pipeline of projects to follow in later years.  As he said, the Senator is aware that Tipperary has benefited from investment with four primary care centres in Tipperary Town, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel and Cahir.  We can all agree that these facilities have a key role to play.  I reiterate that relevant documentation to developers will be issued before the end of May.  I thank the Senator for his interest in the matter.</p></speech>

Today, 17 May, marks the 47th anniversary of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Each year, we gather here to discuss this issue but, unfortunately, there is little or no progress or forward movement for the victims, survivors and their families.  Some 34 people lost their lives in Monaghan and Dublin on that fatal day.  It was the greatest loss of life on a single day during the Troubles.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the anniversary occurs again today, our thoughts and our prayers are with the victims and their families.  It is difficult and frustrating to try to understand how, 47 years on, we are no wiser as to the role of the British state or who was responsible for this tragedy in which 33 people lost their lives, seven in County Monaghan and 26 in Dublin.  We can only imagine the pain and grief the families continue to endure over this period.  That pain is compounded by the absence, for more than four decades, of the truth of what actually happened on 17 May 1974.</p><p>I pay tribute to all those who have worked through the years to lift the lid on this mystery.  I acknowledge the huge work done by the Justice for the Forgotten group, as well as everything that has been done by Members of the Oireachtas to move this issue forward.  Despite all of this, we are no closer to a resolution.  The families' quest for truth and justice has been blocked in every quarter and largely ignored.</p><p>The British Government must make all documents relating to this atrocity available.  It is imperative that both Governments work together to deliver a structure that can manage the legacy of the past in a way that can positively contribute to reconciliation on this island in the future.  Unilateral action is unacceptable.  I call on the Government to reinvigorate our efforts, on behalf of the people of this country, especially those of Monaghan and Dublin, to request the British Government to release the papers in order that these families can finally bring closure to this and put the memories of their loved ones to rest.</p></speech>

Some 33 people were murdered and hundreds seriously injured on that awful day in 1974, which was the highest number of casualties in any single day during the Troubles.  We will continue to seek the full truth of these appalling attacks, as well as some measure of closure for the victims' families and survivors, in accordance with the three motions passed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to date.</p> <p>The all-party motion on the 1974 Dublin-Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the D&aacute;il on 25 May 2016, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, calls on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The motions also ask the British Government to provide access to original documents relating to the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay&rsquo;s Tavern in Dundalk, and the murder of Seamus Ludlow.</p> <p>The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-party D&aacute;il motions.  We have consistently raised the issue with the British Government, including at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  We have also raised the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the need for access to all original documents during regular engagements with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Prime Minister.  The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on this request, at senior political level and in official level engagement by my Department, to pursue all possible avenues to achieve progress on this issue until a resolution is found.</p> <p>Importantly, the Government has also welcomed the announcement by the PSNI on 30 November 2019 that former Bedfordshire chief constable, Jon Boutcher, is heading an independent police team to conduct an analytical report on collusion in what has become known as the Glenanne gang series of cases.  This is relevant to several cases including the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The former chief constable has been in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner regarding his investigation, as well as with the Dublin-Monaghan families.  This is a potentially significant development and one which I know the families have strongly welcomed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Colm Brophy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government will be supportive of facilitating this investigation subject to the requirements of the law as there are other investigative processes in Northern Ireland.  The families, like so many across this island who have suffered great loss during the Troubles, have been waiting far too long.  It is appropriate to recall the powerful findings of the inquest last week into the deaths of ten people in Ballymurphy in 1971.  It shows that truth can still be brought to light, even decades later.  Some injustices can be corrected for the world to see.  We look forward to the day when the families of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and other terrible days, will see days like last Tuesday in the Coroner's Court in Belfast.</p></speech>

The events last week in regard to Ballymurphy give us all hope.  I am sure the people of Monaghan and Dublin who were following the developments last week in regard to Ballymurphy, which occurred in 1971, are, perhaps, hopeful that their day too might be coming.  I urge the Minister of State and the Government to do all they can, as I know they will, to ensure these families can finally get closure.  Forty-seven years have passed and a lot of these people are not getting any younger and they would like closure while they are still here to witness it.</p></speech>

The Government will continue to engage with the British Government to secure the implementation of the all-party Oireachtas motions on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Our position on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings is consistent with our approach to the legacy of the Troubles more broadly.  Every family bereaved in the conflict should have access to an effective investigation and a process of justice regardless of the perpetrator.  To achieve this requires a collective approach.  We have set out this approach in the Stormont House Agreement.  Progress on implementing a framework that is consistent with the agreement is critical to ensuring that these issues are dealt with comprehensively and fairly, and in a way that meets the needs of the victims and survivors, as well as society as a whole.</p> <p>I again thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p></speech>

The only way to stop this horrific spiral of violence and displacement is to end Israel's illegal occupation of Palestine and its violent oppression of the Palestinian people.  The Government should sanction Israel for breaching international law and committing crimes against humanity by way of passage of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.</p><p>Human Rights Watch, one of the most respected human rights organisations in the world, and B'Tselem, another respected Israeli human rights organisations, both recently concluded that Israel is committing crimes against humanity, against the Palestinian people.  The only way to stop this horrific cycle of Israel's violent displacement of Palestinians from their homes, the daily punishment of innocent families and Israel bombing Gaza is to make the economic cost of this conflict too high to bear.  Ireland was at the forefront of the campaign that ended apartheid in South Africa and we can end Israeli apartheid.</p><p>Condemnation is not enough.  It can be ignored.  It is only when there are consequences for Israel that it will end the discrimination and oppression.<font color="#2F2F2F"> </font>Most EU states, including Ireland, are rightly calling for an immediate de-escalation of hostilities to save lives, but calls for de-escalation without any meaningful plan for what comes next is gaslighting.  Western leaders can call for de-escalation, but when the fighting stops, what happens next?  Everything goes back to normal, but normal just means institutionalised discrimination and apartheid, with widespread injustice across the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza.  Those same Western leaders will accept this return to normal and move on to the next issue, refusing to take any real action or ensure accountability. </p><p>Breaking the cycle of violence requires de-escalation, but it also requires political will and action from the international community.  Let us not gaslight the many Palestinians and Israelis who want to see a just and lasting peace by calling for de-escalation today when the issue is in the news, but abdicating any responsibility tomorrow.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Palestinian people have been abandoned by the international community but Ireland can take a stand and progress the occupied territories Bill.  The Government has said that it received legal advice from the Attorney General that EU trade agreements prevent Ireland from acting unilaterally on the issue.  It also said Ireland could face many millions of euro in EU fines for introducing such a law.  The Government&rsquo;s contention that the Bill would contravene EU law has been challenged by Professor Takis Tridimas, a barrister and one of Europe&rsquo;s top legal experts on EU law.  Professor Tridimas wrote a legal opinion on the Bill, citing previous decisions upholding the right of a member state to unilaterally ban imports from a country.  Ireland can unilaterally ban imports from the occupied territories under a provision that allows it to take decisions based on public policy.  The Government&rsquo;s position that we would be breaking EU law can be challenged at the European Court of Justice.  We should make the case and then let the court decide.  Sometimes laws are there to be changed and the dial is there to be moved.  That can only be done by testing the law and that is what we should be doing here.</p><p>The Government regularly states that it and our diplomats speak up for the human rights of Palestinians at the EU and the UN Security Council.  Will the Minister of State make a statement on what specific actions Ireland will now take at national, EU and UN levels in response to the extensive human rights violations and military assaults on civilian targets being conducted by the Israeli Government?  Does the Minister of State accept that statements of condemnation have not been and are not sufficient?  Does he acknowledge that a response based on international human rights must demonstrate seriousness about those human rights by following through with appropriate diplomatic and economic action, and what such actions will Ireland take and advocate for others to take?</p><p>Virtually every other tactic has been tried for decades to stop Israel's oppression of the Palestinian people.  The occupied territories Bill may be the first step in bringing freedom to Palestine and peace to the region.</p></speech>

I know he engaged with Senator Black on this yesterday at some length.  I would like to restate the Government&rsquo;s deep concern at the intensification of violence in Gaza, on the West Bank, and in Israel.  Now is the time for de-escalation, as the Senator correctly points out, before further loss of life.  We need to encourage all efforts to reach a ceasefire.  These events are terrifying for both Palestinian and Israeli civilians.  The number of child casualties is particularly shocking.  The protection of all civilians is of paramount importance and it is an obligation under international humanitarian law.</p> <p>Ireland has been vocal, as the Senator will acknowledge, in its condemnation of the escalating situation in the Middle East.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, addressed the UN Security Council, which met in emergency session.  He called for the council to condemn the violence and that all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law and respect human rights.  Adherence to international law is critical.  The Minister has also spoken to his counterparts in the Middle East region to underline the need to protect civilians, bring an end to this violence and move towards political engagement.  EU foreign ministers will meet tomorrow in an extraordinary session to discuss the issue.</p> <p>The overall human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory remains a matter of serious concern.  The protection and promotion of human rights is an integral part of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and we consistently seek to raise our concerns on human rights issues through the most appropriate and effective channels.  Our active participation at the UN Human Rights Council is particularly important for us in that regard.  Ireland is a consistent and strong supporter of interactive dialogues with the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory at the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly.  At the most recent session of the UN Human Rights Council in March, Ireland made a statement under item 7 during the general debate, which restated our commitment to the principles of accountability and emphasised that Ireland will continue to speak out against unilateral actions which are in breach of international humanitarian law.  Ireland regularly conveys our concerns on human rights issues to the Israeli authorities, both directly and through the EU.  The Minister raised these concerns with the Israeli ambassador last week.  We also provide financial support to Israeli and Palestinian NGOs working on human rights issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Colm Brophy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2427"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2427&amp;amp;pid=ColmBrophy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In respect of the occupied territories Bill, I know from her contributions on the Government's position that the Senator is well aware that the Bill is not and will not be compatible with EU law and will not be implementable.  This is the clear legal advice on the matter the Government has received from two Attorneys General.  As a Government that is strongly committed to the observance of international law as a solution, if it is not legal it is not something we will take forward.</p><p>Ireland has consistently and strongly opposed settlements, and will continue to do so.  Ireland is very clear on the illegality of Israel&rsquo;s settlement policy, which can only be seen as a strategy to take possession of Palestinian lands and is fundamentally undermining the two-state solution and a future Palestinian state.  The events of the past few days have not happened in isolation.  They come after settlement expansion and threats of violence against Palestinians in particular.  Ireland remains firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution based on international law, the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the agreed parameters.  I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p></speech>

I want to put on the record that I thank the Minister for calling me last night.  I know he would have been here this morning if he could have been.  I suppose the Minister of State has to understand my frustration.  It is very difficult to watch what is happening in Gaza and see children and families being killed.  Not only this but their homes are being destroyed.  They are given 58 seconds to leave their homes.  What kind of world are we living in?  I acknowledge the Minister is very passionate on this issue.  I understand where he is coming from.  I ask the Government to be open to looking at the opinion of Professor Tridimas and those of Senator Michael McDowell and Professor James Crawford.  They are all experts on this issue.  I also ask that the Government publishes the advice of the Attorney General.  It would be very beneficial for the people of the country to see what the Attorney General is saying so we can argue and debate it.  This is my ask today.  Let us see the advice of the Attorney General.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.</p></speech>

I agree that it is incredibly difficult to see the pictures and the absolute horror of what is taking place, and see people who are effectively trapped in Gaza coming under the most sustained very sophisticated military weaponry with absolutely nowhere to go.  We all take on board the horror of what we have seen and, obviously, the impact in Israel of rockets coming in in an uncontrolled way and landing on civilian populations there.  What is happening in Gaza, particularly to children, is something that is absolutely awful.</p> <p>With regard to the occupied territories Bill, as I said in my opening contribution, we are guided by the advice of two Attorneys General.  I fully empathise and understand where the Senator is coming from on this and the need and want for people to see something, and the concern they have about the settlements.  It is very important, as the Minister has said very clearly, that we want to engage with all of the partners, particularly with our EU partners.  We want to act collectively to bring about the solution, as I mentioned, that is desired by everybody, which in this immediate case is a cessation of the current violence.  The best way for us to do this is to adhere to law.  If we have the advice from two Attorneys General that we cannot progress, I do not think we, in setting out on a course of action, should do something we are told as a Government is not legal and, therefore, we cannot do.  Obviously we want to work towards a solution.  I thank the Senator very much for the opportunity she has provided by raising this today.</p></speech>

I thank the Leader for reacting so quickly and timely to organise a debate today on Palestine, Israel and the occupied territories.  Many of us in this House will welcome the opportunity to say what we feel and think about the situation.</p> <p>I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his performance at the meeting of the UN Security Council and his strong comments.  It is a shame that the US Administration was not as strong in its response.  I condemn utterly the killing of what we know to date as 58 children in these recent attacks.  It is appalling and disgusting.  We, the international community, should collectively be really worried by the situation and make a strong call to action on all communities across the world.</p> <p>I wish to again raise the ongoing restrictions at maternity hospitals.  We were told last week that there were national guidelines and that partners would be allowed to be present for labour, including induction, for the birth, that there would be visitations afterwards, and that partners would be present for the really important 20-week anomaly scan.  We were told that 14 of the 19 maternity units or hospitals were in compliance with national guidelines but my information is that is not correct.  Hospitals are taking a very localised view of what labour means when exactly the partner can attend.  Fathers and partners are still being left sitting in their cars waiting for a call to come in and mums are in considerable distress because of this situation.  It is my information that the Limerick hospital is not providing the 20-week scan to all mums and only provides a scan for at-risk pregnancies, as it determines.  It is 2021 and that is unacceptable.  Every mother and their baby or babies are entitled to an anomaly scan, which is an essential part of the pregnancy process.</p> <p>I have seen a letter that Saolta sent to a woman for the University Hospital Galway, where it said that it cannot conduct a full anomaly scan, would limit the appointment to 15 minutes due to social distancing requirements and, therefore, would give a partial anomaly scan.  In that case one may as well not give a scan at all.  One needs more than 15 minutes to do a scan as anyone who has been through this will testify.  Basically, hospitals are fudging the numbers and saying that they conduct anomaly scans for all women when they only give a half-baked scan.  They then deny doing so but I have seen it in black in white in a letter that a woman received.  I ask that the Leader uses the strength of her office to get an urgent update from the HSE and the Department of Health on the national guidelines, what exactly is meant by "labour" and if we can get a uniform approach across every hospital and unit as to what that means, and not have a localised approach.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I must note that five hospitals continue to be completely outside of national guidelines.  They are not anywhere near compliant with the guidelines on allowing partners to be present at almost any stage.  That must be addressed with urgency.</p><p>The final issue that I wish to raise is the ongoing debate around the menopause.  It has been a fantastic national conversation.  We need to see action.  In that regard, I call on the Leader to organise a debate on women's health at the earliest possible opportunity.  I ask that we get an update from the Minister on the women's health task force and the work it is doing not just on the menopause, but across all of the women's health issues that we have raised in this House, including fertility, IVF, maternity and endometriosis.  There are many issues and we would welcome the opportunity to discuss them.</p></speech>

I will not say anything more about it now.</p> <p>In raising the following issue, I am not engaging in being wise after the event.  The hacking of the HSE computer system is very serious.  The suggestion that other State computer systems are equally vulnerable is frightening, to say the least.  One only has to think of the possibility of the social welfare systems and those of the Department of Finance and various other places being interfered with by such hackers, to see how serious the situation is.  Again, without attempting to be wise after the event, we have had hints in the last year that HSE ICT systems were, to put it charitably, clunky and difficult to adapt to emergency situations.  I am conscious of the fact, going back to the time I was in Government, that the public sector has a difficulty sometimes in commissioning ICT expertise and systems, and is sometimes the victim of overzealous and overpriced proposals.  It is weak in that respect.  </p> <p>However, we now live in a society where our dependence on these systems is growing.  It is all very well for people to come into this House and talk about climate change and the rest of it, but thinking about it, as we move towards the use of electric cars, electric transport and no solid fuel, all of these things are driving us directly towards a situation where, for instance, electricity will be the absolute lifeline to all of us in the sense that water was to our ancestors.  I must be guaranteed that cybersecurity is taken very seriously.  We must have guarantees that there are back-up systems and internal firewalls in place, and that the matter is taken as seriously as anything else in the community - as seriously, for instance, as the pandemic.  The damage that can be done to us by repeated hacking from China, North Korea, Russia or wherever these people are free to operate with impunity is huge.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to arrange for a Minister with overall responsibility - perhaps the Minister with responsibility for the public service - to come in here and tell us clearly and in a properly organised way precisely what steps the Government is taking to protect us from calamities.  In my view, this is only the first shot in a war and I do not know whether we have any defences in this war or whether we have done anything seriously to counter this threat.</p></speech>

Parents and students alike who were close to the threshold limit are being told they no longer qualify for the SUSI grant because they accepted the PUP.  I raised this issue last year and asked that the Minister not allow it to happen.  In the period since, the Minister has spoken about SUSI a number of times.  There has even been a public consultation on SUSI reform.  However, somehow he did not see fit to stop students, who have had no drastic change in circumstances, be pushed beyond the threshold for grants simply for accepting the pandemic unemployment payment issued to them by this Government, which they were entitled to take.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not understand how or why their PUP cannot be disregarded for the purpose of assessing income, as per their other summer or Christmas earnings.  I ask that the Minister come in and we have a conversation about it.  I do not believe it is acceptable that students are being pushed out of SUSI grants this year.</p><p>I wish to briefly bring up the topic of eating disorders.  HSE figures show that the number of referrals for eating disorders has increased 66% since March 2020.  That is an enormous increase with which the service is in no way able to cope.  The services were underfunded and unable to cope long before Covid-19, quite frankly.</p><p>I am particularly concerned about eating disorders in young people.  In our health service, young people end up falling between cracks and into the wrong services.  Indeed, as we saw recently, a teenage girl spent nine weeks in the paediatric unit of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  I will also point out that there are no specialist eating disorder beds in the midlands or the Louth-Meath mental health services.</p><p>We need to ensure that intensive early interventions are available throughout the country.  An audit of the entire eating disorder system is needed.  The provision of beds and inpatient services is not sufficient.  An eating disorder is a deeply complex mental illness with a high mortality rate.  The nature of social media, and many traditional media, means there is an idolisation of a particular type of body, which is often unhealthy.  There is, therefore, also a responsibility on social media companies to play their part.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister into the House for a debate on eating disorders and funding of same.</p><p>I will take a moment to flag that 17 May is International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, which celebrates LGBTQIA+ people globally and raises awareness to combat discrimination.  All LGBTQIA+ people around the world deserve to be treated with respect and dignity and to be able to live free from discrimination, violence and persecution.</p><p>In Ireland, we pride ourselves on having progressive laws that protect LGBTQIA+ people.  We are considered a beacon internationally.  We lead by example but we must also look at how we can improve things here.  In particular, we need equal rights for families.  Internationally, we must be key players in education, fighting prejudice, discrimination and violence.  Transgender rights are human rights; transphobia can get into the sea, and then some.  I would like to take a moment to wish happy international day against homophobia, biphobia, interphobia and transphobia to my friends, family and fellow LGBTQIA+ parliamentarians.</p></speech>

Time and time again, we are told that things are opening up for women in maternal healthcare and they simply are not.  We are not seeing it on the ground.  We should not have to take to Instagram, which I have seen countless women do, or Twitter and Facebook to shout for our own rights.  It should be a given that there is transparency within our healthcare system with regard to maternity services.  I call on the Minister and also the HSE to provide that guidance and reassurance to everyone.</p> <p>Since I spoke about the issue of the menopause last Tuesday, little did I know that it was going to dominate the airwaves for almost another week after and will probably continue to do so.  That is really welcome but it has also been quite an emotional week for an awful lot of women, and indeed, their partners.  Several women as young as 30 have contacted me to talk about early menopause.  They do not want to be forgotten in the conversation when we speak about how this is perhaps an issue for older women.  Let us, therefore, continue that conversation.  I also welcome the comments from the Taoiseach around this issue.  There really is an opportunity now to have it placed front and centre when it comes to the women's health task force this year and into the future.</p> <p>I also thank the GPs who have reached out to tell us what will support them in the services they provide.  We also need to talk about employers, however.  We need to make sure this is an equal Ireland for every woman so that no matter where they work or who their doctor is, they are getting the exact same information and care.</p> <p>I agree with Senator McDowell about cybersecurity.  I will also point out that as we are moving forward to a greener Ireland, it is not just electricity on which we are relying.  Much of what we are doing is also ensuring that people have retrofitting in order that they do not need to use as much electricity, and that we also have other forms of transport.  It is a small point but not everything will be going electric.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to invest in cybersecurity, as the last few days have proven.

Like Senator McDowell, I want to refer to the weekend's cyberattack which was a very serious development.  Systems are under attack all of the time but this was a successful attack, at least in terms of breaking through.  It is possibly the most significant cyberattack on the Irish State and prompts questions about the robustness of the State's cybersecurity.  This goes right to the heart of data and systems security, not to mention the impact it has had on services.</p> <p>For years now Sinn F&eacute;in has included in its alternative budgets the need to significantly invest in improving and modernising ICT systems within the broader health sector.  It is for the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, GNCCB, to pursue the criminal element but there is a need for this to have minimal impact on health services as we move ahead.  Some hospitals had to cancel many services and clinics and there will be significant ongoing disruption, potentially for a number of days or weeks, if not months.  Clarity is needed from the HSE on the timing of the reopening of services and the Government must ensure that any additional supports or protections needed are resourced now.  We need to know how this happened, the source of the attack, how the systems were impacted and how it can be prevented from happening again.  There is a need to focus on ensuring that robust security is in place to fully protect the system and prevent future attacks like this from being successful.  There must be a review of the HSE's and the State's cyber defences.  It is equally important that services resume as quickly as possible.  Healthcare workers are facing a difficult enough situation already with Covid-19 and waiting lists and further disruption will create a very challenging environment.  </p> <p>We need to consider an enhanced role for the Defence Forces in cybersecurity.  Earlier this year my party colleagues, Deputies Brady and Clarke, made a comprehensive submission to the Commission on the Defence Forces which included an extensive set of recommendations on the expansion and enhancement of the capacity of the Defence Forces to defend the State against cyberattacks.  The events of the last couple of days have illustrated the importance of this beyond any doubt.</p> <p>There is a definitive need to develop the technology and software systems necessary to reduce our dependency on external systems.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the Government must identify the key strategic, technical and operational procedures required to develop our capacity to act independently of external partners.  Adequate training also needs to be introduced in the field of cybersecurity in order to enhance and maintain highly effective, professional staff in the field.  The sustainability of any cybersecurity system will depend on adequate investment in this area.  The role of a revamped, cutting-edge Defence Forces cyber unit is critical in preventing cyberattacks but this can only happen if the State has the ability to recruit and retain the necessary personnel.  This is a cross-cutting issue and we should have statements in this House on it as soon as possible, particularly on the next steps and the longer-term strategic response.</p></speech>

I am completely and utterly exhausted from talking about what is going on.  It is just soul-destroying and if I am feeling like that, what must it be like for the people of Palestine?  The situation is just horrendous.</p> <p>I raised the issue as a Commencement matter this morning.  I ask that the Minister, during the course of this evening's debate, give us an understanding of the legal advice the Government has received from the Attorney General and go into some detail on it, if possible.  I would really like to hear about that tonight.  We have already heard legal opinion from Senator McDowell, Professor Takis Tridimas and Professor James Crawford so if it is possible, I would like to hear the opinion of the Attorney General this evening.</p> <p>In the time remaining, I would like to read a poem about what life is like for the people of Gaza.  This poem was first published in 2017 but reflects what is going on at this very moment in Gaza.  I want the Government parties to hear what it is like.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all have our busy lives but we must bring down to brass tacks what is going on.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to allow me to read a poem into the record.  It is &quot;Running Orders&quot; by Lena Khalaf Tuffaha.</p><blockquote>	They call us now.<br /><br />Before they drop the bombs.<br /><br />The phone rings<br /><br />and someone who knows my first name<br /><br />calls and says in perfect Arabic<br /><br />&ldquo;This is David.&rdquo;<br /><br />And in my stupor of sonic booms and glass shattering symphonies<br /><br />still smashing around in my head<br /><br />I think &ldquo;Do I know any Davids in Gaza?&rdquo;<br /><br />They call us now to say<br /><br />Run.<br /><br />You have 58 seconds from the end of this message.<br /><br />Your house is next.<br /><br />They think of it as some kind of<br /><br />war time courtesy.<br /><br />It doesn&rsquo;t matter that<br /><br />there is nowhere to run to.<br /><br />It means nothing that the borders are closed<br /><br />and your papers are worthless<br /><br />and mark you only for a life sentence<br /><br />in this prison by the sea<br /><br />and the alleyways are narrow<br /><br />and there are more human lives<br /><br />packed one against the other<br /><br />more than any other place on earth<br /><br />Just run.<br /><br />We aren&rsquo;t trying to kill you.<br /><br />It doesn&rsquo;t matter that<br /><br />you can&rsquo;t call us back to tell us<br /><br />the people we claim to want aren&rsquo;t in your house<br /><br />that there&rsquo;s no one here<br /><br />except you and your children<br /><br />who were cheering for Argentina<br /><br />sharing the last loaf of bread for this week<br /><br />counting candles left in case the power goes out.<br /><br />It doesn&rsquo;t matter that you have children.<br /><br />You live in the wrong place<br /><br />and now is your chance to run<br /><br />to nowhere.<br /><br />It doesn&rsquo;t matter<br /><br />that 58 seconds isn&rsquo;t long enough<br /><br />to find your wedding album<br /><br />or your son&rsquo;s favorite blanket<br /><br />or your daughter&rsquo;s almost completed college application<br /><br />or your shoes<br /><br />or to gather everyone in the house.<br /><br />It doesn&rsquo;t matter what you had planned.<br /><br />It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are<br /><br />Prove you&rsquo;re human.<br /><br />Prove you stand on two legs.<br /><br />Run. </blockquote><p>I think that says it all.  It is absolutely devastating.  Enough is enough.  Condemnation is not enough anymore.  We must do something.  We have a Bill now.  I really want to hear what the Attorney General's advice is, and why he says it is illegal, when we know this can go to the European courts.  We can let it go to the EU courts and let it be argued there.  I ask Ireland to lead on this and I ask the Government parties here today to please, please do something that is positive.  We did it for apartheid South Africa and we can do it now today.  </p></speech>

With the passage of the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 in October last year, we had all hoped it would address the inertia in the issuance of licences, especially for the felling of timber.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  With the construction sector pretty much back in full swing, there is a shortage of timber.  Licences are not being issued, timber is not being processed and, unfortunately, when there is a hold-up in supply, there is considerable demand and the price goes up.  I am being told that since earlier this year the price of timber has gone up by 35%.  This is a commodity and the price would normally fluctuate 5% either way, but when we take this into account on top of a housing crisis, and when nearly 35% of our house construction is now timber frame, it is a real crisis.  I do not know what is required but we need an urgent debate in the House and we need to thrash out with the appropriate Minister some pathway to ensure that the felling of timber gets under way.  There are issues with licencing for roadways, thinnings and plantations, but we are also way under the number of trees that need to be planted.  We had a target last year of 8,000 ha to be planted but we planted some 2,500 ha.  This is an ongoing issue but it is currently at a crisis point, with no sign of a resolution until such a time as we can get the licences issued, get the timber cut and into the mills to be processed.  I am talking with sawmill managers and their agents daily.  They tell me that they must dot across the country to try to get scraps of timber just to feed their mills.  This is not good enough.  It is an important indigenous sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to treat it as such and ensure that the laws and rules allow the industry to operate efficiently, although that is not in any way to take away from the climate change perspective, which recognises that we need to plant many more trees to sequester carbon.</p></speech>

I have always believed that as long as there are five permanent members of the UN Security Council, issues such as this can never be truly resolved.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to accommodate a debate on the issue of rural transport.  As we know, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 is currently before the D&aacute;il and will soon come before this House for an important debate on its passage.  Its commitments include a target of net zero emissions by 2050 and a 51% reduction in emissions by the end of this decade.  Actions for each sector will be detailed in the climate action plan, which will be updated annually.</p> <p>Transport will be a key area, among others.  Many urban dwellers have different options for getting from A to B.  People in Dublin have the DART, the Luas and more comprehensive bus and cycle lanes, while there are plans in Galway for BusConnects and it also has greenways, some of which can be used by commuters.  Options in rural Ireland, however, are limited and, where present, expensive.  If we are serious about reducing car use and thereby emissions, rural transport will have to be examined to improve the public transport spines and to interconnect the local public transport systems that are in play.  I ask that we have a debate on the issue of public transport.  It will be key in respect of emissions reduction and have a practical benefit for all rural residents.</p></speech>

The replacement of the debate on defence issues is important.</p> <p>I look forward to the debate on Fine Gael's Private Members' motion on young people.  It is a thought-provoking issue.  All is not well in that area and I look forward to setting out a number of issues and sharing some information in respect of the Ombudsman for Children.  I also welcome the debate on the Affordable Housing Bill 2021, which will be critical.</p> <p>I call for a debate on dying, death and bereavement.  Senators might recall that the final event in this House of the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, was to launch an amazing body of work, Finite Lives, by the former Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell.  It was the biggest event I have experienced in my five years in the House.  It was packed and there was much anticipation, about both Mr. Kenny's future and, more important, the issue at hand.  The then Taoiseach told me he had chosen to make it his final official launch in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The report is a substantial body of work that raises many issues.  We have all been touched by loved ones who have passed away.  The report received a very significant endorsement from the Irish Hospice Foundation.  Let us not reinvent the wheel but rather dust down this substantial work.  It makes 16 substantial recommendations.  I ask that at some point in the schedule, we make time for a debate on the content and recommendations of the report.</p></speech>

We have been fighting a war against Covid for more than a year.  This enemy operates by stealth.  It entered our communities unnoticed and has wreaked havoc.  Many have lost their lives and people continue to make enormous sacrifices.  We will be living with Covid for many years and the scars will be enormous.  Many have lost loved ones and we have missed out on things like going to funerals and visiting elderly residents so I commend everyone on pushing back this enemy.  Over the past few weeks, I have been really disappointed by the approach we have taken to antigen testing and the diminishing of its role.  I would go so far as to say that this approach is tone deaf.  We were told that antigen testing was snake oil.  Now we are being told that it has limited benefits in certain circumstances.  To be clear, I am not saying that antigen testing is a silver bullet.  I strongly endorse the advice we have been given, which is to follow clear guidelines on social distancing, handwashing, sneezing and cough etiquette, etc., but I also believe that antigen testing should be rolled out to every business and organisation that is willing to use it to encourage people to go about their business.  Of course, people need to be educated on how to use antigen tests correctly but I do not see any downside.  I do not see how offering this to people going to the hairdressers has a downside.  We have all cherished the opportunity to go to the hairdressers and we know how busy they are.  I am asking for antigen testing to be rolled out to all industries, institutions and colleges.  Denmark accepts antigen testing for entry into the country yet here we are told that it has very little value.  Think about it.  The authorities in Denmark uses antigen testing to allow people to enter the country but we are not encouraged to use it.  Countries like the Czech Republic use it for dental and hair appointments.  Antigen testing should be rolled out and used here by anyone who wants to use it to fight Covid.  I hope that when our response to this pandemic is examined, our unenthusiastic approach to antigen testing will not be identified as a missed opportunity.  I call on the Minister for Health to make the tests available at no cost to any business or organisation that wishes to use them and to launch an education campaign in respect of antigen testing.</p></speech>

I commend our healthcare professionals and their supervisors and managers on their unstinting commitment to ensuring that the impact on patients will be kept to a minimum.  It is impossible to eliminate any and all effects on patients and appointments but they have done a stellar job in terms of ensuring that testing, tracing and testing and the vaccine roll-out have not been affected by this scurrilous and terrible attack on our State and the most vulnerable people in it.</p> <p>I again wish to refer to aviation, a matter about which the Leader has spoken extensively in the past.  Aviation is critical for our country, not just in terms of the number of people it employs but also in the context of the critical role it will play in kick-starting our economy.  Ours is an island nation.  That is the reality.  Connectivity is critical for our country and is in large part achieved by means of aviation.  I understand that a memorandum will be brought to Cabinet tomorrow in respect of reducing the impact of mandatory hotel quarantine and to remove it for a number of, if not all, European states.  However, I am still waiting for meaningful short-, medium- and long-term plans regarding how we are going to assist our aviation industry in getting out of the situation in which it currently finds itself.

I am concerned, as I hear this issue being discussed, that no consideration is being given to city and apartment living and the right of people to be able to buy or live in affordable rental apartments.  I will give two examples in my area of the impact that has had.  A few years ago NAMA had within its grasp the Player Wills building and surrounding site in Dublin 8.  It could have been used to provide affordable and cost rental homes but it was allowed to go to the developer, Hines.  There was a height strategy for that site negotiated and agreed with the local community.  The agreed heights went from six to eight to ten storeys.  Hines came in and the two applications submitted were for 16 stories and 19 storeys.  It was clearly stated at community consultations that was what it needed to do to be able to satisfy its investors and while it was looking at it from a planning perspective, it needed to be able to satisfy its investors.  Of the up to 400 units that will be built on that site, including some co-living units, not one will be available for people in the local area to buy.  The estimated rent for a studio there will be &euro;1,350 per month.  According to the definition of an affordable rent, one would need to earn &euro;4,050 net per month to be able to afford to live in a studio in Dublin 8.  Furthermore, one would need to earn &euro;8,400 a month to able to afford a rent of above &euro;2,000 per month for a three-bedroom unit in Dublin 8.  We need to put an end to the investor-led planning approach but we also need to be cognisant of our cities, climate change  and the need to create sustainable, affordable apartments for people to live in the city centre.</p></speech>

This is an issue I have raised a number of times in the House.  Until we start to treat data like gold, we will not realise the scale of how important this is.  Some 30% of the European Union&rsquo;s data is stored in Ireland.  That is how serious an issue this is.  We must begin to take this issue more seriously.</p> <p>The issue I wish to raise is that of the revelations concerning the charity B&oacute;thar and, in particular, that those at the top of the organisation siphoned off &euro;1.1 million, including in suitcases of cash, over a long period.  I was one of those who donated to B&oacute;thar down the years.  The Leader will appreciate that those in rural communities in particular have a strong affinity for what B&oacute;thar was trying to achieve.  Children in schools organised fundraisers to help out this very innovative charity.</p></speech>

The issue is in the public domain.  I am talking about it on the basis of an affidavit.  The reason I am asking what is happening in the context of B&oacute;thar is that this is not the first time individuals at the top of siphoned off money from a charity for which they were responsible.  This type of thing breaks the heart of those who go out and raise money for charity.  It also makes people who donate question the motives of such charities and raises questions about others.  B&oacute;thar was a wonderful concept.  Ours is an extraordinarily generous country.  People will lose their trust in some of these charities if these instances continue to happen.  This is happening again and again and although it involves a minority of cases it is damaging all the other charities.  It is making people angry.  I ask that we examine the role of the charity regulator but, equally, that we ensure those at the top are held to account for actions of this nature.</p></speech>

We need a debate on the security of our State.  It is devastating for those who are left wondering when their appointments will be held over the coming weeks.  At the same time, I commend the work done in the past few days.  Our data was clearly kept in silos.  Our data is allegedly kept in silos in Clonshaugh and, as a result, the Department of Health was protected from the detonation of a further attack.  It has yet to be revealed what else has been prevented.</p> <p>This morning's reports that there people's details and personal data may be published on the dark web must be worrying.  I see this as a particular concern.  Obligations arise out of that.  In the first instance, the State needs to publish those categories of data and start putting in place the mitigating actions people need to take.  On a daily basis, particularly in my area in which there are many elderly individuals, people receive phone calls requesting their PPS numbers and other information.  These are scam phone calls and the Attorney General's office and the Department of Social Protection have issued warnings about them.  If data is now out there, however, people will be worried when it comes to deciphering what is real and what is not.</p> <p>We need to talk about the breaches, what is likely to happen and the consequences of that and explain the position.  Small businesses that have moved to paperless transactions on foot of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and that have been protective of people's privacy as a result now also have to worry about their security.  I am calling for the State to announce a set of guidelines on how people can know when they have sufficient security in place.  We need an education campaign and a debate on this matter.</p></speech>

That is welcome.</p><p>There were two extraordinary articles yesterday on what is happening to our property and housing markets.  The <i>Business Post </i>revelations that more than &euro;225 million of taxpayers' money has gone into supporting vulture funds buying up houses and apartments before they go on the open market is quite extraordinary.  It puts the lie to the suggestion, which came from some Government circles, that what happened with the estate in Maynooth was a once-off.  It clearly was not.  There are three estates and &euro;225 million of Government funding involved.  Not only is Government tax and planning policy denying people affordable homes, it is using taxpayers' money to fund developments which will not be sold on the open market.  This is extraordinary and outrageous and clearly has been Government policy for some time.  The Government was warned in 2019 that cuckoo funds were not likely to develop additional supply in the marketplace.  Two years after that, we see what is still going on.  It is outrageous.</p><p>The second article is even more concerning, particularly from a Limerick perspective.  A British property company, chaired by a sitting Deputy, which opposed council plans for social housing on the outskirts of Limerick City in 2018, is a venture partner and building 37 houses nearby - just across the road.  That is extraordinary, is it not?  The Formation Group seems to have extraordinary success in terms of building homes and winning contracts.  I will not get an opportunity to speak on the housing issue, unfortunately, because I have to do work for the Council of Europe.  It is crucial this Affordable Housing Bill addresses the outrageous gearing of the marketplace against ordinary people and in favour of major investors.  This is a scandal which has gone on for far too long.  We need urgent action in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

I am talking about all media across the whole island of Ireland, not just in the Republic.  The lack of reporting with regard to what is happening in Derry is extraordinary.  I refer to the situation whereby politicians are being stood down by a political party.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall Blaney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The legacy of former deputy First Minister, the late Martin McGuinness, has been torn apart.  What is the problem with the media in this country that they are afraid to report these things?  There are all kinds of rumours in Derry of community moneys not being properly spent.  There are also rumours of drugs being involved.  It is in everybody's interests that the media report these things.  It is extraordinary that, for the last six weeks, the media in this country would not touch the matter.  What is wrong with our media?  Have they been infiltrated?  Are they afraid?  Why will they not investigate these things?</p><p>Gerry Adams's brother was placed in a Donegal house for three years and had charges of paedophilia made against him.  No media would ever touch that story.  Everyone knew about it in Donegal but nobody would touch it.  In addition, Sinn F&eacute;in is spending tens of thousands of euro week in, week out on newspapers, media and independent journalists across the country and they can attack anybody on social media with the drop of an email.  Our democracy is under attack at the moment.  We are talking about cyberattacks.  This attack needs to be investigated and it is much wider than just the Ab&uacute; website.  Our democracy is under attack.  It is time our media spoke up and woke up and we got independence for all parties in this State. </p></speech>

When we debate this matter in the Seanad, maybe we should also consider the multilayered strands of charities operating in the same general area where resources overlap.  There are so many good charities in the area of cancer and mental wellness.  It is a shame there is such an incredibly large number of them.  Is there a need for so many individual charities?  Could they not come together and amalgamate for the sake of fundraising?  That is something we should consider.</p> <p>Since the Seanad last sat, a new leader of political unionism has been elected.  I wish Edwin Poots well, though personally, looking at his track record I am not convinced.  I do not really have massive hope but he deserves space and a fresh start and I wish him the very best.  I am not a fan of his social or environmental agenda but hopefully the responsibility of leadership will weigh heavily on his shoulders and he will rise to the challenge.  I was not a particular fan of Ian Paisley Snr. so Edwin Poots is not a lost cause.  He is a fellow Irishman and I wish him well.  I will judge him by his actions, not his words, but his words have been very uninspiring to date.</p> <p>In respect of the cyberattack, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, has a natural love of this area and expertise in it.  He will be a positive for the Government.  These people are the new mafiosa - make no mistake about it.  They should be treated the same as people who kill on the way to rob banks and art galleries, or drug cartels.  Their actions risk people losing their lives around the world.  We should throw everything at this and the Defence Forces should have an increased budget as this is happening throughout the EU.  It is the new scourge and we must rise to this challenge or it could debilitate our country.</p></speech>

I ask specifically that whichever Minister or Minister of State comes in is able to speak about the single customer view data set, to which we have started to add biometric data in the last few years.  It includes the data of over 3 million of our citizens and photographs are now being added to it.  This is very concerning and is something I have highlighted previously.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand the Data Protection Commissioner is due to publish a report on biometric data.  The State has still not addressed the concerns the commissioner has raised about the customer view data set.  That is a mistake and I ask that it be addressed when we have that debate.</p><p>The House will get to debate housing.  We might join the dots on the fact that hundreds of millions of euro have been given to investors to purchase at a time when local authorities have been forbidden from purchasing.  Instead, local authorities are being told they must lease and are sometimes leasing at the same cost because of the fiscal rules.  Those rules have been suspended for a year by Europe and will be suspended for another two years, so this is the moment.  To join a third dot, Ireland apparently has capital earmarked for expenditure which it cannot spend this year.  Let that capital go to local authorities to purchase and own public housing stock.</p><p>I join Senators in thanking the Leader for arranging a debate on Palestine.  It will be very important.  Let us not simply talk about the human tragedy, as others have.  I saw the little girl saying she would do anything she could but what can she do as she is only ten years old.  We must remember we are a country that is powerful and has an impact, and that there are things we can do.  Everything we can do should be done.  The ten-year-old spoke of wanting to be a doctor.  Last night, Dr. Ayman Abu Al-Ouf, the head of internal medicine and coronavirus response at the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, was killed.  That is somebody who was dedicated to their work.</p><p>Let us have the Minister in but we must hear the detail, specifically the Attorney General's advice.  The Government does not have to publish it but it should be explained.  Does the advice include, for example, the European Court of Justice ruling on Rosneft from last year, which said sanctions could be imposed on Russia for reasons of public policy?  Does that decision form part of the advice?  Is there a danger that Ireland is itself committing violations - as some legal experts would argue - by giving aid to settlement areas through the purchase of goods?  That is a legal opinion I would like to have.</p><p>We should also bear in mind that Attorneys General are sometimes wrong.  In 2017, in the debate on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, Senator Ruane and I were told by the then Attorney General that our proposals were illegal.  Those proposals are in the new Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2021.  Let the Government be ready to argue the case and show Ireland can give leadership on this issue.</p></speech>

The security breaches of the last few days are not the first such breaches.  A number of local authorities have been hacked in the past year and a half.  I fully support the call for a debate.</p> <p>The Passport Office provides a great service.  Its online service is very efficient and has helped so many people.  There have been problems with the Passport Office over the last week.  There is a major build-up of passport applications.  Children's passport applications continue to be more complicated as consent forms and first-time adult witness forms are not accepted by the system.  This is causing a huge backlog.  The system is not accepting submissions for photographs, which will further add to the backlog.  I had an email from a worried person this morning who has made a passport application.  While he does not have to travel at the moment, he may be required to travel at any time and needs a passport.  When he tries to upload his photographs to the website, an error message appears on the system.  That feature is obviously not working.</p> <p>As of 11 a.m. today, the web chat and telephone lines are unavailable.  There are, therefore, some issues with the Passport Office which will feed in to the serious backlogs.  While staff in the office are doing a magnificent job, the Minister needs to take action.  As Senators have pointed out previously, we have a big backlog and the summer is coming, so something will need to be done.</p></speech>

My family were in the business of the provision and retail of menswear for 150 years and I know exactly how big a day this is for small shopkeepers.  It is a time when we must give them support.  The Government, in fairness, gave those businesses and their staff very good supports during the lockdowns.  However, they are going to be on their own from now on.  I would appeal to the general public to support their local shops.  Shops on high streets all over the world are up against the massive multinationals and megastores.  The local shop is the heart of local towns and when the day comes that the shop closes down, small, lonesome and empty streets of the kind we have been looking at for the past six months will be left.  I am sure the Leader will encourage people to shop local.</p><p>My Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, Senators Blaney and McGreehan, brought an important Private Members' motion about the Taoiseach's shared island initiative to the House last week.  The motion received the unanimous support of the House, which is to be welcomed.  Only today, the shared island unit, in conjunction with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has published its first papers, examining economic and social opportunities from increased co-operation on this island.  The four papers cover areas of mutual concern, such as cross-Border trade, primary care, education and training systems, and foreign direct investment.  This is another step in working towards a shared island and a good relationship between North and South.  I urge all Members to study the papers and bring them back to their constituencies.  </p><p>The shared island movement has been given a fair welcome by our unionist neighbours because they do not see it as a threat.  The Taoiseach has made clear that the enterprise is predicated on maintaining peace and shared living as priorities.  Unionists are no fools and they are not nearly as sanguine about a number of other organisations and groups, self-appointed and answerable to nobody, that are engaging furiously in dialogue about constitutional change and agitating for a border poll.  Some of those groups present themselves as disinterested and neutral voices that are anxious merely to facilitate the discussion that we all support.  What they are really doing is building up momentum for a border poll which they think should take place when, and only when, they think they will get the answer they want.An <i>Irish Independent-</i>Kantar opinion poll showed quite clearly that a majority in the North are in favour of retaining the union with Great Britain.  There is a nuanced range of opinions in the South on the issue of unity.  It is emphatic that more than 70% of the Irish population see this type of agitation and constitutional movement as representing a real danger to peace on this island.</p></speech>

Some of these people are well meaning.  Some of them are academics, others are journalists and politicians.  They may very well want to be helpful.  However, former EU ambassador to the United States, Mr. David O'Sullivan, recently addressed the Pat &amp;amp; John Hume Foundation and stated that heightening tensions in regard to a border poll is the most unhelpful thing that could be done to the body politic in Ireland.  He said it could, in fact, prove disastrous.</p> <p>I ask the people who are agitating for a border poll to think about what they are doing and its consequences.

I will ask for one as soon as I can.  If I am to be honest, I am not even sure who is the Minister in charge of cybersecurity.  I will have to go and find out.  Senator Malcolm Byrne is right when he said data is king.  Senator McDowell is accurate that it is the new space, if not the sole one, next to the drugs world on which those with criminal intent will be focusing their minds for the next number of years.  It is so difficult, yet so easy at the same time, to access states' and individuals' information and to exploit it.  I heard a gentleman say on the news yesterday that there were 2,500 attempts to attack the HSE last year.  Obviously, last week's attack was successful and we are not even sure how successful.  I will try to arrange that debate as quickly as I can.  It is an issue on which we will be talking about for many moons to come.</p><p>I welcome everybody's acceptance of the Order of Business and the change to tonight's debate.  The debate on defence is important and we will try to arrange that as soon as we can.  However, I really feel that not only does the world need to hear the outpouring of grief about what is being done to both the Palestinian people and to the innocent Israeli people who are not reflective of what their Government is doing on their behalf, but the world must also stand up and act in solidarity.  There is a need for a human response to people who have absolutely no choice as to what is being done to them or on their behalf.  I thank Members for their co-operation today.</p><p>A housing debate was requested by Senator Alice Mary Higgins.  She will get an opportunity to make her interventions on that issue tonight.</p><p>Senator Vincent P. Martin talked about the multiple charities which pop up across the country.  To be fair, they are a direct response to people's experiences and suffering.  The charities regulator needs to be given more teeth.  There certainly should be a more serious level of governance with regard to all of our charitable organisations.</p><p>Senator Blaney spoke about the independence of Irish media.  A lot of the time, many of us are left scratching our heads wondering why mainstream media, as we call it, does not reflect on some of the topics raging on social media.  Any journalists or editors one speaks to will say the root of the difficulties lies in our defamation laws.  Maybe we should be having a debate on the defamation laws as opposed to maybe questioning why some of our Irish media do not do what we would so wish them to do.</p><p>Senator Gavan raised some questions about a particular Limerick organisation for which I do not have responses.  I will make some inquiries today and come back to him.</p><p>Senator Mary Seery Kearney also spoke about cybersecurity, as did Senator Malcolm Byrne.</p><p>Senator Moynihan raised the case of the Player Wills site in her area, something which is going to be topical for the next number of weeks, if not months, until people start to see a resolution to the concerns they have been raising for many years.  That debate will start here in the Chamber this evening.</p><p>Senator Conway brought up the aviation industry.  We have been waiting for a long time for Ryanair's results to come out as they did this morning.  An &euro;850 million loss in Ireland alone is absolutely staggering.  When we add that to the &euro;550 million losses of Aer Lingus and the &euro;220 million losses for our airport authorities, it is no wonder the 150,000 families whose livelihoods depend on the industry are at their wits' end with regard to the Government's response.  I hope we can give them a positive response soon.</p><p>To that end, Senator Ardagh raised antigen testing and the clamouring on behalf of what I would think are reasonable people looking for it to form part of our national public health response.  I have to be honest - it would be remiss of me not to say it - that the patriarchal medical narrative that we witnessed in the past number of weeks by some of our professionals harks back to an era when Irish people, and indeed women, were afraid to challenge the medics.  That is not the Ireland we live in today.  Anybody who thinks medics should not be challenged should not be in a position of authority to give advice.  We should be using antigen testing as part of our public health response.  Irish people are not stupid.  They absolutely know a negative result does not mean they are negative.  What they do know, however, is that if people get a positive antigen test, they should make their way to their doctor, get a PCR test and act appropriately.  That is the part that antigen testing should play in our public health response.  Less of the condescension would also be very welcome.</p><p>Senator Boyhan talked about the Finite Lives report.  I would welcome a debate on that matter and I will try to organise it in the next couple of weeks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will try to organise it in the next couple of weeks.  The body of work done by our colleague, Marie-Louise O'Donnell, is superb, as is the work of the Irish Hospice Foundation and all of the people who care for others during their end-of-life and who also support the bereaved when they have lost a family member.  I will try to organise that debate.</p><p>Senator Dooley spoke about the forestry sector.  I will seek a debate as quickly as I can because this issue has major ramifications for the housing debate that is currently going on.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine recently released a report on forestry.  It needs to feed into the wider debate that we are having, and I very much welcome it.  </p><p>Senator Black read out the most powerful poem I have heard in a long time.  Poetry usually lifts us, but I regret to say that the poem she read this morning lifted us to the horrors that women, children and families are experiencing on a daily basis.  I thank the Senator for sharing the poem and I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing the poem, in full, to be read into the record.</p><p>Senators Pauline O'Reilly and Chambers raised an issue they have been raising every time they stand to their feet.  I heard this morning that 14 of our 19 maternity hospitals are now in compliance with the public health guidelines.  It is amiss as to why not all 19 hospitals are in compliance but, as stated by Senator Chambers, not all of the 14 are in full compliance.  I will contact Paul Reid of the HSE today, who, to be fair to him, along with the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, have said that the responses of the hospitals as to the reasons they cannot adhere do not stand up to scrutiny.  I will make contact with him again today.  I thank the Senators for raising the issue again today.</p><p>Senator Hoey spoke about eating disorders and the 66% increase in referrals.  I will try to arrange a debate around the medical profession and women's health in the next few weeks.  </p><p>On menopause, Joe Duffy is in danger of becoming my generation's Gay Byrne.  I listened to "Liveline" on Friday.  Many of us do not have an opportunity to listen to the radio at lunchtime every day, and if we do, we are listening to the news.  The experiences being shared by the women brought tears to my eyes.  They were very powerful.  It is even more powerful that that debate was ongoing for about eight days.  The sharing of the experiences, and the solidarity of women, was powerful.  I would like to see a lot more of that in this country.  The next space for that debate has to be in the Seanad and the next response has to be in the women's health task force on behalf of the Minister for Health.  I will try to arrange that debate as quickly as I can.</p></speech>

This is a positive Bill.  I welcome the support for the Bill of most contributors on First Stage.  With the co-operation of both Houses and the assistance of our teams here, we can deal with this legislation quickly.  I thank Members for their support and assistance on that.  It is an important Bill for supporting our SME and agricultural communities and our food producers.  We also do very important work here in scrutinising the legislation.  It is not ideal, therefore, when we ask our colleagues to fast-track stuff.  I recognise that and I thank the House for co-operating.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to present the Bill to the House.  This short and technical Bill will enable the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into agreements with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to facilitate access to finance for qualifying enterprises.</p> <p>The new Brexit impact loan scheme is part of the Government&rsquo;s response to Brexit and enactment of this Bill will allow us to launch the scheme in the coming weeks.  The Brexit impact loan scheme will be an important support for Irish businesses throughout the country that are facing challenges arising from Brexit while also dealing with the impacts of Covid-19, something we discuss a lot in these Houses.  I am conscious that Members are familiar with the situation.  It will be available to SMEs, including those in the primary agriculture and the seafood sectors.  That is different to the previous Brexit scheme that did not include those sectors so it is important that they are included this time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To bring this loan scheme to the Irish market as soon as possible, it is imperative that the Ministers are granted the necessary powers to enter into the agreement with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in the coming weeks, which includes providing the necessary Exchequer funding.  The Bill is about giving us permission to do so.</p><p>The scheme is an important component of the Government&rsquo;s Brexit mitigation measures for businesses as it will provide them the opportunity to borrow for periods of up to six years for liquidity, working capital and investment purposes.  The previous loan was for three years.  We know from feedback, engagement with the sector and representative bodies and feedback from Members that there is strong demand for a longer six-year product, which is what the Bill will cater for.</p><p>The Brexit impact loan scheme has been developed to support those businesses experiencing liquidity issues as well as those wishing to invest and diversify their business by ensuring they have appropriate and affordable financing available to them.  This support will provide vulnerable but viable businesses the opportunity to access finance and help them to survive through this period of turbulence, which, of course, will help to maintain jobs.  As we speak about businesses, producers and farmers, we recognise that behind them are the jobs we want to create and save.  When the Government and colleagues refer to a jobs-led recovery this is what we want.  If we are to have a jobs-led recovery we have to support business and stand beside and behind businesses to make sure they have access to variable supports, grants and wage subsidies.  We must also recognise that many businesses will have borrowing requirements.  We will make this possible through these loan guarantees.  A loan guarantee such as that in the Bill will make it easier to access finance and, more important, it will reduce the cost of the finance.</p><p>Lending through the scheme will also fuel future economic growth in our important indigenous sectors by helping them to remain competitive.  We know the opportunities are out there and we have seen during Covid a number of companies increase their sales, turnover, production and number of employees.  Approximately one third stood still and another third is under serious pressure because of Covid.  Thankfully, we have seen thousands of businesses reopen in recent weeks, which will certainly assist them.  Many will have a difficult period ahead as they try to trade their way through Covid and Brexit.  This is what we are trying to deal with.</p><p>To unlock the European guarantee fund counter-guarantee, which will be used to leverage funding of up to &euro;330 million for the Brexit impact loan scheme, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will collectively contribute &euro;29 million in taxpayer funding.  Given the particular exposure of the food and agriculture sectors to Brexit, the scheme will be 40% funded by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is planned that the existing Brexit loan scheme and the Covid-19 working capital scheme will be closed in parallel with the launch of the Brexit impact loan scheme, and the Exchequer funding previously allocated to the Votes of the Departments for the Brexit loan scheme and Covid-19 working capital scheme will be utilised to cover the &euro;29 million cost to the Exchequer of the Brexit impact loan scheme.</p><p>The Bill presented today also provides for the potential for further such agreements in the future if needed.  The question has been asked as to whether &euro;330 million is enough to cover demand.  We believe we are in the right space with this figure but the Bill allows the lending to be increased if needs be.  The Attorney General has advised that primary legislation is needed to provide the necessary powers to both Ministers to enter into such an agreement.  This is why we are here today.</p><p>I will now go through the Heads of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the "relevant Minister" as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as the Ministers entering into the agreement with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland for the Brexit impact loan scheme.</p><p>Section 2 provides the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine with the power to enter into agreements with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  This includes providing the necessary financial contribution from the Irish Exchequer and limiting this to an aggregate total of &euro;50 million should the Ministers wish to implement additional schemes concurrently.  It also includes the discharge of any additional fees and expenses.  Definitions for "qualifying enterprise", "SME" and "small mid-cap" are also referenced here.</p><p>Section 3 provides for a review of the operation of the Act after four years following its passing.  Section 4 provides that expenses incurred in the administration of the Act be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 5 provides for the Short Title and commencement provision.</p><p>This short Bill is important as it will allow the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into an agreement with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to implement the Brexit impact loan scheme.  It is a critical component of the Government&rsquo;s response to Brexit and the scheme has been developed in the context of the compounded financial challenges that Brexit impacted businesses face due to the Covid-19 pandemic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Relative to the existing Brexit loan scheme, the new scheme will provide for longer loan terms, eligibility to primary producers, a wider range of loan purposes, including for investment as well as working capital, and for some level of refinancing.  Refinancing will be important for some businesses that drew down these products when the scheme opened up in 2018 but due to Covid and other reasons did not get a chance to fully utilise or fully repay the loan.  Given that the arrangement under the Brexit deal did not kick in until 1 January this year, many businesses probably put their preparations on ice for a period and are only now kicking in.  Companies now know what their financial and other requirements are to be able to trade through Brexit.  This product is a timely response to that market as well.</p><p>If we want to ensure that businesses throughout the country succeed and prosper in the face of fundamental challenges like Brexit, it is essential that we take the necessary steps to ensure appropriate financial supports such as this scheme are in place for businesses.</p><p>When we debated the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill 2020, much of the conversation focused on what lenders would be involved in the scheme and who could avail of it.  Similar to that legislation, this is an open call.  In addition to the main banks, which were the original players with regard to the credit guarantee we discussed last year, the credit unions and other lending institutions have come forward.  Similar to this legislation, we expect all those providers of finance to apply to the open call to provide this service.</p><p>The interest rates on most of the products available last year that we assess have ranged between 2% and 3%.  For the majority of drawdowns, they are 2.99%, which is a reduction of between 2% and 4% on all the other products that were available prior to the credit guarantee.  Interest rates were a major issue for Senators when we discussed the credit guarantee for Covid.</p></speech>

It is an apt day for him to be in the Chamber as it is an incredibly positive day for businesses right across the country.  I extend good wishes to all the businesses reopening in Tipperary today.  It has been an incredibly tough five months for them.  I know from speaking to numerous business owners in Clonmel and Cahir over the weekend that the excitement about being able to get back to work is something else.  While they appreciate all the supports they have had in the recent months, there is nothing like making one's own money and having one's own business.  Most people who have a business treat it like a child or a family member in the way they run it.  I wish them all well.</p> <p>I welcome the establishment of this new Brexit impact loan scheme, which will have a lending capacity of up to &euro;330 million.  As the Minister of State said, the amount can be increased if necessary.  The scheme is to be launched in parallel with the closure of the existing Brexit loan scheme and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland working capital scheme.  It is also very important that the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme will remain in place until the end of 2021 to provide appropriate access to finance options for businesses for which Covid-19 is the primary disrupter.  However, these two schemes provide a number of enhancements for Brexit impacted small and medium-sized businesses seeking to access finance.  These include providing funding for primary producers; offering longer terms of up to six years, which is a doubling of the previous option of three years; lending for a wider range of loan purposes, including refinancing; and financing to support cashflow and investment purposes.</p> <p>The enhanced scheme has been developed in the context of the additional complexities and implications that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought about for Brexit impacted businesses.  This new Brexit impact loan scheme will give farmers and food producers in County Tipperary, which had previously been unable to do so, to access funding at a much lower rate than they can access anywhere else.  This will be another useful tool for businesses in Tipperary post Covid-19 for the creation of local jobs and will lead economic recovery.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the Minister of State said, it is important to acknowledge that the Bill is being supported by all political parties across the House.  I hope that continues today.</p><p>This Bill is about supporting businesses and jobs.  I am always guilty of talking about Tipperary and jobs there.  When we bring through proposals to support businesses, there are benefits.  In my county of Tipperary there are many people involved in food production and farming who can benefit from this scheme and who have loans that they can refinance for a lower rate of 3%, if they so wish.  If I am correct, I believe that approximately 95% of the loans will be granted at a rate of just under 3%, which is extremely good.</p><p>I would encourage anyone who is in farming or food production in Tipperary to look at this as an option going forward.  It is just another tool to support them through the Covid pandemic.  As the Minister of State outlined, there are many businesses that have only started to see the challenges that have been posed by Brexit in recent months.  I deal with many food and drink production companies in Tipperary.  It must be stated that many of them have only started to realise the impact that Brexit is having on their businesses.  When this scheme is taken into account with the other supports that have been available, such as the Covid restrictions support scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme and all of the supports that have been introduced over the past 12 months by this Government to help businesses that have been struggling - some businesses have really struggled more than others to survive - it will give them the opportunity to try to get loans that can help them get back on their feet.  I encourage businesses to have that confidence to take out loans and to build once they reopen.  It will take time.  First, businesspeople need the confidence to take that risk.  If they do that, and if they are supported by people locally, the period it takes for them to get back to where they were will be shortened.</p><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for bringing this Bill before us.  I hope that the Bill will get the same sort of support today as it did in the Lower House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1646" speakername="Ollie Crowe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#PP00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his detailed briefing and for his constant support for all Senators in this House.  The Brexit impact loan scheme is very welcome and much needed.  Obviously, it is too early to see the full impact of both Brexit and the challenges that have arisen in recent months.  However, the early trade figures from this year certainly provide some indication in that regard.  My concern relates to the decline in exports of food and drink products, which is particularly worrying.  A recent report by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, indicates that these exports fell by 35% from &euro;641 million to &euro;418 million in the first two months of 2021 compared with the same period in 2018.  In that report, the CSO noted that while sales to seven of Ireland's ten largest food and drink markets actually increased during that period, the decline in export to Britain was greater, causing a decline in the total food and drink exports.  This perhaps reflects how significant a trading partner the UK is for Ireland.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on this worrying aspect.</p> <p>As Senator Ahearn alluded to, the agricultural sector and the stakeholders within it deserve huge credit for their efforts since 2016, when the Brexit vote occurred, to diversify and target new regions and markets.  Again, we see this in the trade figures on beef exports.  In 2016, the UK market accounted for 56% of Irish beef exports; by last year, the figure was down to 47%.  Obviously, it will be substantially lower this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That poses significant challenges to the sector.  The Government has been proactive in assisting the agricultural sector, which as all Members will be aware, is particularly vulnerable to the huge impact of Brexit.  The &euro;100 million capital investment programme for the food processing sector, which was announced in December, was particularly welcome and will assist as the agricultural sector faces post-Brexit challenges identifying and adapting to the requirements of new markets.</p><p>The Brexit impact loan scheme will be an additional resource for the agricultural sector and others to draw on when responding to the challenges posed by Brexit.  It is particularly welcome that SMEs and small and mid-sized capitalisation companies, including primary producers, will now be included and can utilise lending through the schemes for activities aimed at addressing climate change challenges and other opportunities.</p><p>Funding through the Brexit loan scheme can also be utilised for purposes which yield environmental benefit but are under normal lending conditions that are less attractive to lenders due to a longer return on investment periods.  That is important and fills a much needed gap in that area.</p><p>The essential roll played by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland was evident last year following the pandemic when &euro;1 billion in bank loan guarantee schemes was provided to in excess of 8,000 businesses.  The recent expansion of lending beyond retail banks is very welcome and relevant.  I note that it involves 19 credit unions spread between three groups and non-bank lenders.  This is especially necessary in light of a recent announcement made by KBC Bank Ireland and Ulster Bank.</p><p>As alluded to by the Minister of State, I believe we need the broadest possible range of participants in these schemes.  I also believe the Government should support the development of credit unions as much as possible, which I have stated before in the House.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could provide his views on this and on whether there may be merit in implementing a quota for lending, which must be done in such schemes other than through major retail banks.  I believe there is but I will await his comments </p><p>I wish all businesses well that open today across the country, especially retailers that have been under enormous pressure, particularly in Galway West and the west of the country.  They have had an extremely difficult five months and more.  I wish them well.  People want to get back to work.  They do not want to be getting supports from the Government even though the supports have been vital to keeping us alive.  It is very welcome that businesses are back.  One saying common to all in the Government is that there is no return and no going back.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p> <p>I want to be associated with the Leas-Chathaoirleach's words regarding the momentous occasion we have all seen today in our towns and villages with so many retail outlets opening.  I had the great pleasure of driving through my hometown of Athy this morning and seeing the pride businesses were taking again because they could actually open their doors.  As the three previous speakers said, the huge statement we can make today is sending all our good wishes to those businesses, particularly the family-run businesses that take great pride in opening their doors.  It was great to see some queues forming this morning outside some of those local businesses in towns in many parts of the country, which is unusual .  Again, we obviously need to support them in every way we can.</p> <p>The Labour Party will be supporting this Bill.  As other speakers said, it is a largely technical Bill giving the relevant Ministers the powers to enter into agreements with the SBCI to implement loan guarantee schemes.  The reason for the Bill's introduction is, of course, to enable the Government to deliver the Brexit impact loan scheme.</p> <p>The cost to the Exchequer of the Brexit scheme would be a maximum of &euro;29 million, with more than &euro;300 million in low-cost finance and much more being made available to viable micro SMEs and mid-cap enterprises.  It aims to assist them to adapt their businesses to the challenges caused by Brexit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have a question related to the built-in review in the fourth year.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that a preliminary assessment of the performance of the scheme is conducted within the first year.  The UK will implement new import procedures in October and that is when Brexit will have the greatest impact on Irish business.  It is important, therefore, that any unforeseen issues with the administration and drawdown of this scheme can be addressed as quickly as possible, preferably within a year, for the benefit of all of those who may apply.  </p><p>Speaking of those forthcoming UK import procedures which are due to come into force in October, we had a very important and interesting discussion with representatives from Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the HSE at the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union last week.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree that it is vital that we prepare companies for the undoubted challenges they will face in exporting goods to the UK from October next.  In fairness to all of the agencies that spoke to us last week, their preparations are at an advanced stage.  They are working hard with many companies to prepare them for what is coming.  It is very important that companies are prepared and that Government agencies continue to support them in their preparations.  I am sure the changes that will be rolled out in the UK will necessitate some companies applying for loans to facilitate their business.  </p><p>It is important that this scheme is advertised to all who may wish to avail of it and that those who may need assistance in applying are provided with same.  Many small and medium sized businesses are family run and have been hit very hard by both Covid and Brexit.  We must support them and try to ensure that the greatest possible number of jobs are maintained in these viable businesses.  It is also important that we recognise the importance of agribusiness to this country and that we support the many start-ups that are struggling at this time.</p><p>I am sure there will be many opportunities for business as we exit this pandemic but schemes like this are so important right now, particularly for those who are starting up and need help.  I wish those businesses applying under this scheme every success and assure them of our support in the coming months when they may need it most.  We look forward to seeing this scheme becoming a success and providing a lifeline for many businesses that need support at this time.</p></speech>

I also welcome this Bill and thank the Department for its work on it.  I wish to draw attention to a number of important issues, the first of which is the need to put the credit unions front and centre in the context of this scheme.  We must give people choices other than the big banks.  Credit unions are really connected with communities and small businesses and in some cases, they would know them better than a lot of the bigger banks.  Credit unions have played a huge part in community life for many years through sponsorship and are run by the people themselves.  In that context, I hope the Government emphasises the need for this lending to be accessible through credit unions.</p> <p>I seek clarity on the maximum interest rate applicable.  Can we be guaranteed that it will be capped at a very low rate and will not waver in any way?</p> <p>I welcome the fact that this is happening because it means that smaller businesses will be able to access low-interest loans with 80% guarantees from the Government, which is a huge help.  I hope that some will avail of loans to go greener because that will also save them money.  A lot of businesses have huge heating bills and this might be a good opportunity to look at that and switch to an air-to-water system, for example.  That would reduce their energy bills and they could use the money saved to pay back the loan.  The future is green and we know it makes economic sense.  These loans can provide lots of opportunities for businesses to become greener while also saving themselves money.  </p> <p>It is great to see the shops finally reopening today and I hope that everybody sticks to local shops as much as they can and for as long as possible.  This will give hope back to those people who have been waiting, in some cases for over a year, to have proper one-on-one customer care and interaction.  This is the best aspect of small businesses.  One cannot buy online the great care one gets from small businesses or the customer satisfaction one gets from supporting them.  I really hope that everybody, including politicians, focuses today on going in to small, local businesses before going to the big chains.</p></speech>

It would have been better to see him if Westmeath had held on to that lead yesterday, but it is early in the season, so let us hope we will get another opportunity later on.</p> <p>The need for a loan guarantee scheme for small and medium enterprises affected by Brexit and Covid-19 is apparent to all.  This is particularly true of SMEs and this is why such businesses have been prioritised by this Bill and the schemes that will flow from it.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill and the moneys it will help be loaned out but, as is ever the case, difficulties for businesses in accessing this money comes from what happens between the passing of the Bill and the loaning of the moneys.  The design of the scheme, the length of repayments, and the interest charged all contribute to the success of such a loan scheme.  We have seen throughout the Covid-19 crisis that some loan schemes are more attractive than others, and it beggars belief that where the State has backed loan schemes that are not popular, the moneys behind those schemes are not moved laterally to better performing loan schemes so they can be of use.  Either that or engage with business to figure out what the issues are and rectify those schemes that have a low take-up.  This scheme has a built-in review mechanism, but I would hope a preliminary assessment could be carried out into the performance of the scheme within six months to a year rather than the four years mentioned.</p> <p>It is now, when Covid and Brexit are hitting hardest, that SMEs and family businesses need access to credit.  We know the twin crises of Covid and Brexit have caused untold difficulty for businesses, but there is some light at the end of the tunnel.  There are opportunities for SMEs to expand in domestic operations and in trading internationally, especially with the European Union.  The exit of Britain from the EU and from the Single Market leaves trading opportunities with our European partners.  I have no doubt there is scope for indigenous SMEs to expand and secure some of these trading opportunities.  The role for the Government and the Oireachtas is to help facilitate that. This is why these schemes are so important and why it is so important they work effectively and efficiently.</p> <p>On the future economy, the reality is the State is a critical player in our economy, in our economic development, and in the economic direction.  It is up to the Government to play its part in working with business, with workers and the trade union movement, and with others to help deliver a more robust, progressive economy: a high-wage, high-productivity and high-growth economy that delivers for everyone.  That is the best way to deliver for business and deliver for workers, especially as we exit the Covid crisis.</p> <p>After the financial crisis and austerity years, the economy was just pieced back together the way it was.  That has not worked for ordinary people, for workers or for indigenous SMEs.  After this pandemic we need to build back better and use the finances within the State to the benefit all of our people the most.  I will highlight in particular the &euro;12 billion the State uses on public procurement every year.  We could ensure companies provide a living wage and build a workplace democracy.  We could use an innovative policy such as community wealth building to line up our anchor institutions, for example, in Limerick with the University of Limerick, the hospital and the council, to ensure procurement is done in such a way that we have a low carbon footprint, that we see benefits for the workers employed in those businesses that win contracts, and that we see more benefits going to local small businesses than to large multinationals.  It is an opportunity to build back better.  I hope the Government would realise that and act on it.  The moneys the State uses every day of every year must be used to create better working conditions, better pay and regional development across this State.</p> <p>On regional development, I believe most people would concede our growth has been very much skewed towards the east coast and Dublin over the past ten years.  This policy does not really work for Dublin given the horrors we all see in traffic, outrageous rents and so on.  Such development feeds Dublin beyond its actual capacity and it starves the regions beyond being sustainable.  We need balanced regional development, better local economies, community jobs and growth.  We cannot do this without a change of mindset.  This relates back to the issue of community wealth building.</p> <p>We welcome the proposed loan scheme.  We would like to keep an eye on it.  I ask the Minister of State to consider perhaps giving the scheme an earlier review, if possible.  Now is an opportunity to create a better society out of the back of this pandemic where our towns and villages can grow, and where people can live with opportunities around them in their own communities.</p> <p>I apologise to the Minister of State.  I have another meeting I must attend in a few minutes.  If I am not here in the Chamber when he responds I will take a note later in the day.</p></speech>

We will not say anything else.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber to debate this important Bill.  Like other Senators, I wish all businesses that are reopening a permanent reopening, which is very important.  As I said in the Chamber last week when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was here, many businesses have had a hellish 14 months with regard to Covid.  They have been through the mill.  Some businesses may have opened afresh in early 2020 and had their great plans go awry, so it is great to see businesses reopening.  It is important that we support local businesses, where possible.</p> <p>I will not say that one would almost have forgotten about Brexit, given all that has gone on in the past year, but certainly the challenges for businesses in the context of Covid have overshadowed its impact.  Brexit has been with us for a number of years, from even before the referendum when there was speculation of the possible impact of Brexit, to the referendum result, to the negotiations and the settlement that took place in 2019.  One of the challenges that businesses identified during the Government of 2011-16 related to the availability of credit.  Banks that had been flaithulach to all-comers became risk averse in regard to lending to businesses and private individuals.</p> <p>The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland was established in 2014 as an organ to provide stable, lower cost, long-term funding options for SMEs and it has proved its worth in terms of the number of SMEs it has supported over that time.  It has been somewhat reimagined.  Before its inception, the challenge for businesses related to not being able to access funding and then there were the challenges of Brexit, that is, both the anticipation of it and the fact that once it had become a reality, businesses would be impacted.  That, of course, was followed by Covid.  Some businesses, therefore, have experienced a trifecta of issues over the past ten years.  This funding is very important to allow the supports from the Government, through the SBCI, to continue.</p> <p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be those best able to engage with the SBCI with loans from their voted departmental budgets.  We need to recognise that because of our good standing as a country and the work done since 2011 to ensure we regained our reputation, we are still able to access funding at low interest rates, which is very important, as are the solidarity from the European Commission and the fact that the SBCI is able to access this fund from Europe.  The European Union provides an important solidarity.  Others charted their own course and that is part of the reason we need these loans.</p> <p>I acknowledge all the businesses that have struggled and possibly will continue to struggle arising from the impact of Brexit and Covid.  These supports are very important.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and others before them in establishing the SBCI and continuously providing supports.  Ultimately, all SMEs, whether small or medium sized, provide critical jobs throughout our country and that is what it is all about.  It is about ensuring that as many businesses as possible can stay afloat, continue to hire and possibly expand and hire new people.</p> <p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1674" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#UU00100"><p>On the one hand, it was fantastic to see everywhere opening up.  Going along the quays this morning, one certainly knew that it was a new day.  I have not seen such traffic chaos for a long time.  Nevertheless, we must stay patient because the most important thing is the joy being brought to many businesses, families and people and the hope that we are finally exiting what has been a terrible time.  I would still sound a note of caution.  We must still be very careful about how we proceed.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I listened to his contribution.  This is very important legislation.  I acknowledge the involvement of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister of State in the context of the SBCI and the implementation of the Brexit impact loan scheme.  It might be fair to say that in some respects  we do not know what the effect of Brexit will be.  We were all consumed by Brexit.  After a while, it was not about Brexit, it was about Covid.  As we try to get back to some form of normality, we may have more concentration on Brexit and its effects.  For counties and areas like my own, the Galway-Roscommon region, and given the importance of farming and small business, it is important that we support them in every way we can.  This scheme provides an 80% guarantee to participating lenders on loans to Brexit-impacted businesses and will be underpinned by a counter-guarantee through the European Commission&rsquo;s pan-European guarantee fund, which is managed by the European Investment Bank Group.  </p> <p>One great thing we have seen in recent years in my county and adjoining counties - mainly rural counties - is agrifood really taking off.  This sector is being affected by Brexit so it is so important that we have this type of scheme and this type of lending.  It is very welcome to see that the credit union movement has been involved.  Senator Garvey referred to that as I was making my way here.  In our part of the country, banks are pulling the plug left, right and centre.  I made the point here last week that in part of north-east Roscommon, more than 12,000 people will not have access to a bank branch.  However, we will have our credit unions.  It is really important that when we are producing legislation like this, we include credit unions because many farmers and small businesspeople will deal with credit unions in the future.</p> <p>The Government has designed the new Brexit impact loan scheme and, as has already been stated, it will provide up to &euro;330 million in lending with loans up to six years being available.  Through the SBCI, the Government is inviting all financial providers, including banks and credit unions, to take part.  This is extremely important.</p> <p>The issues facing Irish enterprise have been exacerbated by the challenges of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.  As Members are aware, among its European peers, Ireland is uniquely exposed to the effects of Brexit, which is a significant challenge for our society.  Talking to small business owners and farmers, I can see that we have a very resilient population.  I hear much talk about how we will not get people back to work but I think that as people see Covid go away, they will go back and will appreciate their jobs.  The important thing is to be able to keep our businesses alive.  In that regard, I certainly hope that when they see a business is viable, our banks will support it fully because they need the support of our banks.</p> <p>The documentation relating to the Bill states that it is intended that the scheme will be open to SMEs and small mid-caps, which are businesses of up to 499 employees, including those engaged in farming and fishing.  Is there a minimum figure?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If employers employ five, eight or ten people, can they participate in the scheme or must they have a certain number of employees in order to qualify?</p><p>This is an important day and this is important legislation.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1636" speakername="Paddy Burke" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#VV00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  I also welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important legislation.  The lack of sufficient finance is the biggest obstacle to businesses.  I have seen many businesses fail due to a lack of finance or not being able to secure finance.  In some cases, businesses do not have enough finance.  In others, they are not able to get it and they fail.  Nobody has seen more that more than the Minister of State.  He has seen at first hand since the crash of 2008 the many viable businesses that failed because they could not get finance.  That is why this legislation is so important.  If a person has a coffee cart but not enough funds to buy the coffee, the cartons it is served in or the milk people put in it, he or she cannot operate.  Regardless of the level at which one is operating, one has to have sufficient finance.  If one cannot get it. one will be at a big disadvantage.  It is ironic that we are discussing those matters when many businesses are reopening having been closed for probably 12 months.  I take this opportunity to wish every business that has reopened today and those that will open in the future the very best of luck.  Small businesses are the lifeblood of this country.  They suffered greatly during the past year and a half.  They have never seen anything like this pandemic, its impact or the way their trade, be they family businesses or medium to large-sized businesses, has been devastated.  The pandemic has had a major effect on them.  I am sure everybody would like to wish them the very best of luck.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to primary agriculture.  Was he saying that large dairy farmers or beef farmers can access this measure or must they have a specific project that is additional to the main enterprise the farm is carrying out, whether it be cheesemaking, liquid milk or some other enterprise?  Will they need to have additional facility or can any farmer avail of this measure?</p> <p>I welcome that credit unions and all the other institutions that provide finance will be involved in this initiative.  When this started first, it was only the four main banks that were able to facilitate businesses.  The involvement of credit unions is a major and welcome change.  I am sure the credit unions and businesspeople will very much appreciate that.  Quite a large number of businesses work solely with credit unions.  It is their main source of finance and where they do all their banking .  Great credit is due to the credit unions for the services they have provided to small businesses and business in general.</p> <p>The Bill states there will be a cost to the Exchequer of &euro;29 million.  Where will that arise?  Will it arise in the context of providing funding for the setting up the strategic banking initiative or will it come about in making provision for bad debt?  The overall amount of funding being provided is &euro;330 million.  How will the cost to the Exchequer of &euro;29 million arise?  It may not arise at all but there is provision in the Bill for it.  What is the position in that regard?</p> <p>Basically, it is a technical Bill.  I wish the Minister of State well with it.  As already stated, this is important legislation.  As we have all said, regardless of whether one has a large or a small business, finance is crucial.  I fully support the Bill.</p></speech>

Today is an important day for our country and the business sector as retail fully opens up.  I take this opportunity to wish all businesses, especially those in my home county of Longford and County Westmeath, every success.  I thank the Minister of State and the Department for the support they have given to businesses, our local authority for the work it has done in supporting businesses over the past 12 months and, in particular, the local enterprise offices, LEOs, which have been instrumental in working with businesses.</p> <p>However, if the funding was not put in place by the Government, it would have been more difficult.  It is important we urge everybody to support and shop local over the next 12 months, minimum, to ensure more businesses can get back on their feet.</p> <p>I welcome this Bill, in that money will be made available for small businesses, including primary producers which were excluded from the previous scheme.  It will be supported by all parties.  It is a positive Bill which gives a legislative basis for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into an agreement with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland so it can implement the Brexit impact loan scheme.</p> <p>Once launched, it is expected loans under the scheme will range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million and will be available for liquidity for investment purposes as well as for refinancing specific forms of existing debt, which many businesses will have after the past 12 months.  I welcome the opportunity for investment for small businesses, in particular for those in the farming community.  They face plenty of challenges over the months and years ahead in terms of the Common Agricultural Policy and climate action issues which have to be implemented.  All of these things will put increased pressures on them and any opportunity for investment or a line of credit, as this Bill will facilitate, is welcome.  It is also important we discuss how these and similar schemes are operated.  I have engaged with a number of businesses in County Longford which have tried to access these schemes over the past 12 months but have found it difficult to get approval.  In many cases, the red tape has been the issue.</p> <p>A number of schemes are being operated by the banks, on behalf of the Government.  However, the banks have strict criteria as regards access to the schemes.  They are applying the normal criteria they would have previously applied to loan applications.  This defeats the purpose of these schemes.</p> <p>The reason businesses are looking for help is they have been affected by Brexit and Covid-19.  How can these businesses be assessed on normal credit criteria in this case?  These are supports to help businesses which have liquidity issues as a direct result of Brexit and Covid-19.</p> <p>I will refer to a couple of figures of which the Minister of State, Deputy English, is well aware.  Some &euro;2 billion was set aside for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  However, only up to &euro;283 million has been loaned out.  That raises serious questions as to how the banks have been assessing these applications.  The Covid-19 working capital scheme has a fund of &euro;425 million, yet only &euro;138 million worth of approvals.  The future growth scheme has been more successful in terms of the amounts which have been approved.  </p> <p>Funding needs to go to the smaller enterprises because they are the backbone of our economy and we are reliant on them in our towns, villages and cities.  It is clear changes are needed as to how these loans are administered by the financial institutions.  Credit unions are now involved and may not look at them as stringently as the banks have.  We will have to do so because this will have a direct impact on how many people are available to do it.  It is necessary as these businesses reopen, that more of them are able to access this fund put in place by the Government.</p></speech>

I always enjoy his contributions because he is always so well prepared and can articulate what is being done in a clear, simple way in which people can understand.  Communication is important in these areas because it can be quite technical.</p> <p>I, too, would like to welcome that we are moving further down the line of easing restrictions.  It is a great day when we see so many people back to work with non-essential retail opening.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wish the people in County Clare who are returning to work today for the first time since before Christmas the very best of luck and good fortune.  It is great to see the main streets of our towns throughout County Clare open again and people going in and out of shops.  Shopping online was very convenient, and in some ways essential, during the most recent lockdown and people got into the habit of shopping online.  However, I encourage and appeal to people to now shop in person and go back into the shops because these are the businesses that pay rates, create employment and sponsor our GAA teams and community events.  These are the people who need our support.  Some of them operated click and collect services and some set up websites and tried to adapt to social media to sell their products.  That is great and I welcome the supports the local enterprise offices gave businesses to embrace social media and new technologies.  Sadly, many products were bought from Amazon, the multiples and companies abroad.  Unfortunately, when selling tickets for the local GAA lotto, Amazon is nowhere to be found to buy lines or support football teams when they get to county finals and so on.  We need to shop local in order to support local and protect local.</p><p>While this may be a technical Bill, it is an extremely important one.  I love the Titles of technical Bills because they are there for a reason and they knit things together.  Brexit has not gone away but it has been sidelined in the narrative because of the pandemic.  Thousands of businesses are affected by Brexit and, as has been said already, getting credit is a lifeline for businesses.  They cannot make a sale unless they can afford to pay for the cost of the sale and, sadly, the cost of the sale has to be funded before the money comes in from it.  This Bill will unlock a very important stream of funding for those businesses.</p><p>I am delighted that credit unions will now be involved in partnering with the State to make funding available because sometimes they are the only source of support for small businesses.  They have a greater role to play, especially now with the consolidation of financial institutions and two major banks withdrawing from the market.  It is critical that the credit union's role in society is enhanced and supported.  That is a welcome feature of the Bill.</p><p>The agricultural industry, whether direct farming or businesses associated with agriculture, will now be able to benefit from this fund as well.  That is very welcome because agrifood, agribusiness and agriculture in general is one of the biggest industries in this country, if not the biggest.  This Bill will eliminate some of the red tape and open funding up to more businesses to benefit from it.  The Minister of State's commitment that further funding, as well as easing and reducing of administration and red tape, will be made available if necessary to ensure the credit flows to the businesses that need it, is very welcome.</p><p>I again thank the Minister of State sincerely, on behalf of all businesses in this country, for the work he and the T&aacute;naiste are doing to ensure businesses are supported, retained and allowed to flourish going forward.  That is very important.  While many businesses suffered during the pandemic, and sadly some no longer exist, we have succeeded through the State's interventions during the pandemic in retaining a lot of businesses and ensuring they have the platform and funding they need to prosper.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With Brexit, it is only in the future we will realise the extent to which it has an effect on our businesses.

I thank everyone for their involvement in and support for the SME community and the agricultural and food-producing community.  We are all aware of all the jobs both those sectors create and want them to get back to employing and also to growing their businesses as well.  I will go through some of the comments.  Earlier, I reflected on how urgent this Bill was and I thank both Houses for their co-operation in not availing of pre-legislative scrutiny and dealing with it directly as well as fast-tracking it through both Houses.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn mentioned the importance of this to food producers in County Tipperary and elsewhere.  This is essential to them.  I want to be clear that regardless of what size a company is, we have one category for companies with up to 499 employees and it can be availed of no matter what size the farm is.  A question was asked about farming activities and dairy farming.  The answer is "Yes".  Applicants need only show they have a link to either importing from or exporting to the UK for 15% of their business.  That covers nearly every farmer I can think of who would need access to finance, so they can access that as well.</p> <p>More importantly, I think everybody, led by Senator Ahearn, mentioned the importance of the retail sector fully reopening today.  I know it has caused traffic problems for many of us but I remember saying back in 2009 or 2010 that I would never complain about traffic again after that financial crisis.  It is the same this time round.  While it was great to be able to get in to or out of Dublin from County Meath in less than an hour, I will not complain that it took much longer than that today because it means there is economic activity, which leads to jobs.  Of course, we all want to make that better through public transport and everything else, but more importantly, it is for now a sign of activity we are glad to have because we know the pressures many sectors have through over the past 12 months.  Especially in the last four or five months, the retail sector took a really hard wallop and of the 300,000 people employed in the sector, more than 70,000 have been on the PUP for most of the past year, and that is not a nice place to be.  They want to be back at work, are eager to return, and today many of them are back.</p> <p>Of course there will be difficulties in that sector and we must continue to work with it in the year or two ahead, as we try to recover.  The national economic recovery plan, which the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Cabinet will produce towards the end of the month, will detail the range of supports which will continue, along with today's proposal, to assist businesses of all sizes.  It will certainly recognise that retail took a major hit and I thank the sector for its efforts.  By closing their doors, retailers have no doubt stopped the spread of the virus in many cases and saved many lives.  Likewise, those who were able to open went to great efforts, through the protocol, to protect their staff and customers and we must recognise that.  In addition to everyone's appreciation of them today, I ask customers to respect the rules of engagement and the protocols that are there.  Retailers have gone to great effort to put them in place.  If everybody plays their part, we can stop the spread of the virus, but more importantly, we can get the rest of the businesses that are still closed opened up.  Many of them are in leisure, hospitality, play centres and activity centres and so on.  There are still many which are not open, but if we can keep the virus under control, they too can reopen.</p> <p>Senator Crowe asked about the food and drink markets.  He is right that we will see the impact with the UK.  While things do get more complicated towards October, as Senator Wall mentioned, as things ease up and we get to deal with the Northern Ireland protocol and other parts of this, it may change.  Brexit is still in its early days and we should be able to ease some of that and get back to some additional trading and regrowing that.  It is true that putting Brexit in place puts barriers on trade.  It makes it more complicated and has made it very difficult for the say, 20% of companies importing here.  The majority of cases have now found their way through with all the procedures and Departments but there is still a certain percentage in difficulty and it is complicated, so we will work with that as well and, over time, we will build back some of those markets.</p> <p>More importantly, since 2016, the Department and the Government have been trying to link with all the various businesses to get them to go further than the UK, to access new markets and grow new markets.  That has happened, through supports from Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, our local enterprise offices, LEOs, InterTradeIreland and all the various enterprise agencies working on behalf of Departments and the Government.  They have been there to assist businesses.  Many businesses are only now coming forward looking for extra assistance.  That is what we are there for and that is what we will respond to, and it is part of what today's Bill is about as well because there are opportunities out there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are a lot of opportunities for Irish enterprises to win market share abroad and those opportunities have been referenced often today.  Senator Conway mentioned the loss of business to online competitors in the retail sector.  There is a massive opportunity for the retail sector to win back some of that business.  Some 70% of retail trade goes away from Irish shores through online sales but we can win that back.  That is why we have announced a range of schemes.  I am glad that over 13,000 companies last year availed of the online trading voucher to take their business online and win back some of that market share. </p><p>I launched a new scheme with Enterprise Ireland last week, another offering to help companies strengthen their online presence.  It is important for us to support our bricks and mortar industries and give those businesses every chance to succeed through the town centre first proposals in the programme for Government.  We will row in behind that and make it easier and better to create a stronger shopping experience in all our counties.  At the same time, there are opportunities for transacting business online.  We need to support online and offline business and win in both spheres.  That is why I have great hope for the future of retail.  There is a lot of opportunity to build and to draw down the supports available in the relevant funds.  Apart from winning back the online business, there is a constantly growing online business.  We want to support our Irish retail sector to trade abroad and win some other customers from different countries.  </p><p>People talk about the next 20 years and we know that, over that time, an extra 1 million people will be living here.  Our population is still growing quite fast.  If our retail sector can survive this year, it will have a prosperous future in the years ahead.  It will provide massive employment opportunities.  I want to say, on the record, that it is a sector I believe we have a lot to offer in respect of training and recognition of skills.  There are an awful lot of people who have been involved in the sector for 20 or 30 years, or more, but do not have a certificate or proof of education to accompany all those years of experience.  That is something on which we want to work in order to recognise existing skills and, more importantly, develop and enhance the skills that are needed to handle the retail conditions of the present and the future.  There is a lot of opportunity and we can do that in the years ahead.</p><p>Aside from asking about food and drink products, Senator Crowe also asked about the involvement of credit unions in the scheme and whether there is a quota for lending.  There is a quota for those lenders that are not the main banks, recognising their capacity to lend.   We can increase that quota if there is demand for it.  I am glad that the credit unions have applied to use the most recent scheme.  I have no doubt that they will also apply for this scheme.  There has been positive feedback from businesses that are engaging with the credit unions.  As everyone in this House will know, I have believed for a long number of years that credit unions need to be more involved in our lending to, and support of, business, as well as supporting communities as credit unions do.  At the moment, many credit unions are under pressure and are losing money by having savings.  We need to give them more opportunities to use their money wisely because they pay back into communities.  They also have a great understanding of local businesses, concerns and issues.  Credit unions enhance the situation when it comes to providing finance to SMEs as well as the opportunity for their own members to make money, rather than lose money, on the savings that are in place.  The rules around that need to change to allow credit unions invest in more areas.  They have changed in the past but there is room for further change when this House is ready to debate the matter.</p><p>Senator Wall asked about the review of the scheme.  To be clear, section 3 refers to a review of the legislation, after its enactment, and the permission it gives the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar in this case, to be able to borrow the money, along with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The schemes are constantly reviewed.  There is, on one hand, the Act, the permission to borrow the money and the setting aside of money for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  On the other hand, there are the schemes, which are constantly evolving.  We will constantly monitor the schemes.  This scheme is a reaction to what we know the market needs.  It is replacing the two previous schemes which have not performed very well.  Fewer that 280 loans were drawn down under the previous Brexit loan scheme.  The working capital scheme has not performed much better.  This scheme recognises those shortcomings, reviews them, adjusts and puts a new scheme in place.  We have done that and will continue to do so.  We will track, review and monitor the scheme.  That is done by the SME community but we will also do it, along with the various Departments and agencies involved.</p><p>Senator Garvey had similar issues to Senator Crowe around credit unions.  Everybody is talking about the need to support local businesses, jobs and communities.  Senator Conway used a nice analogy with a GAA club.  I remind everybody who gets a knock on the door from someone asking for sponsorship for the local shop to give the local shop some business because not everyone is doing that.  There have been many campaigns over the past year, through our Departments, encouraging people to look local and shop local.  I again ask people to do that.  All of the Senators have said we should look local and support local.  That is what we are trying to encourage to try to create jobs because we want a job-led recovery.</p><p>A question was asked about whether there is a maximum level of interest that can be charged.  The maximum is 3.75%.  We expect the majority to come in under that.  Senator Ahearn asked if 95% of the loans will come in at less than 3% interest and the figure is, roughly, 94%.  He was only a percentage point out.  That applies to 94% of all the loans under all the schemes.  Senators should bear in mind that 4,500 people have drawn down funds under the credit review scheme, which was the recent initiative we discussed.  Some 6,500 people have been approved for access to that scheme.  Less than &euro;400 million is tied up in that scheme while &euro;2 billion had been set aside for it, and more, if needed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We want to encourage more companies to come forward and avail of these schemes when they are in place.  This scheme will run until 2022 and the credit guarantee we discussed last year will finish at the end of this year.</p><p>Access to finance, as Senator Paddy Burke said, is key.  These credit guarantees enable a company to access to money.  I encourage companies to look at their financial positions, not just in the context of today and tomorrow but also with regard to their needs for the remainder of this year and into next.  They should avail of these schemes to put in place funding that they might need to draw down.  There is no point in doing so when it is too late and one is waiting for cash the next day.  There is a process to go through.</p><p>Senator Carrigy is right that it is not straightforward or easy trying to draw down money when the amounts involved range from &euro;25,000 to &euro;1.5 million.  We are trying to get banks and credit unions to cut out some of the red tape to make it as easy as they possibly can.  We have to review that constantly.  Some of the schemes were not working so we scaled them back and put more money into the ones that were working.  We believe this scheme will work as well.</p><p>A credit guarantee of this sort should enable a bank to look at a loan a little bit differently.  We would expect that and that is part of the open call.  In the credit guarantee, the bank is only exposed for 20%.  The State, through the SBCI, is exposed for 24% and the EU for 56%.  It is attractive to banks to look at their credit policies and try to make credit available.  With the credit guarantee, as we are de-risking it, they can charge a lot less which goes back to Senator Ahearn's point about percentage costs.  The majority of these loan are under 3%.  We want to continue to do that but it does not work for us if the banks are not engaging.  We want those businesses which can prove they can survive with the right access to funding.  That is what we will be pushing out through all our lending institutions.</p><p>The statistics show a decline rate of 15%.  We all know that not all people fill in forms properly.  They might start with a phone call but get negative feedback and then pull back.  Everyone interested in applying should process their applications and put them in the system.  There are appeals mechanisms with the Credit Review Office.  If a business is viable and one has been refused a loan for a wrong reason, the Credit Review Office will pick up on that and deal with it.  Some adverse decisions on worthwhile applications have been overturned for various reasons.  People should always process their loan and not just settle with a phone call.  If there is a particular trend in an area, I would be happy to engage with the Senator on it.  We expect these products to be used.  We set aside &euro;2 billion for the previous scheme and &euro;330 million for this.  We would like to see them drawn down.  As we are part of the EU framework, it will be worth our while ensuring that everyone uses these schemes.  We want them used.</p><p>Senator Gavan also referred to the drawdown.  It is important to make businesses aware of the scheme.  We will certainly advertise it.  Having these debates helps.  Not every business knows about these opportunities.  I accept not every business wants to draw down money.  If one was not trading until today, the last thing one wants to do is borrow money.  Sometimes, however, it is the wisest thing to do.  It can be cheap money.  It is important to look at a financial situation, get advice, talk to the local enterprise office, bank, credit union and other financial institutions and avail of products.  There is some refinancing allowed under this scheme of up to 30% of an existing loan that is not an not property-related or 100% if it was a previous Brexit loan.  It is worth looking at the schemes and work through it.  The schemes are there to help.  It is not a four-year review of the legislation not the scheme.</p><p>There was talk about good quality jobs and the phrase "build back better" was used.  People have this impression that nothing changed after the last recession.  They are wrong on that.  Before the last recession, there was a dependence on the construction sector to the point where it accounted for 28% of GDP.  Such a situation was not sustainable for any country and certainly not when it was built on credit.  When it fell apart for different reasons, it had a major impact on jobs and across the economy.  When we dealt with that, along with the Action Plan for Jobs sponsored by the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, and a whole-of-government approach under Enda Kenny, there was much investment in many sectors to create jobs not dependent on construction or credit.  Enterprise and trading all over the world is what we do best as a country, not just selling houses to each other.</p><p>I accept that construction is extremely important.  We all know about the shortage of housing and that it took far too long to bring it back to what it should have been.  That was because of access to money.  Nobody had money, either the State, the builders or anybody.  Nobody was building houses.  Thankfully, at the first opportunity we could get, finance was drawn down in 2015 and 2016 and we started a housebuilding programme that is now paying off.  I accept it is still not enough to catch up.  It is important we continue to invest in housing, both publicly and privately.  One wants to see a spend of &euro;10 billion a year on housing.  We are not there yet but we will be if we access everyone's money to do it correctly under the right conditions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Again, the construction sector should be at only 10% or 11% of our economy, not 26% or 27%.  We have a much better economy than we had previously.  Likewise this time, we will rebuild after Covid.  There are so many opportunities we can develop.  Senator Garvey touched on the access to money for climate adaptation and climate change.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, launched products in that space two weeks ago.  A large part of the recovery will be around dealing with climate change, investment in energy efficiency and the green agenda sponsored by Government and backed by Europe, and the digitalisation agenda.  There are many business opportunities for which companies are not ready because they are not trading online.  Many are not fully ready to handle e-commerce and so on.  We need to invest in the technology and skills required in that regard.  We need also to ensure we give the access to the right people at the right time.  Businesses need to have the confidence to invest in a digital strategy.  Many companies, having been burned in the past, are a little nervous to invest in the digitalisation of their business, but it is essential if they are to be competitive and trade into the future.</p><p>We have all dealt with people in business and we all understand the concept of drawing down a mortgage to expand the shop floor to bring more customers in the door, but not everyone gets the importance of drawing down money to invest in the online, which is all around us.  The payback from investment in an online presence in terms of thousands of new customers without any new infrastructure needs to be understood by everybody and encouraged.  People need to be brought through that process.  The role of Government and the State is to work with the private sector to bring people on the journey through that system.  That is where the opportunities lie.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste has also announced initiatives around sick pay, the minimum wage, a living wage, the terms and conditions of work, including the right to work remotely, and so on.  A lot is being done to strengthen the conditions of employment.  We want to support business and to support a jobs-led recovery.  A large part of that work is high-quality jobs with good conditions for everybody, which is an area in which this country has seen massive improvements over the past 20 or 30 years.  We will continue to build on that progress.  Some of the recent announcements, often debated in this House, reflect that as well.  We are on the right track in this regard.  There is good movement.</p><p>The plan is to grow the country, not just the east coast.  Project Ireland 2040: National Planning Framework, which was published and debated in this House in 2018, sets out the plan to move future development away from the east coast to concentrate on regional development.  An analysis of the regional enterprise plans over the past ten years shows regional growth and job creation.  I chair four or five of the regional committees and I am aware of the opportunities in the regional plans to develop and invest more in jobs.  We will draw down the funding available under the 2040 plan to invest in those actions, but action is required from the bottom up too.  I welcome that the local authorities, the education system, the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and chambers of commerce are coming together through those regional plans to bring forward ideas.</p><p>The Government, like the two previous Governments, is committed to regional balance and regional growth.  In light of Covid, the people have moved ahead of us.  A couple of years ago the question under previous plans would have been around how to get people to live in Galway, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Limerick or Cork and what investment over time would be required in terms of infrastructure in those counties.  That is happening now.  As people can work remotely, they have gone ahead of us and we now have to catch up and provide the services as soon as possible, be they housing, community and banking infrastructure and facilities to grow businesses.  A lot has to happen in terms of technologies and broadband.  All of that is in play, but we need to monitor and focus on this area continually to ensure we are targeting investment.</p><p>There has been much talk about the public finances.  There is at least &euro;10 billion available to Government every year for the next ten years, and well beyond, to invest in capital projects in this country.  That is how we secure the future of the country.  That investment, coupled with businesses being able to access money and credit and being able to trade under normal conditions, will ensure this country can survive and thrive well into the future.  We have really good potential.  Products such as this loan guarantee scheme were not in place when we came out of the last recession.  It took until 2012-2013 to get them in place, when the need for them was almost gone.  We needed them from 2008 to 2012 to be able to respond quickly.  This time around, they are in place, and over the past year, businesses have been able to avail of all of these facilities and a lot more to be able to drive on and stay afloat.  It is to be hoped from this week on they can continue as normal.</p><p>I apologise for going over time.  I have only two or three more points to make.  Everybody here has recognised the support of the LEOs and the great work being done, be that in Longford or elsewhere.  The LEOs did stand up.  They processed more than 13,000 applications last year for online trading vouchers and they helped many more business with access to schemes and supports.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The local authorities helped us to implement the restart grants on two or three occasions, and are responsible for the small business assistance scheme, SBAS.  The Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, is being done by the Revenue.  We always compliment the public health response and public health teams but other State agencies and Departments such as the Department of Social Protection quickly made sure people were not left without money.  There will always be the odd hard case but that is where we all came in.  Our job is to get involved and get those matters sorted out.  The majority quickly had access to finance.</p><p>Likewise, the enterprise agencies, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and InterTradeIreland, and the local enterprise offices all provided access to funding and advice, guidance and support.  We know that is not enough for every business to survive, nor does it replace all the lost turnover, sales or jobs.  It is assistance to help businesses get through this and get back on their feet.  We are in phase 2, which is the recovery as we come out of the pandemic.  It is important that Members from all parties fully support the need to work with businesses over the next 18 or 24 months to drive a full jobs-led recovery.</p><p>I was asked about the number of applications for the credit guarantee.  The number of successful applicants that have drawn down money is 4,450 and more than 6,500 businesses applied for the scheme.  The previous Brexit scheme had fewer than 300 successful applicants.  We expect demand for this &euro;330 million scheme to be much higher.  With the permission of the House today, funding can go beyond that figure if need be.</p><p>Senator Paddy Burke asked about the costs behind the &euro;29 million.  It is a combination of the cost of the SBCI to run the programme, which is reasonable, and the moneys which, according to he risk analysis, potentially may not be paid back and for which the guarantee could be needed.  If the guarantee does not kick in and the money is not needed and if everyone repays on time and in line with conditions, money will flow back to the State.  As such, &euro;29 million is our maximum exposure under this scheme.  We expect some of that to flow back to the State, as has happened with other schemes.  The majority of companies are in a good position to pay back the loans but the credit guarantee gives the banks the confidence to dish them out.</p><p>The risk to the SBCI, on behalf of the State, stands at 24%.  The EU assumes 56% of the risk and the banks assume the remaining 20%.  It is a well balanced scheme, similar to other schemes.  </p><p>Senator Burke stated that access to finance is the key.  We often argue about the price of money but the difficulty with money is getting one's hands on it.  The cheaper it is the better but being able to draw down funding is more important.  This scheme does both in providing access to funding at a reduced price.</p><p>Senator Kyne asked whether this will be the last reopening.  The vaccination plan is working and we can all see the benefits of it.  Success is measured both in growing numbers of people getting the vaccine every week and the protection the vaccine offers those who get it.  We said we hoped that by mid-May over 95% of those who are vulnerable to Covid would have received two doses of the vaccine.  We are probably a week or two behind on that but that is about the height of it.  That box will be ticked by the end of May.  There are always a few who need to be reached and the system is catching up with them.  The majority, over 95% of vulnerable people, have the protection offered by two doses of the vaccine.</p><p>The other aim was to vaccinate 80% of adults by the end of June.  We will reach and exceed that target.  We are in a strong position.  Supply is coming in and everybody knows somebody who has got the vaccine.  That is always a good sign that something is working because that was not the case a month ago.  We were all getting telephone calls, emails and everything else about this matter.  This has given businesses the confidence to drive the economy and recovery and it has given me the confidence to be able to say that we are coming out of the last lockdown and we are in a strong position to ensure businesses are kept open.  I accept the approach has been cautious for the past two months.  That has put added pressure on the retail and hospitality sectors and many other sectors but it will be proven right in the long run because it will mean we can stay open in a safe way.</p><p>Senator Murphy asked if applicants must employ a minimum number of people.  If a business has one employee, it can apply to the scheme and it is available to businesses with up to 499 employees.  It is not available for large companies with more than 499 employees.  People appreciate that such businesses can probably manage.</p><p>I thank Members for their support.  When the Cabinet approved this legislation it gave approval for a priority debate, scrutiny and progression through the Houses.  I thank Members for their efforts in support of that.  It also sought agreement for early signing of the Bill by the President.  We will probably discuss that issue on Committee and Report Stages.  If all goes well and we pass the Bill next week, the scheme should be up and running by mid-June or the end of June at the latest.</p></speech>

To be young is quite a challenge.  Young people are ever thought of in terms of what they will give to society when they are older and I have a real problem with this.  They are considered intimidating if they gather in groups but this is just because they do not have anywhere else or a designated place to meet.  They are loud and cause fear just by being young and exuberant.  This age group has handled challenges never before experienced.  Even outside of Covid they cope in a cyber age.  They have to figure out social interaction, appropriateness, consent and what is real and what is not in an online environment where reality is frequently distorted and engagement can be twisted and disseminated even before any right of reply.</p><p>While these young people coming up are better educated than any generation before them they still face unprecedented challenges.  Those in their 20s have now lived through two dramatic economic shocks and all of the consequences that flow from this.  The funding of mental health and recovery programmes is very timely and important as the youth generation is the generation that has had the rug pulled out from under it quite literally.</p><p>Despite all of the judgment and narrative surrounding them, young people make huge contributions in the here and now.  In their youth they enrich our society.  Their views are significant and their perspectives are challenging and refreshing.  The optimism of youth is a resource to be harnessed by leaders.  The purity of their perspective, which is not tarnished by disappointment and life experience, should be a shining light and it is important that their voices are heard, their perspectives are considered and their views impact.</p><p>Childhood, youth and old age are finite periods in our lives when a lot of change can happen in a very short space of time.  For the very young, throughout Covid the milestones of development have passed without being shared.  Children have taken their first steps without the presence of grandparents.  Holy communions and confirmations have been cancelled, or if they proceeded they did so without the pomp and significance that every child deserves on such an occasion.  Birthday parties did not happen and some children, like my own child, spent months at a time without playing with any other child.  Young people have had their junior certificate cancelled, and while this might have been a cause for celebration, and it certainly would have been for me in my day, that right of passage was missed and the maturity of the experience of the exam is now a confidence deficit that must be addressed.</p><p>In the initial days of the lockdown, youth work programmes were cancelled as the country got to grips with what it meant to be in a pandemic.  Youth work staff have not received the absolute credit they deserve for all they did in the past year.  Projects such as the St. John Bosco Youth Centre youth work programme in Dublin immediately pivoted from engaging with large numbers of participants to having to go to zero face-to-face contact and interaction that was only online or by video and phone contact.  It published a fantastic document on the nine months of the pandemic last year and all it did and achieved with young people during that time.  It created and developed online programmes.  It distributed art packs.  It had anti-racism initiatives.  It held an online cafe and a video blog chat, Bosco Inspires, which involved interviewing various guests relevant to young people.  When the lockdown eased it painted murals depicting the country's front-line services.  It painted &quot;We are Drimnagh&quot; as a representation of the community of Drimnagh and what aspects were relevant to them.  The same creativity and engagement was demonstrated in many organisations that engage youth, such as the GAA and the Irish Girl Guides, which got involved in an extraordinary level of volunteerism making their communities better places.</p><p>One of the strategic goals of the Minister is to help those who are vulnerable, including children, young people and at-risk individuals, to overcome adverse circumstances and achieve their full potential.  Last year's budget for the Department was an unprecedented investment and I call on him to ensure it is maintained this year and, if possible, increased.</p><p>As for the school leavers of the past year, they travelled an emotional roller-coaster with the leaving certificate.  They missed their debs and their holidays.  They were not able to travel abroad to work.  For those who did get into college, the first year was nothing of the uplifting liberating experience it should have been.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I acknowledge that significant investment has gone into ameliorating the awfulness of last year for them, and that continues.  I set that out in the wording of the motion.  Recent figures show that when the PUP is excluded youth unemployment stands at 15%, up 4% from the pre-Covid seasonally adjusted average of 11%.  I appreciate that moves to address this are already in place or will shortly be announced and that the Department has been involved in those measures.  The capacity of the Intreo centres has been expanded, there are an extra 100 job coaches, the JobsPlus subsidy for employers to hire young people has been increased, and an employer can get &euro;7,500 for employing a young person who has been unemployed for more than four months.  Employers are incentivised to employ young people.</p><p>I appreciate the apprenticeship schemes, the back to education and back to work allowances and the soon to be finalised pathways to work strategy for 2021 to 2025, which will be published by the Department of Social Protection.  These initiatives reflect a whole-of-government strategy that will build on the support measures already in place to assist young people in their journey to work.  Other measures that would help young people include addressing the sudden rise in insurance for international students, ensuring quick pathways to driving tests for young people who are anxious to get on the roads and hastening all of the initiatives the Government has planned.</p><p>I have asked the Minister to create a pathway to engage with young people.  It needs to be interdepartmental to ensure the response is assured across Departments.  We need to establish a youth collaborative forum, similar to the effective forums established in many other areas of the Department, to hear the unique challenges of young people and enable them to suggest, request and influence the Government's output in accordance with all that is ambitiously set out in the programme for Government and by the Department.</p></speech>

The motion acknowledges the contribution of young people through volunteering and advocacy, and the way in which they have built reserves of resilience that inspire us in the face of this pandemic over the past year.</p> <p>During the year, I thought about how I would have felt facing a pandemic in lockdown if I was a teenager or in my 20s.  I remember the period of transition from school to college where I met lifelong friends and had opportunities to travel.  For those learning languages, as I was, we got to travel and work in countries such as France and Spain.  We must acknowledge that much of that was lost by many young people in the past year.  The college years are a great period in life when we makes discoveries, learn and get opportunities to meet new people and have new experiences.  They shape us.</p> <p>Young people have given us hope this year and have been great examples of resilience.  They changed their behaviours to protect their parents, grandparents and loved ones.  In my area of Ballinasloe, many young players' clubs became involved in the community call through the county councils, particularly in Galway and Roscommon.</p> <p>If we think back to the first few dreadful months of the pandemic starting in February last year, there was so much fear and our knowledge of the pandemic was very limited.  Despite this, young people brought hope to older people, delivering medicines from pharmacies and groceries and newspapers.  That effort was replicated in all the counties.  All of these clubs and young people stepped up.</p> <p>As Fine Gael spokesperson on education, further and higher education, I am a member of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  I am also a member of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health.  The committees have heard in recent months about the impact of Covid-19 and the lockdown on young people, especially when schools were closed.  The sacrifices during lockdown were to save lives but they also allowed the Government to prioritise the reopening of schools.  Children and young people came first and were a priority of the Government.  While we used technology to facilitate remote learning, the closure of schools impacted on developmental and social skills.  In the time ahead, post-primary schools will work well to ensure well-being and inclusivity for all students.</p> <p>The education committee also discussed bullying and the impacts on young people of cyberbullying and online harassment, especially at post-primary level.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know that legislation has been introduced by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, which is looking at online harassment and supporting young people who go through difficult times online, especially in respect of the sharing of images.</p><p>In terms of exams, I know that the accredited grades system has reduced stress and anxiety for students by offering choice and the option of being awarded an accredited grade or sitting an exam.</p><p>However, as has been mentioned, the traditional college experience is also very different.  At third level, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has increased the number of places available through the apprenticeship programme, whereby people can earn and learn and go from diploma to PhD level.  The numbers on this programme have grown from 6,000 to 10,000.  There are a further 2,200 college places available.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, has also initiated a consultation on the SUSI programme on how to reform the support and increase the number of people and students who are eligible for the programme.</p><p>Now, more than ever, there is such a choice for school leavers at age 17 or 18.  As Senator Seery Kearney has noted, Ireland included young people in the PUP support.  That support was extended.  When seasonal adjustments are made, it does make a difference in terms of the figures.  We know that there is a large number of students who are currently in receipt of the PUP support.  I will stop there.</p></speech>

I wish to commend my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, on putting forward this motion, and on her hard work and commitment in this area and her empathy for young people.  I feel it too.  I feel it for my own children who are now aged six and eight.  There is a massive about of mother's guilt for when we were both working full-time and they were knocking around the house by themselves.  They have grown up in many ways over the past year, but in other ways they have also remained very innocent.  It has been a really hard year for them.</p> <p>Not every kid that hangs around a street corner is a hooligan.  I fear that we are heading in that direction at the moment because of a lack of things to do for young people.  I was one of those kids that hung around the street corner when I had nothing to do and I do not think I turned into a hooligan.  However, we must find a way to safeguard and protect them from antisocial behaviour, both getting into it and being victims of it, and ensuring they enjoy their summer.  We must also have policing where necessary, too.  I welcome the youth justice strategy that was announced.  It has gone down very well locally.</p> <p>I wrote to the Minister's Department last week.  We do need a plan for the summer holidays for our youth.  The Minister invested in a capital fund in August 2020 to the tune of &euro;2 million to prepare the likes of For&oacute;ige to work online and to support youth services.  For&oacute;ige did an incredible job and brought everything online and still managed to help vulnerable children.  Now we need to see additional funding for this summer.  At the moment, the youth clubs are working with groups of 15 young people outside, and they are hanging around in places like car parks.  We could invest in universal services and also in premises for this summer.  I wonder if places like Blanchardstown Shopping Centre would be a good places for kids to meet when the schools shut.</p> <p>The year 2021 will see funding of &euro;67 million, which is an increase of 8%, but some areas are still falling behind in universal services.  I know the Minister is aware this is the case in areas like Ongar, Tyrrelstown and Carpenterstown.  I am helping For&oacute;ige to set up a youth club in Luttrellstown at the moment, but that is using funds that are being diverted from elsewhere.  Therefore, it would be great to see more universal services.</p> <p>I particularly want to acknowledge the parents of children who go to special schools and note how much I regret that we could not open the schools sooner for them. I sincerely hope the July provision programme will deliver.  Central to that is that schools that have not opened under July provision will open this year.  That is something we will have to watch.</p> <p>One of the areas we absolutely have to deliver on concerns disability services and our child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The problem was acute before Covid, but now they are seeing numbers on the ground that they have never experienced before.  Psychologist staffing levels are a major issue, and yet there are obvious barriers to getting them on the front line.  One of them is the inequitable funding for trainee doctorates.  For example, if you study as a clinical psychologist at doctorate level, you will be paid a salary of &euro;33,000 for the placement and will receive 60% of your funding, whereas if you go down the route of counselling and education, you pay &euro;15,000 per year for three years and you do not get paid for the work placement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They put hundreds of hours into their placements.  That is also on the back of approximately ten years of studying.  We are putting their welfare behind that of everybody else.  A healthy system would actually look after everyone.  That is just one of the barriers.</p><p>There are not enough doctoral places.  We must look at the role of assistant psychologists and make sure they are funded.  We have to look at the new therapy posts, of which there were 100 in 2020 and 100 in 2021.  How many of them are child psychologists?  There are others but that is just at the tip of the iceberg for how we can look at the entire system in giving children access to educational psychologists.</p></speech>

I also thank the Fine Gael Members, led by Senator Seery Kearney, for using their time for this Private Members' business.  It is a really important focus.  One of the great things about Private Members' business is that it gives us an opportunity to make public comment.</p><p>The practice here in recent times has been that very few Private Members' amendments by the Opposition have been accepted, which is a disappointment.  I want to focus on that for one second.  It is a disappointment in a democracy and in a parliament.  The Minister will remember and be aware of his colleagues who sat in opposition for a few years and were blocked out.  It is not good for democracy for the Government to say in a blanket manner that it is not supporting amendments before it has even seen them or heard the debate.</p><p>We know that the Government is not going to accept the amendments today, which is disappointing when we have not even spoken.  It really is disappointing.  The reason and rationale behind that, of course, is that the Cabinet did not meet and, therefore, cannot approve them.  I must accept that.  I have no choice but to accept it.  If I were Minister with responsibility for youth affairs, however, I would find it very difficult not to accept some very key recommendations.</p><p>I wish to start by strongly thanking the Ombudsman for Children's office and the Children's Rights Alliance, two amazing organisations that have a track record and publish annual reports, which I will quote to the Minister in a few minutes.  I could not really argue with them.  I am not the expert on children.  We were all children once and we must listen.</p><p>What message, therefore, are we sending out to the children's ombudsman today?  I notified both offices today about these amendments.  I notified a number of stakeholders in this area who are advocates of childcare.  I told them to watch what is going to happen today.  People have been coming into our audiovisual room, talking to politicians and Ministers, bringing wonderful reports about recommendations on the safe protection of our children and supporting LGBT youth and people with difficulties, which is in this book I will mention in a minute.  It is very disconcerting and disappointing.</p><p>I fully acknowledge the Minister's track record, however.  I am not questioning him or his commitment in this area.  He is part of a bigger team and he must play his part on that team.  I fully respect that and wish to say so before I start.</p><p>First, I thank the ombudsman's office.  I formally move amendment No. 1 and I will speak to amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4.  Basically, I believe the ombudsman's report has done an amazing thing.  Our amendments seek two simple things.  We ask that the Bill addresses the urgent matter of the waiting list of more than 2,500 people for child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  The Minister will be aware of the work done by former Senator Joan Freeman on CAMHS and mental health services.</p><p>I looked back on Commencement matters with regard to members of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il who spoke about the difficulties of mental health services in recent months.  I spoke to many of them and shared their concerns.  We must, therefore, be consistent about our messages and our role as advocates in terms of mental health for our young people.  That is an important point.  I ask people to look back on the record of this House with regard to where they stood then and where they will stand later today.  That is really important.  We also need to address other issue such as poverty, etc.</p><p>I am going to go straight to the report because it really deals with and highlights a few issues.  Roughly, we are talking about the right to education, educational disadvantage, religious diversity in our schools and the challenges around it, and disability and additional needs for our young people, particularly in education.  The Children's Rights Alliance outlines the difficulties and sets out its concerns.</p><p>We then move on to the rights of adequate standards of living for children and young people, and family homelessness.  We speak about parental leave and income supports to sustain and safeguard our young people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Challenges are set out in this report card.  We talk about the right to healthcare including primary healthcare and mental healthcare, and the importance of physical and mental health.  These organisations are making a call on the Government and I do not know what has gone wrong in the messaging here.  Reference is made to the right to family, environment and alternative care.  What we call "family" is very different for different people.  The concept of family is broad, wide and inclusive, as it should be and we need to be there to support all of that.  Also important is the right to early childhood supports and assessments.  </p><p>Covid has taught me that while there are lots of shortcomings with regard to the way we deal with older people, there are lots of young people, aged 14 to 17, who have nowhere to go.  There are no basketball courts, no multi-use games areas for them; there is nothing.  Sadly, some of them are involved in drinking and anti-social behaviour.  They are the ones, according to my local superintendent, who are the most challenging in the context of anti-social behaviour in our communities.  They feel forgotten and isolated and are bordering on confrontational towards the establishment because they feel they are not being supported or listened to and that is a valid concern for them.</p><p>The right to equality is so important.  What about our Traveller and Roma children and youth?  What are we doing for them?  There are particular challenges there and two organisations in particular are well represented.  What about our refugees and asylum-seeking young people who are trapped in all of that, and the places they have to call home?  What about LGBTI+ children and young people who are struggling to be accepted and supported in their schools, communities and dare I say it, their families.</p><p>The amendments we have put forward are reasonable.  I accept what the Minister said about Cabinet proposals but I do not think we can park these issues for too long.  We should support young people.  We must find a vehicle for dealing with these issues comprehensively.  We must support young people and put the necessary legislation in place.  I genuinely thank Fine Gael Senators for enabling us to have this debate, which is positive.  Sometimes we can get frustrated and I, for one, am particularly prone to getting frustrated but I did not want to do that today.  I came in here today and said to myself that I would not get angry because anger gets us nowhere.  I ask Senators to keep the issues I have raised today at the top of our political agenda.</p></speech>

I thank our Fine Gael colleagues, and Senator Seery Kearney in particular, for bringing this very considerate and important Private Members' motion to the House.  I very much welcome this debate today which addresses how young people have suffered as a result of Covid-19 in the context of social isolation, education, employment and housing.  In truth, any cohort in our society which relies on others for the fulfilment of their life has been badly affected.  This includes our older people, young people, carers, people with disabilities and those with a health condition that makes them vulnerable.  These are the people, our family members and members of our community, who have been affected most by Covid-19.  One of the lessons we must learn from this pandemic is how to ensure that those who are most vulnerable are not disproportionately affected should another pandemic occur, which we hope will not happen.</p> <p>Today's debate is about children and young people and it is up to us in this House to find answers.  How do we create a world that they deserve?  They deserve everything but they have not got everything during this pandemic.  We see the same pre-pandemic problems arising again; they are starting to creep back into the news.  We hear about homeless children, people with disabilities not getting access to care and young people engaging in anti-social behaviour.  The latter is a symptom of the problem of disengagement and it is up to all of us to address it.  I welcome Senator Boyhan's contribution and agree that it is about all of us working together.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It might be a bit twee to say it, but children are our future.  If we do not look after them now, then who will take over from us?  We are all shaped and affected by our life experiences.  It is up to us as adults, parents, aunts, uncles, and as legislators, to do our best in advocating for our children, to make them strong and confident and resilient, to ensure that every child has a dream, and that they can do what they want with that dream.  I have been incredibly lucky to live in a country that has allowed me to dream, to know there was a big world out there beyond the Cooley Mountains, and to know that if I wanted to do something I could get there.  The State helped me to achieve it.  It gave me a good education and I scraped myself into university.  I got the grant.  I was able to move on.  I got supported in college.  Only for it, I would not be here today.  The State created an environment for me and I am so grateful for that.  I am one of the lucky ones, however.  There are many people in our country, especially children and younger people, who do not see that this opportunity is there for them.  It is for us now to make visible those opportunities for young people and children.</p><p>We have all been affected by the pandemic, including our children.  Parents have been working from home and home-schooling children.  It was an incredible struggle.  Families really suffered.  Consider the parent or two parents working who had a couple of children.  It nearly broke us.  It was very hard.  Our family had to row back from our home schooling because everything was given and we felt as a family that we were achieving nothing.  All we could do was to step back from the home schooling and give love and time.  There may have been less reading and writing done, but there was a little bit more sitting and cuddling done.  That helped us but not every family was able to do that.</p><p>We must applaud those families for how they struggled through and achieved.  Some families, however, did not.  It is up to us now to look at how we can support families to get through the next period.  There are an awful lot of families who have been locked down in abuse.  It is no offence to fathers, but it is usually the single mothers who need the support.  I am aware that a lot of this debate is cross-departmental.  We hope the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will report back to his Cabinet colleagues.  A lot of supports are needed, from mental health supports to creating an environment where a mother can get herself educated.  It can break that cycle.  When children see their mother achieving in education and moving forward, that she has the confidence in herself, this confidence is passed on to her children.  I see so often how this is the link and the cycle to break: to make sure we look after the mother and the father, to give them the opportunities, and the opportunities will then be given to the families.</p><p>There are so many activities for young people but a lot of those activities cost a lot of money.  Similar to the back-to-school initiative, there should be a grant to allow lower wage families to be able to afford the GAA, gymnastics, ballet and all of those things, which can cost a lot of money.  This is how to get children engaged in their communities and to get them involved and part of it.  It really opens up a door.</p><p>We should also have a national paid internship programme that looks after all of our children.  We could pull them in from across all parts of society, from those young people with a disability to the LGBTQ young people, and positively discriminate to get young people working in our State organisations.</p><p>A huge number of children are waiting on the basic child developmental checks.  We need to look after the mental health supports.  We need to look after those disaffected youth.  Anti-social behaviour is just a symptom of the problem, the youth are not the problem.</p></speech>

The motion refers to the contribution that young people make to our society.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I want to talk about young carers.  In December, I referred to the fact that it is estimated that there are approximately 67,000 young carers in Ireland - an enormous number.  This is according to a report published by the National University of Ireland Galway in conjunction with Young Carers Ireland.  Some of the responses showed that young carers face issues with emotional health and well-being and lower life satisfaction than their peers.  One third of young carers reported having been bullied in school.  One of the most tragic findings of the research was that one in four young carers was going to school or bed hungry because there was not enough food at home.  No child should go to bed hungry in a wealthy country such as Ireland and nobody should have to take on a caring role before he or she becomes an adult.  In Ireland, we do not dedicate enough resources to carers in general, in the form of home help hours or respite provision, and the report highlights how lacking we are in the context of care supports.  It is estimated that 13.3% of young people are undertaking caring roles, which is a huge proportion.  I hope we remember that and that the Minister will consider what he and his team can do to better provide for the emotional, physical and material needs of young carers.  I thought I would raise that issue while we are speaking to the contribution that young people make.</p><p>The motion refers to the student experience.  As my party's spokesperson on further and higher education, I take the student experience very seriously.  I am sure all of us have heard reports of students and young people being at home on their own, completely isolated.  They may have not made any friends in first year.  In my first year of college, it was difficult enough to make friends in person, so I can only imagine how extraordinarily difficult it is now.  Many young people have considerable anxiety about going onto campus in September to be with people they have never really met and with whom they have only really chit-chatted online.  That is causing a very significant level of anxiety and I am sure we all know someone who has experienced that.</p><p>As we are talking about the welcome role that education plays and, as other Senators have noted, the impact that being able to access education has, it would be remiss of me not to mention who is not progressing to further and higher education, or even those who are not finishing school.  There is great concern this year, according to the teachers to whom I have spoken, regarding the students they would normally be able to capture and get through their education post junior certificate and into the leaving certificate, somehow someway.  Those students have been lost this year and we need to think about what we are going to do in that regard.  We do not want students just to disappear from the system for ever more and to fall between a number of stools.  We need to think about students who have been lost in the interim, particularly between junior certificate and leaving certificate and those who will not have completed school, for whatever reasons, and what additional supports will be provided for them for the coming years.</p><p>The motion also mentions the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on young people and their ability to work and earn their own money.  As I noted on the Order of Business, a number of families and students applying for SUSI this year have, due to accepting the PUP, been deemed to be above the thresholds.  No one should be punished for having received the PUP over the past year.  I highlighted last year that this would be a problem in the coming year and asked whether we could do something about it, but nothing has been done.  I ask the Minister to raise with his Cabinet colleagues and Senator Seery Kearney to raise with her party colleagues the fact that it is not good enough that people will potentially miss out on continuing their education because they were paid the PUP.  I do not know whether it will have to be regarded in same way as the threshold of &euro;4,500 for holiday earnings but there should be a workaround.  Thus far, the answer is to get people to apply with reference to exceptional circumstances but I am not sure that is the best response.</p><p>The final issue I raise relates to youth unemployment.  There was previously a youth guarantee and I hope there will be a European-wide response to youth unemployment.  There is an extraordinarily high level of youth unemployment in Ireland at the moment.  If we are considering a youth guarantee in the context of how we deal with jobs and training, it is important that it be more than a conveyor belt for getting young people into just any job.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It needs to be a job that is meaningful and provides for growth and opportunity.  I dare say that pushing someone into a job that is not the right one is almost as bad as leaving him or her without anything at all because it has such an impact on his or her sense of well-being, confidence and potential.</p><p>This motion is very welcome.  We support the amendments, particularly that relating to lowering the voting age to 16.  We are very supportive of that.  There is mention of ensuring the voice of young people and their needs are respected and heard.  I commend the Irish Second&ndash;Level Students' Union, ISSU, and my alma mater, the Union of Students in Ireland, for the incredibly hard work they have been doing over the past year to ensure that the voices of young people are heard.</p></speech>

Young people have had a particularly difficult couple of years.  The fact that we are talking about this today shows that we value them and acknowledge that difficult period and that we must make moves to ensure it does not have a negative impact on their lives.  One thing about which I am particularly passionate is youth participation.  Since the children's right referendum in 2012, we have seen a stepping up in this area and the idea of &quot;nothing about me without me&quot; has entered policy across the Department and Tusla.  I have been on the receiving end of it as a family.  Sometimes it can be very <i>ad hoc</i>and almost like &quot;youthwashing&quot; so we need to examine this area, particularly when we have seen young people stepping up during this pandemic like never before and really having their voices heard.  Senator Hoey mentioned the ISSU.  Young people have gone to places we never expected them to go, have led the charge and have almost designed this leaving certificate themselves.  It was what they were asking for and they got it.  Policy and how we act with regard to youth participation need to bring them into the middle of it and I would love to see some work from the Department in this regard.  I am sure there is work being done in that regard.</p><p>There have been so many small and large announcements from the Department that it is almost too much and overwhelming.  Even the LGBTI+ capacity grants scheme, which is going towards young people and their families, is one part of that.  It is important that all these little pieces go to individual groups of people because young people have had a hard time but the most vulnerable are the ones who are the most deeply impacted upon.  The Minister has this in mind all the time.</p><p>We really need to look at whether education is matching up to some of the activities within the Department.  It is not the fault of the education system but it does mean that we need to step beyond that and have relationships and sexuality education, RSE, that is the same across the country instead of it being a postcode or school lottery.  There has been a lot of talk about Flourish.  I want to see RSE that respects everybody - their sexuality and their families.  This is what the Government can do.  I have spoken a lot about voting at 16.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to look at a reduction in the voting age so let us do it.</p></speech>

He is a busy man with a lot going on.  I have worked with young people for approximately 25 years and I have a 22-year-old son.  What I keep coming across is young people's passion for everything and anything.  I am struck by the diversity of young people and all the different things they bring to the table.  I started visiting a couple of schools recently.  Sometimes they are so refreshing compared to the adults because they have a can-do attitude.  They do not see the obstacles.  They think "Why can't you just do this?"  It is really refreshing to see that they focus on solutions.  It is great to remind ourselves that we must keep looking for solutions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> To that end, I would point to a few matters that have struck me about secondary school environments.  It is unfair that practical subjects are not taught in every school.  That means the academics only get to use one part of the their brain and miss out on practical staff and people who are not as academic do not have the opportunity to do well. </p><p>My nephew is doing his leaving certificate.  He is a very clever guy.  He will have four or five of his subjects almost half done before he sits down.  I remember when I was doing my leaving certificate the fact that I had five years' work to be tested in three hours was nerve-racking for the entirety of my secondary school existence.  We need to examine that area.  The leaving certificate examination programme does not fit anybody, even if the authorities think it suits the academics.  Just because one gets six A1s does not mean one is a happy camper and enjoyed one's time in secondary school. </p><p>The issue of apprenticeships is major.  They should not start in January.  It is as though there is a stigma attached to them.  Those taking up an apprentice find that they finish school and all their mates have gone to college but they have to wait around and go on the dole until January.  It is major issue that applicants must be in receipt of social welfare for a good six months before they can take up an apprenticeship.  We need to examine that. </p><p>I met a women with a good project called Elder Home Share when I got to the finals of a social entrepreneurs workshop.  She matched young people with old people.  In Ennistymon, there is 48% single occupancy of the houses and such single occupancy would be found in many towns and cities.  People who live on their own might, if there was proper Garda vetting, share their home with a young person.  The woman who has that project has a good system where she matches old people with young people who find cheap accommodation and the old people feel safe at night.  There is much we are can do in that area.</p><p>I must talk about mental health services.  Prevention is better than cure.  My son and his friend made a very important point about this issue.  My son is 22 years of age and finished school a few years ago.  I remember he and his friend, Conor, saying they would not be caught dead going into a counsellor's office.  If it was mandatory for every student in the school to go to the counsellor's office once for 20 minutes, we would get young people over that threshold and break down that stigma or barrier.  That should be mandatory.  It concerns young people's mental health.  That would help the maintenance of their mental health.  That is what we should be doing.  Consideration should be given to doing that for the purposes of young people's mental health.  It would help if we could get them to understand they need to mind their minds from the beginning, as opposed to thinking they would never reach out for help until they have reached rock bottom.  </p><p>We should praise the student councils and the students&rsquo; unions.  It is important they have proper participation from everybody in every grouping.  My son got into college through the disability access route to education, DARE.  Students' unions are often full of privileged, academic upper middle-class students.  Many people in politics have come from those but student councils and students' unions should be more diverse and represent all the different people who get into college.</p></speech>

The Senator can speak to those amendments he referenced.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#UUU00400"><p>I will come to them.  I am quite supportive of Senator Boyhan's comments regarding the need for the Government to take on board the amendments.  When dealing with a youth motion, where does one start and where does one stop in the context of what we could have put in and what we left out?  Every issue that goes through these Houses is relevant to young people.  I will speak later about the importance of lowering the voting age to 16.  I want to open my contribution with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, data released last week, which outlined how the pandemic has hit young workers the hardest.  That should be a wake-up call for the Government and policy-makers here that we cannot return to business as usual after the pandemic.  The ESRI report came after the publication of data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, EUROSTAT, and the European Commission's statistical division, all of which showed the scale of the pandemic and the Covid crisis on young people.  Reports from all three organisations outlined that the pandemic has hit young workers the hardest.  We know there were 112,000 fewer 15 to 34-year-olds in paid work in the final quarter of 2020 than the year before.  Employment was 14% below its pre-pandemic level for those 15 to 34 year olds.  Part of the reason for the disproportionate impact of job losses on young people is that they were more likely to have been employed in retail, hospitality, arts and leisure sectors, all of which have been affected by the Covid crisis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The data also reinforced one of the greatest threats to our society and economy, namely, the scale of intergenerational division and inequality that exists.  Young people are locked out of housing and their earnings have stagnated.  Young workers in their early 20s earned less in the 2010s than their counterparts did in the 1990s and the 2000s.  A progressive country should prioritise a high wage and the kind of progressive growth in the economy that delivers for young people and society.</p><p>We could not include everything in the amendments.  It was a case of "our demands most moderate are, we only want the earth."  However, I will touch on what is contained in Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment.  We make reference to the need to increase youth work and funding for youth work services in order to bring us back to 2008 levels.  There is a perfect storm in the youth sector.  Funding has not been restored and that is having a huge impact on volunteers.  Youth services are looking for a major programme from Government, with funding to match, for education and training in order to bring funding back to 2008 levels.  Youth services have an enormous financial impact on the State in regard to volunteering.  The impact of the pandemic notwithstanding, the existing funding shortfall is creating a perfect storm in the youth sector.  There is a major supply issue in the context of volunteers and the funding is not there to run many important programmes.</p><p>Our amendment also refers to the student contribution charge.  It has been a long-held demand of the left that student fees be reduced.  The charge involves no small sum.  People are more impatient having seen what can be done in terms of how the State can respond to the pandemic.  Our politics are on a trajectory we can all see.  Young people have huge political influence as well, so we need to address these issues.</p><p>In terms of mental health, there will need to be surge capacity in terms of the provision that will be needed in the months ahead.  Action is needed in this regard.</p><p>My final point relates to the proposal to lower the voting age to 16.  We can do this without the need for a constitutional amendment.  We can do it through legislation relating to European and local elections.  It has been a long-time commitment of the Green Party to achieve what is proposed in this regard.  Fianna F&aacute;il has committed to it in successive election manifestos.  Fine Gael has committed to it in the past.  Ultimately, as many people as possible should be allowed to vote.  We know from elections and the independence referendum in Scotland that young people aged 16 or 17 come out to vote in greater numbers than those in the 18 to 25 age category.  I urge the Minister, who has responsibility for youth, to get behind that initiative and to bring his Cabinet colleagues with him in support of lowering the voting age in advance of the 2024 local elections.  This can be achieved.  It would be welcome if councillors across the State committed to supporting that change through motions.  I call on them to do that, particularly as there is an impression there is not support in the political system for making that change.  I am of the view that it should be done.</p></speech>

I am already getting many emails about young people being pushed out of university because they cannot stay on their SUSI payments.  The latter is unintended of Covid-19 which needs to be remedied quickly.</p> <p>When I think about young people, it is such a big subject.  How does one begin to talk about young people?  I always need to take it back to who I was as a young person and the young people with whom I identify most.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Usually, it is the young people who are right at the back of the line.  I try not to sound overly pessimistic - I do not know whether I achieve that - when opportunities arise to talk about new initiatives, new funding or an increase in the number of people who want to go to university.  It is very hard for me not to look out my bedroom window at my community, knowing that even with the greatest will and intention, often no amount of intervention will reach those who need it most and who are furthest from the system.  Those are the young people who are usually at the forefront of my mind in anything I do as a politician, such as working on spent convictions, drug possession or crime.</p><p>The young people I advocate for, and for whom I want to advocate even more, are often those society deem as problematic, as criminals or as causing a problem beyond antisocial behaviour.  Antisocial behaviour is probably a bit too light a term for what I am referring to.  At some point in those young people's lives, they were not considered to be the same thing they are seen as when they hit 16, 17 and 18.  When they were two years old, they might have been considered people in a vulnerable position or young children or families that needed support.  At some point when they get older, poverty, deprivation and lack of access manifest themselves in the world as an outward behaviour that the rest of society can see, and they then become known as something else, whether that is as criminals or some other very classist words that I will not use.  People might think that they just do not care or that they are violent.  I do not know how much people know about childhood trauma but it can manifest itself as violence.  Hurt people hurt people.</p><p>I would never suggest for a moment that we should not hold people accountable to try to help curb their behaviour, but when we look at young people and talk about their involvement in criminality or violence, we cannot separate them from their history.  We keep separating young people from who they were two or four years previously, or when they were born, and then we separate their parents from their own history.  Parents who have not had access to education or employment and do not know how to read information, search forms or understand what their doctor is saying do not all of a sudden know all those things when they become mothers.  They do not suddenly know how to create a completely different life for the child they are after having.  They are still that same person with that same lack of opportunity and the same lack of ability to advocate for themselves.  People online often say "Where are the parents?" or "I blame the parents" but those parents were the same children all the previous Governments talked about.  This is an intergenerational issue and we are failing people in their thousands.  We often do not speak up for some of these people because they may also behave in very problematic ways, such as becoming robbers or being violent or so on.  It all intersects.</p><p>I wrote my dissertation on the moral significance of class and poverty.  I researched the philosophy behind all of it and the biggest thing I learned was that, while we are busy striving and talking about a republic of opportunity and equality of opportunity, there can never be equality of opportunity if the floor on which we are all standing is not the same.  Opportunity means nothing if our environments do not look like each other.  If my environment does not look like the next person's and theirs does not look like the next's, opportunity is meaningless and empty.  We need to strive for young people, whose disposable income is now 16% less than it was in 1987.  Young people now are experiencing a different type of inequality with the standard cost of living having gone up.  We need to create a society where we all have the same social floor.  What people do from there is up to them, but they should never fall below a certain point.  There are too many people below that floor right now and that is what we need to fix.</p></speech>

I thank him also for today's announcement of the capacity building grants which help a lot of gays, lesbians, bisexuals and trans people around Ireland.  It is noticeable that, with the exception of Senator Boyhan, all those in the Chamber so far are either women or gay men.  I hope we will see a number of our other colleagues taking part in what is a really important debate around young people's participation in society and how we can help them to recover.  Last November I made a speech about young people missing out on rites of passage and made reference to nightlife and how young people were missing out on building relationships.  It grabbed a bit of attention.  Not everyone in here agreed with me but it is actually really important to young people because they have made enormous sacrifices in their social and personal lives, as well as in their educational and professional careers and these things are very important.  We must acknowledge the contribution young people have made and how they have volunteered in their communities, as wells as on the front line in retail and our health service.  They are going to have to deal with much of the social and economic consequences not just of Covid but also of climate change, the rapid change of pace with technology and they must deal with the housing crisis and everything else as well.</p> <p>I want to focus on what we can do.  A number of colleagues have spoken of the importance of investing in youth services.  When we pull back the cotton wool that has protected us through this Covid period there will be a lot of scars.  Our youth services rely very heavily on volunteers and they will need the supports in place to be able to help those young people who may have lost family members or friends to Covid or who have found this period hard on their mental health.  Those supports, therefore, must be in place.  I know specific cases have been made to the Minister about Scouting Ireland and some of the other youth organisations and that must be addressed.  Others have commented on that.  Equally, with regard to educational support programmes, while some have adapted very well to going digital, there is a digital divide and others have not been able to do so.  We will thus need to provide those supports to allow people to catch up.  Senator Hoey and others have mentioned the importance of reform of SUSI and access to it.  We will be debating the housing issue later on which, again, is critically important.</p> <p>There are a few other specific issues I think are important.  One is the case of driving tests and the fact that there is a 30-week waiting list.  That impacts on young people in a big way because it drives up the costs of their insurance, and their ability to be able to access services is limited, particularly in rural Ireland.  Apart from all that, I would like us to be imaginative.  We should look at the idea of a free travel scheme.  Let us give young people a break.  Why not allow free public transport for young people over the course of the summer?  The EU has looked at a pilot scheme for inter-railing and so on but let us look at public transport here in Ireland and maybe give a certain number of free passes; it is something that has been tried in Belgium.  We must look at nightlife.  We must let young people get out.  Senator Warfield has made arguments around this.  We must be radical about when our nightclubs and city nightlife can open back up again.  We must give young people the opportunity to go out there and enjoy it and to have a break.</p> <p>Senator Dolan used the word "resilience".  Young people have been resilient and it is important to acknowledge that.  I have spoken to some of the most amazing young people over the last year.  I have been involved in youth organisations for a long time and when one looks at the Irish Second-Level Students&rsquo; Union, ISSU, which many of us have engaged with, or at what is coming out of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition, at the young social innovators, the young social entrepreneurs, the young carers, we have all these groups of young people who are doing things that are really imaginative and different.  When we say no decisions without us, I do not necessarily want some task force on young people, and that is important, but we need to have young people at the decision-making table.  Last week I told the Minister for Finance that the most innovative people coming out of Ireland in the fintech space have been the Collison brothers.  Why not put them in charge of the forum on the future of banking?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As for the cybersecurity attacks, somebody such as Shane Curran and his company, Evervault, could do far more than some of those who have been responsible for what has been happening recently.  Alicia O'Sullivan has been speaking out recently around cyberbullying and her testimony has been powerful.  We should have voices such as hers at the table.  Bl&aacute;ith&iacute;n Ennis can speak to sustainable and ethical design.  Fionn Ferreira has been doing amazing work about taking microplastics out of water.  Jack O'Connor, a student from Limerick who I know, teaches farmers in Malawi how to plant seeds in a more imaginative way.  These young people are making enormous contributions and we need to have them at the table.</p><p>I strongly support changing the voting age to 16.  We need to make that decision, go with it and move on.  It is about more than simply giving young people the right to vote.  It is about meaningful ways of participating in society.  It is about strengthening the student councils and Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  I would introduce participatory budgeting at local authority level to allow young people a say in the budget.  We tried to do that in Wexford.</p><p>I know the Minister is passionate.  Everybody in the country knows the difficulties that young people have faced over the past number of years.  We now must give them a break.  Every single decision we make over the next few months, from the review of the national development plan to the budget and the recovery plan for coming out of Covid must be youth-proofed.  We must put young people at the centre of those decisions.</p></speech>

Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;; praise the young and they will flourish.  Many of us will recall this Irish saying from our schooldays.  Indeed, there is great wisdom and merit in that saying.  However, praise can only do so much.  The youth of Ireland need support, especially as we emerge from 14 or 15 months of rolling lockdowns that have affected them severely.  Fifteen months is a long time in anyone's life, particularly a child or a young person.  Young people are at a crucial time of personal development.  At the same time, they are trying to progress in education, sport, socially and in the workplace.  There has been a growing body of expert opinion and research on the manifold harms that lockdowns have had on people, particularly, in the context of this discussion, young people.</p><p>I call for a critical look at whether all aspects of restrictions affecting young people were necessary, proportionate and medically justified.  The impact of the lockdowns imposed by the Government and National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, on the mental health and well-being of teenagers is, understandably, critically important to allow us to respond in a more nuanced way in the future.  Dr. Caroline Heary from the school of psychology in the National University of Ireland, NUI, Galway has stated: </p> <blockquote> 	These prolonged periods of social distancing are occurring during a critical stage of life for our teenagers.  Social interactions are of paramount importance for our young people.  The social environment is critical for brain development, the development of self and general wellbeing. </blockquote> <p>Like many other demographic groups, the youth have all been in the same storm but have not all weathered the storm in the same vessel.  Research and anecdotal evidence alike indicate that the lockdowns have impacted more severely on the youth than others.  I have been inundated with heartbreaking accounts of hardship endured by parents and families of children and adolescents with special needs.  It is a moral imperative that we do not leave anyone out of the recovery.  There are already too many people contending with disadvantage, finding themselves at the periphery of society and excluded from economic participation.  I believe the Minister to be a caring and genuine person.  I ask him to do all he can to mobilise the resources of his Department to support young people with disabilities, their families, carers and organisations that assist them.</p><p>My amendment to the motion proposes an interdepartmental approach to be taken by the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth; Education; Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and Health to design a scheme that is universally available to young people to provide them with free access to a range of different pursuits.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the spirit of the Fine Gael motion, I would encourage engagement with young people themselves for ideas as to the range and breadth of activities that might be included in any such scheme.  The next step might be to invite expressions of interest from the private sector in the range of areas identified.  Services and amenities for young people in this country are sorely lacking compared with our European peers, suffering from decades of underinvestment.  Lockdown has merely served to magnify these failures.<br/><br/>The housing crisis, low wages, unemployment, lockdown, disruption to education and healthcare, along with the lack of social outlets, have all put tremendous strain on our young people.  Prior to the pandemic, our youth were already finding themselves being relegated to the bottom of the social and economic equality charts.  I have a well-founded fear that the pandemic could deepen intergenerational inequality.<br/><br/>The Covid-adjusted youth unemployment figures of 61.8% for April floored me.  To put this statistic in perspective, it is over double the peak rate of youth unemployment after the 2008 economic crash, a crash that sparked another lamentable Irish diaspora.  Behind the appalling statistics, however, are literally hundreds of thousands of young people.  They are in the spring and summer of their lives with hopes, dreams and aspirations that need to be nurtured not crushed.  It behoves the Government to deploy all the available resources of the State to support our youth and to give them options other than that of obtaining a Covid-19 cert and a one-way plane ticket to distant shores.<br/><br/>The Government's voted current expenditure is running to almost &euro;75 billion in budget 2021.  In light of this, should we be applauding an increase of &euro;5 million in funding for youth services?  Can we not see the value of investing more in our youth?  I urge the Government to do everything possible to assist the private sector to generate employment opportunities.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is doing well with regard to youth unemployment.<br/><br/>We must do everything possible to support enterprise, advanced education and training opportunities.  I fully endorse the amendments brought forward by me and my Independent colleagues which put flesh on the bones of these motions.  I will conclude with a warning from Barra Roantree, an economist with the ESRI and a co-author of the report, Poverty, Income Inequality and Living Standards in Ireland, which states:</p><blockquote>	These findings should be a cause of serious concern.  While the most serious medical impacts of Covid have been on older people, it is clear that the greatest impact in the labour market is being felt by younger workers.<br /><br />To minimise the potential &lsquo;scarring&rsquo; effect on young adults, policymakers should ramp up capacity on high-quality training programmes in the months ahead.  Policies that act to tackle the root causes of high rents will also disproportionately benefit younger adults who risk otherwise being left behind. </blockquote><p>A scheme like I have suggested would put all youths on an equal footing to develop into their best selves.  Surely that is what we should aspire to give all our youth.  That is exactly what Senator Ruane was talking about.</p></speech>

I commend my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, and the Fine Gael group on bringing forward this motion.</p> <p>I have worked for many years as a volunteer with many youth groups and have also been involved in a secondary school.  Only recently I attended a Zoom meeting with some students to speak about their experience during Covid.  While some of them had the experience of being able to go to school, I also met with some third level students who certainly felt that the biggest loss was not being able to meet their friends and colleagues.  Not being able to meet first hand has certainly put an awful lot of pressure on young people.</p> <p>There was a call earlier that a committee be set up and that the youth be engaged with it.  It is the way to go because the youth have so much of a contribution to make.  They have so many of their own thoughts and it is all about our futures as well.  Many of them have thought it out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Covid has taught many of us, including our youth, what needs to happen.  It has given us time to reflect as well.  I learned that from the two different groups I met. </p><p>In my community, a number of the voluntary groups that were previously run by older people were taken over by young people when Covid hit and the older people were afraid to go outside and get involved in the community.  Young people got involved in the delivery of the meals-on-wheels service and a number of other services when people who would otherwise be involved in organising some of these services were not vaccinated and felt unable to contribute.  Our youth went out of their way to get involved.  They have made an enormous contribution during the Covid pandemic.  </p><p>Many young people were mentioned by Senator Malcolm Byrne, including the Collison brothers from Limerick.  We all know of their success arising out of the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.  There is a lot of investment in youth services, but we need to make further investment in programmes like that and to encourage youth to get involved.  Young people also get involved in the Gaisce programme.  We need to develop that further at a later stage as well.  So many young people have contributed at bronze, silver and gold levels of the programme, but it is only open to those between the ages of 15 and 25.  We need to expand programmes like that.  </p><p>Many schools offer youth political programmes, but this is not compulsory.  We need to encourage students to get involved in such programmes.  I was involved in youth politics at a young age.  It gave me a great understanding of my views and led to me getting involved in voluntary work in my community.  That was my route into politics.  It is important that we engage with young people.  They have missed out over the last 12 months.  They have so much to contribute.  We should definitely engage with the student unions, but we should also put out a call to young people to come forward and participate in youth forums, such as Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, through which they can bring forth their own policies.  So many young leaders have come out of that forum.  An open engagement with organisations like that might be useful in developing youth policies going forward.</p></speech>

He has a genuine interest in making life a better place for our youth.  We should all subscribe to that type of thinking.</p> <p>I thank Senator Seery Kearney for bringing forth this important motion.  In terms of Covid, young people have lost out on school and college time, participation in sports, part-time jobs, their social lives and their relationships.  The rug was plugged from under them, but we need to acknowledge some of the work they have done.  For example, those who had grandparents living in their areas have called to their homes to see if there was anything they could do for them, always mindful to be socially distanced.  They went to the local shops to buy fuel and so on.  In some parts of the country, young people got involved in social services.  We should acknowledge that they were there to help during the crisis.  They were also of enormous help to families with children with disabilities.  Young people who have brothers, sisters or cousins with disabilities, for whom services were not available owing to Covid, were, I am told, on hand to help.  That should be acknowledged.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to look at the paused apprenticeship programme.  A lot of young people have had their apprenticeships paused and they have been told they will not be able to get back to them for six or seven months.  I would like the Minister to bring that back to the Cabinet to see if we could get them back more quickly as long as more people are vaccinated and society starts to return to normality.</p><p>We also need to look at the operation of SUSI.  Due to the PUP, there are families that will have difficulty qualifying for any grant.  In normal circumstances they would qualify and those are people who do not have an awful lot of money.  They are not in any way even middle-income families.  We need to look at that to see if we can help them because the PUP has put them over the threshold.  Maybe we need to step in there and try to do what we can for them.</p><p>As we go forward we have to engage with youth, listen to them more and give them more of a say.  Prior to the arrangement of the leaving certificate, what the second level students got involved with in such a mature way was outstanding.  It shows what can be done with people working together and listening.  Some years back the second level students might not have been listened to and it might have been questioned whether they should have a say.  Their contribution and the fact that the Government and all politicians listened to them and saw they had a good case to make on the leaving certificate was extremely important.  In the end, we saw that when they were given a choice, some 98% of students were happy with that.  They were listened to and the right thing was done.  It shows that a level of co-operation and discussion is important.  Rather than talk down to them and ask what they would know about it, we should bring them on board, talk to them, discuss issues and listen to them.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Seery Kearney for tabling this motion.  "We cannot always build a future for our youth, but we can always build our youth for the future."  These were the words of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 when he announced the New Deal for the American people coming out of the Great Depression.  We are looking at producing a new deal as we emerge from Covid.  Those words are equally as important now, particularly around the notion that we need to re-engage with our young people.</p> <p>There is no doubt but they have been hugely impacted by Covid, not just in education and the possibility to earn money as young people, but in all of their social mores, such as being involved with sport or with other organisations or just hanging out.  While we are having the conversation about where we need to go from here, we need to have the energy, imagination, creativity, exuberance and talents that young people have in terms of that conversation about where we are and where we need to go.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the national framework for children and young people's participation in decision-making was launched in April and that is crucial to the conversation.  Like others have mentioned, I was hugely impressed by the level of engagement with young people in the examination years for 2020 and 2021 in terms of their advocacy for themselves and their peers.  We can only learn from that.  Our national youth organisations need to be supported, as well as those that provide sporting opportunities and the opportunity to participate through arts.  CAMHS and all of the different programmes around supporting young people's positive mental health are crucial to the development of our young people.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge that today is International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.  That is important in terms of young people in that community.  We support them.</p></speech>

I thank my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, for tabling this Private Members' motion.  I was listening in my office to the contributions, which have been very enlightening and positive.  In particular, I listened to the contribution of Senator Lynn Ruane, which I found incredibly interesting with regard to the perception that when children have a tough upbringing certain people ask where were the parents and what were they doing.  It is not as simple as this and it never has been.  The Senator's contribution was very interesting.</p> <p>When people speak on this subject they normally speak about their own experiences and sometimes this is all we can use as a basis for a contribution.  I have been thinking about how to address this topic with regard to young people, the contribution they make and the difficulties they have had over the past year.  Young people can be divided into three groups.  There are extremely young children, toddlers and babies who have just been brought into this world in the craziest year we have ever had.  My son is one of these.  Parents naturally worry about the challenges that their children would not ordinarily have had in other years.  It is simple things, such as interaction with other children and other people.  I see it with my child.  The number of people with whom he has interacted since he was born a year and a half ago is five or six.  As a parent, I worry this might have a long-term effect.  The challenge at this age is more about whether this will be seen further down the line.</p> <p>Children who are of school-going age have been out of school and have not been with their friends.  They have not had normal events such as holy communion, confirmation or gatherings of any kind, which are big things in children's lives at that age.  That they do not have them is very difficult for them.  It is probably hard for us to appreciate this.</p> <p>Then we look at the challenges teenagers have, specifically those doing the leaving certificate and those who have started college.  Students who have been in college for two years have not developed friendships because they have not been on campus.  They have not had a normal college life.  For most people who went to college, it is where they develop their personality and personal skills.  Students have not had the opportunity to do this.  Coming out of Covid, we need to recognise that many of the challenges people have had over the past two years will take a lot longer than two years to address.  We need to be prepared for this.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke about supports for young people.  At third level, the Minister, Deputy Harris, introduced more mental health supports and staff for students in colleges.  The demand for mental health services in colleges has increased dramatically.  We need to focus on this even more.</p> <p>I see the good work done by groups in Tipperary, such as Youth Work Ireland Tipperary, and the support they give to so many people throughout the county.  We are supporting many sectors at present and organisations such as this will need support long after Covid.  In Tipperary we are lucky to have a Jigsaw service.  It has been delayed because of Covid, like everything else, but Tipperary and Wicklow were chosen to have a Jigsaw service.  Jigsaw is a mental health service for those aged between 12 and 25 and it has been hugely successful in other areas.  It should be rolled out not just in Wicklow and Tipperary but throughout the country as quickly as possible.  The need is there.</p> <p>Many Senators spoke about the contribution young people can make to society and I have seen it in the youth wing of my party.  Last month, Young Fine Gael voted in a new executive, led by the president, Art O'Mahony.  I congratulate him and all of those elected.  The contribution they make is important, wide and varied.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Everyone has spoken about how young people can make such a huge contribution to society.  Sometimes young people might think that can be condescending in a way, but it is not.  If you look at the biggest changes we have seen in the past ten years, and only because I was watching "Reeling In the Years" on Sunday night, the marriage equality referendum and the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment were led by young people.</p><p>When we look at the exit from Covid-19, where we want to go from there and how society changes on the back of what has been the most traumatic year and a half in Irish history, perhaps this should be led by young people.  The decisions we make going forward should be based on recommendations from some of those young people and groups.  We have seen before that they are well capable of leading us, and generations even older than us, in the right way going forward.  I thank my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, for bringing the motion forward and for the debate.</p></speech>

We are discussing young people but the voice of young people has been quite prevalent in these Houses in recent weeks.  Three weeks ago, students from Tallaght Community School and Kinsale Community School appeared before the media committee and discussed the online safety Bill from their perspective.  Their inclusion as part of the debate was critical, especially when, over the past year, the only way they could communicate was by way of social media.  That was very relevant.</p><p>Addressing the committee, Megan Fahy from Kinsale Community School told us in no uncertain terms that:</p> <blockquote> 	It can be infuriating for students to be lectured on the dangers of social media by parents who perhaps do not understand that this is an integral part of growing up. Listening to young people [and young people] with experience ... [on] this issue is the best way to [inform decisions and to] educate. </blockquote> <p>Powerful words from her to us.</p><p>Equally powerful was a testimony we heard last week from the ISPCC and the Ombudsman for Children at the same committee outlining the impact of online abuse via social media.  The CEO of the ISPCC, Mr. John Church, outlined the account of one 13-year-old girl named Kate who was contemplating slitting her wrists because of the abuse she suffered.</p><p>The appearance of Facebook, TikTok and Twitter at our committee this week is, therefore, an opportunity for them to start to address what these young people have said and what these companies will do positively to protect them.  Regulation is coming for this unregulated sector, but I hope they come here with a positive attitude because these issues have been exacerbated because of Covid-19 and the abuse young people have suffered.</p><p>The words spoken by Megan were not the first time young people have told us we do not have a clue what we are talking about when it comes to matters concerning them.  My 18-year-old niece said as much to me when Senator Malcolm Byrne spoke in this Chamber some time ago about how young people were missing out on the shift.  She told me it has not been called that since I was in a nightclub back when the dinosaurs were around.  That was some sucker punch to the old ego.  Notwithstanding what it is called, the chance to swap saliva in a darkened corner of a nightclub with a sticky carpet has not been able to happen in more than a year.  The thought of someone seeking a negative antigen test before they let you near them again in a darkened corner of Copper Face Jacks is hardly the best chat-up line to look forward to.</p><p>The resilience of young people over the past year has been immense and deserves great credit.  Nothing has given me more pleasure in recent weeks than to see my own kids return to their sporting activities, be it the GAA or athletics.  Getting sport back was a big thing for us in this country because it plays such a role in our society.  The physical and psychological benefits are multiple.</p><p>There are many young people who are not involved in sport, however, and for whom the reopening of pitches had no consequence whatsoever.  For many others, the inability to meet up with friends in a social club or nightclub or to attend a live music show is equally frustrating.  The impact was felt by those whose passion and love is the performing arts and music.</p><p>We have seen countries, whether it is Spain or the UK, where live music events have come back.  I know there is a huge appetite for that to return, especially when you see other live shows being cancelled already this year.  I ask the Minister to work as closely as he can with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and others to make sure those areas in society can also reopen soon.  They are as important as the sporting world on which we place much importance.</p><p>This has been a tough year educationally.  Many have spoken about the impact on leaving certificate and junior certificate cycles this year.  Like so many other aspects of our lives, we have woken up to the reality that testing kids by a written examination on one day of their lives is pure madness.  Senator Ruane spoke passionately about this in the Seanad last Tuesday.  The reassessment of that system is very much needed.  I welcome that the Minister, Deputy Foley, said the reform process would look at this on the whole because it is badly needed.</p><p>Finally, the youngest people of all in our society are those in our childcare and early education centres.  As the Minister well knows, the mobilisation of these centres to open in order that front-line workers could get to work was a mammoth effort co-ordinated on the ground with our county childcare committees, with which the Minister tick-tacked daily and weekly.</p><p>The actions, therefore, by the Minister's Department two weeks ago to renege on a Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, agreement from November last year to pay these co-ordinators in childcare what they are worth is disgraceful.  This act was then compounded by a statement from the Department to the effect that those is the sector could pay themselves what they want but it would not fund them.  That was a double slap in the face.  Valuing those who are putting in place the structures for the early years sector and for our young children needs to start to be recognised in real terms, not with flowery language or plaudits.  An agreement has been reneged on.  It is fundamentally wrong.  I hope the Minister will look at that, pay these people what they are worth and fund it as is required.</p></speech>

It is good to get this discussion going.  Young people have borne the brunt of society's anger at certain things so many times over the past 12 months and they have been forgotten about in certain matters.</p> <p>One thing that has annoyed me is that young people have had to sacrifice so much by essentially being locked in and cooped up for the last 12 months, and then you see the valley of the squinting windows-type stuff on social media where someone with a mobile phone films a couple of young people having fun outdoors, puts it up online saying this is why we will be in level 5 forever and the horror of it all.  It is young people enjoying a level of socialisation in the outdoors.  It is not a problem whatsoever.  I find the kind of shock-horror we see from people online about it distasteful.  In reality, the only reason people put it online is they are looking for a few retweets or likes.  They are not doing it out of the kindness of their hearts.  That was one thing in the past year that annoyed me a little bit when it comes to young people.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, I had a really good discussion with young people in my county of Louth.  We had more than 100 people on a call about apprenticeships, which shows us why apprenticeships are so important for people who are aged 17, 18 and 19.  There are so many different ways of learning.  We all have a different way of learning, which is why apprenticeships are so important.  It says to people they can get equally as good a career, job and outcome by doing an apprenticeship they want to do and in which they are interested rather than perhaps going to college and learning in a different way compared with someone else.  To see that emphasis now being put back on apprenticeships and how crucial they are is really important.</p> <p>People talk about the resilience young people have shown, and we look at the leaving certificate.  I did my leaving certificate in 2009.  The biggest problem with the leaving certificate in 2009 was that a school in Drogheda handed out English paper 2 instead of English paper 1 ahead of the rest of the country.  The whole thing then had to be cancelled.  I got a C2 and did really badly in my English because I basically studied exactly what I thought the pass examination paper was going to throw up, which then snookered me when the follow-up paper was completely different.  That was the big disaster for people of my generation.  We thought that was a big deal.  If you look at it now, it was nothing whatsoever.  The resilience young people have shown, therefore, has been incredible.</p> <p>We recognise how important it is to get university students back learning on campus.  My sister, Ruth, is 20 years of age.  She is doing a three-year course in UCD and has spent 50% of her college lifetime upstairs in her bedroom doing online Zoom classes.  She is moving to Dublin next week and is so excited to be able to get back to college and learning on campus come September.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is very important for people of that generation to have the college experience.  These will be the best years of their lives when they will learn so much about themselves, get a good education and have a good time.  I am glad students are getting the opportunity to get back on campus.</p><p>The moral of this whole story, which everyone has alluded to already, is the sheer resilience young people have shown.  That is to be commended.  They are the hidden heroes of this pandemic over the last 15 months, the people who have probably had to make the greatest sacrifices.  It is grand for me and many other Senators because we do not go out at weekends and no longer have a social life.  These are kids who are in the prime of their lives and they have had a year taken from them.</p><p>Young people and sport is an issue that has been overlooked.  The ages of 17, 18 and 19 are when good players become very good.  Young people have missed out on that.  They missed 12 months where they would have been physically developing, honing their skills and getting better at their sport.  That is the difference between making it and breaking it.  We have seen so many opportunities like that denied to young people in their sporting careers.  I hope to God some will still have a good sporting career but we cannot underestimate how important the formative years of 17, 18 and 19 are in the career of a sportsperson.  It has to be acknowledged that they have missed out on so much and that society needs to give them that break.  I hope that once we get through the vaccination process and reopening is ramped up further during the summer, young people will have one hell of a party because they deserve it.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Seery Kearney on tabling this important motion.  As has been said, the contribution of young people, the effect on them of the Covid-19 pandemic and their resilience have all been remarkable.  One must consider the experiences of young people, including the leaving certificate classes of last year and this year and the college freshers who have not yet set foot in their universities.  Hopefully that will change in September.  Their contribution, commitment, resilience, tolerance and playing by the rules - because the vast majority of them have played by the rules - are remarkable and commendable.  This generation of young people will define our future in a very positive way.</p> <p>As a society, we have a responsibility to make Ireland attractive to young people.  For too long, we have seen our young professionals leave the country as soon as they qualify and gain a year's experience in employment.  We have lost thousands of medical professionals, from doctors and nurses through the whole suite of people trained in various medical disciplines, who have opted to go to other countries because of the lifestyle available, conditions of employment and so on.  They are not leaving Ireland because they are forced to do so.  They are leaving Ireland by choice.  As a society, we must look at how we can make our country attractive to these people.  I salute those who returned to help out in the pandemic when the call went out 14 or 15 months ago.</p> <p>We need to invest in youth services.  We need to significantly invest in youth clubs and youth caf&eacute;s.  This infrastructure is needed throughout the country, not only in urban areas.  Some work has been done in this regard but much of it was paused as a result of the pandemic.</p> <p>As with many other areas of society, we need to develop long-term strategic plans to support young people, particularly vulnerable young people.  Every person born in this country has rights, as Senator Seery Kearney pointed out.  In 2012, we had a referendum on children's rights.  We also had a senior Cabinet Minister with responsibility for children.  In saying that, I acknowledge the work the Minister has done since taking up his position.  It has been a baptism of fire with all of the issues he has had to deal with.  Now that things are beginning to settle a bit and he is getting comfortable in the seat, we will begin to see significant results from investment in youth services.  This will create an environment in which young people who qualify and graduate will want to stay in this country.</p> <p>It is reasonable and fair-----</p></speech>

I thank Senator Seery Kearney for bringing it forward and I thank all the Senators for their contributions.  A wide range of issues has been raised, some of which fall directly within my Department's remit while others are within the remit of my Cabinet colleagues.  I will try to address as many as I can in the time allowed.</p> <p>While it has always been the case that our young people should be supported and have their potential and contribution recognised and fostered, now more than ever, it is critical that this happens.  I have regularly spoken about what young people do for society and I have said that their contribution often passes under the radar, which is regrettable.  I have also spoken about the particular impacts the pandemic has had on young people, including the barriers to their communicating, engaging and interacting with each other which they have experienced over the past 14 months.  As such, I mention the importance of supporting them as we come out of this crisis and move past it.  I am happy, therefore, to support the motion and I will outline the work being progressed to try to address many of the challenges that are raised within it.</p> <p>The Covid-19 health emergency and its economic and social impacts have disrupted nearly all aspects of life in Ireland.  The OECD and other research bodies have noted that young people, especially vulnerable young people, have faced immediate challenges and risks in the areas of education, employment, mental health and disposable income.  Senator Keogan quoted the work of Dr. Barra Roantree from the ESRI in this area.   The research indicates that the mental health and well-being of young people have been significantly impacted and shows the possible longer term social and economic consequences of the crisis.</p> <p>As part of my Department's research partnership with the ESRI, last year we commissioned the report, The implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for policy in relation to children and young people: a research review.  This research focused on the expected impact of Covid-19 on children and young people.  It was published last July and provided early evidence of the negative long-term impacts of the pandemic.  It stated, as Senator Pauline O'Reilly noted, that these negative impacts would be felt worst by the most disadvantaged in our society.</p> <p>Subsequently, my Department commissioned a survey of young people to hear from them directly about their experiences of Covid-19, in particular about its impacts on their well-being, with a view to informing how youth services and other services across government could best respond to the needs of young people.  The results of this survey, How's Your Head? Young Voices During COVID-19, underline the experiences of many young people.  The survey found isolation, boredom, anxiety, loss of income and other difficulties.  It showed that young people miss their families and friends.  This was one of the findings that emerged most clearly from the work.  Young people expressed concerns around isolation and loneliness and about the lack of routine, education, work, money and access to services.  Interestingly, it also showed that young people who had been in a position to continue to engage with youth services were more optimistic and had a better sense of what was going to happen in the future.</p> <p>To ensure continued access to essential youth work activities during the pandemic, my Department has worked closely with youth services to ensure that young people, particularly those who are most vulnerable, continue to receive the necessary supports to the greatest degree possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Youth services continue to be delivered, either outdoors or remotely, where necessary, with strict regard to public health guidelines through outreach work, small group work and crisis intervention work.  I have continued to review and approve sector-specific guidance for youth work organisations.  We have always tried to have it as up to date and expansive as possible, mirroring the general public health restrictions in place.  We have done this in very close collaboration with the youth work sector.  The guidance has been updated in line with changes to the public health measures.  To support the delivery of necessary face-to-face supports for young people who are vulnerable, at risk or in crisis, youth service delivery has been explicitly recognised as an essential service under Covid-related regulations.</p><p>In recognition of the vital role played by youth services in providing support to young people, I have secured increased funding for the youth sector through the current challenging period.  This extra funding has enabled the youth sector to continue to provide supports to young people, particularly to marginalised, disadvantaged and vulnerable young people.  As a number of speakers have noted, a &euro;5 million increase was secured in budget 2021, which brought the overall funding profile for the provision of youth services to &euro;66.8 million nationwide.  I have said before, and I will say it again here, that it is my intention in future budgets to continue to expand the amount we spend on youth services because it is one of the best investments the Government can make.  This funding supports front-line services as they seek to innovate to continue to provide critical services to vulnerable young people.</p><p>In recognition of the particular challenges facing our country's youth, I approved a small grants scheme for youth clubs and services as a contribution towards some of the additional costs arising from Covid-19 restrictions.  Last year, I was also in the position to provide &euro;1 million in capital grants to support ICT procurement within the sector.  Even though some of these grants are quite small, on a club-by-club basis they have been strongly welcomed by the sector.  I am also conscious of the impact of Covid on funding and fundraising for youth services throughout the country.  A number of Senators raised this matter.  I will look to make the very best use of existing funds to support youth services, particularly over the summer and for the rest of the year.  I hope to be able to say more about this later in the year.</p><p>I have also committed to ensuring the voices of young people are heard and given due weight in decision-making across government.  This is a theme that emerged in many of the contributions today.  The Department is progressing these aims through the implementation of the national strategy on children and young people's participation in decision making, the establishment of a national participation office, the recent publication of a national framework for children and young people's participation in decision-making and a renewed and strengthened commitment to Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, the permanent structure for the inclusion of young people in decision-making at local and national level.  The new national framework was widely welcomed.</p><p>It is important to note that Ireland is not alone in acknowledging the detrimental impact the necessary health restrictions have had on young people.  Last week, at EU level, the Porto declaration was agreed by the European Council.  This declaration includes an action on supporting young people as part of a fair and equal recovery.  Next week, EU Ministers with responsibility for youth and other member state representatives will come together at the Education, Youth, Culture and Sports Council of the EU to discuss ways to support young people through the recovery and to mitigate the particular impacts that the pandemic has had on young people.  Research carried out at European and national level suggests that a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach must be taken to ensure that young people are not left behind as societies begin to reopen.  Likewise, a key tenet of Ireland's national youth strategy is that achieving good outcomes for young people is everyone's business.  It requires all Departments, the statutory and non-statutory sectors and wider society and communities to play their part.</p><p>I acknowledge the role played by the Ministers for Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputies Foley and Harris, and their Departments in responding to the impact of the pandemic on the young people in our education system.  The Minister for Education has formally recognised that sustaining students' engagement and progression in learning is most effectively achieved when students attend school in person.  It is also important to acknowledge that schools are important sources of social and emotional support for children and young people.  The Department of Education has put in place significant infection prevention control measures to support the safe operation of schools and to reduce the risk of coronavirus being transmitted to and within the schools.  Significant funding of almost &euro;650 million has been put in place by the Government to fund Covid-19-related measures.  These supports will ensure that schools can continue to operate safely in line with public health advice.</p><p>The National Educational Psychological Services, NEPS, developed a suite of practical resources for students, school staff and parents to support their well-being during this time.  In addition, student well-being has been supported by means of the provision of an additional 120 guidance posts at post-primary level and the continued expansion of educational psychological services to schools.</p><p>The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has taken a range of initiatives to support third level students.  In budget 2021, the Minister, Deputy Harris, secured once-off funding of nearly &euro;50 million to provide additional financial assistance in the current academic year.  This follows the doubting of the student assistance fund in 2020, increased funding for mental health supports, including &euro;2 million provided in budget 2020, an additional &euro;3 million provided as part of the 2020 Covid cost package, the introduction of a &euro;15 million fund to assist third level students access technology including laptops and devices, and additional funding for postgraduate grant holders.  I take on board the points made by Senators Ruane, Murphy and others on the issue with the pandemic unemployment payment and SUSI and I will engage with Cabinet colleagues on this.  The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has established a working group to develop a plan for the reopening of third level in September in line with public health guidelines.</p><p>A number of Senators referred to the amendments proposed.  Amendment No. 1 relates to a lowering of the voting age, something I have long supported and feel strongly about.  It is an arbitrary age to state that aged 17 and three quarters someone is not entitled to make decisions on the future of their community and our society but that at the age of 18 they assume all the necessary wisdom.  A demarcation has to be drawn somewhere but the experience of Scotland, about which Senator Warfield spoke, shows that young people and those aged under 18 are engaged and prepared to participate in the democratic process.  The Senator pointed to the constitutional barrier to voting in D&aacute;il elections.  I thought back to what I thought was a very sensible proposal in the 35th amendment in 2015 to reduce the age at which someone could run to be the President and how it was resoundingly defeated with a 73% no vote.  We are probably best to try it in European and local government elections to demonstrate the sky will not fall and then look to broaden it further.  I am very excited about the legislation being brought forward to create an electoral commission and I will certainly be looking for the electoral commission to examine this proposal because it is significant.  Having an independent body to oversee how our elections function in terms of their operation and wider questions about the electoral system is something that will be very positive.</p><p>The Independent Senators tabled a range of proposals and Senator Boyhan spoke passionately about the work of the Children's Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children's Office.  The Department has a very close relationship with both, the Ombudsman for Children as a statutory body and the Children's Rights Alliance as an alliance of NGOs.  Senator Boyhan spoke about the 2019 report of the Ombudsman for Children.  Even more recently, the report on direct provision was very critical of the treatment of children in the direct provision process and of Tusla and the International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, both of which now fall within the remit of the Department.  Since the report was given to the Department there has been substantive engagement with Tusla and IPAS.  Both bodies have stated they will respond and accept all of the recommendations coming from the Ombudsman for Children.  When the Ombudsman presented the report he commented on the fact that both bodies had fully accepted all of the recommendations and were working on them.  The Ombudsman for Children and the Children's Rights Alliance have been very much involved in the drafting of the White Paper on ending direct provision.  Senator Boyhan asked what are we saying to these groups.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I say to these groups that they have a direct impact on improving and enhancing the lives of all children in the country, particularly the most vulnerable, through their advocacy work and reporting mechanism.  I consider both as an alliance with a particular statutory function that is very important in supporting the work of my Department.</p><p>Young people have a key role in Ireland's future in the post pandemic era.  I thank them, their families and the organisations that have supported them for their ongoing efforts to support all of society during what has been an incredibly difficult 14 months.  I am continuously struck by their resilience, and other Members have spoken about the resilience of young people.  In the words of a young person taken from the "How's Your Head" survey, she said: "We are all in this pandemic together and we will come out of it together".  That is a telling statement.  From my point of view as Minister, I and my Department are committed to ensuring that sufficient supports are put in place to support young people.  Again, I thank all Senators for their in-depth contributions today.  This has been a very useful debate.</p></speech>

This is a good time to have had two hours dedicated to young people.  It is the least they deserve.  In the discussion we have highlighted their challenges, how they have overcome their challenges and how extraordinary they have been in the last year.</p> <p>I used to talk a great deal about resilience, and many community reports and so forth have the word "resilience" in their titles.  I have become very uncomfortable with it because there are some people who have not been able to demonstrate resilience and I am very sensitive to ensuring that they do not feel that there is any type of failing on their part.  This has been a real challenge.  Some people were better able to handle it than others and for those who were not, it is important that we come around and beside them and bring them forward with us so their ability to overcome the challenges of the last year is emboldened.</p> <p>As always, I loved Senator Ruane's contribution.  I want to read her thesis.  I have taught about equality.  I have always taught the idea of equality in an employment setting and in childcare settings.  The analogy I always use is the fact that I am 5 ft, 1 in. so I need a step to be able to see over a 6 ft wall.  Some people will naturally be that tall and be able to see over the wall, but others need that step.  For equality to be truly lived we must ensure that assistance is put in place for those who need it.  That needs to be in the here and now in terms of our aspiration for young people.  We must aspire for them to be anything that they want to be in the State and for them to have that opportunity.  Where somebody is born and educated should not disadvantage a person.  We should have a just society that ensures there are very directed supports to wherever young people are growing up and that we channel our funding, ideas and innovation to make sure that wherever one is, one can be whatever one wants to be.  When I kiss my daughter goodnight I say: "You are Scarlett Seery Kearney and you can be anything you want to be when you grow up".  That is the daily narrative she gets.  Every child in the State should get that aspiration.  It is important we do that.</p> <p>What I like, and what debates such as this bring out, are the things that are critical of Government.  I really love that the reports that are mainly quoted across our democracy are those that tend to come from organisations and bodies that are funded by the Government.  A true democracy funds criticism, and funds us to take analysis of ourselves.  I read the Children's Rights Alliance reports and the reports of the ombudsman.  I am a member of the joint committee on children and the Joint Committee on Disability Matters.  We analyse these things, we get disappointed and upset and we invite representatives of the bodies to speak to us.  In many cases, the people who are sitting in the room are in positions that are funded by the Government.  It does not stop them from speaking out, because we live in a democracy where at all times we need to be impassioned and emboldened to be the best we can be.  However, we never arrive.  The day when the Opposition and the Government are all saying, "We are great and we have done it really well", there will be something wrong.  We will always be championing being better and stronger.  That is very important.</p> <p>I respect the ambitions of the programme for Government.  There are great ambitions for young people.  The Minister has already more than demonstrated that he is in consultation with young people.  He is not yet a year in office, and we have come an extraordinary way.  I marvel at the publications and the consultation.  The "How's Your Head" survey was very good.  It was a good and valuable engagement, an engagement that had the integrity of being interested in the outcome and having the outcome in power.  I believe that everything is set in place to ensure we continue to listen to and embolden our young people, and that we value them in the here and now and not just what they are going to be.  That is a lesson I learned strongly from the former Senator, Jillian van Turnhout, who kept saying to me that it is not about the future, but about who they are here and now.  It is important that we listen to that.</p> <p>I thank my colleagues and the Minister.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#KKKK00300"><p>I am here this evening to address the current cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians.  It is the latest tragic chapter in a long, brutal and inhumane conflict that has taken an unspeakable human toll.</p> <p>Let me start by expressing my deep concern at the shocking levels of violence over the past week in Gaza, the West Bank and across Israel.  Now is the time for de-escalation, before even more lives are lost.  We must encourage all efforts to reach a ceasefire and beyond that, we must find a way to put an end to the repeated cycle of violence which we see over and over again. </p> <p>The scale of deaths and injuries to civilians is reprehensible.  These events are terrifying for Palestinian and Israeli civilians.  Protection of all civilians, in Gaza, the West Bank and Israel, is of paramount importance and an obligation under international humanitarian law.</p> <p>The deaths of Israeli citizens are unacceptable and I repeat my call on all factions in Gaza to halt attacks on Israel immediately.  Hamas and other militant groups must refrain from violent and provocative acts, including rockets and incendiary devices launched from Gaza into Israel, indiscriminately targeting civilian populations and infrastructure. </p> <p>Israel has a right to defend itself but this must be proportionate.  I called in the Israeli ambassador last week and conveyed, in the strongest terms, that Israel&rsquo;s actions, which are causing significant civilian casualties, are unacceptable and that Israel must act responsibly and comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law, particularly in terms of the protection of civilians.  The impact of Israeli air strikes on civilians in the Gaza Strip is clearly disproportionate.  </p> <p>The number of Palestinian civilians killed, of whom one quarter were children, flies in the face of humanity.  It is just not acceptable.  Israel must ensure its security and defence forces act in full respect for the principles of proportionality, distinction and precaution in the conduct of any operations.  Accountability needs to be transparent and ensured for the actions of the Israeli security forces.  Civilians on both sides deserve the protection of international law.</p> <p>The plight of children, in particular, is shocking.  More than 60 children have been killed in just over a week.  No child, anywhere, should have to endure the trauma of an onslaught of rockets and missiles.  All violations against children must end, including attacks, or threatened attacks, on schools.</p> <p>In the Gaza Strip, in particular, children and families have nowhere to run to escape this violence.  Unlike their Israeli neighbours, they have no bomb shelters to which to flee.  They are locked into a tiny piece of land which is 25 miles long and approximately five miles wide.  I have been there a number of times, as have others in this room.  It is densely populated, with 2.1 million people who are being bombarded night after night.  </p> <p>The trauma and damage this is doing to children, even if they are lucky enough to avoid physical injury, is hard to measure but it must stop.  Time and time again, children are a casualty of history and conflict.  They are never a legitimate target, regardless of where they are located or who is located nearby.</p> <p>Ireland has been urging the Security Council to use its voice to better effect.  The Security Council met in two closed consultation meetings last week.  After the Security Council meeting on 12 May, Ireland, together with the EU members of the council, Estonia and France, as well as Norway, issued a joint statement in which we condemned the violence robustly and urged maximum restraint in order to protect civilians in line with international humanitarian law.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I addressed the Security Council&rsquo;s open meeting on the situation yesterday.  I underlined that we need to send a clear and united message, and that the Council and its members have a responsibility to speak out.  I must say that we are very disappointed that negotiations taking place this afternoon in New York to try to find agreement on a statement have not succeeded - at least not at this time.  However, our teams are working hard to find a way to make progress.</p><p>I must put on the record that it is hard to comprehend how the UN Security Council - the body in terms of international politics that is there to prevent conflict and to respond to it when it is taking effect to bring it to an end - is unable to agree a clear joint statement on this issue.  It is not even able to make a clear statement on the protection of civilians and children or call for a ceasefire.  This afternoon the President of the UN General Assembly has convened the General Assembly on the situation, which will meet in plenary session on Thursday.</p><p>In the past week I have spoken to my counterparts in the Middle East region to underline the need to protect civilians, bring an end to this violence and move towards political engagement.  I have been in contact with the foreign ministers of Qatar, Egypt and Jordan.  However, more is needed.  The international community should and must come together to enable all efforts to reach a ceasefire immediately.  Tomorrow, I will join EU foreign ministers who are meeting virtually in extraordinary session to discuss the hostilities.  I will underline the need for strong EU engagement, both on the current hostilities and to address the root causes of this conflict, on which we have tried repeatedly to focus political attention.</p><p>I opened my remarks by noting that the events of this month are just the latest cycle in a long and brutal conflict.  These conflicts with Gaza have become cyclical, and that cycle needs to be broken by politics and better international engagement.  We cannot shy away from the root causes which have been drivers of the tensions at the Temple Mount and in East Jerusalem.  I have been forthright in expressing my concerns regarding the Israeli occupation of Palestine.  Ireland&rsquo;s position on this issue is, and will continue to be, based on international law, including Israel&rsquo;s obligations as the occupying power under the fourth Geneva Convention.  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has raised important issues in recent days, stating that a failure to adhere to the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution in the conduct of military operations amounts to a violation of international humanitarian law. </p><p>I want to speak also about the impact on journalists trying to cover this conflict.  All of us were shocked by the footage of the air strike on Saturday which destroyed media outlets in the Gaza Strip.  I condemned that air strike in the strongest terms at the Security Council yesterday.  Freedom of expression and the work of journalists must be protected, without exception.  I want to credit the essential role played by journalists and the media more generally in reporting on conflicts like this one, often at great personal danger to themselves.</p><p>I remain deeply concerned about the lack of accountability for violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory.  I support calls for independent, transparent and thorough investigations into allegations.  In this respect, I fully respect the role of the International Criminal Court and the integrity of that court and its prosecutor in carrying out important work.  </p><p>The cycle of reducing tensions when violence boils over is not enough.  I believe that proactive, firm and direct engagement is what is required, by the parties themselves, of course, but also supported strongly by the international community.</p><p>We are using our voice at the Security Council to draw attention to these issues and we will continue to speak out at this forum.   Along with our EU partners, we will continue to engage in renewed and reinvigorated international and regional efforts, which are necessary now more than ever.  As I have said repeatedly in this House, we will continue to speak out against illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory and, in particular, their expansion.  We will continue to speak out against the demolition of Palestinian homes and forced evictions in East Jerusalem.</p><p>Ireland is firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution based on international law and in the context United Nations Security Council resolutions that have been agreed.  I will continue to demand that the UN Security Council lives up to its responsibilities on the Members' behalf.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#LLLL00200"><p>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House and acknowledge the fact that he has given this issue priority of attention from the beginning of his Ministry.  It is an issue that resonates with everybody in Ireland, so it is important.</p><p>I want to begin by acknowledging the death, destruction and the horrendous events in Gaza, the West Bank and indeed in Israel and right through Jerusalem over the last number of days.  At one point, the death toll was 184 lives in Gaza and ten in Israel.  As the Minister has said, one quarter of all deaths were of children.  Whatever the current figures are, they are horrendous.  They are a blot on humanity and are to be utterly condemned.  </p><p>Health facilities have been attacked and two prominent Palestinian doctors were killed.  Roads leading to the hospitals and ambulances were shelled and destroyed.  As referenced by the Minister earlier, the al-Jalaa Tower, housing the international press and Al Jazeera was razed to the ground.  The clinic of <i>M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res </i>was destroyed and its work was thwarted in a huge way.  As has also been said, 2.5 million people have been bundled into Gaza in dreadful conditions.  Another dimension to this conflict is the fact that there is a 20% Arab-Palestinian population in Israel and there is serious civil disorder, violence and destruction there.  Last week we discussed the Ballymurphy massacre in this House.  What all of that proves is that might is not right.  It must stop.</p><p>I would like to focus on the backdrop to this conflict for a moment.  In the West Bank in 2021, 350 structures were demolished and 468 Palestinians were displaced.  In February alone, 153 properties were destroyed, displacing 305 people, including 172 children.  There has been a 65% increase this year in monthly demolitions.  Since 1967, 250 settlements have been established in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, inhabited by 650,000 settlers.  Accelerated expulsions and home demolitions are a common feature now and there has been a 25% increase in them in the last two years.  Notable examples include the expulsions and demolitions in the Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods, which have caused huge difficulty.  Some 640,000 settlers are residing in the West Bank under Israeli military control.  Israel withdrew from Gaza but maintains a blockade.  </p><p>I have set the background.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also make the point that the violence and police activity at the Al-Aqsa Mosque made for a difficult situation in the background.  The settlements are thwarting the prospect of a two-state solution as they surround Jerusalem.</p><p>The critical point is that there has been a provocative background to this violence and there is a need for something to be done.  The settlements are in violation of the fourth Geneva Convention, resolution 2234 of the UN, and on it goes.  The unemployment rate in Gaza stands at 40%.  The basic point is that the UN, the EU and the International Criminal Court, ICC, must combine to act.  As the Minister stated, we in Ireland support international law.  We condemn violence, whether it is from Hamas or the Israeli side.  Given that Israel has might on its side and considering the history and backdrop to this, and the fact that we have not established the two states, there is a particular onus on Israel to take an initiative, to be willing to come to the table and to, almost unilaterally, bring about a ceasefire.  The onus is on Israel to lead.  I am glad the Minister will meet other foreign ministers tomorrow because there is an onus on the EU to act firmly.  I hope the UN can act in concert before a few more days have passed.  It is a shame if there is dissension there.</p><p>The situation is a catalogue of destructive violence and inhumane activity.  It is a blot on our humanity and needs to stop.  Ireland needs to be at the vanguard, leading the effort to make it stop.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#MMMM00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I agree with everything he said and I agree with everything Senator Joe O'Reilly said.  I was listening this morning to our colleague, Senator Black, and she recited a poem that was written by a young woman in Gaza.  As I listened to it, and when she got to the point of being given 56 seconds or whatever it was to get out of your home and leave everything behind, I was reminded of my wife's grandfather, Joe Brennan, a founding Senator of the reconstituted Seanad in 1937.  He was given a similar notice by the commanding officer of the British forces based in Buttevant as part of martial law.  His house was blown up with an hour's notice in 1921.  It struck me, listening to the account today, that the poem Senator Black recited dealt with somebody who got out of their house.  One must think about the parents of children who did not escape and look at the hatred that is being stored up when considering all of these things.  People talk about sowing the wind and reaping the whirlwind.  This cycle must stop.</p><p>I speak as somebody who, like Senator Black, is a member of the European Parliamentarians for Israeli-Palestinian Equality, a network of people from across European parliaments and in the European Parliament who are, effectively, trying to call a halt to the annexation of the West Bank and its <i>de facto </i>absorption into a greater Israel.  I also speak as somebody who, as Minister for Justice, apologised on behalf of the Irish people for the first time for what happened in the late 1930s and, indeed, the 1940s in respect of Jewish refugees.  I initiated the State funding of Holocaust Memorial Day and the Holocaust educational trust.  I have spent a lot of time studying the Holocaust and nobody needs to impress upon me the enormity of it.  This year is the 80th anniversary of the Babi Yar ravine massacres.  That brings back to us that the Jewish people have been the subject of terrible wrongs.  However, two wrongs never make a right.  I am not going to compare what is going on now with what went on then but I will say that Gaza is a living hell and that is something which must come to an end.  Tolerating or inciting provocative marches through east Jerusalem at the end of Ramadan is comparable, in some respects, to what Oswald Mosley was doing in the East End of London in the 1930s.  They are provocative marches designed to inflame and stir up hatred.</p><p>Those of us who believe in justice for the Palestinian people in no sense deny the right of Israel to exist or defend itself.  I absolutely condemn people in Iran and elsewhere who talk about the destruction of the state of Israel.  I condemn that absolutely.  However, our opposition to what has happened this week and last week, and to what has been happening in Gaza for years, is based on a sense of human rights and decency.  It is not, in any sense, based on an anti-Israeli point of view.  I object to the efforts of some people on the right wing of Israeli politics to set a definition of anti-Semitism which somehow prevents me from articulating my opposition to what is happening on the West Bank and, effectively, puts resistance to the extreme right of Zionism into the category of implied anti-Semitism.  Nobody can lecture me on anti-Semitism.  I have done what any Minister in Ireland could ever possibly do to assist in bringing Irish people to a recognition of the wrongs that Irish society did to the Jews and to society's duty to uphold the rights of Jews.  I reiterate Eamon de Valera's great step of bringing the recognition of the Jewish population into our Constitution.  This State did that when nobody else was willing to do it.</p><p>We must protest and object to what is happening.  We must defend the rights of children, be they Israeli, Israeli-Arab, Palestinian-Arab or wherever.  We must also protect the rights of individual citizens.  The poem Senator Black read earlier evoked in me strong feelings of revulsion and pity.  This House must stand with all the other parliamentary assemblies across Europe which have stated that this must come to an end, the cycle must end, that we must stand up for what we believe in and not be afraid to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#MMMM00300"><p>The Minister is welcome.  I commend him on his strong words, comments and actions in respect of this issue to date.  He has represented Ireland very well on it.  Senator McDowell put it well when he said that Gaza is a living hell.  More than 2 million people are, essentially, being suffocated, crammed into tight spaces without basic living conditions.  They are living in conditions with which none of us would be able to live.  The ongoing escalation of violence in Gaza and the West Bank is completely abhorrent.  We have to condemn, in the strongest manner possible, in openly saying that Israel's actions have fundamentally breached Palestinian human rights.  They are in breach of international law and we must call that out and be very clear about it.</p> <p>The Taoiseach has made it clear that the Government is extremely concerned about what is happening in the Middle East and wants to see an immediate end to the violence.  We must be clear that Israel's actions are unacceptable and confrontational.  There is a reason the violence is escalating.  Even though we stress the right to peaceful protest on all sides, I think it is fair to say that Israel's actions are completely disproportionate and in no way justifiable by any means.  The events for civilians on both sides are extremely terrifying and deeply tragic for the families who have lost loved ones.  The person who wrote the poem which Senator Black read into the record this morning managed to get out alive but we have all been struck by the scenes of children who have been killed in the recent attacks being pulled from the rubble.  It would turn your stomach.  There is no justification for the killing of innocent civilians and almost a quarter of the casualties we know about are children.</p> <p>The office of the spokesperson for the Israeli army stated that the most recent attack targeted Hamas's underground military infrastructure and, as a result of the strike, the underground facility collapsed, causing the foundations of civilian houses to collapse too, leading to unintended consequences and casualties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is not good enough.  There are international obligations to prevent harm to civilians and to prevent the killing of children and innocent civilians, so to say it was an unintended casualty simply does not cut the mustard.  The UN Security Council met in a specially convened session and all foreign ministers and ambassadors have called for a ceasefire, yet nothing has happened in that regard.  There was also a call for both sides to respect international law, and again that is not happening.  There was no sign of even a temporary truce to allow the people of Gaza just to compose themselves and recover those they have lost, who are dead or potentially still alive under the collapsed buildings.</p><p>After speaking to Egypt's foreign minister, the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, wrote on Twitter that all parties need to de-escalate tensions and the violence must end immediately.  However, I must say the response from the US Administration has been disappointing, to put it mildly.  We must ask why the UN Security Council failed to reach unanimous agreement on a UN Security Council resolution wording.  We spend a lot of time in this Chamber, and in other parliaments and assemblies across Europe, dancing around the very obvious issue that we need the US to step up to the mark and deal with this.  If it does not, the UN will continue to be limited in its response and what it can do about this.  The entire world, indeed any right-thinking person across the globe, is appalled by what is going on in Gaza.  We are looking to the United Nations to address this and it is not addressing it, yet nobody is willing to call out the reason for this and that needs to be said loud and clear, namely, it is the inability or the unwillingness of the US Administration to call for a ceasefire and call on Israel to stop what it is doing.  Until the US does this, Israel will continue what it is doing and the innocent Palestinian civilians and the innocent Israeli civilians will be the ones to suffer.</p><p>In a televised address, Netanyahu said Israel's attacks were continuing at full force and would take time and that Israel wants to levy a heavy price on the Hamas military group.  He said this flanked by his defence minister and political rival, Benny Gantz, in a show of unity.  Again, this is utter defiance of the international community that they will not cease, and there is only one country that can stop this right now.  We know from current figures that just short of 200 Palestinians have lost their lives, and of those we think 58 have been children and 34 women.  This should sound alarm bells right across the international community.  It is not acceptable, it is not something we must live with and it is fine to use our words and Parliament to express our outrage, concern and disgust at all this, but until we stop the killing and the violence and see an immediate ceasefire and a meaningful pathway to true peace between both states, this is going to happen again and again and again.  More children will lose their lives, more families will be devastated and more lives will be lost.</p><p>I join colleagues in utterly condemning the attacks on buildings housing international media and then suggesting it was somehow to take out locations where Hamas was operating.  It was clearly designed and intended to try to limit international coverage of what Israel is doing in Gaza, and it probably had the opposite effect.  I thank the Minister for his time.  It has been a good opportunity for us to give our views on the floor of the House.</p></speech>

It is one  which I and many other colleagues called for last week but, very sadly, the conflict has escalated since then and, appallingly, we have seen even more killings of civilians, particularly of children, in the intervening period.  It is even more important, therefore, that we speak now about this and we support the Minister's strong words in condemning the violence, calling for a united statement from the United Nations Security Council, calling for the upholding of international law, condemning breaches of international law, and condemning in particular the illegal settlement, demolition and evictions that have been carried out by the Israeli Government.</p><p>As the Minister said and I think we all agree, civilians on both sides deserve the protection of international law.  We are conscious of the appalling plight of civilians in the overcrowded space that is Gaza, that living hell where we see 2 million people living.  Overnight, between Sunday and Monday, 54 Israeli jets took 20 minutes to bomb 35 targets largely in and around that region, an area which is so small and so tightly packed.  I think we are all clear that the targeting of civilians in this way and the killing of children, journalists and healthcare workers is a war crime, regardless of anyone's views.  Just as we condemn the targeting of civilians by Hamas, so too must we condemn the actions of the Israeli Government, which have led to such an escalation of violence and such appalling casualty figures for Palestinian civilians.</p><p>We in the Labour Party have called on Ireland and the international community to use every available diplomatic tool to bring about an end to this aggression.  We agree it is important that the Minister keep those strong words at the forefront in condemning in no uncertain terms the forcible evictions, the illegal settlements and the illegal demolitions.  We call on the Minister to continue to communicate that condemnation to his counterpart in the Israeli Government and to engage with the Palestinian ambassador to Ireland to offer the assistance of the Irish Government to her and her government in seeking a peaceful resolution to this crisis.</p><p>It is very distressing that the United Nations has not succeeded in coming together on this, that the Security Council has not come up with a united stance on this, but here in Ireland we must be strong in our continued efforts to ensure there is a peaceful resolution.  I must say it has also been disappointing to see the EU High Representative, and indeed the President of the Commission, not taking a stronger stance in support of peace in the Middle East.  As somebody who has always stood with the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, we in the Labour Party have always taken a strong position in support of the rights of the Palestinian people.  We also call for a comprehensive multilateral peace agreement between Israel and Palestine which respects international law and delivers for the Palestinian people a secure and viable state of their own but which also recognises the legitimate interests of the people of Israel to live in peace, prosperity and security with their neighbours under a two-state solution.  That is something which clearly has the support of the Irish people.</p><p>Our Government should now go further and pass into law the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 which Senator Black has been so strongly championing and which we in the Labour Party have also been supporting in both Houses and which has such strong support across both Houses.  That Bill is before the D&aacute;il, and despite the continued insistence of the Government that it is not enforceable under EU law, we think it should be.  It should be something that is now passed, which would ban imports from illegal settlements and would send out a powerful signal that international law must be respected.  It would help to support efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution in the Middle East and ensure we do not see this sort of cyclical violence the Minister spoke about and we do not have yet another <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>moment where we see the people of Gaza and throughout the Middle East living in fear and we see children speaking about hearing the screams night after night and living in fear of attacks on their homes.</p><p>We must take strong action on this.  We cannot allow this cycle to continue.  It really feels like <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>as we stand and speak about the carnage experienced by civilians and children in Gaza and condemn again the illegal settlements, evictions and demolitions.  We are all very conscious at this stage of the need to move with greater resolution through the international community, through the United Nations and through the EU to bring about peace in the Middle East.  It has been very disappointing to see the US not taking a stronger stance on this, but with our seat on the Security Council, we can really play a very important role and provide a powerful voice for a peaceful resolution.</p></speech>

It is a sensitive powder keg and the initiator, what provoked this current crisis, the lightening rod, as it were, was Israeli provocation, and that should be called out.  The Israeli response has also been entirely disproportionate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are guilty of war crimes and are in flagrant breach of and have abused international law.  </p><p>The carnage, wanton waste of life, destruction and slaughter of innocent people, particularly children, are horrendously reprehensible.  We all know that; it is well documented.  The question is what the free world will do.  We should support the Minister, whom I welcome.  He speaks for Ireland.  We have a special affinity with Palestine.  It is not anti-Israel.  We love Israel too.  We like the people but we must call out barbaric acts.  We should commend the Minister.  With the utmost respect, he is proudly affiliated with a political party that is not the first port of call for people campaigning for equality, equal rights and respect for Palestine.  We must commend and encourage the Minister.  </p><p>I heard calls from other Members at the weekend for the Israeli ambassador to be expelled.  This is not the correct move at this point for the reason cited in the Minister's speech, namely, the need for a collective and unified response.  Perhaps we should keep it in mind if it is done in a collective way but a unilateral action to expel the Israeli ambassador from Ireland would not be advisable.  At least at the moment, we have access to the ambassador and he can tell the Israeli Government our views on this. </p><p>There are a few things we could do.  I welcomed President Biden's election but he has been disappointing in this regard.  He must be told that his native home in Ireland is most disappointed with him.  I know he is not a Donald Trump.  I would be worried about the Donald but Joe Biden has let the free world down.  </p><p>The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018 has been mentioned.  In the meantime, Sadaka has said it would love to bring a motion forward and have it supported in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  This is a most measured and pragmatic response on its part that would recognise there is de facto annexation by Israel of large parts of the West Bank.  Will the Government support that small measure?  The Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill championed by Senator Black and others has been suddenly trumped.  There should be sanctions, although this should not be a unilateral action.  All members of the free world - the countries that call this out - should impose trade sanctions against Israel.  There are things we can do, although not unilaterally.  There could be trade sanctions against Israel to say enough is enough and it is not going to get away with this.  It will get away with it, however, unless we act in a tangible way.</p></speech>

In the past, Irish Governments has not been so clear and supportive so I appreciate the Minister coming out strongly on this and using the Irish voice on the UN Security Council.  I listened to the Israeli ambassador and I just do not believe him.  I think he told lies to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  With all the money, power and modern technology Israel has, it could easily avoid civilian deaths.  It is doing it so flippantly.  Israel does not value Palestinian lives and does not see them as being equal to Israeli lives.  I do not accept the ambassador's excuses.  There are no excuses.  As the Minister said, there is nowhere to go in the Gaza Strip.  It is like shooting fish in a barrel and the Israelis know that well.</p> <p>I want to distinguish between the Israeli Government and the Israeli people.  I have lots of good friends from Israel and they do not support this Israeli Government and its oppression and destruction of the Palestinian people.  I put my hand up to go and observe the elections there at the end of May but they have been cancelled.  It is great that the national media are covering this issue so much because it has been going for years.  I did a fund raiser for Palestine 17 or 18 years ago when friends of mine went there to pick olives and ended up spending the entire time throwing food up to people living in apartment blocks because the people in Gaza were not allowed to leave their homes or go to the shops.  This has been going on for years.  Now it is coming into the mainstream and people who never cared about it before care about it now.  I encourage these people to support the Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which has been in existence for many years.  We have a good group in County Clare and there are many others around the country.  </p> <p>I went out to the gates of Leinster House last week and was given this lovely mask by the Palestinian ambassador.  I would like to see her invited to appear before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence so it can hear what she has to say.  The Israeli ambassador appeared before the committee so the Palestinian ambassador deserves to be recognised and invited to appear before the committee.</p></speech>

I begin by expressing my sympathies and those of my party and our solidarity with all those who have lost their lives, particularly in the days and weeks of this latest series of incidents.</p> <p>None of us has the time to do justice to the context that is required in a debate such as this.  In the limited time afforded to me, I think it is important to lay out some of that context because the events of the past week did not happen without context.  We have laid it out in this House with the Minister in this term and the previous one.  I do not seek to be reductive but I will provide a snapshot of that context.  There is a coloniser and the colonised.  There are those who are implementing apartheid and those who suffer that apartheid.  There are those who are driving people from their homes and demolishing them and those who become refugees as a result.  There are those who build illegal separation walls and those who are forced to live behind them.  There are those who break international law and the Geneva Convention and those who are victims of these war crimes.  There are those who cry out for international support, solidarity and help and those who bomb the media outlets through which these people try to do so.  </p> <p>The Minister is in possession of this information, having said he had been to Gaza and other places.  He then asked Israel to act responsibly.  It strikes me that Israel has no desire whatsoever to act responsibly.  What this State and states throughout the world need to do is act responsibly in response to the flagrant breaches of international law by Israel and the vast slaughter carried out against the Palestinian people.  We should use the UN Security Council seat for practical outcomes, adhere to the will of the Oireachtas and recognise the state of Palestine, and, as other colleagues have said, implement the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  I do not doubt for one second the sincerity and forthrightness of the Minister's words, be they in this Chamber or the other House, but it is time he moved beyond words and took action because we owe that to the people who, as has rightly been acknowledged, are suffering, enduring and dying as we speak.</p></speech>

I have three brief quotes.  The first we heard on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; on Friday from a 23-year-old Palestinian writer who said: </p> <blockquote> 	Then the aeroplanes bombed a target, and the target was children.  I saw them.  I saw their blood.  I saw their remains, to be specific.  It was really heartbreaking to see these innocent children getting killed and getting torn into pieces. </blockquote> <p>The Palestinian foreign minister, Dr. Riyad al-Maliki, said:</p> <blockquote> 	There are no words to describe the horrors our people are enduring.  Israel is killing Palestinians in Gaza, one family at a time.  Israel is trying to uproot Palestinians from Jerusalem, expelling families, one home, one neighbourhood at a time.  Israel is persecuting our people, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Some may not want to use these words but they know they are true.   </blockquote> <p>The final quote is from the Israeli ambassador to Ireland yesterday on the &quot;News at One&quot; on RT&Eacute;.  He said &quot;the vast majority of people killed in Gaza are Hamas terrorists or Hamas members.&quot;  How does one begin to address that?  I welcome what the Minister said but I am very clear.  Words are not enough.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Palestinians with whom we have been engaging all weekend have been telling us that words are not enough.  We have an incredibly powerful voice because we are on the UN Security Council.  The Minister needs to use that voice.  He can do it very clearly by recognising the state of Palestine.  That has to happen now.  He should also recognise that we are dealing with an apartheid state.  That is incredibly important.  We must pass the occupied territories Bill.  We must stand up for the people of Palestine.  The Minister will be failing them if he does not act.  We need more than words.</p></speech>

I also thank him for the telephone call I received from him last night.  I am aware that he is extremely passionate about this issue and I know it is very close to his heart.</p><p>I want to tell the Minister about a family in Gaza.  Yesterday morning, multiple generations of the al-Kulak family, at least 17 people, were killed.  The youngest victim, Qusay al-Kulak, was six months old and the oldest, Saadia al-Kulak, was 84.  That is an entire family, a total erasure of an entire Palestinian lineage.  The Ministry of Health confirmed that 33 people were killed, including Dr. Ayman Abu al-Auf, head of internal medicine at Shifa hospital, following Israeli bombardment of their homes.  Five children were found alive under the debris.  It is just heartbreaking.  I know the Minister gets upset about this just as much as the rest of us do.  A Palestinian security source said was it was the most intense shelling since the second <i>intifada</i>, or uprising, that began in 2000.  Palestinians were stuck under the rubble overnight until emergency services were able to retrieve them.  Despite surviving the bombings, a number passed away when they were trapped under the rubble due to the delayed arrival of assistance.</p><p>For every day that passes as we witness the slaughter of Palestinians, remain silent and do not impose sanctions on the perpetrator, the State of Israel, we remain complicit. The least we could do is to fulfil our duties under international law and pass the occupied territories Bill.</p><p>I know the Minister works very hard on speaking up for the human rights of Palestinians at the EU and UN Security Council but, as others have stated, condemnation is not enough because it can be ignored.  It is only when there are consequences for Israel that it will end the discrimination and oppression.  Most EU states, including Ireland, are rightly calling for an immediate de-escalation of hostilities to save lives.  However, calling for de-escalation without any meaningful plan for what comes next is gaslighting.  Western leaders can call for de-escalation but when the fighting stops, then what?  Everything goes back to normal but normal just means institutionalised discrimination and apartheid, with widespread injustice across the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza.  Those same western leaders will accept this return to normal and move on to the next issue, refusing to take any real action or ensure accountability.  Virtually every other tactic has been tried for decades.  We have to stop Israeli oppression of the Palestinians.  The occupied territories Bill may be the first step in bringing freedom to Palestine and real peace to region.</p></speech>

We are aware of these issues and we know that the Minister spoke strongly at the UN, as did many others on the Secretary Council, but that a resolution was not passed.  There are, however, multiple previous resolutions of the Security Council.  We have testimony.  We know there have been, in contravention of the Geneva Conventions, violations of human rights and war crimes.  There has been a litany of proven and acknowledged violations of human rights.  We are not at a point where we need to indicate there might be a concern about that, we know it - it is a fact.  The debate now relates to what we do show how serious we are about those human rights violations.  We have called on Hamas and the Israeli Government to bring about a ceasefire.  What are we going to do about our obligations in respect of human rights?  I refer, for example, to our obligations in the context of the judgment of the International Court of Justice to the effect that third-party states should not recognise illegalities nor render aid or assistance in maintaining them.  Can we do more there?  What are the proposals for how we can do more to ensure that we do not give sanction, give permission indirectly or give a message of impunity with respect to these violations?</p> <p>On the occupied territories Bill, if the Minister will not publish the advice of the Attorney General, will he explain in great detail to us exactly what are the obstacles?  For example, does the Attorney General's advice reflect the ruling in the Rosneft case last year whereby the European Court of Justice said that public policy is a grounds for the imposition of sanctions?  That was the case regarding Russia and Crimea and it is the case now.  Will the Minister also publish detailed responses to the legal opinions we have put forward?  It is not enough to simply say that it may be illegal or not.  If we are passionate about international law, I want the Minister to tease out in detail for us how he is trying to find solutions if there are constitutional concerns about any part of the occupied territories Bill, to publish ideas about how we can bring it forward and to tell us what we are doing, in the context of customs, to ensure that no person in Ireland will be indirectly put in a position of supporting illegal settlements and the inhumanity attaching to them.  How can we fully confident about that?</p> <p>At EU level, the message from President von der Leyen was not strong.  I want to know that Europe is strong about this.  Persuasion is a great power Ireland has but we also need to show leadership through action.  We have the capacity to do that.  Please follow through.</p></speech>

I listened carefully to what the Minister said.  While I do not doubt the sincerity of his words for one moment, I was concerned to hear him say that the UN Security Council was unable to issue a clear statement regarding the conflict, not even in terms of calling for a ceasefire.  What are we about and what is the UN Security Council about if it cannot even do that?</p><p>Many years ago in the late 1980s, I spent a number of months in Israel working on a kibbutz located between Ashkelon and the Gaza Strip.  It was about six miles form the Gaza Strip.  A number of Palestinians worked in the kibbutz I was based in.  I worked closely with them.  We worked in a pardes, which is a citrus fruit orchard, and we became very solid friends.  I spent many afternoons and evenings in their homes, playing with their children, listening to their stories and speaking about Northern Ireland.  They were incredibly informed about the conflict in Northern Ireland and they likened it to the situation that was happening - and continues to happen - in Palestine and Israel.  I remember all the contradictions at the time.  I could not understand being in Bethlehem in the West Bank on Christmas Eve - when people were celebrating Christianity and being Christian to one another - seeing all the snipers on the roofs with their guns and then speaking to people from that land who were not allowed into Manger Square in their own space.  I remember being at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem and the people I was with were not allowed to go to the Wailing Wall because of cultural differences.  I also remember in 1990s when the breakthrough agreement came, which was negotiated by the leaders in Oslo, and the real hope that there was that we were finally on a mutually negotiated pathway to peace.  While there was initial promise and progress, that dissipated.</p><p>I do not know if any of those present have read Colum McCann's book <i>Apeirogon</i>.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I read it a number of months ago.  The word "apeirogon" means "many different sides to every story".  It was a word he came across when he was writing about Northern Ireland and George Mitchell.  He wrote this incredible book having gone to Palestine and Israel where he had the opportunity to speak to two dads, Rami and Bassam.  One was Palestinian and the other Israeli, and they were united in grief over the loss of their daughters.  They felt that if they started telling their story, the world would listen.  He documented, in the most incredible way, their story of loss, heartbreak and grief and tried to unite their story in such a way that people could perhaps learn from their loss.  They weaponised, to a certain extent, the force of their grief to tell the world about the loss of their two daughters, Smadar and Abir. </p><p>In less than a week, 60 more fathers have lost their Smadars and Abirs, with that weight of grief and loss.  Today, we heard about 50 airstrikes.  We know four hospitals and 60 schools have been destroyed, aside from the press buildings and journalists who lost their lives.  Many of us have heard the stories emerging over the past few weeks on social media.  The most recent and notable is the video of a young Palestinian boy running through a crowd of war-torn men screaming for his father.  When he got the front of the crowd we saw the funeral procession was for his father.  The pain and sorrow the boy emoted forced every global citizen in the world to look at and live through that excruciating experience with him.  We learned that the young boy was killed the following day.</p><p>We need to send a very clear and united message that the cycle of violence and bloodshed needs to end now and we need to show huge solidarity.  I commend Senator Black on all of the work she continues to do on this.</p></speech>

I have had the privilege of visiting Israel on 14 or 15 occasions over the past 20 years.  I remember the first time I visited I got a bus from Tel Aviv to Cairo through Gaza City and Rafah at the border during the <i>intifada</i>.  It is so different.  It seems that we have travelled so far backwards since then.  As Irish people we, to a certain extent, understand more than many other countries conflict, different traditions and how people can hate one another in real terms.</p><p>I have been in Gaza City when sound bombs were flown in by the Israeli Defense Forces.  They flew in at the speed of sound at low altitudes, shattering windows, causing miscarriages, waking people up in the middle of the night and scaring the life out of them because they thought they were being bombed when in fact it is just a sonic boom.  I have had stones thrown at me in Hebron.  I have also sat around tables in West Jerusalem with ordinary decent Israeli citizens and broken bread with them on Shabbat.  I have sat in settlements with people I consider less than decent citizens and argued the toss with them on their illegal occupation of Palestinian lands.  I have stood refugee camps in places like Nablus. </p><p>I have seen this from both sides.  There are of course parallels with our own troubles on this island, yet it is so far away from what we have experienced.  In recent days Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested Palestinians actually celebrate when they are bombed because they can say that the world community will come out and get behind them and that the world community supports Palestine.  To me, that demonstrates a flippancy that is totally inappropriate given what is happening at the moment and shows an absolute lack of understanding about how the world sees this.  If the world was behind Palestine, Israel would not be part of the international community.  It would instead be relegated to a small part of the world that is subject to sanctions, but it is not. </p><p>I do not think that is our fault; it is primarily the fault of the United States which continues to supply Israel with military aid, trade and investment.  Whatever about that, when the Israeli state says things like &quot;Everybody is against us, it is so unfair, it is desperate how the world thinks&quot;, one has to ask why on earth it thinks that.  When it bombs media buildings in Gaza, hospitals and homes, and every time there is an outbreak of conflict in this part of the world the number and proportion of casualties between the two sides is in the region of a factor of ten, one would wonder why it thinks people would not be appalled by its behaviour.  </p><p>I do not think the answer is always to say how awful is Israel and how much it breaches international law and behaves in a way that is totally unreasonable.  Yet, when one looks at the situation one has to say, without ever taking sides, that all of the might and military power is on one side and, therefore, all of the responsibility is to be born by Israel.  When it reacts disproportionately, which is what it does time and again, it spends its international capital.  God knows, there are communities in this country and throughout the world that want to support the Israeli state and the Jewish state and the right of Israel to exist.  We all recognise that.  The problem is that Israel spends that capital every time it flies bombs into Gaza with only seconds of warning for people to get out of buildings.  We can see the effect of that in the casualties that have been reported. </p><p>I deeply respect the commitment of the Minister to this issue and the fact he has spoken strongly on it.  We as a nation must do that and stand up to these abuses.  It is not an anti-Israel position; rather, it is an anti-Israeli behaviour position.  I speak to friends on both sides of this debate.  The people who are pro-Israel tell me I am anti-Semitic to be as pro-Palestine as I am.  I am not anti-Semitic.  I am an enormous fan of the Jewish nation and have friends who live in Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities in Israel who are Israeli and Jewish, but there is a distinction between those ordinary, decent people who do not support this activity and the Israeli Defense Forces and state that continue to overstep the mark of reason, go beyond what is proportionate, spend their reputation and throw it down the drain. </p><p>It is not anti-Semitic to oppose Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.  It is not anti-Semitic to oppose the killing of innocents in places like Gaza.  That is not anti-Semitic; it is reasonable and respecting our international obligations and role as a member of the international community to call out exactly this kind of activity.  I praise the Minister for doing so and hope he will continue to do so.  I hope he will use our diplomatic might to do so at the highest level throughout the world.</p></speech>

I agree with the views expressed by most of my colleagues.  What is needed is more than just words.  The full might and pressure of the international community is needed to ensure there is a de-escalation.</p> <p>Following on from Senator Ward's points, Ireland is friends with Palestine but we also want to be friends with Israel.  I am concerned about some of the message going out to the effect that we are trying to alienate Israel completely.  We want to be friends with Israel but friends are people and individuals who tell home truths.  In the Jewish religion there is an enormous value placed on truth, as there is on peace and compassion. </p> <p>Israel has a right to defend itself but, as the Minister said, it must be proportionate.  Clearly, in this case the actions of Israel are not proportionate and Israel is not behaving appropriately and is breaching international law.  I share Senator Ward's concerns around the conflation of Israel and Judaism, something Senator McDowell also mentioned.  To oppose the actions of Israel is not anti-Semitic.  That point has to be made very clear.  I acknowledge anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe and Ireland, and we need to take a strong stance against it.  It is appalling and wrong.  Expressing concern and, indeed, anger about the actions of the Israeli Government, however, is not anti-Semitic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This country has always favoured a two-state solution.  We need to continue contributing and campaigning wherever we can to ensure that happens.  This is also a test of Irish foreign policy.  I have never believed that Irish foreign policy is neutral or should be neutral.  Irish foreign policy is non-aligned.  When it comes to issues of human rights, the protection of civil liberties and the protection of lives, we cannot be neutral.  The Minister must use that voice as much as he possibly can.</p><p>The Jewish people, probably more than most, should know about the history of dispossession.  Senator McDowell mentioned the Holocaust, but we should also remember the Jewish people suffered centuries of pogroms.  They were dispossessed of their lands all over the world.  The state of Israel, more than any other, should understand dispossession and the harm it causes. </p><p>What can we do in the long run?  The danger is this is just a cycle.  We keep hearing the same things again and again.  We can exert whatever power we have at UN and EU level but let us also see whether there are practical measures we can adopt.  Are there things we as a country or as individuals can do to help?  I was struck by Senator Ward talking about dialogue between different groups.  One of the things we learned during the peace process, and which is still so important, is bringing together people of different traditions to talk and share ideas.  Yes, there will be conflict but bringing people into a room is important.  We should do whatever we can to bring young Israelis and young Palestinians together, to talk not just about political issues but about other things they have in common.  If we have learned anything on this island it is that peace is achieved through dialogue and engagement.  I ask the Minister to consider sponsoring programmes that encourage engagement among young Palestinians and young Israelis.  Having that engagement among young people over a long number of years certainly benefited the peace process here.  That is something to which we can contribute in building a long-term solution to the conflict in the Middle East.  I ask the Minister to consider that.</p></speech>

I do not pretend to know as much about this conflict as others in the Chamber today, and I would not suggest otherwise, but I do understand the feeling of seeing children being blown to pieces and families searching for their children or their loved ones, as well as the pain one sees in communities.  There is nothing you can say that can truly explain the sense of loss of the community within Palestine.  I commend what the Minister said at the weekend and his strong words on behalf of the Irish people.  It is frustrating there is no joined-up communication from the UN Security Council or from America in particular and that they do not feel the need to speak as strongly as the Minister has for the Irish State.</p> <p>As many other Senators have said, it seems this issue just rolls around every few months and there is no solution.  We need to talk about what we can do going forward.  As people from a country where there has been very severe conflict, surely there must be a way of achieving peace in the future.  As a country with a strong voice on the world stage, it is important we use it as much as we can and as strongly as we can because we do have that strong voice.  I echo the comments of everyone else in their support for the people of Palestine.</p></speech>

As a Government colleague and a party colleague I wish to express my pride in how he has represented our country and spoken on its behalf on the international stage.  Since he gave his speech here I have received messages asking me to convey thanks and pride to him.</p> <p>We need to speak out strongly and convey our horror and how appalled we are that there are children and families in such situations, particularly those described by Senator Black.  I once worked in Chicago during an air show where an F16 flew over us and we experienced a sonic boom.  For people to have that experience in a conflict zone when they fear their children and their home will be bombed and their family wiped out must be extraordinary.  It was frightening in a friendly situation so that must be horrific.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile listed the types of people involved in such conflicts.  I would add there are also those who think their conflict justifies the murder of innocent civilians and term it collateral damage of a justifiable conflict.  There is no such thing.  There is no justification for the murder of children.  Anyone who deploys a bomb of any sort from either side with the view that on the other end of it innocent civilians and children are going to die is abhorrent and can only be condemned in the most absolute of terms.</p> <p>When trying to get young people to talk about their sense of obligation to humanitarian rights, we often use an ice breaker.  We tell the young people that a child has been left on their doorstep and ask them if they would go out to school in the morning or if it would disrupt their day.  The young people say they would not go to school and would have to call the Garda.  They go into all the things they would do if they saw a child abandoned and in a difficult position.  That is then widened out and they are told there are children in different conflict zones, such as the occupied territories, in that abhorrent position at this moment in time.  It is horrific and we stand in condemnation of it.</p></speech>

First, I express my sincere condolences to the families of the dead, and I include people on both sides of the border in that.  It is important to recognise loss is loss no matter the geography, age or religion.  However, we are not talking about equal partners in destruction, occupation or violence when we speak about the Israeli occupation and apartheid regime in Palestine.  The state of Israel has deployed air strikes in residential areas, attacked a building housing the offices of an international news agency and driven families from their homes.  I cannot stand up in this Chamber having seen the footage over recent days and describe it as anything other than bombardment.  That has been echoed by many people in the Chamber today.</p> <p>There are political, cultural and religious sensitivities to this decades-long conflict.  I do not even like to use the word "conflict" because that implies there is an equal balance of power and I do not think there is.  Let me be clear that my motivations for speaking today are driven by a commitment to peace and a belief in the power of people to learn to live side by side in a respectful manner in which we all fulfil our duty to one another as humans.  We have a duty to show each other love and understanding, to be fair, compassionate and open, and to ensure peace for ourselves as well as for children, the elderly, the sick and the next generation.</p> <p>As a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement I am privileged to hear weekly from those in Northern Ireland who lived through the Troubles and worked with the communities on both sides over recent years.  Their voices have been ringing in my ears and I would suggest they were ringing in many people's ears over the past week as we watched what has been unfolding.  Those people speak of channels of communication, of shared pain and joy, of a culture, community and identity which are not polar ends of a spectrum but rather two sides of one coin.  Peace on our own island no doubt often felt as unlikely and as far outside the reach of the peacemakers in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s as it does today for those living through this hellish experience in Palestine.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Yet even in a place so fraught and divided, there is always hope for peace.  So many countries stand in solidarity with Palestine because they are informed by their own history and experiences of oppression and their own struggles for freedom from a colonising or oppressing force.  We know oppression when we see it and we stand in solidarity with Palestine because it would be a dishonour to those who fought for our own freedom not to do so.  <br/><br/>Change, however, comes more often through external influences.  Senator Black put it frankly and accurately this morning when she mentioned Ireland's response to apartheid in South Africa.  I also welcome the Minister's comments in recent days when he acknowledged that the UN Security Council cannot jointly agree to condemn the slaughter of children who, he rightly pointed out, are never a legitimate target.  We really have reached a very sorry and fearful crossroads in international diplomacy.  When the Palestinian Minister for Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, Dr. Riyad al-Maliki, addressed the UN Security Council on 16 May 2021 he asked:</p><blockquote>	What are the tools the international community is ready to deploy to ensure compliance by Israel with its obligations and an end of its occupation, tools it uses regularly in other conflicts?  Military intervention?  Sanctions?  Suspending bilateral relations?  Prosecuting perpetrators of crimes?  Deploying protection forces?  Imposing an arms embargo? Or will it simply rely on the possibility of convincing the occupying Power to end its colonial occupation while history has proven that Israel is not willing to listen?  </blockquote><p>The time for rhetoric and statements is long past.  Action, solidarity and a collective response in the face of violence, oppression and human rights abuses are the avenue we must head down if we want to use our position as a UN Security Council member and leading member of a small group of neutral, peacekeeping nations in the world to the utmost effect.  I ask the Minister to ensure that Ireland's response is the right one, befitting the Palestinian people who are suffering unduly.</p></speech>

I now invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#SSSS00300"><p>I thank all Senators for their remarks.  I share their condemnation of the civilian deaths over the past week and, in particular, the child casualties.  Senators have raised several points that I would like to address but first I must say that it is clear that the more than 2 million people living in the Gaza Strip cannot endure another war.  They have suffered far too much for too long already.  The years of the illegal blockade have resulted in extreme hardship, including poverty and food insecurity.  Repeated cycles of violence and now the Covid-19 pandemic have further eroded coping mechanisms, leading to a mental health crisis which particularly impacts women and children.  Civilians in Gaza simply have nowhere to flee.  They are a population under siege, not just now in the midst of this cycle of violence, but constantly for a long period.</p> <p>I would like to address some of the points raised regarding the civilian impacts in the Gaza Strip, where this latest escalation risks worsening an already poor humanitarian situation.  Israel, as an occupying power, is duty-bound to ensure unimpeded access to humanitarian assistance.  Humanitarian access to the Gaza Strip must be ensured, especially through the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings.  The UN and its humanitarian partners must be permitted to bring in vital food, fuel and medical supplies and to deploy humanitarian personnel.</p> <p>Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip may be targeted at terrorists but the damage to homes, schools, hospitals and basic facilities for the people of Gaza is undeniable and cannot be ignored.  I am very concerned that UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, buildings have been damaged during the military operations in Gaza.  UNRWA plays a vital humanitarian role in Gaza.  It needs to be protected and never targeted.  According to the UN, 41 educational facilities in Gaza have been damaged, 36 of which are schools.  Over 500,000 school-age children in Gaza have been affected by the conflict, half of whom attend UNRWA schools.  The damage to UNRWA school buildings is deeply concerning.</p> <p>I have seen for myself, on visits to Gaza, the importance that families attach to their children's education.  I have spoken to many pupils in these schools and heard their stories in English, illustrating the quality of education that is provided.  Every child has a right to education but in Gaza school means so much more to these children.  It is their chance to escape the grim reality of their daily existence, a chance for them to shape their future and dream of an escape from the desperate cycle that they live in.  At the moment, these schools are also providing shelter for over 40,000 internally displaced persons.  They must be protected in line with obligations under international law and no threat to an UNRWA facility or UNRWA school is acceptable.</p> <p>I pay particular tribute to the dedicated staff of UNRWA and other agencies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, the Red Crescent and various NGOs, who continue to provide critical services and support, even in the most harrowing of circumstances.  </p> <p>While much of the focus today is rightly on the violence and tension we are seeing in Gaza, the West Bank and in Israel too, we cannot and must not shy away from the enabling factors in all of this, namely, Israel's continued strategy of expanding settlements and the discriminatory practices by Israeli authorities against Palestinians.  That is not an anti-Israeli statement but a statement expressing concern and criticism of Israeli Government policy, which is a different thing.</p> <p>Ireland has consistently and strongly opposed settlements and will continue to do so.  I am very clear on the illegality of Israel's settlement policy, which can only be seen as a strategy to take possession of Palestinian lands.  It is fundamentally undermining a two-state solution with every month that passes and a future, viable Palestinian state.  Actions such as the construction and expansion of settlements and the unnecessary destruction of Palestinian property are unlawful under international humanitarian law.  Repressive, discriminatory and provocative policies and actions take us further away than ever from the prospect of achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace through negotiation and from equality of esteem, which is necessary to achieve the agreement that we seek.  </p> <p>It is hard to deny that what we see on the ground, in particular the impact of settlement policy, is tantamount to de facto annexation.  Elsewhere, the position is equally worrying.  There is no real prospect of political talks resuming any time soon; let us not cod ourselves.  There is an absence that undermines faith in political action as a way forward.  The postponement of Palestinian elections adds to this and I am particularly concerned that an entire generation of Palestinians has not yet had a chance to exercise their democratic rights.  These frustrations are evident in the unrest across the West Bank in recent days.  I have raised these issues in my contacts with the Israeli Government and with the Palestinian leadership.  I will be speaking to my EU counterparts tomorrow at an emergency Foreign Affairs Council and will be pushing for an EU response of substance.</p> <p>I hear Senators' calls for action and I assure them that I have been assiduous in my efforts over the past week.  I will continue to support all efforts to reach a ceasefire in response to the current hostilities but also to encourage a reinvigorated engagement by the international community to restart political engagement and a process of peaceful resolution.  We cannot return to business as usual after this.  This is the fear that so many Senators have outlined but that is simply no longer a credible political option.  We cannot return to the flouting of international law, with the expansion of illegal settlements into occupied Palestinian territory, making a two-state solution an ever more remote possibility.  We cannot see a return to forced evictions of Palestinians from their homes in East Jerusalem and other parts of the West Bank and we cannot return to the demolition of Palestinian property, settler violence and intimidation.  We must acknowledge that these actions, occurring at an unacceptable rate for many years, are a source of legitimate grievance among the Palestinian people and undermine the prospects for peace and reconciliation.</p> <p>Senator McDowell spoke about the consequences, in a post-conflict situation, of the emotion and hatred that are generated by the loss of life and injury.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It makes peacemaking so much more difficult and more painful.  The violence must stop.  The indiscriminate targeting of civilians must stop.  Rockets must stop.  Progress requires dialogue, and ultimately there can be no substitute for direct negotiations between the two parties.  It is time to look afresh at how we can assist Israelis and Palestinians to bring new momentum to resolving this conflict, but I do not believe that anybody is overly optimistic at this stage.</p><p>Let me conclude by stating my commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.  I have been asked to consider introducing the occupied territories Bill again.  I spoke to Senator Black last night.  It was a conversation we have had before but it was slightly more emotive last night given what we are seeing on our television screens and, certainly from my perspective, the reports I am getting from our teams in Ramallah and Tel Aviv.  My focus is on trying to make things happen on an international stage that can put pressure on to move from violence into a cycle of negotiation.  I will use all the tools that I can legally and credibly use to do this.  I understand the frustrations with the lack of progress with the occupied territories Bill but I must be honest too.  Two Attorneys General have given me very clear advice on what is EU competence and what is not.  I must be honest that do not believe we can progress the Bill in a legally sound way.  There are many other things we can do, however, and I look forward to working with the Senators on those.</p></speech>

It has increased the age of the average first-time buyer by almost a decade to 35 years of age.  Ireland has plummeted from a world leader to below the EU average rate of home ownership.  For an entire generation, owning their own home is slipping through their fingers as they pay unprecedented levels of rent or as they live longer in their parents' homes.  A generation is caught in an unaffordable rent trap.  The recent Maynooth housing controversy has underlined the scale of that challenge.</p> <p>We must put in place the legislative buildings blocks of a new approach to the crisis, one which puts home ownership back on the table for a generation that has been smothered by rising rents and job uncertainty.  Failing to do that will open the door to the disastrous populism and Trump-style hysteria that has sadly characterised much of politics across the globe.  This housing crisis is not about one party or one Government; it is about giving a whole generation hope and investing in the future of our democracy.</p> <p>The Affordable Housing Bill 2021 is a very important step in rising to that challenge.  It places the legislative foundations for the State to put bricks and mortar in the ground to tackle the housing crisis directly.  I firmly believe home ownership is good for individuals, good for families, good for communities and good for the State.  With this in mind I have put affordability and the chance to own your own home at the heart of our housing policy.  This Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 are going through the Oireachtas simultaneously and will work in tandem to give people the opportunity of home ownership.  These two landmark pieces of legislation are backed up by the largest housing budget in the history of the State and our most ambitious social housing targets on record.  Combined, this represents a major step change in our housing policy that mobilises both the public and private sectors.</p> <p>The Affordable Housing Bill 2021 has four key elements.  It will be the first local authority-led, direct build affordable homes on State lands in more than a decade and our first ever national cost rental scheme. It will also provide for an innovative shared equity scheme.  It will expand Part V by designating units for first-time buyers.  This element will be brought in on Committee Stage of the Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann following the conclusion of further work I am doing with the Attorney General and with final Cabinet approval.</p> <p>The roll-out of local authority-led, direct build affordable housing will be the central plank of the Government's affordable housing plan.  Units will range from &euro;160,000 to &euro;310,000.  I am working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, to reform the serviced sites fund to ensure it can effectively fund major delivery.  The upcoming housing for all plan, which will be published this summer, will set out the ambitious range of targets throughout the State over the coming years.</p> <p>Shared equity will involve the State bridging the affordability gap by taking an equity stake of up to 20% between an individual's mortgage limits and the price of the unit.  It will work in conjunction with the help-to-buy scheme to get people into homes this year.  It will help to turn generation rent into a generation that can buy their own home.  With regard to shared equity, I will address legitimate concerns but also tackle some of the opportunistic and unfounded criticisms around a particular aspect of the Bill to dispel any uncertainty and to tackle deliberate misinformation directly.  Because of the Opposition's hesitancy to acknowledge it is broadly supportive of most of the measures contained in the Bill - the local authority direct build affordable homes, the expansion of Part V, and a new form of cost rental - a particular intentionally distracting focus has been paid to the affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  I intend this scheme to be a short-term, targeted measure as part of a much broader multifaceted approach to increasing housing supply and affordability.  It will increase viability and generate supply to provide an immediate boost to first-time buyers for new homes.  It has been developed in close consultation with relevant Departments, housing delivery partners, international comparator bodies and other key stakeholders.</p> <p>We have examined and assessed the impact of similar schemes in other jurisdictions, including in England, learning from experience in developing a scheme that is unique to the Irish market.  The English scheme has supported 250,000 home purchases.  An independent assessment concluded it has met its twin objectives of increasing supply and increasing home ownership.  The UK's National Audit Office's independent analysis found it increased supply by 14% and increased purchase prices by less than 1% on a like-for-like basis.  Some in Opposition have cited claims that inflation in the UK was rampant.  The National Audit Office acknowledged there were higher inflationary figures circulating in the public domain and investigated this.  Its analysis said "We found that these estimates do not compare similar properties and so do not accurately assess any additional premium paid by those using the scheme".</p> <p>Taking on board legitimate concerns, safeguards are being built in to tailor eligibility to meet individual affordability needs only and to manage prices through area-based price ceilings.  The price ceilings are based on real data, which are the CSO-recorded median prices of new first-time buyer homes sold in each area.  This means developers will build homes in the lower half of the price distribution.  I am happy to confirm this will be an equity product.  It will explicitly not be a second mortgage, as claimed by some in the beginning when this scheme was launched.  It will not compel homeowners to borrow more than they can afford.</p> <p>I am pleased the provision of cost rental has been widely welcomed by a range of political and research groups.  It will involve rents of at least 25% below market rates and generally 30% below market rates.  This is an entirely new form of tenure and an exciting departure for housing in Ireland.  I want to correct any suggestion that the inclusion of a limited return on equity is equivalent to allowing the private sector to generate large profits.  That is the very opposite of what we are trying to achieve for this new sector.  Rents in cost rental schemes will only ever cover the cost of providing the homes.  This includes the repayment of the loans and the interest accruing on them, as well as a modest return on any money invested directly in the homes, which will be capped.  A limited return on equity of between 3.5% and 5% is permitted under the exemplar Austrian cost rental model, which we are seeking to emulate in Ireland.  This allows for any private providers of cost rental homes, for instance, large institutional pension funds, to make a modest return on any of their own funds they spend building cost rental homes, which can then be reinvested in future projects.  It will also allow the Land Development Agency to participate at scale in the delivery of cost rental schemes.  It is important to note that cost rental has been discussed for a number of years to give a new option to working people.  The Government will be delivering it within one year of it coming to office.  It is very significant in that regard.  I hope we will have cross-party for this Bill and for these measures.</p> <p>I turn to Part V and first-time buyers.  I intend to bring forward further changes to strengthen this Bill on Committee Stage.  This will include expanding Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, and designating a range of units for first-time buyers.  Work is under way right now with the Attorney General to bring these amendments forward to level the playing pitch further for first-time buyers, which is an absolute priority for me and for the Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are in the middle of a national housing crisis and faced with such an emergency we need to use all the tools at our disposal to address this challenge across both the private and public sectors.

Access to secure affordable housing is one of the most immediate and urgent challenges facing young people, modest income earners, workers and families in Ireland today.  The Minister and the Government recognise that fact.  The Minister also recognises that over the past ten years housing supply dropped, house prices inflated and homelessness exploded.  I commend him and the Government for all of the actions they have taken to date.</p> <p>The cost of renting and the buying of homes have increased by more than 40% since 2016 yet at the same time housing supply has plummeted.  So we have a real crisis of both affordability and supply.  That crisis is real, urgent and undermines citizens, society, the economy and our future.  The urgency and timeliness of this legislation could not be more pressing.</p> <p>The Minister and the Government's affordable housing plan recognises, I guess, the market's failure to deliver affordable housing.  The plan is designed so that the State will take a lead in the provision of affordable housing.  It will have the State take a lead in the provision of affordable housing and the increased supply of affordable housing.</p> <p>We support the Affordable Housing Bill.  We support the State taking this lead to help people on modest incomes and people who earn above the social income thresholds yet who are still priced out of owning their own home or just renting an affordable home.  For the first time in a decade, as the Minister has said, local authorities will be empowered to build affordable homes both to purchase and rent on public land.</p> <p>As the Minister has said, affordable homes that start at a price of &euro;160,000 will introduce for the first time in the history of the State, and this has been talked about for years, affordable cost-rental homes.  These are affordable cost-rental homes where renters have security of tenure, affordable rents and only pay rents for the construction and management of their homes.</p> <p>The proposal to double, at a minimum, social and affordable housing that will be provided in every private development is welcome and to be supported.  The proposed amendment to ring-fence a percentage of all new developments for first-time buyers will be supported also.  The short-term measure where the State provides financial support to renters who pay more for rent than they would on a mortgage to secure their own affordable home is very welcome.  I agree with the Minister that the issue has been distorted and misrepresented.  I can tell him that I have been contacted by people who have been saving who pay more in rent than they would on a mortgage and welcome the Government's financial support to enable them to acquire their own home.</p> <p>The Affordable Housing Bill will empower local authorities and get them back building homes in addition to their significant social housing building programme.  There is the affordable housing element for local authorities to partner with the Land Development Agency.  There is the establishment of the Land Development Agency on a statutory footing to manage public land so it is maximised for the delivery of affordable homes.  That is to be welcomed.  There is a combination of those two pieces of legislation with ambitious budgets.  With budgets of &euro;3.3 billion for the housing budget and &euro;2.5 billion for the Land Development Agency, that is a significant financial power being invested by the State to deliver affordable homes both to purchase and to rent for people on modest incomes who work hard, pay their taxes and deserve to have secure affordable homes.</p> <p>It is right that the State uses every available asset to support people.  It is right that a combination of the Affordable Housing Bill, the Land Development Agency and the budgets will provide affordable homes for decades to come if this legislation is passed.  For generations to come the legislation will restore home ownership and affordable home ownership.</p> <p>The cost of land is a significant portion of the cost of a home.  We all know this.  We are going to use State-owned land to reduce the cost of providing homes.  We will legislate then for affordable purchase and rental.  We will control the use of that land and the value of the land.  It has been said that it is the greatest land devaluation in the history of the State.  That is taking place for a reason.  It is taking place to invest in providing citizens with homes and to invest in communities, society and the economy.</p> <p>The shared equity loan scheme shows a real commitment in the short term.  We all know there has been a decade of undersupply of housing.  We all know that there is no magic quantum of housing available to be built overnight.  It takes time to plan, design and build.  We know that the 35,000 housing target will be met by this Government over time.  We also know that today there are 80,000 permissions granted for private housing that are unaffordable because of the cost of construction and private land, combined with the current bank lending rules.  The shared equity loan scheme will bridge that gap for people who pay more in rent than they would on a mortgage.  The scheme will allow them secure an affordable mortgage and allow the State to invest in their homes with them.  It will also stimulate construction that is so desperately needed.  If we all believe sincerely that we want to tackle the housing crisis then we need to use every single available tool to do so.  There is no one silver bullet and no quick fix.  In addition, people have waited too long.  The urgency and need for modest income earners to know that they can have a secure and affordable home is real.  They cannot tolerate any further delay.</p> <p>Covid-19 has compounded the crisis of both affordability and supply.  During Covid-19 we all recognised the real value of having a secure home and having some place safe to go for protection.  That is not a luxury and should be a basic human right.  That should be an essential human requirement.  It is right that the State is taking this action.  It is right that the plan is ambitious, radical and that we are going to combine it with the funding and the urgency to deliver.</p> <p>We have all worked collectively to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic.  I urge every Member of this House and the D&aacute;il to work collectively.  We all know and recognise that there is a housing crisis - a crisis of affordability and supply.  If we want to really address that crisis and deliver for citizens then we need to support this affordable housing legislation that will see local authorities build affordable homes on public lands, both to purchase and rent, provide affordable cost-rental homes, double the allocation for social and affordable homes in every private development and, most importantly, in the short term provide financial support so that all of our citizens can move on and have a secure and affordable place to call home.</p></speech>

There was Rebuilding Ireland, which is still Government policy.  I contacted the Department today to confirm that.  While I acknowledge that the Minister is now playing a new policy, that is the reality.<br/><br/>I thank the Minister for comprehensively outlining the Bill.  It is regrettable that the Government has not adopted a working definition of affordability based on disposable income.  In order for home ownership to be made feasible, affordability must be tied to income, not the market.  We hear all sorts of talk, such as the cap of &euro;450,000 for a property in Dublin city or D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, where I live.  The Central Bank rules, however, allow for up to 3.5 times a person's income.  Not everyone is living on a combined income.  There seems to be an expectation that someone has to live with someone else, on two incomes, when we work out the cost to pay.<br/><br/>The Minister is correct that it is about supply and affordability, whether someone is renting or buying a home.  We need to reconsider the model of public housing.  I am a supporter of public housing.  We do not all need to own our own homes, although we might aspire to do so.  A large part of our personal equity, our savings and the income we have earned is tied up in homes.  We have this belief that everyone must own a home.  Everyone has a right to a secure and safe home but we do not have to get hung up on the idea of home ownership.  I spoke to a woman the other day who has just retired at 66 years of age.  She would like to cash in her chips and be able to rent an affordable home but she cannot get one.  I strongly believe that the cost of rental homes is also important and we need to address it.<br/><br/>What is the definition of affordable housing?  It is not defined in the Bill.  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service for its paperwork and what it has done.  It has done a great deal of work on this.  There is no mention of income.  The Bill states that a house built or made available in a certain way is affordable, regardless of whether anyone can afford it.  In Dublin, rents have increased by 42% in the past six years.  One of the cuckoo fund managers was quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>yesterday as saying they had never seen rental increases like that in any jurisdiction of which they are aware.<br/><br/>We need to look at public housing and we must have a definition of what it means.  The Minister spoke earlier about the Vienna model, whereby people can access housing at all times.  It is secure tenure, a well as fair and capped rent.  That is what people want.  They want secure tenure and proper rents.  To suggest that all these houses are out there and that people can have them is just not the reality.  The Vienna model does this by adopting a general needs approach to housing provision and delivering secure, long-term and innovative public rental housing, as well as designed neighbourhoods.  In Vienna, higher-income earners can also access the public housing sector.  Up to two thirds of Vienna's 1.9 million population live in public housing and are happy to do so.  I have visited the city a number of times and seen the schemes.  They are excellent.  It is important that we understand the meaning of public housing.<br/><br/>I think we are all in agreement.  I have no hang-up on any ideology.  Quite frankly, I do not care who builds the houses.  There is room for approved housing bodies, AHBs, the private sector, the public sector and the councils.  Anybody who can build houses in an affordable way and pass them on is to be accepted.  It is about secure tenure, affordability and the supply of units.  The Minister spoke about the cap of &euro;320,000 in counties Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, and &euro;250,000 in the rest of the country.  He spoke about the cap of &euro;450,000 in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Today I looked on <i>daft.ie</i>.  The cheapest house I could find in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown was listed at &euro;335,000 for a two-bedroom, one-bathroom, 60 sq. m, terraced house in bits.  If one looks at the Central Bank mortgage rules and the income required to get a mortgage for that house, one does not have to be a mathematician to work it out, at 3.5 times the person's income.  A couple on a combined income of &euro;100,000 - some might say that is not realistic but it is - can borrow up to &euro;350,000.  For that falling-down house in bits in D&uacute;n Laoghaire for &euro;350,000, I do not know whether that couple would even get approval for a mortgage for it.  We have a problem.  It is difficult to hear the Minister speak about capping property prices in Dublin city and D&uacute;n Laoghaire at &euro;450,000 because it is not realistic.<br/><br/>As I said, I am not hung up on the ideology of how we establish it, but we need to look more closely at setting up a public housing trust.  There is a slogan, &quot;public houses on public land&quot;.  I believe in it, although some were critical of it yesterday.  I am not in the business of sloganeering but that is what the public want.  It is what people say they want.  It is what the media were commenting on all weekend.  They believe it is a public asset and there should be public housing.  As is the case in the Vienna model, people on any income could avail of it.  I am not in favour of selling public housing.  One of our great problems is that we sold off our public housing stock.  I was a member of a local authority for more than 20 years and I saw lovely tram cottages in Dalkey, Blackrock and other places sold for &euro;10,000 and &euro;15,000.  Today, they are going for &euro;780,000, and that is only one generation removed from those who bought them, moved to Wexford, Arklow, Waterford, Louth or Mullingar, hated it, wanted to get back but could not afford to do so, with all the knock-on effects on communities and the housing market.<br/><br/>I look forward to engaging further with the Minister on Committee Stage.  I cannot let this opportunity pass without saying I would like to hear what the Government intends to do about cuckoo funds.  They need their wings clipped.  Clearly, we have a serious problem.  The people are angry and disappointed.  When they hear that the Government has invested money in these funds in the past, they see it as the Government silently supporting them.  We seem to be hooked on that.  It is all about keeping the messages simple.  People, such as teachers, doctors and, dare I say it, Deputies and Senators, have no homes.  They are priced out.  They cannot afford to buy homes.  They may want either to buy or to rent a home, but it is all about affordability and supply.  I wish the Minister well in what is a very difficult task.  We all know that the Government will be judged on a handful of issues, namely, housing, health, youth unemployment and, possibly, childcare.  They are the key issues on which all members of the Government have to deliver, and I wish them well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#XXXX00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for initiating in this House what is some of the most important legislation that will be debated during this Twenty-sixth Seanad.  Despite what some would have us believe, the Government takes the housing crisis extraordinarily seriously.  Rather than talk about grand plans, ideology and misplaced analysis that the State should be the only player in the delivery of social and affordable homes, the Government is taking action and is willing to deliver social, affordable and private housing via any mechanism possible to deliver what every expert in this space agrees is needed most, namely, supply.  As the Minister said, we cannot and should not allow perfection to be the enemy of the good.</p> <p>The Bill, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency Bill 2021 and the significant increase in the delivery of social homes that has occurred, are the structural foundations that will resolve the housing crisis we face.  We need to be honest with people, however, and that goes for the Opposition too.  It will not be done overnight.  Anyone involved in construction will say it takes three to four years, from concept to completion, to deliver housing units.  There are, as has been mentioned, more than 80,000 inactive planning permission applications for units nationally, on which I believe builders will move as a result of the measures in the Bill in relatively short order.  The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, commits the Government to building on the foundations of Rebuilding Ireland to deliver housing for all.  The document articulates the core belief that everybody should have access to good-quality housing for purchase or rent at an affordable price.  </p> <p>That is why we are introducing the following four main measures as part of the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The first of these measures is the local authority affordable purchase scheme.  This will allow local authorities to acquire, build or cause to be built housing units for purchase by those who cannot secure a mortgage for 90% of the market price of the unit.  Units can be delivered directly by the local authority, by approved housing bodies, AHBs, in conjunction with the Land Development Agency, LDA, or via public private partnership arrangements.  To support the delivery of affordable homes by local authorities there is a &euro;310 million serviced sites fund to provide infrastructure support to local authorities.  One of the main recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny was that access to the serviced sites fund be made more flexible and that an open call be introduced.  I ask the Minister to ensure this happens without delay and to look at the &euro;50,000 available per unit and adjust it upwards to reflect the higher costs in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>I welcome the flexibility to the first-time buyer rule being inserted for those who previously had a dwelling as part of a marriage that has ended, those who sold or lost homes due to insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings and those who are in a home that is now too small for their needs.  These are matters I raised on the first day of pre-legislative scrutiny and I thank the Minister for their inclusion in the Bill.  I also welcome the standardisation of the scheme of priority for the affordable purchase homes, and the 30% flexibility being introduced for local authorities to prioritise those who perhaps do not meet the standard criteria.</p><p>The second measure being introduced, to which the Minister has referred, is cost rental.  This is specifically targeted at those who are above the income threshold for social housing but are trapped in high-cost rental accommodation.  It is intended that cost rental properties will be long-term secure tenancies.  As the Minister said, it is based on the Vienna model, with rents charged to cover the cost of delivering, financing, maintaining and managing the homes.  As rents will be linked to the consumer price index, these homes will in fact get more affordable as time progresses.</p><p>The development of this new sector is already ongoing with the LDA due to break ground on 306 cost rental homes at Shanganagh, and 440 units will be delivered in association with AHBs in Dublin and Cork, with rents at least 25% below market value.  As the Minister knows, there was an open call for the cost rental equity loan earlier this year and I hope, in light of the construction shutdown, that schemes in Waterford, Limerick and Galway can be prioritised and given the green light to proceed without delay to increase the supply of cost rental homes in this calendar year and the early half of 2022.</p><p>While I appreciate that the Department is keen to prove the concept with the AHBs, to ramp up significantly the production of cost rental homes we must allow, as in other European countries, the entry of low-cost ethical funds to deliver units at scale.  I would appreciate if the Minister could clarify whether there is any impediment in the legislation to enable this to happen.  I would also welcome some clarity on how the selection of cost rental tenants will be decided as these will be highly desired properties.</p><p>The third pillar of the Bill is the introduction of the affordable purchase shared equity scheme to assist eligible individuals and families in purchasing a private home.  Surprisingly, this &euro;75 million scheme, which equates to 1% of the mortgage market in Ireland, has received all of the attention but in truth it is only one small part of the measures that will improve access to, and affordability of, new homes for viable but hard-pressed purchasers who are potentially paying higher rents than the mortgages they could get from the banks.  We all know these people.  They are our friends and families and they are the people in our areas.  In addition, the scheme will incentivise and encourage the construction of more new-build homes to help address clear supply shortages.  I welcome the fact the Minister will introduce caps on these, which should probably be reviewed before they are finalised.</p><p>Individuals or families will be required to take out the maximum mortgage with the equity percentage being the gap between the maximum mortgage and the cost of the home, up to a maximum of 20%, which can be paid off without interest in the first five years.  This is a safeguarding measure to ensure we target those first-time buyers who need it most.  The scheme can be combined with the Rebuilding Ireland home loan product and with the help-to-buy scheme, which provides 10%, or up to &euro;30,000, towards the deposit of a home for a first-time buyer.</p><p>The fourth pillar of the Bill, which I understand will be introduced on Committee Stage, is the increase in Part V provision from the requirement to have 10% of any housing estate delivered for social housing purposes to at least 20% for social and affordable housing.  This will have the net effect of delivering approximately 3,000 affordable purchase units per year, which is hugely welcome.  We must also be conscious that increasing the percentage above this level could result in higher prices for the remaining percentage of the development, as builders do not make money on delivering Part V houses as the land costs are attributed at the existing use value.</p><p>Housing is the biggest challenge we face outside of Covid-19.  I truly believe the Bill will assist us in delivering affordable purchase and rental homes.  By all of us putting our shoulders to the wheel and working together, the measures in the Bill will unlock the delivery of affordable homes.

It is a tool for the State to address our severe housing crisis.  I had high hopes for the Bill and initially reserved judgment because I thought it was important that we get it right.  Unfortunately, following the pre-legislative scrutiny and the debates since it was published, I am more wary.  I will begin with the positive elements of the Bill.  I welcome the provision of affordable housing on public land but, as with everything else, whether the housing will be affordable is open to question.  This is because I see a fundamental flaw in the Bill, which is a failure to provide in the legislation a definition of "affordability" that is linked to income.  What we have is a market discount Bill that does not guarantee affordability.  The Minister can say "affordability" as much as he likes but it will not necessarily mean it is the case.</p> <p>To give an example, some of the three-bedroom apartments classed as affordable that will be provided on public land in O'Devaney Gardens in the deal with Bartra will cost up to &euro;420,000.  This contrasts with a project in the Minister's constituency, where prices will start at &euro;166,000 for two-bedroom apartments and &euro;206,000 for three-bedroom apartments.  This is affordable.  It is important that we define in the Bill what "affordable" will be.</p> <p>It is difficult to speak when I am listening to a conversation going on.</p></speech>

The evaluation of an equivalent scheme by the UK's Department with responsibility for housing was that 60% of the beneficiaries could have bought a property without the scheme.  Furthermore, it stated the scheme contributed towards developers building bigger houses and increasing profits.  The report of the London School of Economics was more damning.  It stated the scheme did not improve supply or affordability in the areas where it mattered in London.  Questions remain.  Given all of this background, and the concerns of the Central Bank and the ESRI, why are we going ahead with this element of the plan?  More importantly, from where did we get it?  It was not from the experts.</p> <p>Housing policy continues to be investor-led and the shared equity scheme exemplifies this.  The approach, through encouragement to build to rent and REITs, has led to Generation Rent, who are worse off than their parents.  What frightens me is that there is no indication that the Bill will end this.  I am seriously concerned about the rhetoric put forward by the Government, which is either spin or fundamentally does not understand economics 101, that this is a supply-side measures.  Everybody else states it is a demand-side measure that will increase house prices.  It has echoes of the help-to-buy scheme.  In 2017, Tom Parlon of the Construction Industry Federation, in language with which we might be familiar, stated that scheme would boost supply and help first-time buyers to purchase new homes.  Can we honestly say in 2021, four years later, that it achieved those aims?  Since then, house prices have increased by 22%.  It is true that people are getting more from the State to pay for them but they are paying more.  When it was introduced, the estimated cost was &euro;50 million and in 2020 it cost &euro;270 million.  Will the same cost inflation happen with this policy, which is meant to be a limited intervention?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael market-led approach to housing should have led to supply increasing and rents falling but the help to buy scheme did no such thing.  Since the scheme was introduced, rents have gone up by 24% in Dublin and 27% in the rest of the country.  The scheme is not about making housing affordable; it is about giving credit.  The shared equity scheme is designed to bridge the gap between Central Bank lending rules and what developers are saying it takes for them to develop housing, rather than address the reasons underlying the much higher cost of construction in this country.  This is not a policy to get people on the property ladder, but one to generate more profits for developers and saddle people who are just within reach of owning their own home with more debt.</p><p>The Minister and the Government have an opportunity to institute a fundamental change in how we approach the provision of housing.  I urge him to reconsider this part of the Bill rather than continuing with it.  We should learn the lesson from the 2000s and the help to buy scheme that policies which investors and developers say will help the housing market are only really designed to help them.  </p><p>This goes back to the issue of the lack of definition of "affordability" in the Bill as we move to cost rental.  The whole purpose of an affordable rental model is to target lower income renters, protecting them and ensuring that they have a roof over their heads in a crazy rental market.  Low-income workers and families cannot take any more of the fallout from the housing crisis.  There is no definition of "affordability" in this Bill, just market discount.  The minimum cost calculation period in this Bill is 30 years.  I consider that too short to provide affordable rental homes to many on low incomes.  While 30 years might seem like a long time on paper, for housing and place-making, it is not.  I often look at the Iveagh Trust buildings that were used for subsidising low-income housing back in 1907.  They are still used for that purpose today.</p><p>In addition, we are now opening up cost rental to investors.  As they say, perfection is the enemy of progress.  That change is meant to be based on the Austrian and German models.  However, Austria and Germany established limited profit associations on a legislative basis.  That is not being provided for in the Bill before us.  It is being done through regulation.  Housing policy in Austria and Germany has evolved very differently from housing policy here.  Our housing policy has jumped from boom to bust.  This is an opportunity for us to test this model.  We are letting the investor and landlord class into this new form of tenure before it has even got on its feet.  We saw what happened with the approach taken in respect of REITs.  We gave an inch to encourage investment at the bottom of the market and they took a mile, in the middle of a housing crisis, to boost their incomes.  We are giving the Minister the power to decide what a limited profit is.  That is the same Minister who is now providing for a shared equity scheme against all the expert advice.</p><p>Let us take it as a good idea.  If that is the case, why can we not also make provision in the Bill to limit profits of the build-to-rent developers or investors who buy up whole complexes?  While there are many policies that may improve affordability, let us put this to the wider private sector and link rents to inflation, as is provided for in the Affordable Housing Bill.  The Minister loves to pay lip service to young people, single people and first-time buyers.  There is a whole lot the Government will do, yet when it comes to the detail, we see that it is heavily influenced by the desire to incentivise the investor and landlord class.  It is all carrots and no stick.  This Bill was an opportunity to back this up with action.</p><p>We cannot take this Bill on its own.  Delivery is what is important, as is how the provisions will interact with the LDA and wider Government policy.  That is where I am disappointed.  From what I can see, in the approach to the cuckoo funds buying up housing estates in Maynooth, Government policy seems to be looking to lock another generation into a rental economy, servicing the needs of investors.  How are we doing that?  We are doing it through the build-to-rent sector.  There are 1,400 units being built in my area against an agreed masterplan, none of which will be available for people to buy.  Policy is based on high-income yields for investors.  The head of Hines told us in public meetings that this is what his investors want.  Security and affordability in cities and high-density areas matter too.  People should be able to buy to rent and live in Ireland securely.  The Affordable Housing Bill will not achieve that.  It is trying to incentivise investors and developers rather than taking a State-led approach.  I hope I am proven wrong but I fear I will not be.</p></speech>

In order to tackle the housing crisis, of which every one of us is acutely aware and, I believe, wants to solve, the boom to bust nature of housing must be eliminated.  Cost rental is the key that will free us from this boom-to-bust housing model that has dominated Ireland.  Given time, it will calm the market across the board and allow people to have a forever home.  It allows people to rent their home for the duration of their lives, at a rate that depends on their income.  They can rent a home in which they can have children and grow old in the same house with no need to worry that a landlord will evict them or change the terms of the lease.  The cost, though predicted to be 25% below market rate, will not be linked to the market rate in this Bill, which is critical.  It will be based on the cost of construction and maintenance over the life of the property and other costs, as well as what the tenant can afford to pay.  That is real security of tenure.  That is the Vienna model of cost rental that the Green Party has been harping on about for decades.  This Bill is beyond the proof of concept of cost rental.  It enshrines that model in law for the first time ever.</p> <p>Over time, the cost rental model will calm and lower rents overall in the market because rents in the private sector will be brought down in tandem.  They will have to fall to compete.  This Bill, through the provision of cost rental and local authority housing, is doing what has been dearly needed in housing policy in Ireland, namely, restoring the State's rightful place at the centre of delivery to help curb the worst excesses of the market and to provide housing for those who need it.</p> <p>I know and hope that a review will be carried out to examine how the scheme is working.  One of the areas I will be interested in hearing about is the succession plan for cost rental tenancies and properties.</p> <p>In terms of homelessness, which is slightly different but related to the housing crisis and has been exposed to a horrifying extent as never before over the last couple of years, if one asks people on the ground what will help to bring people out of homelessness, one of the key responses is supply.  According to the most recent report published by the Simon Community, there were two homes eligible for HAP in Galway city, and another two in the county.  That is shocking.  I know the issue only too well, having sat on the housing committee of the public participation network for a few years before becoming a councillor.  </p> <p>Addressing social housing is this Government's number one priority.  As a Government, we have committed to ensuring that all housing from now on will include a mix of private, social and affordable housing, and in cost rental developments, there will be a mix that includes social housing.  The Government committed to meeting a target of providing 50,000 social homes over its lifetime.  While the pandemic has hampered construction, taking the response of just one approved housing body as an example, it has over 1,500 homes under construction.  </p> <p>Affordability, both for rent and purchase, will simply not be achieved without this Bill.  Just ask a family or a single person who is couch surfing.  Young people cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel but I believe this Bill provides the way.  According to a report compiled by Dr. Padraic Kenna in association with the Irish Council for Social Housing, only the top 10% of earners can truly afford to rent their own home in Dublin.  The equivalent figure in respect of Galway and Cork is 20%.  Not being able to afford a home is not just about being homeless.  It is also related to food and fuel poverty.  People are living in these homes and paying these rents.  The Government has committed to ensuring people have affordable homes.</p> <p>Short-term and medium-term measures in the Bill will change the very nature of the housing market.  They include a cost rental intervention to have forever homes in the rental sector and a commitment to increase social housing through the use of creative measures to finance the building of social housing and Part V interventions.  These interventions will be introduced on Committee Stage.  They will transform the housing model.  Everybody deserves to have an affordable home.  Without the interventions in this Bill, it simply will not happen.</p></speech>

He faces a daunting task.  We could spend all our time giving out about what previous Governments should and should not have done.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Here we are, however, so let us move forward.  This Bill is the first ever to focus solely on affordable housing, which cannot be a bad thing.  People like to focus their energy on poking holes in things but we must focus on solutions.  I want to focus on cost rental, a new phenomenon in Ireland based on the Vienna model, to which the Bill gives legal status.</p><p>I do not believe the Irish obsession with fixture of tenure is solely the result of being colonised.  It goes back to James Larkin and those before him.  As a tenant for many years, I always worried about the landlord wishing me good luck and telling me I had to move out.  I was always afraid to hang pictures or paint the walls or anything.  I ended up living in one house for ten years but I never had security.  The lack of security creates a latent stress that many people carry all the time.</p><p>Cost rental is a very important model.  I am proud of the Green Party's work on this issue and that the Government has taken it on board and will give it legal status.  It basically means that market value will not dictate the cost of living in cost rental properties.  This housing will be supplied by the AHBs through the LDA.  I hate using initialisms.  I refer to the housing boards.  What does the "A" in AHB stand for again?</p></speech>

Maybe not everyone will have to own a house if people know they are not going to be kicked out of their home for 30 or 40 years.  I would like to see tenancies to be <i>ad infinitum</i>but a 30 or 40-year tenancy is vastly more secure than what we have now.  I praise that aspect of the Bill.</p><p>The Bill also provides that rents in AHB built housing will be capped.  Rent increases are another big fear.  The rent for the house I lived in increased from &euro;450 to &euro;800 over a long period.  When a tenant's budget or pay does not change, such increases cause serious stress.</p><p>I will briefly speak to one other issue as I only have a minute.  I feel strongly about derelict buildings and the town centre first initiative.  I want more done in this area.  I cannot permit myself to raise water infrastructure again because the Minister is in the House but we need water infrastructure if we are to have serviced sites for building houses.  That is a major issue.  I cannot pretend to know about Dublin but it is a serious issue in many villages in County Clare.</p><p>We want people back living in our towns and villages again.  It is prohibitive to try to build serviced sites, yet we do not want people living on their own out in the middle of nowhere either.  We cannot prevent that if we do not have a good and affordable alternative.</p><p>We also need to address the prohibitive cost of meeting fire and safety regulations when renovating buildings.  We need people living upstairs above shops again.  Where this has worked, it has been amazing and changed the entire fabric of the local community.  I flag that issue.  I wish the Minister the best of luck with the Bill and thank him for his work on it.</p></speech>

We were always told, as we have been tonight, that solving the housing issue was going to take time.  Even I believed that for a while.  It takes time for anyone to build a house.  The crisis has become worse as the years have gone by and a decade later, the housing crisis has become an emergency.  People are not able to rent or buy.  They will take to the streets in their tens and thousands at the soonest possible time to make their feelings known.</p> <p>People expect the Government to make radical decisions and interventions that support working people.  People see what is possible.  They see decisions of a type they never expected to be taken by centre and centre-right parties and radical decisions they thought could not work or might not happen.</p> <p>Renters, first-time buyers and people in mortgage distress want a break.  They want a Minister who does not miss deadline after deadline for legislation and who backs up legislation with cash.  Budget 2021 only allocated &euro;35 million for cost rental and &euro;50 million for affordable purchase housing.  People want a Minister who does not break election promises.  Fianna F&aacute;il promised 10,000 affordable homes every year for ten years in its election manifesto.  Why has it abandoned that promise?</p> <p>Direct capital investment in public housing needs to be doubled to at least &euro;2.8 billion annually to meet social and affordable need.  We need more detail on targets and finance to be announced in the later Stages of the Bill.  Will the Minister agree annual targets for the delivery of cost rental and affordable purchase homes with every local authority and approved housing bodies, co-operatives and community housing trusts?</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued for affordable and cost rental homes.  We need 8,000 affordable homes every year, of which 4,000 should be cost rental and 4,000 affordable purchase.  The cost rental model also requires much more detail to give reassurance about security of tenure and tenant protections to cover all eventualities, such as a reduction in income and tenants approaching retirement.</p> <p>We need to make sure the cost rental units are available for working people who fall just outside the cut-off point for social housing.  It is, therefore, crucial that the entry level is set as low as possible.  It has been shown that with the right model of financing, rents can be set at between &euro;700 and &euro;900.  Instead, we have seen rents of up to &euro;1,200 per month described as affordable, for example, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p> <p>There is no definition of what an affordable rent is, as Senators Moynihan and Boyhan noted.  We would like to see it defined as 30% of net income, based on Central Statistics Office, CSO, annual earning indicators.  Many people, especially in Dublin, and many friends of mine, would welcome any indication that affordable rent is under 50% of their income.  Most of my friends spend at least 50% of their disposable income on rent.  I am not against home ownership and nor is Sinn F&eacute;in.  Many of my friends would happily rent if it were not cheaper to take out a mortgage.</p> <p>The shared equity scheme should never have made it into this Bill.  As the Bill was being drafted, officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the ESRI, the Central Bank and a host of economists were warning that the only certain outcome of this provision was a rise in house prices and developers' profits.  The origin of this proposal lies in two documents that were developed by two industry lobby groups, Property Industry Ireland and Irish Institutional Property.  These two groups are also strongly in favour of co-living and lobbied the Department not to introduce a ban.</p> <p>The Minister refers to the national price ceilings as upper levels, as if we do not know that a developer will simply see these as a target for which to aim.  We are likely to see many housing units costing &euro;399,000 or &euro;499,000 being granted public money because, technically speaking, they are affordable.  When the 4% limit was introduced for rent pressure zones, RPZ, it was obvious from an early stage that this was seen as a baseline for landlords.  Can the Minister honestly say that 4% functioned as a ceiling and not as a guide for landlords increasing rent?</p> <p>We need to see an expansion of the serviced sites fund and greater flexibility for local authorities in the amount they can draw down for each scheme.  Increasing the allocation to the fund will only make an impact if directed at areas where the need is greater.</p> <p>We need to double capital investment to at least &euro;2.8 billion annually.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, the ESRI and the Housing Agency have all called on the Government to deliver affordable homes at scale.  The ESRI has called on it to double direct capital investment on social and affordable homes.  The International Monetary Fund, IMF, has stated the Government can borrow more capital to address the affordable housing crisis.</p> <p>Good elements of this Bill will only be effective and have impact if they are met with ambition, ambitious targets and cash.  Sinn F&eacute;in has long argued  for affordable and cost rental housing but we are absolutely against the shared equity scheme.</p></speech>

It is good to debate the issue of affordable housing and to have a new Bill, although there are many concerns.</p><p>I open by joining together the dots between four different articles that appeared in the <i>Business Post</i>last week.  I commend the work the <i>Business Post </i>has been doing in diving into the real detail of our housing policy.  We can all bemoan the experiences but we need to look at the detail.</p><p>The first of the four stories showed that State investment in cuckoo funds amounted to &euro;225 million, of which &euro;60 million was in one fund that was mentioned.  These are the same kinds of cuckoo funds we have all been giving out about and which have been buying up entire housing estates and gazumping local authorities, including Kildare County Council, that wished to purchase properties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have, on the one hand, State investment in cuckoo funds.  It is worth bearing in mind that the &euro;198 million that has been invested in housing schemes is less than the &euro;220 million we have put into cuckoo funds.  The other story is about the local authorities that are being forced to lease.  To buy the Heron Wood estate would cost &euro;18 million but to lease it for 25 years will cost &euro;20 million.  The council is being forced to lease it because it has been told about the fiscal rules.  At the same time, the fiscal rules in Europe are suspended.  We are not obligated to be doing this on the balance sheet.  We can, in fact, have major public investment.  Local authorities are limited in what they can do.<br/><br/>Another of the <i>Business Post</i>articles was a deep dive conducted by Killian Woods.  He discussed investment funds with some of the people involved, specifically Pat Davitt of the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, who talked about how brilliantly the rental system is set up for funds right now.  He said that the properties come into the market at the highest price a fund can get, unaffected by rent control rules and existing stock.  He went on to say:</p><blockquote>	Then the Government comes along, in some cases, and they guarantee they will lease the properties for social housing for 25 years [the same amount of time as applied to the Heron Wood story].  So you get a 25-year lease from the Government on the basis of the rent.  Somebody then has what they call a fund.  It's not a property any longer. </blockquote><p>We are turning housing estates into funds.  In the same article, Mr. Davitt talks about how investment funds do not really mind if the cost is &euro;300,000 or &euro;400,000.  What they care about is their 4% per annum return in an inflating market.<br/><br/>On the same day, there was a positive, hopeful story in the newspaper in which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform told us he does not know if he will be able to spend our capital expenditure budget for this year and that &euro;1 billion had to be handed back to the Exchequer last year.  Why do we not give a lot of money to local authorities and allow them to buy or build, not lease, on public land and keep those houses in public ownership?  The solutions are there.  We must be clear that the EU rules no longer prohibit us from doing that.  Why are we favouring a model of a 25-year lease and leasing in general?  What does that do to the next generation?  As Senator Moynihan said, life moves faster than we think and 25 years is not an eternity.<br/><br/>The Minister said we should use all the tools but we are making our local authorities work with one hand tied behind their backs.  He spoke about the State playing a central role but the State must play a sustainable central role.  The role of the State should not be to hand a large amount of public land over to private developers for a set period of time, after which the assets might be gone.  This is where the detail will come in when we debate the Bill.  Will the Minister's adaptation of Part V include a limitation on leasing?  Will it recognise that leasing is not adequate delivery under Part V?  Will it include not only the 20% requirement for social and affordable housing, but also a 10% requirement for social housing?  I am concerned about that, although I am conscious that we will see the details.<br/><br/>Will we also see that, as a part of the cost rental scheme, any house built on public land will, at the end of the period of time, revert to public ownership?  The nature of cost rental is that it is long term and gives long-term security of tenure.  I think everybody embraces the principle of cost rental but the important point is that eventually the money is paid off and the house or flat should not become an asset at that stage.  The local authority or approved housing body should still have the property as public housing.  That is why I am concerned about bringing in investors.  I am concerned that at whatever level the return, we are creating a situation whereby cost rental housing will leave in 25 or 30 years' time and go back to its function as an asset, rather than as a long-term home and the place-making about which we have heard.  Can we give security beyond that term?  Local authorities and approved housing bodies should be satisfied with having covered their costs and should not need an asset output.<br/><br/>In terms of the affordable housing that is being built, can we guarantee that a certain amount of that housing will be designed in a way that is appropriate for the needs of those with a disability, as is our obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities?  Many disabled people long for independent living in appropriate housing.<br/><br/>I do not need to add to what others have said about the shared equity house purchase scheme.  The ESRI, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the London School of Economics have told us that the scheme has the potential to contribute to the inflation of house prices.  I have concerns about the requirement that persons must seek the maximum possible mortgage.  I know that is designed so that the State would only lend to those who need it in order to bridge the gap to the amount required but I am concerned that it creates a dynamic whereby the margin gets pushed up and everybody is encouraged to push.  Others with great expertise have argued that it will have that effect.<br/><br/>The Minister mentioned a constraint on investor purchases of entire housing estates such as those the State has supplemented to this date.  He stated that those constraints might, however, exclude estates for which planning permission has been secured.  If the Minister introduces a constraint on the disposal of housing estates to ensure that some of them are reserved for first-time buyers and the estates cannot be sold on a large scale to institutional investors, I ask him to include those with planning permission, certainly in the case of strategic housing developments, bearing in mind that only 30% of strategic housing developments have commenced building since 2016.  We were told by a previous Minister that strategic housing developments would guarantee a supply of houses, yet only 49 of 162 projects that have planning permission have commenced construction.  Let us be clear that planning permission is not the obstacle because I am talking about projects that have planning permission.  Strategic housing developments have benefited from fast-track planning because they were meant to address our housing crisis.  Surely it is reasonable that we would add those housing estates to any constraints on investor purchases.  That would be a reasonable measure and I hope the Minister will take the suggestion on board.<br/><br/>Perfection is not the enemy of good.  Greed is the enemy of good.</p></speech>

It is not about ideological positions or anything else.  It is about individuals and families who want to be able to rent their own home and, crucially, to aspire to own their own home.  I know that is something about which the Minister has been passionate for as long as I have known him.  We may disagree on aspects of the legislation but I know that passion is, in many ways, the Minister's driving force in politics.  That is a difference between some political parties.  Part of the reason I am a member of Fianna F&aacute;il is that we strongly support the aspiration of individuals to own a home.  Everything we will do in government is to realise that aspiration.  Senator Moynihan was correct that this legislation will not, on its own, achieve that.  A number of measures will be required and I want to make a number of suggestions in that regard.</p> <p>When the measures under this Bill are enacted, along with the introduction of the Land Development Agency and all the other reforms, I ask that simple explanations be made available.  I am thinking about the renters who are watching and want to buy their own home.  All that such people want to know, whether they are living in Gorey, Swords or west Clare, is how they can access the necessary resources to be able to afford their own home.</p> <p>It is welcome that local authorities are empowered to deliver affordable homes on their own lands under the legislation.  However, there is a big difference between empowerment and delivery.  It will be essential that project management teams are put in place in local authorities.  I am in favour of league tables to force local authorities to prove how they are performing but we need to set delivery targets because I am confident that some local authorities will excel while others will not.</p> <p>The problem is a lack of supply and this legislation is about getting the supply of houses out there as quickly as possible.  I agree with Senator Higgins about strategic housing developments.  That initiative never led to fast-track planning.  All it did was discount the possibilities, at local level, of democratic input in the political process and, in most cases, we ended up with judicial reviews, with planning lawyers benefiting.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with getting rid of the strategic housing developments, SHDs.</p><p>On a supply issue, there is a disdain for developers and those involved in the construction industry.  If we do not start to support those in the construction industry, we will not be able to address supply.  Senator Warfield asked why the houses were not being built.  During the period of Covid, construction was closed down for most of the time.  It is interesting that some of those who were shouting most loudly for zero Covid to have the construction sites closed down are now asking where is all the building and where are the homes going.  Unless one has a vibrant construction sector, one cannot have home building.</p><p>It is important to listen to the construction sector and the small developers right around the country.  That means we look in addition at reducing the costs of construction and that means an alignment with a number of the State agencies.  Senator Garvey was correct on the need to align with Irish Water.  Clearly, many of Irish Water's practices are not allowing for quick connection.  The costs of connecting into Irish Water are far too high.  In many of our rural villages, it is impossible to even get planning permission because the infrastructure is not in place.  That will need to be addressed.</p><p>We need to speed up the planning process.  I support the calls by Deputy Cowen that there has to be a limit on the length of time it takes An Bord Plean&aacute;la to make a decision.  This is not about the rights or wrongs of the decision but that the decisions before An Bord Plean&aacute;la are taking far too long.</p><p>I do not believe that anybody has a monopoly on wisdom when it comes to how we will build more housing.  It is a crisis.  It is something that is important to every one of us in this House but I believe there are some people out there who simply want this to fail.  They would take more pleasure in the Government not being able to deliver homes than in success with this happening.  Within Fianna F&aacute;il, we have had huge debates.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, who has chaired our own party committee.  We have spent hours and the Minister and I have not agreed on every issue.  It is important that we have this debate to get this right but they only way we will do it is by all working together to get the best Bill.  Ultimately, it is to be able to get affordable rents and, most importantly, to be able to allow individuals and families to aspire to own their own homes.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister.</p> <p>This Bill is, as we all know, very important.  It is one that we should all support and collaboratively and collectively work together on, irrespective of ideology.  Like Senator Malcolm Byrne, I have no hang up in encouraging development, be it private or public.  We need the Construction Federation of Ireland.  We need developers.  In the old world, we called them builders who built houses and who knew what to do.  Let us get back to doing that.</p> <p>This is an important debate because, as I have said, the housing crisis will be solved by a compendium of public and private and by planning reform, as well as by empowering, kick-starting and incentivising, but also instructing, the local authorities that they must build, and we must tackle the issue of supply and affordability.  There is no silver bullet.  There is no panacea.</p> <p>Senator Warfield said we were in government for ten years.  We can go back and parse through the Sinn F&eacute;in record in government in the North for 14 years, if the Senator wants to, but that will not build a single house.</p> <p>What we must do is implement the four measures in this Bill around the issues of the local authority affordable purchase scheme, the cost rental measure, the Land Development Agency, the affordable purchase shared equity scheme or, as Senator Cummins rightly said, the &euro;75 million scheme, as well as the increase in the provision of Part V from 10% to 20%.</p> <p>The Minister and I know each other a long time.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien is a straight-shooter.  The Deputy is a tough man on the field but he is a man who gets things done.  The Minister's legacy in politics, irrespective of what happens before or during, will be his tenure here.  I wish the Minister well and will support him in every step of the way.</p> <p>The media people who say that were the Minister to come into the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meeting on Wednesday, it would be like the O.K. Corral, are wrong.  It will not be because we are interested in solving the housing crisis.  We will not be up on Hill 16 waving a flag and shouting "Come on" or whatever.  We will say, "Let us do it together."  It is not about sloganeering or electioneering; it is about working.  It is about getting boots on the ground and getting concrete and blocks put together.</p> <p>All of us in our lives have been told of and aspired to home ownership.  That is the Irish model and mentality.  Unfortunately, that is where a generation has been left behind.  That is why we must try to get back to it.</p> <p>As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment rightly said on Thursday last, 65% to 70% of citizens own their own home.  We, in Fine Gael, are the party of home ownership whether one likes it or not.  Senator Boylan can laugh and giggle and make all the faces she wants to.  That is what we are as a party.</p></speech>

That is our legacy, unfortunately, of a lost decade, but now in this decade we can rebuild and start building.</p> <p>When I heard people criticise Eoghan Murphy when he was Minister, some of them were in the ivory tower of being in opposition and never making a decision except to cross the road or come in here and give out, while others just wrote a column, went up on Twitter or went out on the media and made smart comments without having to make a decision.  I thank Eoghan Murphy for his tenure and his stewardship in the Department and for his dedication to public life.</p> <p>As I said, the help-to-buy scheme, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, freeing up public land and the Land Development Agency are all parts of the tools with which we can tackle this issue.  The people of Ireland want houses to be built.  They do not care how they are built.  They want affordable houses.  First-time buyers want to be able to have the sanctity of their own key being turned in the safety of their own home.  That is what they are looking for.  Local authorities have a critical role to play in that.  In my opinion, sometimes some of the local authorities have been found wanting.  I hope that we will give more power to the local authorities to ensure that they play a key role in the development of housing.</p> <p>We all know housing supply must be increased.  Senator Malcolm Byrne is correct.  Planning reform is necessary.  We need people to build.  We need good old-fashioned builders who can build.  We need to see, as we have seen in Cork City Council, a committed council working to build.  I would challenge anybody in this House to come up to Boherboy Road, come over to the Deanrock estate and come over to White Street and see social houses being provided for our fellow citizens.</p> <p>I commend the Minister on his work and I wish him well.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and wish him well with this Bill and in the important work that he has before him.</p> <p>The Minister stated at the close of his speech that he would use every weapon in his arsenal.  I might paraphrase and adjust that slightly by saying that the Government needs to get up off its arsenal and use every weapon that it finds there.  It is not only a matter of social justice.  It is not only a matter of addressing the extraordinary pain and hurt that is felt by young to early middle-aged people who are working hard, who have tough and stressful lives in many cases, and who are completely locked out of the housing market, as they see it.  It is not only about addressing the pain and the hurt of their parents as they contemplate an upcoming generation that will be less well off and enjoy fewer life opportunities in many ways than they will.  It is, perhaps, also about securing the future of centrist politics in this country and that is no small matter when one considers the consequences of letting extremes come to the fore in politics.  To be centrist is not to be bland.  To be centrist is to keep an eye on the common good at all times and not to set one person against the other or one class against the other but to seek to look out for the vulnerable and to create the maximum opportunity for human flourishing for all of those who want to participate in society.</p> <p>I was asked in a radio interview recently whether we as a nation were hung up on home ownership and whether we should think more like they do on the Continent where people are happy to rent for their lifetime.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I have said before, however, that is, and remains, the wrong question for as long as people cannot get access to homes at a fair and reasonable rent and cannot be sure of their ability to stay in such homes into their old age.</p><p>We must also bear in mind that Ireland is a relatively low-density country.  It should be possible for us to continue with the aspiration most of us have to own our place, even if it is only the size of a postage stamp, a place that is ours and ours to consider leaving to our loved ones and so on.  I think it was Senator Garvey who mentioned fixity of tenure and the historical roots of that phrase.  It goes all the way back to the 1850s, to the tenants' rights association who sought the three Fs, namely, free sale, fair rent and fixity of tenure.  We might say that the three Fs today are fair rent, fixity of tenure and feasibility of home ownership.  I mean fixity of tenure not in the old sense of being able to hold on to one's property as long as one pays the rent but, rather, to be able to hold onto it at a rent one will always be able to pay, including when one retires and has a lower income.  That is the future which must be budgeted for if people are going to be able to have confidence in rental.  These days, the third F is feasibility of home ownership and that is all down to supply.  We know the figures; we have 65,000 on housing waiting lists and 33,000 houses per year are what we need to building.  Let us say that between 12,000 and 20,000 were built last year, depending on how one calculates it, so we have a growing problem.</p><p>I agree with Senator Higgins in this respect and paraphrase her in saying that the State must not be afraid to be active in the housing market and to be a major player in the market, be that as a developer, lender or landlord, until this problem is solved.  In that context, the Affordable Housing Bill is an important and necessary start.  The Land Development Agency legislation is vital but this is only the beginning of our attempts to solve the problem.  I thank it was Labour's Deputy Nash I heard during the week paying the compliment to the British Conservative Party that it always understood the value of homeownership.  Going right back to Thatcher, that was understood.  The stakeholder society is what we must aim for.  We will have major social problems if we do not create and maintain a stakeholder society where people aspire, where they can own their own homes and where they can have incomes.  If, however, we are talking about affordable houses being capped at &euro;500,000, then two people would each need to be earning &euro;65,000 per year and this would have to be by 3,500 in order to get near that sum.  There is no future in a society where both parents have to be working to the pin of their collars in order to be able to afford something described as affordable.</p><p>There are two cohorts we have not mentioned in this debate.  The first is the homeless, who continue to be a category of people not directly addressed by this legislation and who must be at the top of our agenda.  The second group is children, whose future depends on being able to have access to parents who are not going to have to work every hour God sends in order to pay a mortgage.  To quote the prophet Isaiah, our people should "live in peaceful dwelling places, in secure homes, in undisturbed places of rest."</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister.  Knowing him as I do, I know the commitment he has and the hours he is putting in to make this work.  I have every confidence he will succeed.  I also compliment our colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, who does Trojan work with this.  I assure Senators that it is the top issue at all our parliamentary party meetings.  There is a lot of repetition here and stuff I could go into but I will not do that.   I just want to dwell on the cost-rental scheme for a few moments.  It is basically aimed at people above social housing income thresholds.  People might not think that this relates to rural areas but when I was a Deputy, several couples would come in to my office per week telling me they could not qualify for a local authority house as their income was too high and they could not get a mortgage because their income was too low.</p> <p>For many years, politicians have neglected those people.  I see a chink of light here.  I have no doubt that the Minister's sincerity in this is something we should acknowledge and respect and we must give him the opportunity to do it.  There are many people who have been trapped in that situation for many years.  I have seen people cry in my office when we had no options for them and nowhere to go.  It is an absolutely outrageous situation.  That is why I am a big fan of cost-rental and why it will work.  Also proposed are direct-build local authority affordable homes, priced between &euro;160,000 to &euro;310,000.  There is already &euro;310 million in place for 6,000 homes.  Remember when all the criticism comes - and there have been some very good contributions this evening - I did not hear many people say there is a budget of in excess of &euro;3 billion to deal with the housing crisis.  Some people among will say that money is one thing and delivery another.  However, I assure them, from speaking to the Minister and seeing the way he is working on this, that I have no doubt we will see delivery.  Of course, I agree that it is not going to happen overnight but even in the short term we will see a more positive outlook because if people see light at the end of the tunnel, they will certainly rally to this and see it is the proper way forward.</p> <p>We also have the shared equity scheme whereby up to 2,000 homes will be supported every year.  Returning to what Senator Boyhan said, he is right that Rebuilding Ireland is still there but the Minister has a new housing plan to replace it.  Rent stability is a massive issue.  Again, in rural areas I have noticed quite a lot of people in fear.  This is even with the law allowing people a certain period to be in their house before they can be pushed out of it.  People nowadays have a huge fear of rent not working out for them, so they come under pressure from a landlord.  Even with what is in the law they still feel threatened.  Rent stability is a massive issue.  If we give long-term rental security to people, it would be a massive change going forward.   I would not in any way discourage people from building homes.  We can talk about the Vienna model but let us have an Irish model.  Let us do things the Irish way.  Too many times in these Houses we say that something is done such a way in such a country.  Let us adopt our own model.  That is the way to do it because we can talk about the Vienna model but this is Ireland.  The geography of this country might mean that model would not work out too well.</p> <p>Finally, there is the expansion of Part V to 20% in order to include affordable housing.  That is significant and important and I am delighted to see the Minister doing that because it will have a very positive effect.  I remind the House that the Minister and the Government gave quite a lot of leeway to local authorities, so they could borrow &euro;6 million to build houses.  We need to get the local authorities building houses and that is something that can happen in the short term.  We also need to ask the executives of the local authorities to get schemes up and running in every county they are needed in, that will be a plus.</p> <p>I have full confidence in the Minister.  To be honest, I believe he will go down as one of our best Ministers with responsibility for housing.  We all know he cannot do it overnight or in a couple of weeks but in the months and years ahead we will see that his policy and that of this Government was the right one.  I join with everyone here in saying that if we cannot put a roof over people's heads and give them some security in their houses, then we are not fit to be parliamentarians.  It must be done in conjunction with others, with everybody agreeing on most things and not trying to bring a given proposal down because it comes from a given party or the Government.  We must work together on this.</p></speech>

I welcome that he is bringing the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 before the House.  As someone who served on a local authority for 17 years and saw houses being built, and not being built and being built again, I am happy to say that in Limerick we are currently building local authority housing.  Only in the past two years, 89 units were opened at the top of my own road by the previous Minister, Eoghan Murphy.  We look forward to when the current Minister comes down to Limerick to open some houses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In Limerick we are building 15 affordable houses, but for a county with a population of more than 200,000 it is not really enough, so I am delighted to see the Minister bringing this Bill forward.</p><p>It is only in recent days I have had two different people on to me whose marriages have broken up for one reason or another, their families are grown up and the family home has been sold.  In both cases the wife was looking to try to get on the scheme and purchase her own home but would not have enough money to buy it outright although she would still be young enough to qualify for this scheme.  That is something we need to look at.  For too long, builders and local authorities left builders off lightly in that they would take the money or move the housing to another part of the city or in the county area and maybe not mix the affordable housing or social housing in with the estate that was being built.  Therefore, I am delighted to see there are proposals for mixed units.</p><p>I know the Land Development Agency has been active down my way and we have a large bank of land where there is huge potential.  It is all publicly owned land but it has been lying derelict for a number of years.  The local authority, along with the Land Development Agency, has gone and put the pockets of land together.  There is huge potential so it would be good if we could replicate this, and I know it is being done in some places along with the Land Development Agency.  It has been said already that everybody deserves a roof over their head and so many people aspire to owning their own homes.  In Europe, you see an awful lot of apartments and people tending to rent whereas in Ireland people tend to try to own their own homes where possible.</p><p>I am delighted to welcome this Bill and I look forward to working with the Minister on it.  It is something we have to drive forward, which I believe the Minister will do, and I wish him well in his tenure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-05-17a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021051700002#EEEEE00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  The sooner we get around to getting this Bill through the House and getting down to the work the better, because as we have seen and as Senator Byrne has just pointed out, we have lost the first quarter of this year with builders not being able to get on site and build, which is what this is all about.  I said in so many debates in the previous D&aacute;il that I often wondered who the Opposition thought was going to build the homes.  Was it the pixie fairies who were going to come in with magic dust and sprinkle it around the place and homes would sprout like mushrooms?  No.  It is people involved in the building trade who provide homes.  That is a basic tenet.</p> <p>Many speakers, both for and against this Bill, have stated the Bill cannot be taken on its own.  They are so right and nobody is saying otherwise.  When it comes to delivering affordable homes, that will happen in many different guises.  It will not just be through the measures in this Bill.  Funding the Minister delivered at the start of the year through the urban regeneration fund will equally make a mark when it comes to homes in our town centres.  Now that inter-county travel restrictions have been lifted, I look forward to welcoming the Minister when he will be doing his John Creedon tour of Ireland.  I can bring him down and he can buy me lunch because it is important the Minister sees the variance of what is happening on the ground.  There are different scenarios, challenges and opportunities in each of our counties across Ireland, and each of the respective Senators could portray different challenges and weaknesses in each of the areas they represent, and rightly so, and the Minister has to take cognisance of that.</p> <p>When the Minister comes to Navan he can see the boarded-off site in Rathaldron that has lain unfinished for ten years and which will see 26 new units on it because last month the Minister and the Department allocated &euro;7 million for the county council to acquire that site and build there.  We can go on from there down the road to Flower Hill, which has benefited from a total of more than &euro;10 million from two calls of urban regeneration funding.  Critically, it will see the largest number of people living in that area in the centre of the town for 50 years.  That is because the Department and the county council have acquired one entire side of the street, are demolishing that derelict street and building homes and a community centre in the centre of my town.  Imagine that: housing and urban regeneration all in one, a concept that provides homes and regenerates our towns at the same time.  I am labouring the point because &euro;500 million that has been announced in urban regeneration and development funding, URDF, this year will accomplish that double goal in towns and cities throughout Ireland.</p> <p>Yet you would nearly believe there was nothing happening if you were listening to some of the debates in these Houses.  I am a great follower of the provincial newspapers and it is funny seeing some political opponents nearly choking on their cornflakes in trying to say the urban regeneration funds are welcome but knowing this could have a huge impact in the towns they represent.  That is because one of the biggest challenges we face is acquiring land, and through these funding initiatives we can acquire public land, regenerate areas that have lain derelict for decades and get people back living in the middle of towns.  That is crucial because one of the biggest issues we all face in new residential areas is the lack of facilities.  This is a concept where we are getting people beside retail, schools, sporting facilities and giving them a chance of quality of living.  The Bill the Minister has in his possession is a body of work that will have a huge impact in rebalancing the housing market in favour of the first-time buyer who is trying to get on the property ladder.</p> <p>A lot of ideological political opinion has been offered in this debate.  That is fine, I respect that and I have no interest in trying to convince people otherwise.  I would ask, however, that when we have the various schemes in place and when we see the benefits for constituents in their areas, perhaps Members might come into the House and acknowledge it.  Mark my words, there are thousands of people who are just waiting to see the green light for the shared equity scheme to benefit from it.  The expansion of the Part V scheme and seeing affordability as part of that is massive and that section alone will deliver 3,500 social and affordable homes per annum.  We should never have had the buy-out clause for councils in the first place in its original form and I am glad to see this measure being introduced.  What is most depressing is Members of the Oireachtas coming into the Seanad and the D&aacute;il and hoping the scheme will fail.  What a sad existence it is to be hoping something will fail at a time when an issue such as this should unite us, but Members like to use this and create further division.  There is enough division in this country.</p> <p>I spent four years working closely with the Minister in the term of the last D&aacute;il and I know his political beliefs are driven by the belief in affordability and that people should get the opportunity to purchase an affordable home.  That goes to the Minister's core and I know this Bill will make a huge difference in that respect and critically change people's lives.  I commend the Minister and this Bill.  Please God we will get to see this moving very soon.  Well done.</p></speech>

I am 30 years of age and it is people in my generation and from my age cohort who will benefit.  Those of us from this generation who are still in Ireland today are the ones who did not emigrate in 2010, 2011 or 2012.  We are also the generation of people who went to New York and London, did our five or six years there and are looking to come back and set up family life at home.  That is what this is about.  It is about families and graduates who have the ambition of home ownership.</p> <p>From listening to this debate, I can tell the Minister that if you were to ask any of my mates to come in here and explain what it all means, it would be difficult.  We need to put things in layman's terms.  When Members are talking about ideological things and saying what we need to do, a lot of that detail will fly over everybody's heads.  We need to be clear on what affordability is.  It means we will give people a house and the opportunity to buy it.  Again, I am looking back to my mates and people I know and they do not care if a house is built by a developer or a local authority.  They also do not care if it is built on public or private land.  Normal and average people on the street in Dundalk where I am from do not care who houses are built by.  That is a bubble issue and an ideological issue for Members.  The average Joe Soap on the street in this country does not care.  They want the opportunity to buy an affordable house and they will do so through landmark legislation like this.  That is what we are trying to do.  That gets lost in the debate on ideology around housing that we have seen rage within our county councils and local authorities in recent years.</p> <p>I agree with some of the proposals made by Deputy Cowen recently on cutting down the waiting times with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Let us be radical about this.  If there is one political lesson to learn from the Covid pandemic over the past 12 months, it is that anything is possible.  We can pass legislation in 24 hours and we can change the Constitution, if necessary.  Let us take the lessons from the Covid pandemic and realise the sky is the limit for what we want to try to do and that anything is possible.  Let us take that approach to housing and be radical about it.</p><p>When we look at the local authorities, there is something I believe we should consider.  A couple of years ago, Louth County Council was the best local authority in the country for using compulsory purchase orders to take vacant houses and put them back into the housing stock.  That is another avenue we must consider when we are looking at reintroducing housing stock.  Another thing I would appreciate is the local authorities being given definitive targets when they start building houses.  Who is responsible if they do not hit those targets?  To whom will the chief executive of a local authority be responsible?  When there are certain local authorities flying it, somebody has to be accountable to an Oireachtas committee or to the Minister to explain why the targets have not been hit consistently for the past two or three years.  That would be something to consider as well when it comes to local authority housing.</p><p>Over the next years in office, this Government has to be radical.  It must set clear, definitive targets.  How many houses, and not just houses on public land, that normal people will be living in do we want to deliver in year 1, year 2, year 3 and by the end of the Government's term?  I accept it when people say my party has been in government for ten years.  That is grand, but not a single house was built in this country for five of those years, between 2011 and 2016, when we were trying to get the country out of an economic mess.  That is a fact.  Nobody can disagree with it.  It is disingenuous that the Opposition knows that yet still harps on about a decade of no houses being built.</p><p>The final thing I wish to say relates to political ideology.  This is where the cynicism of it creeps in.  When you see local authorities constantly blocking housing at every opportunity, the higher level of it might be they have a political ideology on it and do not believe in it.  The real issue is the cynicism of it and the politics of it.  The politics of it is to delay and delay and to make it as difficult and hard as possible to build.  It is "Delay and delay, and we will reap the political benefits by exacerbating this housing crisis in the next few years".  It boils down to that.</p></speech>

I did not interrupt the Senator and I would appreciate the same respect from that side of the House.</p><p>This Government has failed.  It has failed on the housing crisis.  Despite all the rhetoric it brings here, the truth is it has failed.  The Minister has missed every deadline he has set.  He said he would have an affordable housing Bill in September.  Then it was the budget and then it was the new year.  Weekend after weekend we see more infuriating stories about home buyers being locked out of ownership.  Members talk about ownership, but this is thanks to the Fine Gael policy of throwing the doors wide open to the wrong kinds of investment funds.  It rolled out the red carpet for the vultures, just as it rolled out the red carpet for Donald Trump.  We learned on Sunday from the <i>Business Post</i>that not only is the Government supporting these funds through an unfair tax policy but also taxpayer money is being used to assist in the funds buying up the homes.  This comes as another slap on the face for anybody who is trying to buy a house, who is playing by the rules, who is paying sky-high rents or who is living with family and trying to save a deposit.  It truly shows where this Government's priorities lie.</p><p>Public money should not be used to facilitate the mass purchase of homes.  It should be used to deliver genuinely affordable purchase and affordable cost rental homes.  The Bill before us has been a long time coming.  My colleague, Senator Warfield, has outlined some of our party's concerns, but none more so than the now infamous affordable purchase shared equity scheme.  This &euro;75 million scheme, which will be doubled to &euro;150 million if the banks get approval to join in, is, we are told, a small part of the Bill.  However, it is the highest amount of money.  It is higher than the other two schemes.  The Minister's determination to plough ahead with the scheme, regardless of the expert views of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, is breathtaking arrogance.  This scheme was not in the Fianna F&aacute;il general election manifesto.  It was not in the programme for Government either.  We know where it was.  It was in the papers of lobbyists of Property Industry Ireland and Irish Institutional Property, which sold their wares to a Minister who could not come up with his own plan.  It is a return to the Fianna F&aacute;il style of reckless developer-led housing policy.</p><p>This scheme will not make homes more affordable.  It will lock in high housing costs and saddle people with more debt.  The Minister claims a similar scheme in Britain led to a 14% increase in supply.  It did.  It was a 14% increase in supply where it was not needed.  It has echoes of the Fianna F&aacute;il Celtic tiger ghost estates.  The Minister also says prices only increased by 1% in a similar scheme.  This is a lie.  That 1% did not relate to price inflation.  The only detailed analysis of this scheme was carried out by the London School of Economics and Political Science-----</p></speech>

A bit of respect, please.  Sinn F&eacute;in would deliver a minimum of 8,000 affordable homes each year - 4,000 affordable cost rental and 4,000 affordable purchase homes.  Sinn F&eacute;in would structure the financing and delivery of the affordable purchase homes to deliver an average purchase price of &euro;230,000 in Dublin and less elsewhere.  We need an approach that puts people's needs first, not one that delivers on every whim of the private developer.</p> <p>Some Members have tried to insinuate that the Sinn F&eacute;in plan would mean a person would not own his or her own home.  This is simply untrue.  The purchaser owns the home and the property is theirs to alter, extend and to pass on to their children, unlike the Government's proposal which would involve inspections of people's houses annually.

I really hope that the Bill is going to do what it says on the tin.  I have listened to what the Minister has had to say and what other speakers have had to say.  It is tremendously important legislation.  It is not an easy portfolio and notwithstanding things that have been said in this House we have actually made a lot of progress in housing.  That is not the popular thing, however.  It amused me that the last speaker stood up and said at the very beginning that one knows when one is in trouble when the others are throwing mud, and then proceeded to spend the vast majority of her time on her feet throwing mud at other people, including Senator Byrne, in what was an entirely unjustified statement.</p> <p>Putting that aside, and in terms of what the Minister said earlier, I particularly want to focus on two aspects of it, the first being affordability.  Coming as I do from D&uacute;n Laoghaire I am particularly concerned about the differentiation of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and Dublin city with regard to the affordability of houses there.  People who live in, were born in and grew up in D&uacute;n Laoghaire want to, as much as any person in any other part of the country, live close to where they are from, close to their parents and close to their support structures.  They do not earn any more money than anybody else does.  Jobs, regrettably, do not pay more money in D&uacute;n Laoghaire than jobs in Cahersiveen or Clifden or anywhere else.  I understand why there is a differentiation, but there is a fundamental unfairness in saying that affordability is somehow at a higher level in D&uacute;n Laoghaire than it is elsewhere.</p> <p>I understand that land costs more and property costs more in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  As someone who is trying to buy a house there at the moment I acutely understand this difficulty.  As a State we should be stepping in to level the playing field in that area, and say to people that we recognise they want to live where they are from and that we do not believe things should be more expensive for them than in other parts of the country just because they come from that area.  In that regard, the State needs to step in to bridge the gap in land prices between houses, be they in Shankill, Blackrock, Foxrock or D&uacute;n Laoghaire and houses in Clonmel or Portlaoise, or anywhere else in the country.  I have a difficulty with that aspect of the Bill, but I recognise the difficulties that arise with it.</p> <p>The second aspect I will focus on relates to something the Minister said at the outset of his speech about being in favour of home ownership.  This is tremendously important for a number of reasons.  It is not just because we aspire to own our own homes, and I have heard other Senators speaking about this: of course we do.  Everybody does.  There is an ingrained thing in the psyche of Ireland about land ownership, but really we are talking about home ownership here.  I do not know if we still do have it, but for most of my lifetime Ireland has had the highest rates of owner-occupiers of homes in Europe.  There is a long-standing tradition of people owning the homes they live in.  People want that and I understand it.  It is expensive and undoubtedly for 99.9% of people it is the most money they will ever spend on anything in their lives.  It is the greatest liability people will have in their lives.  People chain themselves to a mortgage for all of their working lives to achieve it, but yet people want to do that.  Beyond that, it is very important to know that home ownership gives people a stake in society.</p> <p>After the financial crash we saw issues.  I became the owner of a small one-bedroom apartment before the crash, regrettably, and for a very long time it was in negative equity, as many of my generation were.  It still is not worth what I paid for it.  People suffered disproportionately, relative to other generations, at the time of that crash.  Before that we had a situation where people wanted to own property and to a large extent achieved that.  After the crash, people could not do that.  As a result, along with all of the other disaffection in society, people no longer had a stake.  They no longer were part of society, and therefore they had no buy-in into Ireland and what Ireland brings.</p> <p>Sometimes we forget what a fantastic country we have, the stability we have, the functions we have and the services we have.  God knows it is not perfect but one can, for the most part, enjoy a safe and fruitful life in Ireland.  That is true for the vast majority of citizens.  Of course, there are people who fall through the net and we desperately need to catch those people.  Home ownership is one of the ways to do that.  It brings those people into the fold.  It brings them in on a par with their colleagues who can afford to buy houses.  This is at the core of affordability of housing.  It allows people to be included, allowing them to come with the wave and the tide that raises all boats, which we are forever talking about.  It allows people to be part of that movement.  To exclude them is to exclude them, on one level, from society.  It is not going to be possible for everyone, and of course there is substantial work to be done on the provision of social housing.  That has been ramped up since the crash.  While never enough, we have improved.  This is laudable.  This Bill must deliver for those people, and allow all of the people who want to and who possibly can to become part of a home-owning generation, a part of society that contributes and receives - most importantly - from that society.  Without it we are excluding people who do not need to be excluded.</p></speech>
