I am very glad to get an opportunity to speak about this topic of the deposit return scheme.  It is a concept that has potential to enable an entirely new way that people look at packaging and create new, positive habits for our country.  It is a gateway to an entirely new way of consuming goods and re-imagining the concept of packaging.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am sure that some of us remember running around as children and lifting any glass bottles that we could find in order to sell them back to the shops to earn enough money to eat our weight in Macaroon Bars, Clove Drops and cough sweets.  I have wonderful memories of picking bottles out of ditches, cleaning them and bringing them back to my local shop where Mrs. Barry, who is now deceased, would take control of the transaction and look after us very eager and sugar deprived children.  That model, irrespective of the motives back then, is very similar to the circular economy that we need to incorporate into our lives.  The Minister of State will agree with me that we need to design products that will last.  This country needs a drinks deposit returns scheme that is as ambitious as possible.  I will understand if the a scheme is introduced in a phased way but I urge that targets are set for each phase and that we legislate for the targets.  I stress that there needs to be clear timelines to include glass, carton packaging and the move towards a digital deposit returns scheme, DRS, thus enabling the model to be expanded into a reuse model.  The DRS should use a variable fee that includes all of the materials.  Such an scheme would be a powerful tool to improve recycling rates and make consumers think twice about the environmental impact of the product that they buy.</p><p>I hope that the scheme has a variable rate fee and that containers are allocated a deposit value based on the size.  A flat-rate model or fixed fee could apply to all beverage containers.  Recently I met representatives of the Aluminium Packaging Recycling Organisation Ireland, ALUPRO, who highlighted that research shows that the possibility would cause an unfair advantage for plastic bottles as many consumers would be unwilling to pay extra upfront in terms of the flat rate for, say, a 24-can multi-pack compared with the far cheaper 2 litre bottle.  We should acknowledge that packaging is not worthless or should not be seen as waste.  We need to move towards a scheme of a deposit return for packaging for the reuse model and only use the linear single-use recyclable model in the most limited circumstances.  There will still be a need for single-use plastics but we need to reduce where practicable and always incentivise companies to change to better products.  Ireland is a small nation and has a huge opportunity to make its economy one of the best examples of a circular economy.  I am incredibly ambitious for this deposit returns scheme.  I want this Government to be bold and ambitious too.  People want a modern, accessible and wide-ranging scheme.</p><p>Recently I had an interesting meeting with representatives of the Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment or ACE Ireland and we discussed this topic.  ACE Ireland believes that a digital or smart deposit returns scheme should be examined alongside the conventional return to retail scheme.  A digital DRS would ultimately prove a more flexible and adaptable system for widening the scope of acceptable materials.  In order for there to be less waste we need to enable people to change.  A digital system would result in a more user-friendly system where customers could access a scheme through placing materials in their mixed dry recycling bins that are collected at the kerbside.  A digital DRS could also remove the burden on consumers who store used packaging materials in their homes and return them in bulk to shops or supermarkets during their next visit.  I want people to change but we need that help.  We need to make recycling easy.  We need to incentivise, encourage, create opportunities and create ways to access a new-age circular economy in Ireland.  We can do that by using modern and ever upgrading technology to provide a DR scheme.  I know that such developments cannot happen overnight but we can do it in the next five years if we are really ambitious to provide such a scheme.</p></speech>

Many people remember, with some nostalgia, that they could get money back for bottles.  Just like the Senator I recall going to the local pub before I was of an age where I was allowed in and returning bottles and getting money for them.  It was a clear link and reduced the amount of litter on the ground.  People understand the concept.  They know that a DRS is good and has worked in the past.  A lot of principles within the circular economy involve a return to practices that our parents would have engaged in such as repairing clothes, shoes, etc.</p> <p>On the specific point of a digital returns scheme, this is something that we have looked at and the industry has lobbied for same.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With that in mind, the regulations we issued allow for a digital returns scheme.  It is possible within those regulations to allow for variable pricing.  I understand the benefits that can come from offering different amounts of money depending on how recyclable a product is.  I can see the advantages.</p><p>The challenge for me is that such a scheme, as far as I am aware, is not commercially operating anywhere.  I am bringing in a scheme which will operate for 5 million people in one go.  I need to bring in something I know will work.  I know the industry has carried out a pilot scheme in one area, which is a good first step.  There were 200 people involved but I am bringing in a scheme for 5 million people.</p><p>The programme for Government marked a turning point in how Ireland approaches waste management and the circular economy.  Instead of narrowly focusing on how we treat and dispose of the waste we produce, the Government is committed to building a circular economy where waste is minimised, economic growth decoupled from resource consumption and the value of goods and materials retained in our economy for as long as possible.</p><p>Reforming our use of plastic is one of the key measures outlined in the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy.  Tackling our excessive use of single-use plastics is an urgent priority here and across the EU.  Under the 2019 single-use plastics directive, Ireland must achieve a collection target of 90% recycling for plastic bottles by 2029, with an interim target of 77% by 2025.  A report prepared for my Department concluded that a deposit return scheme, DRS, is the only feasible way to achieve the required levels of performance under the single-use plastics directive.</p><p>In September 2020, the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy set out a roadmap for the introduction of a deposit return scheme in the third quarter of 2022.  To deliver on this objective, a public consultation on the design options of such a DRS was completed in 2020 and a working group of Department officials and stakeholders was established to discuss the implementation of the scheme.  The group met on a number of occasions and, arising from these discussions, a second public consultation focusing on the preferred model was completed early in 2021.  The preferred model that emerged is based on a return to retailer in respect of plastic bottles and aluminium drinks cans.  The beverage industry will fund and operate the scheme.</p><p>The separate collection DRS regulations 2021 give effect to the outcome of this policy development.  They were published in November and provide the framework for the approval of a scheme operator.</p><p>The regulations introduce a requirement on producers to establish a DRS or to appoint a body to operate it on their behalf.  The deposit return scheme will apply to beverage bottles manufactured from polyethylene terephthalate, PET, with a capacity of up to 3 l and beverage containers manufactured from aluminium or steel with a capacity of up to 3 l.  They also introduce an application and approval process for the appointment of an approved body to operate the scheme, set out the functions to be carried out by such an approved body, the obligations required of producers, retailers and return points and make provisions relating to the deposit to be paid.</p><p>While these regulations represent a significant milestone in the introduction of a DRS, some important issues remain to be addressed in further regulations.  Some technical and transitional matters required further considerations, including planning exemptions for DRS infrastructure and VAT matters and the level of the deposit zero rated in the November 2021 regulations, enforcement arrangements and some limited exemptions.</p><p>The next milestone in the project is the appointment of an approved body to operate the scheme.  I understand from industry representatives that in recent weeks a company was incorporated which will design and propose a deposit return scheme for my approval.  While industry has noted that the timeframe for introduction of quarter 3 of 2022 is ambitious, my Department is monitoring progress closely.</p><p>I have allowed further time to consider the level at which a deposit should be set and to consider matters such as whether the deposit should be variable and what provisions should apply to beverage containers sold as part of a multipack.  Senator McGreehan raised this issue and I take her point.  However, I will introduce further regulations prior to the introduction of the scheme to establish, among other things, the level of deposit for the materials to be collected.</p></speech>

I have a dream that our waste and packaging will not be perceived as waste, rather as a valuable part of our economy for which there is always a use.  We spend substantial amounts on picking up waste.  Councils' resources are stretched by picking up rubbish.  It is not rubbish, however, but a valuable product that we should always utilise.</p> <p>The Minister of State has the support of Fianna F&aacute;il in pushing for a reuse model for packaging throughout the commercial and small business sector, with incentives and support to make it possible for consumers to change over.  He will have buy-in from all consumers and businesses.</p> <p>I want to hold on to the wind of change and make sure we succeed, in the lifetime of this Government, in bringing in a positive, worthwhile and proper circular economy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to hold onto that and make sure that we succeed in bringing in a really positive and worthwhile proper circular economy within the lifetime of this Government.

I have to give the Department credit for doing a lot of work, before I was appointed, in engaging with the industry.  I refer not just to the people making bottles, but to the retailers themselves.  They were making sure that it would not be a scheme that would work in theory but not in practice or something that people would be against.  Part of that involved bringing retailers to meet their equivalents in other countries where the scheme had been running for decades and allowing one supermarket owner to say directly to another what happens in practice, how the scheme works and how it can be made work.</p> <p>Last week, I was in Spain for St. Patrick's Day and I visited the person who is in charge of setting up the scheme in Spain, which is facing the same issues as we are although it is not as far down the road as we are.  Engagement is the most important part so that we do not bring in a scheme that works in theory but not in practice.  We have the industry, the retailers and the public on side.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned littering during the pandemic.  One would wake up in the morning and find the remains of picnics.  When the bars were closed, people, and not just young people, were leaving large quantities of cans and bottles in fields.  That is not going to happen when they are worth money.  Nobody is going to leave cash on the ground.  It will be an immediate solution to that problem.  I expect the Tidy Towns groups will find that not only will there be much less to pick up, but that what they do pick up will be worth money.</p></speech>

I will share time with my colleague, Senator Conway.  Senator Ahearn sends his apologies.  He has his own very strong views on the issue of overcrowding in University Hospital Limerick.</p> <p>From my own experience and from hearing from people in Limerick, I know that there are great concerns.  Only today, I spoke to a man who has been in hospital for three weeks.  He is seriously ill and has a lot of underlying health conditions.  When he first went into University Hospital Limerick, he spent at least three days on a trolley.  He is still in the hospital three weeks later.  He is very grateful for the care and attention he received once he got into the hospital but spending three days on a trolley when one is very sick is not acceptable.  He is just one example of the many people who are waiting on trolleys.</p> <p>There are no visitors allowed at the moment.  Visits are very restricted unless somebody is very seriously ill, a child or a confused patient.  That is a result of Covid.  The number of people with Covid is increasing, as we are all very aware.  There were 97 Covid patients in University Hospital Limerick yesterday, which is a really high number.  That is adding to the troubles.  My concern is that people are going into the hospital and waiting on trolleys.  As I said, the care they receive is excellent but there is also the matter of the safety of the people working in the hospital.  They are working under very difficult conditions.  I have been speaking to patients and to staff.  I know there was to be a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, investigation.  I am concerned that the Taoiseach said that there would be a HIQA investigation but that the Minister for Health said that he would consider it.  That needs to be clarified.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If there is to be a visit to the hospital, this should not be recognised or announced.

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach agus leis an Aire St&aacute;it, who is very welcome to the House.  I agree with the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Byrne, who, like me, has been inundated with people&rsquo;s views on what is happening in Limerick.  It is not at all attractive and is not something we can stand over.</p> <p>In spite of the great work being done by the nurses, clinicians and consultants on the ground, a problem remains and I cannot really work it out.  Some &euro;40 million was spent on building a state-of-the-art, brand new accident and emergency department in 2014.  A modular unit was then deemed necessary because the overcrowding persisted and &euro;22 million was made available by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in 2017 to build a 62-bed modular unit on the grounds of University Hospital Limerick.  Despite this, the numbers on trolleys at UHL are the highest in the country.  They range from 80 to 100 depending on the day of the week.  On Mondays and Tuesdays, the figure is usually over 90.  The problem then seems to dissipate somewhat towards the end of the week because discharges and so forth run relatively smoothly.</p> <p>We must ask what the management situation is in University Hospital Limerick.  Are management clinicians on duty at weekends?  I suspect not.  Are people on duty at the weekend who are in a position to sign discharge documentation for people?  I suspect not.  I suspect we are dealing with a management issue, from both a front-door perspective in the hospital and a back-door discharge perspective. </p> <p>A commitment has been made to have an independent inquiry and we are told it is to be carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  It is not ideal that HIQA is carrying out this inquiry given that it has already stated it does not consider that there is an issue in University Hospital Limerick.  Really and truly, it should be an independent inquiry.  If it is to be carried out by HIQA, let it be HIQA but let us get on with it.  I want a timeline from the Minister of State for when the inspection and inquiry will start and conclude.  Will the recommendations be published and acted upon?</p></speech>

Senator Ahearn cannot be present and I acknowledge that he has also raised this issue previously.</p> <p>I acknowledge the distress that overcrowded emergency departments, EDs, cause to patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  Senator Byrne spoke about the case of an elderly gentleman who spent three days on a trolley.  That is just not acceptable to anyone and is definitely not good enough.  On top of extremely high emergency department attendances, the health sector is also under significant pressure from Covid-19, as was mentioned.</p> <p>Yesterday there were 1,308 Covid patients in hospital, 83 of whom were in UHL.  The emergency department in Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with over 76,000 attendances in 2021, up 16% compared with 2020 and 7% compared with 2019.  However, the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys for admission in UHL in 2021 were 4.7% lower than in 2020 and 35% lower than in 2019.  </p> <p>The University Limerick Hospitals Group has reported that it is continuing to deal with high volumes of patients attending the UHL emergency department, a pattern that has been sustained over a number of months and is being replicated around the country. </p> <p>UHL is working to ensure that care is prioritised for the sickest patients.  As part of its escalation plan, additional ward rounds, accelerated discharges and identification of patients for transfer to UL Hospitals Group model 2 hospitals are all under way.  There has been continuing substantial investment in UHL and the wider hospital group in recent years to address capacity issues, including a new emergency department that opened in 2017.  This was referred to by Senator Conway.</p> <p>Since the start of 2020, 98 new beds have opened at UHL.  This included a 60-bed modular ward block, which became operational in November 2020, established to provide a rapid-build interim solution to begin to address the bed capacity issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This also included a 24-bed single-room block which functions as a dedicated haematology oncology unit, and a temporary 14-bed single-room block designated for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients, initiated in May 2020 under the national action plan in response to Covid-19.</p><p>The winter plan for 2021 to 2022 was published on 15 November.  It builds on the significant investment in last year's winter plan and the additional capacity delivered in health services in 2021.  The winter plan aims to address the significant combined challenges faced by the health service over the winter period and recognises that a whole-system response is required across primary, community and acute care.  The scale of these challenges and the demands our health system faces require both a plan and an associated system of governance and accountability.  The winter plan sets out the national, area and site level leadership and governance arrangements that are in place.</p><p>The matter of performance in hospital emergency departments is under constant review by the Department through ongoing engagement with the HSE.  The situation is still very distressing.  There is a situation where patients are in the emergency department on trolleys.  Yesterday, there were 83 people in the hospital who have Covid.  The most important thing we can do is to improve throughput in the hospital so that when a person is deemed well enough, he or she is discharged.  We have put substantial investment into step-down beds, transitional beds and home care.  The most important thing is that we can transition people through hospitals as quickly as possible.</p><p>It is very distressing for families, patients and staff when there are high numbers on trolleys, and I know this is happening daily in Limerick.</p></speech>

The staff work very hard but staff morale is at an all-time low.  It is a question of safety for the staff and the patients.  Once most patients get into the system, they have an excellent experience, but it is about getting into the system.  It is not acceptable.  As Senator Conway said, there has been a lot of funding and new beds, but there is a problem and it needs an independent investigation to see what that problem is.  It needs a fresh pair of eyes looking at the situation.  Realistically, this cannot continue.  I know other places have engagement with private hospitals, as we had during Covid, so they can use other beds or transfer patients.  I believe there needs to be an outsider looking in to find new ways of doing things.</p></speech>

The Government has stood up to the plate on each and every occasion when a request has gone in, even to the stage of committing to build a new 96-bed unit, which I believe has gone out for tender and which will in real terms create 48 beds.  That is happening.  Everything the team has looked for, it has got, so I want to know where the problem is.  The only way we are going to find that out is by somebody going in, drilling down, asking the hard questions and challenging people as to what is going on.  At the end of the day, it is taxpayers&rsquo; money but, much more importantly, there are people who are very sick, sitting on trolleys.  That is something none of us here will defend and nobody within the health service should defend.  That is why questions have to be asked but they need to be answered.</p></speech>

The new 60-bed modular ward block at UHL is a significant step in addressing this and provides modern single-room inpatient accommodation with improved infection prevention and control capabilities.  This follows the completion of two separate rapid-build projects delivered under the Government's national action plan in response to Covid-19, which provided an additional 38 inpatient beds on site at UHL.  Furthermore, Project Ireland 2040 includes provision for a 96-bed replacement ward block at UHL.  This project has now been tendered in line with public procurement requirements, with tenders returned on 3 February.  This tender evaluation process is under way and it is hoped to progress this process in the coming weeks with a view to seeking HSE board approval for the award of the works contract.  If that can be escalated as quickly as possible, it would have a major impact.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department and the HSE will continue to work with local hospital management to further improve patient experience in UHL.</p><p>Both Senators raised HIQA and an investigation.

The Commencement matter is about municipal bonds and the important issue of financing local government.  I was spurred on to table the matter by an inquiry from Councillor Karey McHugh Farag, on Galway County Council, who is doing a master's degree on the issue of bonds and the importance of funding to local government.</p> <p>The Minister of State knows and I know, as I think all politicians in these Houses know, that local government is experiencing significant difficulties and challenges with the provision of ongoing funding.  My focus is on how we might in some way leverage some mechanism of bonds.  There are similar operations in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States.  I am familiar to a lesser extent with the position in Britain but am very conscious of what is happening in Denmark and Belgium.  There are other imaginative mechanisms and innovative ways of leveraging money for essential infrastructure projects.  We have to learn about best practice.  There has to be alternative infrastructure financing that we can use in respect of strategies in developing long-term infrastructural development that communities and local government need.</p> <p>I wish to focus on three issues today.  How can we look at the need for new funding sources to generate resources for infrastructure projects?  How can we look at new financing mechanisms that offer flexibility but also the potential for cost-effective ways of financing critical infrastructure across the country?  How can we look at new financial arrangements and synergies that involve the private sector and that partner with the private sector, the non-profit sector and the public sector?  They can all participate and ultimately have some benefit in these critical infrastructure projects.  That is the key.  We all want to deliver critical infrastructure, and there are a number of key issues when we look at this.  We need to help to fund new development.  We need to match payments with benefits in some way.  If people put something into this, they need to have some benefit.  It is very important that this is a mechanism whereby we can raise funding.  This is critical and does not require voter approval.  It should be remembered that the electorate votes people into office to get on with the job.  We should not apologise in that regard.  People are put into power and into office to get on with the job.  We know the importance of critical infrastructure.  Yes, there are weaknesses in the system in terms of administration.  I do not want to overburden local government administration with the administration of additional mechanisms, particularly in the area of finance and funding, but there is enormous potential if we develop imaginative and constructive ways of looking at infrastructural funding.</p> <p>In summary, like many elements of local government, these elements are challenging, but we need innovation, we need infrastructure and we need finance.  That has to be at the very heart of new projects if we are to succeed.  There is no doubt but that there is ambition in local government and on the part of central government, although perhaps not enough.  If I have any criticism of central government, it is that it lacks real commitment to devolving real powers back to communities.  We talk about mayors and reform of local government, but nowhere do I see a real commitment centrally, in central government, to devolve powers.  When powers are devolved to somebody else, be it local government or whatever else, that must come with finance.  The core issue I would like the Minister of State to look at today and maybe undertake to look at further with his officials in the Department is how we can leverage finance and bonds to facilitate the roll-out of our ambition, which is critical infrastructure and the engine to get the economy and communities going.</p></speech>

It is a really interesting question.  He and I have debated this on a number of occasions, both in the Chamber and in these corridors.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Local government services such as those referenced in the matter raised here today are funded in a variety of ways.  Some programmes are supported by Exchequer funding and others from local authorities' own income, often a combination of both.  Local authority income, in turn, comes from sources such as commercial rates, local property tax, charges for goods and services and, importantly in the context of the matter raised, through borrowing.  </p><p>There is a framework in place to manage local authority borrowing, with authorities having recourse to the Housing Finance Agency, retail banks and to both the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.  Municipal bonds do not form part of this framework and are not considered necessary at the current time, although they could be given consideration.</p><p>Local authority borrowing and overall compliance with fiscal rules are managed and monitored by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in conjunction with the CSO and the Department of Finance.  These rules form part of the EU Stability and Growth Pact, which has its origins in the Maastricht treaty.  Under the pact, there is a limit on budget deficits across the EU.  As part of this, the general government balance, GGB, monitors borrowings and budget surpluses or deficits across the wider government sector, which includes local government.</p><p>Adherence to these rules by individual authorities requires a balanced revenue account and keeping the net increase in non-mortgage borrowing within approved levels.  It is for this reason that local authorities are required to seek sanction from the Department, or to quote from the legislation, from the appropriate Minister, for all borrowing, over and above the requirement for formal approval by the elected members.</p><p>Expenditure of local authority reserves or own resources, including development contributions which often contribute to community infrastructure such as lighting and footpaths, is also subject to GGB limits.  In order to ensure Ireland remains compliant with the overall pact, local authorities have been directed that capital expenditure should generally not exceed capital income within the reporting year.  Notwithstanding that, within the overall limits, there is capacity for the expenditure of capital balances and own resources, subject to sanction.  In reviewing requests for both borrowing sanction and the expenditure of reserves, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed, that contractual commitments and ongoing projects can proceed; and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently.  The Department makes every effort to facilitate all such requests.  </p><p>Compliance with the pact means that member states must avoid deficits above 3% of GDP and must limit public debt to 60% of GDP.  To put that in context, in 2020 Ireland recorded a deficit of 4.9% and a debt to GDP ratio of 58.4%.  There is therefore a need to carefully manage any proposed increases in local authority borrowing within the overall envelope.  There are no current plans to expand the borrowing options available to local authorities through the introduction of municipal bonds, which as I have said are not at present a feature of the local government funding model.  Having said that, it is critically important that research is done into alternative sources of funding for local authorities.  The Senator mentioned that research piece.</p></speech>

It is clear there is no intention of introducing municipal bonds.  I have read extensively in a number of papers in the last few days.  There is a lot of information on best practice in other jurisdictions.  It is something we should look at.  We have to be ambitious.  We have ambitious public representatives in local authorities.  We have ambitious chief executives in local authorities.  The Minister of State knows from Kilkenny that there is no shortage of ambitious ideas coming up from the ground.  I understand we have to operate within the fiscal rules and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage ultimately has a role as does the Department of Finance.  However, we can be more ambitious.  We have to convince the people we represent in local communities that we can deliver greater infrastructure and develop a range of greater resources.  However, they have to be financed.  People are ready to commit to financing local authorities.  People do not expect everything for nothing.  They are not looking for a free ride.</p> <p>Perhaps the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, of which I am a member, could look at the matter and work with the Department.  Let us look at municipal bonds, how they work internationally and whether we can apply any aspect of that to our own situation in Ireland.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in today.</p></speech>

The suggestion he made there is very useful.  It would be a really useful exercise for the housing committee to have a look at this and at the overall funding of local government in general.  We have a significant challenge.  As the Senator rightly said, our local authorities are ambitious both at corporate level and among the elected members.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They show real innovation - often in the face of dwindling resources - yet they cannot continually rely on car parking charges or development contributions, which are not sustainable sources of funding.  We are trying to decouple them and move towards sustainability.  If we look at possibilities around public banking and local authorities being involved in that or developing energy supply companies, we can see there are opportunities there on which local authorities in other European countries have been leading.  We should look at all options given the challenges we face and the opportunities, particularly around climate action, biodiversity and all various aspects of local authorities' work, which is expanding.  The work rate is expanding and yet the funding sources are challenging.  The Department will continue to work with local authorities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is deeply committed to doing that but it is important to consider all sources.</p></speech>

I am conscious she is busy today taking a lot of issues for other Departments.  I have enormous respect for all officials within the Department of Foreign Affairs for the work they do and our ambassadors.  My question is about how we appoint our ambassadors.  At present, the recruitment of ambassadors is essentially through the ranks of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is very rare for somebody who has not come up through the ranks and served as a long-standing official in the Department of Foreign Affairs to be appointed and when it happens, it is normally somebody from another Department such as our new ambassador to London.  In the old trade union days, that would have been referred to as a closed shop.</p> <p>The Department will make the argument that there are some open competitions at lower levels within the Department but there should be an open competitive process when it comes to these very senior appointments.  The role of the ambassadors, as with others in the Department of Foreign Affairs, is to represent Ireland and promote and protect the interests and values of the State and our citizens.  Yes, people coming through the Department of Foreign Affairs can do that but so too could people with business or academic experience, contributions through charity and voluntary organisations and indeed through political life.  I am not arguing that it should be a decision of the Minister to name whoever he or she may want.  I believe it should be an open competition.  This was introduced for a number of posts in the UK.  It also happens in other jurisdictions.  The individual must show that he or she is competent and can carry out the functions of representing his or her country as an ambassador but I do not accept the argument that only people from the Department of Foreign Affairs are capable of being the representatives of our country abroad.  </p> <p>I need to be clear that I am not suggesting in any way that they should be political appointments as we see in the US, where about half of its ambassadors are appointed by the US President.  Interestingly, under Article 2 of the US Constitution, all US ambassadors must be ratified by the Senate so the question of ambassadors coming before an Oireachtas committee or even a Seanad committee to present their credentials and outline how they would represent Ireland before they are appointed to represent the country might be something we could look at in terms of Seanad reform.  The point I am making is that there are a lot of people who in many ways already represent Ireland very effectively in the arts and other areas and who may have the requisite skills to represent us.  </p> <p>I also think it would be very good for the Department of Foreign Affairs to broaden the pool to ensure there is diversity within the Department at ambassadorial rank and that it is infused with different ideas and views at a senior level.  I know the Department's argument is that we do that at the lower levels of the Department but then people are sucked into the culture and in order to progress, they must move up the ladder.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I sincerely believe it is time for reform and I hope the Minister of State will agree with me.</p></speech>

The mission of the Department of Foreign Affairs is to serve the Irish people, promote their values, advance their prosperity and interests abroad, and provide the Government with the capabilities, analysis and influence to ensure Ireland derives the maximum benefit from all areas of its external engagement.  To fulfil that mission, the Department is staffed with a team of dedicated civil servants who promote Ireland's values and interests, working from 97 embassies, consulates and representative offices across the globe as well as at the Department's headquarters in Ireland.  The Senator's question is very timely as our ambassadors have been very much to the fore in the past week for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and engagements throughout the world.  They do an excellent job.</p> <p>Decisions on the appointment of ambassadors of Ireland are taken by Government on foot of proposals made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Ambassadors are then appointed by the President and take up duty abroad following the receipt of agreement from the receiving state.  When considering the recommendations for the appointment of ambassadors, the Minister takes into account a wide range of factors, including political, economic and trade priorities for the post in question.  In addition, applicants' management experience, regional knowledge, country knowledge, relevant language skills, policy experience, consular experience and other factors are taken into account as part of the process.  The Minister also takes gender balance into account in the nomination of ambassadors.  For example, the latest appointments to heads of mission posts consisted of 11 men and 11 women, bringing the gender breakdown of heads of mission serving overseas to 37 women and 59 men.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, Ireland has a long and proud tradition of a non-political Civil Service and the individuals nominated as ambassadors are drawn from that service.  I note the Senator was very clear that he was not suggesting these would be political appointments.  Since the foundation of the State, Ireland has regularly demonstrated its capacity to exert influence and make a distinctive contribution on the international stage.  Civil servants and those appointed as ambassadors have played a crucial role in these efforts.  All currently serving ambassadors are established career civil servants employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and recruited through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, or competitions administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs in accordance with the code of practice for appointment to positions in the Civil Service and public service, as set out by the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  Open recruitment competitions are held to join the diplomatic service at third secretary, first secretary and counsellor level.</p> <p>Officers recruited to join the diplomatic service are tested on key competency areas relevant to the grade during the recruitment process.  Resilience, resourcefulness and a commitment to foreign language learning are among the requirements.  The Department also works closely with the PAS to build diversity in the Department of Foreign Affairs and ensure it is representative of the people it represents.</p> <p>I thank the Senator again for his question and would, of course, welcome his support and that of all Members in encouraging applications to open recruitment competitions to join the diplomatic service.</p></speech>

I certainly would encourage anyone to serve in a public service capacity.  I note that the reply from the Department of Foreign Affairs avoids the question I asked.  It does, however, make a very clear point in stating that when the Minister is considering an appointment, he will look at applicants' "management experience, regional knowledge, country knowledge ... language skills, policy experience" and so on.  However, he only looks at those factors among a very limited pool of individuals, namely, people from within his Department.  The argument I am making is there is very rich talent in this country.  We have people from a vast range of different backgrounds who may have been able to gather that experience in other fields.  They should be able to compete openly to enter public service at ambassadorial level.  It would serve any Minister very well for such people to have that opportunity.  To ensure greater diversity within our public service and to ensure it is no longer a closed shop, competition should be open for positions for ambassadors representing our country and all of its citizens.</p></speech>

To ensure that our diplomatic team is of the highest quality and representative of the people of Ireland, the Department works closely with the PAS to ensure a robust and fair recruitment process for diplomatic grades.  In the last year, the PAS has administered open competitions to the grades of counsellor, first secretary and third secretary.  Further recruitment to the diplomatic service is expected later this year.  All competitions are advertised on the PAS website and via social media.  Officers who have been recruited through the open recruitment competition represent Ireland abroad including as ambassadors.</p> <p>I accept the Senator's point that we should look at having greater diversity.  Knowing how tenacious he is, I have no doubt that this will not be the last time we will hear this issue being raised in the Seanad.</p></speech>

It is to pay tribute to the late David Hill, who was playing with the Scottish Parliament against the D&aacute;il and Seanad team on Saturday and tragically passed away during the match.  We had come to know David immensely well over the past three or four years, both from going to Edinburgh to play and from them coming here.  David was an incredibly nice young man.  He had worked for the Scottish Conservative Party for a number of years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He was well respected not only by those in his party but by people across the political spectrum in Scottish politics.  That was a testament to the concept of parliamentary rugby, which is that the political differences that we all experience in political parties are left at the door when we go to play.  David was a young man who was tragically taken away from his family.  I send our heartfelt prayers and thoughts to David's family and to his friends, not only in the Scottish Parliament but also in wider society.</p><p>I listened to his boss, Mr. Jamie Greene, Member of the Scottish Parliament, this morning talk about how somebody had kindly left a vase of daffodils on David's desk in the Scottish Parliament.  He said he hoped and felt that the vase of daffodils would serve as a small reminder that even in the darkest depths of winter, spring will come.  I really hope that will come along for David's friends and family as soon as possible.  I acknowledge David's father, Rodger, his mother, Sharon, his step-parents, Lesley and Gordon, his younger siblings, Alex and Georgia, and his two adored nephews, Freddie and Hunter.  It is a horrific tragedy.  It is one of those things, and I do not say this lightly, whereby at whatever stage we are in this life we do not know what our last interaction with a loved one or anyone could be.  That was brought home to many of us on Saturday.</p><p>I pay tribute to the paramedics who spent 35 to 40 minutes working on David on the pitch last Saturday.  We want to send from the Oireachtas to David's family and friends our deepest and most heartfelt sympathies on this most awful tragedy for David Hill and his family.</p></speech>

The Senator knew him personally and I understand he was in his company over the weekend.</p> <p>On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I ask the House to reflect on and remember a former Member of this House who passed away over the past few days, Mr. Paul Kavanagh.  He served here for a period in the 1980s.  He was undoubtedly a dynamic force in Irish business at the time.  He sat on the boards of An Post, Aer Lingus, Eircom and IDA Ireland.  He had groundbreaking skills and abilities in the printing and fulfilment sector and went on to become an internationally renowned businessman, heading up Stream International and Donnelly Documents, a US multinational.  He gave freely of his time to many people to assist them in developing their business.  He was the brains behind the Dublin Digital Hub, which today houses more than 70 companies and employs 700 people.  He was also one of those involved in the International Financial Services Centre and played a part in its development.  I am sure the House will join me in expressing sympathy to his wife, Anne-Marie, his son, Killian, daughters, Fiona and Sinead, and his sisters, Hillary and Colette.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p> <p>The rising price of fuel is having an impact on all aspects of society.  However, it is having a significant and disproportionate impact on the lives of those whose work is caring for people in their homes.  These are workers employed by the HSE in a private capacity and sometimes through section 39 agreements.  The extreme cost they are now undertaking as a result of the increase in the price of fuel is resulting in many of them giving up their work or not taking on that work.  That is having an impact on people who are trying to be looked after in their homes.  If we do not find a way of resolving this problem, there will certainly be a situation where more people will end up in hospital.  They will not be able to be discharged from hospital to return to the home for recuperation because, quite frankly, the home care packages are unable to be delivered.  I have spoken to many people over the past number of weeks who no longer have the same level of care.  They just cannot get the people to provide that care in the home.  That is a crisis that must be dealt with and I appeal to the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform to address it without delay.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We are told today, through documents to the Cabinet that have been well reported, that Ireland could be expected to take up to 200,000 refugees in the coming weeks.  That will pose a very significant challenge to the State but I have every expectation we will be able to achieve and address it, especially if what I have seen in my county of Clare over the past two to three weeks is anything to go by.  There is a level of support that communities are putting behind the refugees when they arrive that is phenomenal.  I visited areas over the weekend, including Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, Kilkee, Shannon and Ennis, where refugees are being catered for in hotels and other community settings.  There is an outpouring of support from Irish people who want to help, coming in the form of fundraising and provision of supplies, and it is a credit to the good nature of Irish people.</p><p>There is some suggestion we are not playing our part because we are not militarily aligned in this conflict.  We do humanitarian support really well and it does not require the State to direct it.  It is in our DNA and in our nature.  I see it even in our young.  I met some of the Ukrainian families in Kilkee over the weekend together with Councillor Cillian Murphy.  When we were chatting with the families I saw in the corner of my eye three young fellows dressed in soccer kits walking into the foyer of the hotel carrying an expensive leather soccer ball.  Perhaps it was a Christmas or birthday gift.  Together with a welcoming card, they handed it over to three young Ukrainian boys.  If that is not the epitome of the kind of support that exists for people who have, sadly, had to leave their homeland, I do not know what is.  Nothing reflects better on the Irish people not just for this generation but the coming generations.  It is that level of community involvement that is required.  It is a spirit of support in our DNA that will see us through what will have to be a great challenge for all aspects of society.</p></speech>

I hope we will issue them with a major c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and welcome.  I put this against a background of our celebrations for St. Patrick's Day.  I extend my good wishes to the Taoiseach, who I know is stuck in the United States.  I am sure he is not stuck and is using his time constructively.  I wish him well and a speedy recovery before he returns.  I thank and acknowledge the work of our Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, in the United States over the past ten days.  He and the Taoiseach were effectively ambassadors for us, promoting and connecting with the Irish caucus and many others.  We must always be very grateful for the strong Irish-American connection.  We have fostered and developed it, taking advantage of it and leveraging it to a great extent for our own prosperity in the form of jobs and inward investment to the country.  It is something that should be acknowledged.</p> <p>I was in the UK some weeks ago as part of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I had an invitation to go to St. Martin-in-the-Fields to see at first hand the work going on there for the London Irish, the forgotten Irish for many.  These are not people who left in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s or 1960s.  They are people who left in the late 1980s and 1990s and they are now on the streets of London.  They receive hospitality, care and support.</p> <p>We have a history of being a displaced people and having emigration forced on us as people.  I hope we have learned something and passed the stories down through generations.  I know many of my family ended up in the United States many moons ago but they were richly connected to their humble origins, whether in Laois or the west of Ireland.  They sent back money and kept the link, the hope and the ambition.  Many of them had a successful opportunity to return.  I hope we will be mindful of our past and open our hearts, our doors and our minds.</p> <p>Looking at the history of many politicians in local communities, there has been resistance to direct provision.  I am not in favour of direct provision centres themselves.  I do not want to see people coming in from the Baltic states to be warehoused in direct provision centres.  That is not how to welcome people into a country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope we will all genuinely sustain and prolong our compassion, affection and welcome for the people who are fleeing their country terrorised and that we take some responsibility with our neighbours in the European Union to support and sustain these people and families fleeing their homes. </p><p>It is important we all remember, and I know we do so here, that many Russians living in Ukraine are being forced out of their country.

I played with the Oireachtas rugby team only a couple times in Donnybrook before Six Nations games and I know how close all the players are with those in the other parliaments.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis. </p> <p>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has seen a 49% increase in the number of requests for help with energy costs.  Recent research by Red C has found 37% of folks have cut back on essential heating and electricity.  The backdrop to all this is the most recent Government strategy on energy poverty, according to which, 475,000 households are in or at risk of energy poverty.  There were 30 price increase announcements from energy suppliers last year.  Bord G&aacute;is is introducing price rises of up to 39% next month.  While home heating oil has increased by more &euro;1,000 for 1,000 l this year, it is obvious to everyone there is cost of living crisis.  It is our job and that of the Government to do all we can to support workers and families to address the spiralling cost of heat and other energy costs to ensure households are not locked out of any supports or access to them.  The Government should cancel the scheduled carbon tax increase in May.  These are all actions the Government could take.  We should also seek a derogation from the European Commission to temporarily reduce VAT on bills as people are under great financial pressure.  Implementing just one of these measures, in addition to the &euro;1 billion to which, I am sure the Deputy Leader will tell me, the Government has already committed, would go some way to reflect the scale of the crisis.</p></speech>

It is important to note that up to 100 workers on the island of Ireland who were working with P&amp;O Ferries have been affected by this and have now lost their jobs.  This is a case of Irish Ferries mark II.  Some Members will remember that Irish Ferries engaged in the very same practice in 2005.  It pulled a stunt and tried to fire 543 workers overnight and replace them with non-unionised, low-wage labour.  Thousands of people took to the streets at that time because they recognised a threshold of decency had been breached.  We want to express our solidarity with those who have taken to the streets in protest, particularly in Britain, at this outrageous practice by P&amp;O Ferries.  The Irish Government has said it is limited in what it can do.  We have legislation in this country that provides for notification in the event of collective redundancy to both the workers and the Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, we should never be complacent.  We need to send a message to all employers who are thinking of engaging in the appalling practice of effectively firing and rehiring with labour which, we understand, is one fifth of the national minimum wage in the UK.  That is the wage that is on the table at the moment.  The last thing I want to say today is that while the Irish Government has said it is limited in what it can do here, a review needs to be undertaken of whether there are any State contracts with P&amp;O.  If so, the Government needs to terminate them immediately.  The Government in the Republic of Ireland cannot be seen as condoning or associating itself in any shape or form with a company that treats its workers in this manner.</p></speech>

He was over at the weekend representing the Scottish Parliament and passed away during the match against the Oireachtas rugby team, the D&aacute;il and Seanad XV, early on Saturday afternoon.  I met Mr. Hill the previous night at an engagement that the Scottish office had organised.  I am wearing my Scotland and Ireland flags today in his memory.  He was an absolute gentleman.  He was a really lovely human being.  He loved politics and he loved rugby even more.  They all travelled over on Friday in various different ways - some got direct flights from Scotland, some came via Heathrow and so on.  He was just a really lovely gentleman.  Respect and tributes have come in from all over and particularly from the Scottish political sphere, including everybody from Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, to the leader of the Conservative Party in Scotland.  Some of the tributes note that he was calm, helpful, professional, kind, generous, well liked and highly respected.  To his family, his parents, Rodger and Sharon; his brother, Alex; his sister, Georgia; his nephews, Freddie and Hunter; all of his colleagues in Scottish Parliament; and all of his friends, I just would like to send the deepest sympathies and condolences not just from myself and my party, but from the whole House.  It was an absolute tragedy.  It was something that we never expect to happen in a fairly amateur match.  I know many Members of this House have played in similar events in the past.  It is an absolute tragedy.  If it is appropriate, I ask that we have a minute's silence in his honour and memory at the end of this Order of Business.  Hopefully, there might be a time when the joint Houses here and perhaps the house in Scotland, Holyrood, where he was so well liked and he did so much for that rugby team, particularly, in the Scottish Parliament, can do something in the future to respect and remember him again.  I hope we can agree on a minute's silence.</p></speech>

I ask that we also have a look at the role of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  If we are to be honest, all of us as public representatives and the people who we work for and with are having a nightmare in dealing with a multiplicity of departments of agencies around customer care and customer service.  It is high time we call halt to the shoddy treatment of people by a myriad of Government Departments, semi-State companies and public bodies for the way in which they treat people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In particular, let us reflect upon those elderly people who put pay money to put credit in their phones and dial a company yet are made to wait an hour or two and their credit dwindles out of their account.  In the old days one could press button B and get one's money back but today one is given the option of pressing buttons 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 but  will only be connected to someone else.  People are sick and tired that there is no accountability and no customer care or service.  There was a time when the customer was always right.  Sadly, customer care has been outsourced to call centres, which is a situation that needs to be re-examined and looked at by a multiplicity of agencies, bodies and companies.  I ask for a debate to be arranged and suggest that we bring in the communications regulator to speak to us because the way people are being treated now is unacceptable.  People cannot get answers to basic simple questions yet at the same time companies fob people off.  I hope that the treatment of people and customer care can be prioritised.  We saw Covid used as an excuse and it was said that people were working from home but now people are moving back into their offices so there can be no excuse for the shoddy treatment of people around customer care.  I ask that the Leader facilitates a debate at her earliest convenience.</p></speech>

It is time that the debate took place and I appreciate that the middle of a worldwide crisis in Ukraine is not the best time to have it.  I was rather disappointed to see one of our colleagues, in the other House, bring forward legislation, which they hope to bring into the D&aacute;il in the next few days on the neutrality issue.  I do not think that it is the way forward but I think that there is a need for a discussion and we need to consider carefully where we go with this.  For too long the issue has been bandied about as neutral, non-neutral and all sorts of other things.  We are moving into a situation here by default where statements are being made by Ministers and the Taoiseach, which has moved Ireland's policy position from where it was to a new position of being non-aligned and, in fact, the words "non-neutral" have been used.  It is no secret that I want to send weapons to Ukraine so my position may not necessarily fall into the neutral camp but certainly the debate must take place.  The people are entitled to hear that debate take place.  I am mindful of a period when I was president of the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, and I made a statement; one of my executive members asked me who the hell gave me permission to say what I said.  This House is the House that makes decisions about how we progress the neutrality issue.</p> <p>I want to mention a second issue.  The Government has been very generous and brought forward a payment for those who were front-line workers during the pandemic but we missed out people such as those who worked in organisations like Ability West in County Galway where staff came in every day to deal with people with disabilities of one type or another.  They had to deal with all of the same front-line issues encountered by nurses in hospitals and other front-line workers.  We might have a debate on that at some stage in the future and consider what organisations are entitled to be considered for a front-line payment because staff put themselves at risk every single day when they went in to work  and dealt with people coming in for respite.</p></speech>

So for 11 days, including over the St. Patrick's holiday weekend, the people in and around Wexford town were not guaranteed to have clean water and a reliable supply.  Other parts of the country have experienced the same problem and last year my home town of Gorey had a well publicised case of E.coli.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many of us have said that one of our biggest challenges in the housing field is making sure Irish Water responds.  Clearly, it is not, so I ask again for that debate on Irish Water.</p><p>I am conscious there will be a debate tomorrow on humanitarian issues in respect of Ukraine, but we also need to look at the educational and higher education and research implications of what has happened.  A significant number of refugees who come here will look to integrate into our school system.  Quite a number of them will have experienced trauma and will need additional counselling supports.  There will be language issues in some cases.  It is important that both the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are able to respond effectively.</p><p>There are a number of anomalies.  If we treat Ukrainian students who come here as EU students, will Ukrainian students already studying here, who are currently classified as non-EU students, now receive the same treatment?  A number of Irish students had been pursuing their education in Ukraine and some in Russia.  They have now come back to Ireland and there is an issue about integrating them into the Irish system, especially because a number of these are in the medical and paramedical fields.  Will the Deputy Leader write to the two Ministers concerned to look at outlining the strategy and organise a specific debate on the education and higher educational needs of those coming here from Ukraine?</p></speech>

I send my condolences regarding their colleague from the Scottish Parliament.  I also support Senator Dooley on the vote of sympathy for former Senator, Mr. Paul Kavanagh.</p> <p>In view of the decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to dismantle the Derrybrien wind farm in Galway, who will pay the fines, &euro;17 million of which have been accrued and which are clocking up at the rate of &euro;15,000 per day?  The ESB should pay them.  I do not see why the taxpayer should have to foot the bill for those fines to Europe.  I would like the Government to make a clear statement on who will pay them and if the State would ask the ESB, which as we have seen made nearly half a billion in profits last year, to pay the fine of &euro;17 million that the State has forwarded and paid to Europe.</p> <p>In that context, we should have a very worthwhile debate on wind generation along the west coast, whether onshore or offshore.  We need a clear policy statement with regard to the big players, the ESB, Coillte and so forth, and we are not getting that.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, should come to the House, put it on the record and give a clear statement.  We have stopped all exploration along any coast in Ireland, we have an abundance of energy and, going forward, the Government has no choice but to make a clear statement.  We are in a hurry as well and we need this to be done as quickly as possible to generate all the energy we can along the west coast.</p></speech>

As someone who has been a blood donor since I was 18, I encourage anyone who is eligible to contact the blood bank and make an appointment to donate.  Only this morning, I got a text to tell me that stocks of my blood type are down to 1.6 days of supply when they should be seven days.  I cannot believe there has been no public campaign to inform gay and bisexual men that, as and from 28 March, the eligibility criteria will change.  From 28 March, a four-month deferral for gay and bisexual men will come into place and oral sex between men will no longer form the basis for a deferral.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is really welcome progress but we really need to move to an individualised risk assessment system for all donors, such as is in place in the North.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has confirmed that this will be the case in Ireland but we have no confirmed date, having only been told that it will be later this year.  I would like to hear the Minister's rationale for this phased approach as opposed to moving directly to individual-based risk assessments.  I would also like clarity as to the date on which that individual assessment system will be introduced.  I would also like confirmation as to whether the Minister will address the anomalies regarding women donating.  Under the new proposals, women who have sex with men who have had sex with other men will face a 12-month ban while that same man will be free to donate.  I ask the Deputy Leader to seek clarity on those questions but also on why this low-key approach to these changes is being taken.  The blood service is importing blood from England while there are potential donors who are completely unaware that they are eligible to give blood and could be making appointments today for next week.  This is a good news story so I have to ask the Deputy Leader why the Government is not letting people know about it, thereby allowing eligible blood donors to donate next week.</p></speech>

It is great news for football fans and our economy, which will be due to net somewhere in the region of &euro;750 million from visitor spending.  It is definitely a more realistic option than going for the 2032 World Cup.  Given that we missed out on hosting games in last year's deferred European championship because of Covid, it is fantastic for football fans to see this happening.  However, only today, we have already seen an issue develop with one of the main venues that could potentially be used for these games.  We only have two: Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium.  The issue pertains to Croke Park.  UEFA prohibits the use of temporary seating at major championship finals.  When the FAI has previously used Croke Park, such temporary seating has been installed on Hill 16.  For the venue to be used, Hill 16 would have to be converted from a terrace to a stand.  It would be ironic if a soccer tournament were to sound the death knell of one of the most famous terraces in the world.</p> <p>A memo has been brought to Cabinet today by the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, in support of the bid, and rightly so.  We need the Government to back this bid as it did the bid for the Rugby World Cup.  However, in doing so I ask the Minister of State to engage with the FAI and UEFA on the stadium issue from tomorrow with a view to allowing the prospect of safe standing.  We have seen this practice return right across Europe.  It came back in England this year, where the Hillsborough disaster initiated the conversion of terraces to stands.  Safe standing has come back in right across Europe.  I ask the Minister of State with responsibility for sport to engage on this issue right from the get-go.  The Government is going to back this bid.  We want to see it happen, we want it to be it successful and we want to see it in Croke Park.  As a sports supporter and a GAA man, I want to see it happening in Croke Park but not at the cost of seeing an end to Hill 16.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, there has been a lot of discussion of the issue and a focus group including the Department, various parents' groups and so on has discussed the potential for a new programme of July provision.  Looking at the figures from 2021, it can be seen that we set aside more than &euro;40 million but not all of this funding was used because a significant number of schools did not take part in July provision.  The reality is that a significant number of children and parents did not get the provision they needed and were entitled to as a result.  I look forward to seeing the proposals from the Department because significant changes to the scheme are needed to make sure that the children who need this provision actually get it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also raise an issue on behalf of a number of parents and advocacy groups with regard to children attending special schools and classes, and the fact that the children cannot be allowed to be excluded from school due to a chronic illness.  They should only be excluded from school based upon public health advice.  The fact is that a large number of schools are sending text messages to parents telling them to keep their children home if they have any symptoms of Covid-19.  The House will be well aware that there are a number of Covid-19 symptoms in existence, many of which mirror a great deal of typical childhood illnesses.  Yes, it is important that schools keep staff and other children safe but they cannot be excluding children who might have hay fever, for example.  That illness can continue on into September or October.</p><p>I ask and remind schools and parents that children with special educational needs have many chronic underlying conditions which have some of these symptoms.  In these circumstances, where these symptoms are known and are the ongoing health features of a child, this should not preclude the attendance of that child from school.  Parents and schools should now focus on new and acute symptoms of Covid-19 in such children.  In circumstances where this arises, and only in these circumstances, should children be kept home from school.</p></speech>

County Clare is one of the counties that has welcomed a significant number of Ukrainian refugees in the past number of days.  Almost 1,000 refugees from Ukraine are now living among us in north and west Clare.  Of those, 500 are in the town of Lisdoonvarna and almost another 200 are in the village of Ballyvaughan, just up the road.  That brings challenges with it but challenges we as a nation, a county and an area are certainly very capable of stepping up to the plate to meet.</p> <p>I appeal to all State agencies to respond, please, in a timely manner and to be quick in their decision-making, bearing in mind the background from which the Ukrainian people have come.  Teachers are needed for the schools as urgently as possible.  We need to be providing a significant number of English classes.  My understanding at the moment is that it is being proposed to have two English classes a week.  There should, however, be at least two English classes a day.  </p> <p>The one thing I have experienced from my engagement with the people from Ukraine is that they are very diverse but very much want to work and contribute to our society.  These are people who were living ordinary lives a number of weeks ago and now find themselves in this terrible situation.  My appeal today, and I am aware that we are having statements on the humanitarian aid programme tomorrow, is that every day matters.  I want each Minister to appoint liaison people within their Departments who will respond to queries from people like ourselves and the many NGOs who are out there working tremendously hard to create and ensure that the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte that we want to see extended to the Ukrainian people who are seeking refuge here with us is acted upon so that they feel welcome.

I wish to acknowledge all of the St. Patrick's Day parades and the community groups who were involved in organising those at such short notice.  The time on which the public health guidelines were lifted to when so many groups around the country co-ordinated bands, clubs, groups and organisations to come together was completely crucial.  It was also a day of solidarity with Ukraine.  As well as celebrating and coming together after a period of time with lockdown and Covid-19 we were also remembering the people of Ukraine.</p> <p>I also point to and acknowledge the investment of over &euro;11 million we are seeing with Omniplex Cinemas in three rural or perhaps regional towns.  This investment is coming to Ballinasloe, Mullingar and Nenagh.  The construction of a five-screen cinema starts today in Ballinasloe.

This House needs to be actively involved in that engagement.  We spoke about having the ability to put a body in place to help the food industry, to help the farmer at the farm gate and to show there is the ability to get a fair price.  It is part of the programme for Government and something we all support.  I would be concerned that this is a watered-down version of the food ombudsman.  The terminology of &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; has been taken out of the legislation in the heads of the Bill and we need clarity regarding whether this new body will have the teeth required to regulate this industry.  We have spoken at length about farmers getting an appropriate price at the farm gate.  This is the legislation we have all been talking about.  It is in the programme for Government and the terminology of &ldquo;food ombudsman&rdquo; was in the programme for Government.  Unfortunately, in the legislation published this afternoon, the heads of the Bill do not have that terminology.  It is about getting the core aim of this Bill right, and that has to be a fair price for the farmers at the farm gate.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am missing something.</p> <p>I give my condolences and sincere sympathy to the family of David Hill and his colleagues, and to our own colleagues who have spoken so eloquently today and from such a heartfelt place.  It could not have been easy for any of them, so our thoughts are with them as well.  I am a big supporter of any kind of cross-community sports.  I think sport is a great leveller and it brings people together.  In fact, this Sunday, in Seaview in Belfast, the Limestone United under-16s football team from north Belfast will take on Palmerstown Football Club, who are from west Dublin, close to where I grew up.  That is being supported by the Cathaoirleach and the Mental Health Commission chief executive, John Farrelly, and there will be an emphasis on mental health on the day.  Sport is a great leveller and a way we can come together.  I know there was a shared island dialogue on this recently as well.</p> <p>I also want to reflect on the 800 P&amp;O workers who were brutally and shamefully sacked a few days ago without any consultation or advance notice.  It is owned by a Dubai-based company called DP World and the action has not been taken under Irish law, but there are an estimated 25 workers from the Republic and 35 from the North.  A strong message needs to go out from this Government that that is just not acceptable.  Is there any opportunity to engage with our counterparts in the North on this issue?  As I said, the message needs to go out that it is not acceptable that they would be replaced by people who are going to work for less.  We need to take that very seriously in terms of provisions here so no other companies can take the same steps.</p></speech>

To Senators McGahon and Horkan and anyone else who was there, I say that I cannot imagine what it would have been like to be there.  It was a really shocking event.  Our thoughts are with David's family, friends and colleagues and everybody who was there at the time.  Senators McGahon and Horkan spoke very eloquently, and I could not have put better their comments on the man and the impact he had.  May he rest in peace.</p> <p>Senator Dooley spoke next.  He raised a couple of issues.  He wanted first to pay tribute to Paul Kavanagh, who served in this House, and to extend our sympathies to Paul's family, including his wife Anne-Marie.</p> <p>Senator Dooley also spoke about the rising cost of fuel, as did Senator Warfield in the context of the cost of living.  The cost of fuel is becoming a massive issue and it is going to continue.  We have to acknowledge that this is not just an Irish problem but an issue globally.  Oil prices are going up and the war in Ukraine is exacerbating the issue, so it is not just being felt here.  There is a cost-of-living debate happening in many other countries.  That is not to say we do not have a job to do here as public representatives to try to deal with it, but it is important to be honest with the public that this is not an easy issue to fix or to solve quickly.  The Government, however, is working hard to try to resolve it.  We saw the fuel allowance lump sum of &euro;125 in the last budget.  We have seen a reduction in the cost of diesel and petrol through excise, 15 cent on diesel and 20 cent on petrol.  I know it is not a lot in the wider scheme of things but it is an attempt to try to bring that cost down.  There was also the energy grant and the &euro;200 rebate to every household in the country, and now we have &euro;100 a week for every haulier to try to reduce the cost of their fuel to do their jobs, to put food onto our shelves and to keep the country running.  The Government is doing its very best to try to manage the rising cost of fuel and the cost of living, which is impacting every household and every business.  We are monitoring it very closely because we know how severe the impact is on so many households.</p> <p>Senator Dooley also spoke about the discussions at Cabinet today level about the possibility that Ireland could see up to 200,000 refugees, which is a phenomenal number of people, come into our country.  It will be an extremely difficult task.  I know from conversations I have had with my local authority in Mayo that we are looking at contingency beds in public halls and any hotel space we can find.  The difficulty is that some hotels have capacity midweek but not at the weekends.  We do not want to shift mums and their children from place to place on a Thursday and back again on a Monday.  This will really push our country and our citizens, every inch of this island, to the limit, but I have no doubt but that with the humanitarian response, the charity and the love we will show people who have arrived here and who will arrive here, we will get through this.  It will not be easy, however.  It will be really difficult.  It is really important for public representatives of all parties and none to try to refrain from any populist commentary that might inflame the situation or speak of it as though it is easy to deal with and easy to solve.  I know most will refrain, but there will always be one or two.  This is not an easy thing to deal with.  It is important that all of us band together during this time because this will not be fixed in the next six weeks.  We are talking months and years of dealing with this issue.  It will expand and become more pressing, so it is important we all collectively, as a country, work together to try to support these people as best we can and hope to God they can get back to their own country as quick as possible and that they have homes to go to.  However, when we see the devastation, it could be some time before Ukraine can be rebuilt and people can be got back to their homes, but that is the ultimate aim.  I know from talking to the Leader of the House that there will be statements on Ukraine dealing with all aspects, whether higher education, education or health, of this matter.  We will deal with this issue in this Chamber on a weekly, rolling basis.  Whatever comes along, there will be an opportunity for all Members to have their say, to contribute on the floor of the House and to work with the Government and our Ministers to try to deal with this issue collectively.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan also spoke about the refugee issue.  He acknowledged the work of our Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, and our Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in the US over St. Patrick's week, and all our Ministers who went off to represent our country and our people in what is a really important week, not just an important day, for our country in putting Ireland on the international map and building on the immense goodwill we have in so many countries across the globe, something we should never take for granted.</p> <p>Senator Warfield also paid tribute to David Hill.  He also spoke about the cost of fuel in particular but also the cost of living.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I dealt with that in my earlier contribution.  The Senator spoke about how people are cutting back on their central heating.  We certainly have to keep an eye on that issue.  For low-income households this can be the difference between putting food on the table and heating their homes.  We have to be very cautious.</p><p>Senator Sherlock spoke about the P&amp;O staff who were let go, as did Senator Currie.  I concur with both Senators that the manner in which those staff were let go was shocking.  I join with Senator Currie in remarking that we should send a message that it is not acceptable in this country.  The company's location makes it more difficult but we extend our solidarity to the workers North and South.  It is a shocking way to treat any staff member regardless of the reason behind letting them go.</p><p>Senator Horkan paid tribute this morning to David Hill and called for a minute's silence which we will do after this.  The Cathaoirleach will facilitate that.</p><p>Senator Buttimer requested a debate on customer care and customer service and the role of ComReg.  He spoke in particular about the frustration many consumers feel in trying to contact businesses when they need customer services.  Many businesses make them go through lots of hoops before they can speak to a human being.  We will certainly request that debate.</p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke this morning about the need for a debate in this House on neutrality.  That debate was requested by a colleague a couple of weeks ago.  We are working on it.</p></speech>

I will cede to that.  I might add that the debate has already happened among the public.  On many issues, the Oireachtas can be way behind where the people are at.  Nonetheless we have a job to do and it is timely that we would have a debate in the House on that issue.  It will probably be a rolling debate that will evolve over time.  Certainly it is something we need to do.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell also spoke about the &euro;1,000 payment to front-line workers.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, said that if there were challenges or issues where certain workers were excluded, they would look at that.  The attempt that was made by the Government, which was a difficult one to solve, was to try to identify those front-line healthcare workers.  I think in particular of those working in intensive care units in hospitals who were at the front line actually caring for Covid patients at a time when they were unvaccinated and there was pressure on personal protective equipment, PPE.</p></speech>

They were trying to strike the balance.  There were so many workers on the front line including in retail, delivery drivers and every aspect of healthcare, but there was a certain level where they put their lives on the line in a very real way.  Trying to identify those was not an easy task but I take the point the Senator is making.</p></speech>

I take the point.  It is a difficult one to get 100% correct.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of the boil water notice in Wexford town.  There was 11 days of a boil water notice there.  I recall that the Senator raised the issue in respect of Gorey last year in that E. coli situation.  It is no secret that Irish Water is in need of additional funding.  It is certainly worthwhile to have a debate on its role and the work it needs to do.  We will request through the Minister's office to get that at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>The Senator also requested a debate on the implications flowing from the Ukrainian situation for education and higher education.  I have put that request in today as well and will seek it at the earliest opportunity.  We will probably split the debate in two between education and higher education and request both Ministers to come in and answer the questions the Senator raised.  The situation will test our education system at all levels; there is no doubt about it.  I cannot answer the question about the Ukrainian students currently here or Irish students abroad.  Logic would dictate that if there are Ukrainian students here, they should be treated the same.  If there are new rules, they should apply to all.  That would be my view.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of the wind farm in Galway and said that the ESB should pay the fines totalling approximately &euro;17 million.  I suggest that it might be worthwhile putting in a Commencement matter on that issue as it is quite a specific and niche question.</p> <p>Senator Boylan raised the issue of blood donation and the lack of a public awareness campaign as changes are coming in on 28 March.  She suggested that it has been handled as a low-key change.  I am aware of it but perhaps that is due to being in the Oireachtas.  Maybe there is a different level of awareness.  I am not really sure.  Certainly if there is a shortage we should be publicising that the system is now more open in terms of people donating.  I tend to pass out when I give blood so it is something I cannot do as easily as others.  We should not have to be importing blood if we can increase our supply here, which would be good for everybody.  It is absolutely a worthwhile suggestion.</p> <p>Senator Cassells spoke about the likelihood that Ireland along with the UK will host the European football championships.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will not pretend to have vast knowledge of this whole area but I do think it would be a fantastic event for us to host.  I am not aware of the particular issue around Hill 16.  That was news to me this morning but it would probably be worth tabling a Commencement Matter on it because it is quite a specific issue.  Regardless of people's views on different sporting events, Hill 16 probably means something to everybody in the country.  It is a famous terrace and I would hate to see a change made that was not logical or reasonable.  What the Senator said was certainly news to me but it was very interesting and would be worth raising directly with the Minister as a Commencement Matter.  </p><p>Senator Carrigy spoke about July provision and put on the record of the House that the money allocated last year was not spent.  This has been an ongoing issue that has been raised almost every year.  Resources are available but, for some reason, schools are not availing of them and at the end of the day, students lose out.  Reform of that system is long overdue.  If resources are available, they should be spent and children should be prioritised.  If there is a reason schools are not taking up that offer, it needs to be identified and addressed.  It would be worth raising this matter with the Minister for Education - perhaps through a Commencement Matter.  Again, it is quite a specific issue.  Doing so would be quite timely as we are heading into that period.  I concur with the Senator's remarks on the need to exercise a degree of cop-on when it comes to how we deal with younger children who often have sniffly noses.  However, this should not be conflated with having Covid.  A balance must be struck because children must get their education.  We cannot be overzealous in how we apply those rules and must ensure children can get to school within reason.  I hope most schools are doing their best in that regard.  I take on board the serious issue raised by the Senator.  If children are being consistently told to stay at home, it is not an acceptable position.  </p><p>Senator Conway spoke about the Ukrainian refugees and what everyone in Clare is doing.  He spoke about the numbers coming to his county and the fantastic response from all the agencies there.</p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about the St. Patrick's Day parades.  I concur with her remarks.  I was also quite impressed with what people pulled together essentially in the space of two months.  Normally they would plan a St. Patrick's Day parade a few weeks after the previous one.  They only got the green light in January so hats off to all the parade committees across the country that managed to pull those parades together, get schoolchildren involved and get floats out and costumes made.  It was really impressive.  I walked in the parade in my home town of Castlebar and we had the largest crowd I have seen at a parade in years.  It was phenomenal.  For lots of younger children, it was the first parade they could remember going to so it was really important for the community.  They did a great job at such short notice and it is worth acknowledging that.  </p><p>Senator Lombard spoke about the discussions at Cabinet on the food ombudsman.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working very hard on this issue.  The appointment of a food ombudsman has been sought by farming organisations for many years.  I think we will all agree that farmers should be paid a fair price for their produce and that the push for cheaper and cheaper food all of the time, which benefits consumers, can be very damaging to agriculture and the farming sector so we must strike the right balance, which is where the ombudsman comes in.  The Senator posed questions about whether it is being watered down or whether it will have teeth.  We have to trust that the Minister is listening to the farming organisations,  and I know he is, and see what is produced in terms of legislation.  We will judge the legislation when we have it in front of us.  We cannot pre-empt what might come through those discussions.  </p><p>Senator Currie finished the Order of Business by concurring with the remarks regarding David Hill and referring to Limestone United in Belfast playing-----</p></speech>

This Bill is aimed at replacing the Garda compensation scheme that is currently in operation with a new statutory scheme that will reduce the waiting times and costs associated with claims for malicious injury to garda&iacute; or their family members.  The key aims of the Bill are to reduce the length of time it takes for Garda compensation claims to be dealt with from the initial application through to award, to ensure settlement and resolution of claims can be reached earlier in the process and to set out clear time limits relating to each stage of the process.  It also aims to reduce the number of applications proceeding to court by allowing for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to assess quantum in the first instance, which will in turn reduce the legal and administrative costs associated with the scheme.  At present, with backlogs in the High Court, it can take up to four years for a case for Garda compensation to be heard.  That results in significant legal costs, which are covered entirely by the State.</p> <p>Before I move to the provisions of the Bill, I will outline broadly how the new scheme is proposed to operate.  The member, or his or her specified dependant in the case of a fatal injury, will apply to the Garda Commissioner for initial assessment of his or her case within six months of the injury.  The Garda Commissioner will arrange for a reporting officer to determine if the person is an eligible applicant and, if so, to prepare a written report within a specified time period, to conclude whether the injury or death appears to have been caused as a result of a malicious incident as defined in the Bill.  If the report concludes the injury or death appears to have been caused as a result of a malicious incident, the member or his or her specified dependant is entitled to an assessment of compensation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If the report concludes the injury or death was not caused as a result of a malicious incident, the member can seek an independent review of that finding.  An independent review officer will determine whether the finding of a reporting officer should be confirmed or overturned.  If overturned, the member is entitled to an assessment of compensation.</p><p>Where a member is entitled to an assessment of compensation, the Garda Commissioner will arrange for an application to be made to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on his or her behalf.  PIAB will process the application in accordance with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act of 2003, as amended, and will make an assessment by reference to the personal injury guidelines.  If either party rejects it, the applicant will receive authorisation from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to proceed to court.  The State Claims Agency will manage the court proceedings on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>I will now turn the detail of the Bill.  The Bill is divided into seven Parts and I will outline its key provisions.  Part 1 sets out the Title of the Bill and other legislation that the Bill interacts with and provides for commencement orders for the coming into force of the Bill once enacted.  It sets out the relevant definitions for the Bill, including the key definitions of "malicious incident" and "member".</p><p>The current Acts make a distinction between injuries of a minor and non-minor nature.  This Bill removes this distinction and ensures all injuries inflicted as a result of a malicious incident are covered by this scheme.  The transitional arrangements that will apply to applications received prior to the commencement of the scheme are set out in section 5.  For those applications where a determination on whether a member has been maliciously injured has not yet been made in my Department, these applications will fall under the new process as outlined in this Bill.  In cases where the Minister has given authorisation for an application for compensation to proceed to the High Court, those claims will proceed as if the 1941 to 1945 Acts have not been repealed, and applications already initiated in the High Court will remain there.  In other words, there will be no change for these proceedings.</p><p>Part 2 deals with the application for initial assessment to the Garda Commissioner.  The applicant is defined in section 8 and may make an application to the Garda Commissioner specified in section 9.  It captures all persons previously permitted to make claims under the 1941 to 1945 Acts.  Section 10 states the time limit for making an application, which is six months from the date of the injury or knowledge of the injury, with provision made for late applications in certain circumstances.</p><p>Part 3 sets out the appointment of a reporting officer to assess an application.  The criteria for the preliminary examination and the determination of an application are detailed in this Part as well.  It gives clear timeframes for the completion of a determination, which is four months, with the possibility of an extension of a further two months.  Where a determination is made that the application can proceed to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, it sets a timeframe of 30 days for the Garda Commissioner to make the application on behalf of the applicant.</p><p>Part 4 provides for the procedures for the independent review process, the creation of a review panel for independent assessment, the criteria for the preparation of a report and clear timelines for the process.  The time limit for making an application is 30 days from the date of notice issued to the applicant set out in section 16.  A review officer will have three months within which to either make a determination to either confirm or set aside the original decision issued.</p><p>Part 5 sets out the application and amendment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act of 2003.  It permits the assessment of quantum by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in Garda compensation cases and provides for the application of the cost provisions in that Act.  It allows for certain modifications to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act of 2003 for Garda claims to facilitate the new process.  However, the process for acceptance or rejection of an assessment by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will apply in the same way that it does for other personal injuries actions.  This means that where either the applicant or the Garda Commissioner rejects an assessment, an authorisation will issue to the applicant to lodge a claim in the relevant court.</p><p>Part 6 sets out the particulars where proceedings are being brought on foot of an authorisation by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act of 2003.  The court will assess whether the injury or death, as the case may be, was the result of a malicious incident, and it will also assess the level of compensation.  This Bill mirrors the criteria set out in the Garda Compensation Acts 1941 to 1945, while including the requirement to have regard to the personal injuries guidelines, which will streamline cases with ordinary personal injury claims.</p></speech>
