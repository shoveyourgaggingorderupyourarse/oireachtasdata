I am very glad to get an opportunity to speak about this topic of the deposit return scheme.  It is a concept that has potential to enable an entirely new way that people look at packaging and create new, positive habits for our country.  It is a gateway to an entirely new way of consuming goods and re-imagining the concept of packaging.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am sure that some of us remember running around as children and lifting any glass bottles that we could find in order to sell them back to the shops to earn enough money to eat our weight in Macaroon Bars, Clove Drops and cough sweets.  I have wonderful memories of picking bottles out of ditches, cleaning them and bringing them back to my local shop where Mrs. Barry, who is now deceased, would take control of the transaction and look after us very eager and sugar deprived children.  That model, irrespective of the motives back then, is very similar to the circular economy that we need to incorporate into our lives.  The Minister of State will agree with me that we need to design products that will last.  This country needs a drinks deposit returns scheme that is as ambitious as possible.  I will understand if the a scheme is introduced in a phased way but I urge that targets are set for each phase and that we legislate for the targets.  I stress that there needs to be clear timelines to include glass, carton packaging and the move towards a digital deposit returns scheme, DRS, thus enabling the model to be expanded into a reuse model.  The DRS should use a variable fee that includes all of the materials.  Such an scheme would be a powerful tool to improve recycling rates and make consumers think twice about the environmental impact of the product that they buy.</p><p>I hope that the scheme has a variable rate fee and that containers are allocated a deposit value based on the size.  A flat-rate model or fixed fee could apply to all beverage containers.  Recently I met representatives of the Aluminium Packaging Recycling Organisation Ireland, ALUPRO, who highlighted that research shows that the possibility would cause an unfair advantage for plastic bottles as many consumers would be unwilling to pay extra upfront in terms of the flat rate for, say, a 24-can multi-pack compared with the far cheaper 2 litre bottle.  We should acknowledge that packaging is not worthless or should not be seen as waste.  We need to move towards a scheme of a deposit return for packaging for the reuse model and only use the linear single-use recyclable model in the most limited circumstances.  There will still be a need for single-use plastics but we need to reduce where practicable and always incentivise companies to change to better products.  Ireland is a small nation and has a huge opportunity to make its economy one of the best examples of a circular economy.  I am incredibly ambitious for this deposit returns scheme.  I want this Government to be bold and ambitious too.  People want a modern, accessible and wide-ranging scheme.</p><p>Recently I had an interesting meeting with representatives of the Alliance for Beverage Cartons and the Environment or ACE Ireland and we discussed this topic.  ACE Ireland believes that a digital or smart deposit returns scheme should be examined alongside the conventional return to retail scheme.  A digital DRS would ultimately prove a more flexible and adaptable system for widening the scope of acceptable materials.  In order for there to be less waste we need to enable people to change.  A digital system would result in a more user-friendly system where customers could access a scheme through placing materials in their mixed dry recycling bins that are collected at the kerbside.  A digital DRS could also remove the burden on consumers who store used packaging materials in their homes and return them in bulk to shops or supermarkets during their next visit.  I want people to change but we need that help.  We need to make recycling easy.  We need to incentivise, encourage, create opportunities and create ways to access a new-age circular economy in Ireland.  We can do that by using modern and ever upgrading technology to provide a DR scheme.  I know that such developments cannot happen overnight but we can do it in the next five years if we are really ambitious to provide such a scheme.</p></speech>

Many people remember, with some nostalgia, that they could get money back for bottles.  Just like the Senator I recall going to the local pub before I was of an age where I was allowed in and returning bottles and getting money for them.  It was a clear link and reduced the amount of litter on the ground.  People understand the concept.  They know that a DRS is good and has worked in the past.  A lot of principles within the circular economy involve a return to practices that our parents would have engaged in such as repairing clothes, shoes, etc.</p> <p>On the specific point of a digital returns scheme, this is something that we have looked at and the industry has lobbied for same.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With that in mind, the regulations we issued allow for a digital returns scheme.  It is possible within those regulations to allow for variable pricing.  I understand the benefits that can come from offering different amounts of money depending on how recyclable a product is.  I can see the advantages.</p><p>The challenge for me is that such a scheme, as far as I am aware, is not commercially operating anywhere.  I am bringing in a scheme which will operate for 5 million people in one go.  I need to bring in something I know will work.  I know the industry has carried out a pilot scheme in one area, which is a good first step.  There were 200 people involved but I am bringing in a scheme for 5 million people.</p><p>The programme for Government marked a turning point in how Ireland approaches waste management and the circular economy.  Instead of narrowly focusing on how we treat and dispose of the waste we produce, the Government is committed to building a circular economy where waste is minimised, economic growth decoupled from resource consumption and the value of goods and materials retained in our economy for as long as possible.</p><p>Reforming our use of plastic is one of the key measures outlined in the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy.  Tackling our excessive use of single-use plastics is an urgent priority here and across the EU.  Under the 2019 single-use plastics directive, Ireland must achieve a collection target of 90% recycling for plastic bottles by 2029, with an interim target of 77% by 2025.  A report prepared for my Department concluded that a deposit return scheme, DRS, is the only feasible way to achieve the required levels of performance under the single-use plastics directive.</p><p>In September 2020, the Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy set out a roadmap for the introduction of a deposit return scheme in the third quarter of 2022.  To deliver on this objective, a public consultation on the design options of such a DRS was completed in 2020 and a working group of Department officials and stakeholders was established to discuss the implementation of the scheme.  The group met on a number of occasions and, arising from these discussions, a second public consultation focusing on the preferred model was completed early in 2021.  The preferred model that emerged is based on a return to retailer in respect of plastic bottles and aluminium drinks cans.  The beverage industry will fund and operate the scheme.</p><p>The separate collection DRS regulations 2021 give effect to the outcome of this policy development.  They were published in November and provide the framework for the approval of a scheme operator.</p><p>The regulations introduce a requirement on producers to establish a DRS or to appoint a body to operate it on their behalf.  The deposit return scheme will apply to beverage bottles manufactured from polyethylene terephthalate, PET, with a capacity of up to 3 l and beverage containers manufactured from aluminium or steel with a capacity of up to 3 l.  They also introduce an application and approval process for the appointment of an approved body to operate the scheme, set out the functions to be carried out by such an approved body, the obligations required of producers, retailers and return points and make provisions relating to the deposit to be paid.</p><p>While these regulations represent a significant milestone in the introduction of a DRS, some important issues remain to be addressed in further regulations.  Some technical and transitional matters required further considerations, including planning exemptions for DRS infrastructure and VAT matters and the level of the deposit zero rated in the November 2021 regulations, enforcement arrangements and some limited exemptions.</p><p>The next milestone in the project is the appointment of an approved body to operate the scheme.  I understand from industry representatives that in recent weeks a company was incorporated which will design and propose a deposit return scheme for my approval.  While industry has noted that the timeframe for introduction of quarter 3 of 2022 is ambitious, my Department is monitoring progress closely.</p><p>I have allowed further time to consider the level at which a deposit should be set and to consider matters such as whether the deposit should be variable and what provisions should apply to beverage containers sold as part of a multipack.  Senator McGreehan raised this issue and I take her point.  However, I will introduce further regulations prior to the introduction of the scheme to establish, among other things, the level of deposit for the materials to be collected.</p></speech>

I have a dream that our waste and packaging will not be perceived as waste, rather as a valuable part of our economy for which there is always a use.  We spend substantial amounts on picking up waste.  Councils' resources are stretched by picking up rubbish.  It is not rubbish, however, but a valuable product that we should always utilise.</p> <p>The Minister of State has the support of Fianna F&aacute;il in pushing for a reuse model for packaging throughout the commercial and small business sector, with incentives and support to make it possible for consumers to change over.  He will have buy-in from all consumers and businesses.</p> <p>I want to hold on to the wind of change and make sure we succeed, in the lifetime of this Government, in bringing in a positive, worthwhile and proper circular economy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to hold onto that and make sure that we succeed in bringing in a really positive and worthwhile proper circular economy within the lifetime of this Government.

I have to give the Department credit for doing a lot of work, before I was appointed, in engaging with the industry.  I refer not just to the people making bottles, but to the retailers themselves.  They were making sure that it would not be a scheme that would work in theory but not in practice or something that people would be against.  Part of that involved bringing retailers to meet their equivalents in other countries where the scheme had been running for decades and allowing one supermarket owner to say directly to another what happens in practice, how the scheme works and how it can be made work.</p> <p>Last week, I was in Spain for St. Patrick's Day and I visited the person who is in charge of setting up the scheme in Spain, which is facing the same issues as we are although it is not as far down the road as we are.  Engagement is the most important part so that we do not bring in a scheme that works in theory but not in practice.  We have the industry, the retailers and the public on side.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned littering during the pandemic.  One would wake up in the morning and find the remains of picnics.  When the bars were closed, people, and not just young people, were leaving large quantities of cans and bottles in fields.  That is not going to happen when they are worth money.  Nobody is going to leave cash on the ground.  It will be an immediate solution to that problem.  I expect the Tidy Towns groups will find that not only will there be much less to pick up, but that what they do pick up will be worth money.</p></speech>

I will share time with my colleague, Senator Conway.  Senator Ahearn sends his apologies.  He has his own very strong views on the issue of overcrowding in University Hospital Limerick.</p> <p>From my own experience and from hearing from people in Limerick, I know that there are great concerns.  Only today, I spoke to a man who has been in hospital for three weeks.  He is seriously ill and has a lot of underlying health conditions.  When he first went into University Hospital Limerick, he spent at least three days on a trolley.  He is still in the hospital three weeks later.  He is very grateful for the care and attention he received once he got into the hospital but spending three days on a trolley when one is very sick is not acceptable.  He is just one example of the many people who are waiting on trolleys.</p> <p>There are no visitors allowed at the moment.  Visits are very restricted unless somebody is very seriously ill, a child or a confused patient.  That is a result of Covid.  The number of people with Covid is increasing, as we are all very aware.  There were 97 Covid patients in University Hospital Limerick yesterday, which is a really high number.  That is adding to the troubles.  My concern is that people are going into the hospital and waiting on trolleys.  As I said, the care they receive is excellent but there is also the matter of the safety of the people working in the hospital.  They are working under very difficult conditions.  I have been speaking to patients and to staff.  I know there was to be a Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, investigation.  I am concerned that the Taoiseach said that there would be a HIQA investigation but that the Minister for Health said that he would consider it.  That needs to be clarified.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If there is to be a visit to the hospital, this should not be recognised or announced.

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach agus leis an Aire St&aacute;it, who is very welcome to the House.  I agree with the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Byrne, who, like me, has been inundated with people&rsquo;s views on what is happening in Limerick.  It is not at all attractive and is not something we can stand over.</p> <p>In spite of the great work being done by the nurses, clinicians and consultants on the ground, a problem remains and I cannot really work it out.  Some &euro;40 million was spent on building a state-of-the-art, brand new accident and emergency department in 2014.  A modular unit was then deemed necessary because the overcrowding persisted and &euro;22 million was made available by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, in 2017 to build a 62-bed modular unit on the grounds of University Hospital Limerick.  Despite this, the numbers on trolleys at UHL are the highest in the country.  They range from 80 to 100 depending on the day of the week.  On Mondays and Tuesdays, the figure is usually over 90.  The problem then seems to dissipate somewhat towards the end of the week because discharges and so forth run relatively smoothly.</p> <p>We must ask what the management situation is in University Hospital Limerick.  Are management clinicians on duty at weekends?  I suspect not.  Are people on duty at the weekend who are in a position to sign discharge documentation for people?  I suspect not.  I suspect we are dealing with a management issue, from both a front-door perspective in the hospital and a back-door discharge perspective. </p> <p>A commitment has been made to have an independent inquiry and we are told it is to be carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  It is not ideal that HIQA is carrying out this inquiry given that it has already stated it does not consider that there is an issue in University Hospital Limerick.  Really and truly, it should be an independent inquiry.  If it is to be carried out by HIQA, let it be HIQA but let us get on with it.  I want a timeline from the Minister of State for when the inspection and inquiry will start and conclude.  Will the recommendations be published and acted upon?</p></speech>

Senator Ahearn cannot be present and I acknowledge that he has also raised this issue previously.</p> <p>I acknowledge the distress that overcrowded emergency departments, EDs, cause to patients, their families and front-line staff working in very challenging conditions in hospitals throughout the country.  Senator Byrne spoke about the case of an elderly gentleman who spent three days on a trolley.  That is just not acceptable to anyone and is definitely not good enough.  On top of extremely high emergency department attendances, the health sector is also under significant pressure from Covid-19, as was mentioned.</p> <p>Yesterday there were 1,308 Covid patients in hospital, 83 of whom were in UHL.  The emergency department in Limerick is one of the busiest in the country, with over 76,000 attendances in 2021, up 16% compared with 2020 and 7% compared with 2019.  However, the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys for admission in UHL in 2021 were 4.7% lower than in 2020 and 35% lower than in 2019.  </p> <p>The University Limerick Hospitals Group has reported that it is continuing to deal with high volumes of patients attending the UHL emergency department, a pattern that has been sustained over a number of months and is being replicated around the country. </p> <p>UHL is working to ensure that care is prioritised for the sickest patients.  As part of its escalation plan, additional ward rounds, accelerated discharges and identification of patients for transfer to UL Hospitals Group model 2 hospitals are all under way.  There has been continuing substantial investment in UHL and the wider hospital group in recent years to address capacity issues, including a new emergency department that opened in 2017.  This was referred to by Senator Conway.</p> <p>Since the start of 2020, 98 new beds have opened at UHL.  This included a 60-bed modular ward block, which became operational in November 2020, established to provide a rapid-build interim solution to begin to address the bed capacity issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This also included a 24-bed single-room block which functions as a dedicated haematology oncology unit, and a temporary 14-bed single-room block designated for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients, initiated in May 2020 under the national action plan in response to Covid-19.</p><p>The winter plan for 2021 to 2022 was published on 15 November.  It builds on the significant investment in last year's winter plan and the additional capacity delivered in health services in 2021.  The winter plan aims to address the significant combined challenges faced by the health service over the winter period and recognises that a whole-system response is required across primary, community and acute care.  The scale of these challenges and the demands our health system faces require both a plan and an associated system of governance and accountability.  The winter plan sets out the national, area and site level leadership and governance arrangements that are in place.</p><p>The matter of performance in hospital emergency departments is under constant review by the Department through ongoing engagement with the HSE.  The situation is still very distressing.  There is a situation where patients are in the emergency department on trolleys.  Yesterday, there were 83 people in the hospital who have Covid.  The most important thing we can do is to improve throughput in the hospital so that when a person is deemed well enough, he or she is discharged.  We have put substantial investment into step-down beds, transitional beds and home care.  The most important thing is that we can transition people through hospitals as quickly as possible.</p><p>It is very distressing for families, patients and staff when there are high numbers on trolleys, and I know this is happening daily in Limerick.</p></speech>

The staff work very hard but staff morale is at an all-time low.  It is a question of safety for the staff and the patients.  Once most patients get into the system, they have an excellent experience, but it is about getting into the system.  It is not acceptable.  As Senator Conway said, there has been a lot of funding and new beds, but there is a problem and it needs an independent investigation to see what that problem is.  It needs a fresh pair of eyes looking at the situation.  Realistically, this cannot continue.  I know other places have engagement with private hospitals, as we had during Covid, so they can use other beds or transfer patients.  I believe there needs to be an outsider looking in to find new ways of doing things.</p></speech>

The Government has stood up to the plate on each and every occasion when a request has gone in, even to the stage of committing to build a new 96-bed unit, which I believe has gone out for tender and which will in real terms create 48 beds.  That is happening.  Everything the team has looked for, it has got, so I want to know where the problem is.  The only way we are going to find that out is by somebody going in, drilling down, asking the hard questions and challenging people as to what is going on.  At the end of the day, it is taxpayers&rsquo; money but, much more importantly, there are people who are very sick, sitting on trolleys.  That is something none of us here will defend and nobody within the health service should defend.  That is why questions have to be asked but they need to be answered.</p></speech>

The new 60-bed modular ward block at UHL is a significant step in addressing this and provides modern single-room inpatient accommodation with improved infection prevention and control capabilities.  This follows the completion of two separate rapid-build projects delivered under the Government's national action plan in response to Covid-19, which provided an additional 38 inpatient beds on site at UHL.  Furthermore, Project Ireland 2040 includes provision for a 96-bed replacement ward block at UHL.  This project has now been tendered in line with public procurement requirements, with tenders returned on 3 February.  This tender evaluation process is under way and it is hoped to progress this process in the coming weeks with a view to seeking HSE board approval for the award of the works contract.  If that can be escalated as quickly as possible, it would have a major impact.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department and the HSE will continue to work with local hospital management to further improve patient experience in UHL.</p><p>Both Senators raised HIQA and an investigation.

The Commencement matter is about municipal bonds and the important issue of financing local government.  I was spurred on to table the matter by an inquiry from Councillor Karey McHugh Farag, on Galway County Council, who is doing a master's degree on the issue of bonds and the importance of funding to local government.</p> <p>The Minister of State knows and I know, as I think all politicians in these Houses know, that local government is experiencing significant difficulties and challenges with the provision of ongoing funding.  My focus is on how we might in some way leverage some mechanism of bonds.  There are similar operations in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States.  I am familiar to a lesser extent with the position in Britain but am very conscious of what is happening in Denmark and Belgium.  There are other imaginative mechanisms and innovative ways of leveraging money for essential infrastructure projects.  We have to learn about best practice.  There has to be alternative infrastructure financing that we can use in respect of strategies in developing long-term infrastructural development that communities and local government need.</p> <p>I wish to focus on three issues today.  How can we look at the need for new funding sources to generate resources for infrastructure projects?  How can we look at new financing mechanisms that offer flexibility but also the potential for cost-effective ways of financing critical infrastructure across the country?  How can we look at new financial arrangements and synergies that involve the private sector and that partner with the private sector, the non-profit sector and the public sector?  They can all participate and ultimately have some benefit in these critical infrastructure projects.  That is the key.  We all want to deliver critical infrastructure, and there are a number of key issues when we look at this.  We need to help to fund new development.  We need to match payments with benefits in some way.  If people put something into this, they need to have some benefit.  It is very important that this is a mechanism whereby we can raise funding.  This is critical and does not require voter approval.  It should be remembered that the electorate votes people into office to get on with the job.  We should not apologise in that regard.  People are put into power and into office to get on with the job.  We know the importance of critical infrastructure.  Yes, there are weaknesses in the system in terms of administration.  I do not want to overburden local government administration with the administration of additional mechanisms, particularly in the area of finance and funding, but there is enormous potential if we develop imaginative and constructive ways of looking at infrastructural funding.</p> <p>In summary, like many elements of local government, these elements are challenging, but we need innovation, we need infrastructure and we need finance.  That has to be at the very heart of new projects if we are to succeed.  There is no doubt but that there is ambition in local government and on the part of central government, although perhaps not enough.  If I have any criticism of central government, it is that it lacks real commitment to devolving real powers back to communities.  We talk about mayors and reform of local government, but nowhere do I see a real commitment centrally, in central government, to devolve powers.  When powers are devolved to somebody else, be it local government or whatever else, that must come with finance.  The core issue I would like the Minister of State to look at today and maybe undertake to look at further with his officials in the Department is how we can leverage finance and bonds to facilitate the roll-out of our ambition, which is critical infrastructure and the engine to get the economy and communities going.</p></speech>

It is a really interesting question.  He and I have debated this on a number of occasions, both in the Chamber and in these corridors.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Local government services such as those referenced in the matter raised here today are funded in a variety of ways.  Some programmes are supported by Exchequer funding and others from local authorities' own income, often a combination of both.  Local authority income, in turn, comes from sources such as commercial rates, local property tax, charges for goods and services and, importantly in the context of the matter raised, through borrowing.  </p><p>There is a framework in place to manage local authority borrowing, with authorities having recourse to the Housing Finance Agency, retail banks and to both the European Investment Bank and the Council of Europe Development Bank.  Municipal bonds do not form part of this framework and are not considered necessary at the current time, although they could be given consideration.</p><p>Local authority borrowing and overall compliance with fiscal rules are managed and monitored by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in conjunction with the CSO and the Department of Finance.  These rules form part of the EU Stability and Growth Pact, which has its origins in the Maastricht treaty.  Under the pact, there is a limit on budget deficits across the EU.  As part of this, the general government balance, GGB, monitors borrowings and budget surpluses or deficits across the wider government sector, which includes local government.</p><p>Adherence to these rules by individual authorities requires a balanced revenue account and keeping the net increase in non-mortgage borrowing within approved levels.  It is for this reason that local authorities are required to seek sanction from the Department, or to quote from the legislation, from the appropriate Minister, for all borrowing, over and above the requirement for formal approval by the elected members.</p><p>Expenditure of local authority reserves or own resources, including development contributions which often contribute to community infrastructure such as lighting and footpaths, is also subject to GGB limits.  In order to ensure Ireland remains compliant with the overall pact, local authorities have been directed that capital expenditure should generally not exceed capital income within the reporting year.  Notwithstanding that, within the overall limits, there is capacity for the expenditure of capital balances and own resources, subject to sanction.  In reviewing requests for both borrowing sanction and the expenditure of reserves, consideration is given to ensuring that priority infrastructural investment can proceed, that contractual commitments and ongoing projects can proceed; and that development contributions already collected and aligned to specific capital projects can be utilised efficiently.  The Department makes every effort to facilitate all such requests.  </p><p>Compliance with the pact means that member states must avoid deficits above 3% of GDP and must limit public debt to 60% of GDP.  To put that in context, in 2020 Ireland recorded a deficit of 4.9% and a debt to GDP ratio of 58.4%.  There is therefore a need to carefully manage any proposed increases in local authority borrowing within the overall envelope.  There are no current plans to expand the borrowing options available to local authorities through the introduction of municipal bonds, which as I have said are not at present a feature of the local government funding model.  Having said that, it is critically important that research is done into alternative sources of funding for local authorities.  The Senator mentioned that research piece.</p></speech>

It is clear there is no intention of introducing municipal bonds.  I have read extensively in a number of papers in the last few days.  There is a lot of information on best practice in other jurisdictions.  It is something we should look at.  We have to be ambitious.  We have ambitious public representatives in local authorities.  We have ambitious chief executives in local authorities.  The Minister of State knows from Kilkenny that there is no shortage of ambitious ideas coming up from the ground.  I understand we have to operate within the fiscal rules and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage ultimately has a role as does the Department of Finance.  However, we can be more ambitious.  We have to convince the people we represent in local communities that we can deliver greater infrastructure and develop a range of greater resources.  However, they have to be financed.  People are ready to commit to financing local authorities.  People do not expect everything for nothing.  They are not looking for a free ride.</p> <p>Perhaps the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, of which I am a member, could look at the matter and work with the Department.  Let us look at municipal bonds, how they work internationally and whether we can apply any aspect of that to our own situation in Ireland.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in today.</p></speech>

The suggestion he made there is very useful.  It would be a really useful exercise for the housing committee to have a look at this and at the overall funding of local government in general.  We have a significant challenge.  As the Senator rightly said, our local authorities are ambitious both at corporate level and among the elected members.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They show real innovation - often in the face of dwindling resources - yet they cannot continually rely on car parking charges or development contributions, which are not sustainable sources of funding.  We are trying to decouple them and move towards sustainability.  If we look at possibilities around public banking and local authorities being involved in that or developing energy supply companies, we can see there are opportunities there on which local authorities in other European countries have been leading.  We should look at all options given the challenges we face and the opportunities, particularly around climate action, biodiversity and all various aspects of local authorities' work, which is expanding.  The work rate is expanding and yet the funding sources are challenging.  The Department will continue to work with local authorities.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is deeply committed to doing that but it is important to consider all sources.</p></speech>

I am conscious she is busy today taking a lot of issues for other Departments.  I have enormous respect for all officials within the Department of Foreign Affairs for the work they do and our ambassadors.  My question is about how we appoint our ambassadors.  At present, the recruitment of ambassadors is essentially through the ranks of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is very rare for somebody who has not come up through the ranks and served as a long-standing official in the Department of Foreign Affairs to be appointed and when it happens, it is normally somebody from another Department such as our new ambassador to London.  In the old trade union days, that would have been referred to as a closed shop.</p> <p>The Department will make the argument that there are some open competitions at lower levels within the Department but there should be an open competitive process when it comes to these very senior appointments.  The role of the ambassadors, as with others in the Department of Foreign Affairs, is to represent Ireland and promote and protect the interests and values of the State and our citizens.  Yes, people coming through the Department of Foreign Affairs can do that but so too could people with business or academic experience, contributions through charity and voluntary organisations and indeed through political life.  I am not arguing that it should be a decision of the Minister to name whoever he or she may want.  I believe it should be an open competition.  This was introduced for a number of posts in the UK.  It also happens in other jurisdictions.  The individual must show that he or she is competent and can carry out the functions of representing his or her country as an ambassador but I do not accept the argument that only people from the Department of Foreign Affairs are capable of being the representatives of our country abroad.  </p> <p>I need to be clear that I am not suggesting in any way that they should be political appointments as we see in the US, where about half of its ambassadors are appointed by the US President.  Interestingly, under Article 2 of the US Constitution, all US ambassadors must be ratified by the Senate so the question of ambassadors coming before an Oireachtas committee or even a Seanad committee to present their credentials and outline how they would represent Ireland before they are appointed to represent the country might be something we could look at in terms of Seanad reform.  The point I am making is that there are a lot of people who in many ways already represent Ireland very effectively in the arts and other areas and who may have the requisite skills to represent us.  </p> <p>I also think it would be very good for the Department of Foreign Affairs to broaden the pool to ensure there is diversity within the Department at ambassadorial rank and that it is infused with different ideas and views at a senior level.  I know the Department's argument is that we do that at the lower levels of the Department but then people are sucked into the culture and in order to progress, they must move up the ladder.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I sincerely believe it is time for reform and I hope the Minister of State will agree with me.</p></speech>

The mission of the Department of Foreign Affairs is to serve the Irish people, promote their values, advance their prosperity and interests abroad, and provide the Government with the capabilities, analysis and influence to ensure Ireland derives the maximum benefit from all areas of its external engagement.  To fulfil that mission, the Department is staffed with a team of dedicated civil servants who promote Ireland's values and interests, working from 97 embassies, consulates and representative offices across the globe as well as at the Department's headquarters in Ireland.  The Senator's question is very timely as our ambassadors have been very much to the fore in the past week for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations and engagements throughout the world.  They do an excellent job.</p> <p>Decisions on the appointment of ambassadors of Ireland are taken by Government on foot of proposals made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Ambassadors are then appointed by the President and take up duty abroad following the receipt of agreement from the receiving state.  When considering the recommendations for the appointment of ambassadors, the Minister takes into account a wide range of factors, including political, economic and trade priorities for the post in question.  In addition, applicants' management experience, regional knowledge, country knowledge, relevant language skills, policy experience, consular experience and other factors are taken into account as part of the process.  The Minister also takes gender balance into account in the nomination of ambassadors.  For example, the latest appointments to heads of mission posts consisted of 11 men and 11 women, bringing the gender breakdown of heads of mission serving overseas to 37 women and 59 men.</p> <p>As the Senator will be aware, Ireland has a long and proud tradition of a non-political Civil Service and the individuals nominated as ambassadors are drawn from that service.  I note the Senator was very clear that he was not suggesting these would be political appointments.  Since the foundation of the State, Ireland has regularly demonstrated its capacity to exert influence and make a distinctive contribution on the international stage.  Civil servants and those appointed as ambassadors have played a crucial role in these efforts.  All currently serving ambassadors are established career civil servants employed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and recruited through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, or competitions administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs in accordance with the code of practice for appointment to positions in the Civil Service and public service, as set out by the Office of the Commission for Public Service Appointments.  Open recruitment competitions are held to join the diplomatic service at third secretary, first secretary and counsellor level.</p> <p>Officers recruited to join the diplomatic service are tested on key competency areas relevant to the grade during the recruitment process.  Resilience, resourcefulness and a commitment to foreign language learning are among the requirements.  The Department also works closely with the PAS to build diversity in the Department of Foreign Affairs and ensure it is representative of the people it represents.</p> <p>I thank the Senator again for his question and would, of course, welcome his support and that of all Members in encouraging applications to open recruitment competitions to join the diplomatic service.</p></speech>

I certainly would encourage anyone to serve in a public service capacity.  I note that the reply from the Department of Foreign Affairs avoids the question I asked.  It does, however, make a very clear point in stating that when the Minister is considering an appointment, he will look at applicants' "management experience, regional knowledge, country knowledge ... language skills, policy experience" and so on.  However, he only looks at those factors among a very limited pool of individuals, namely, people from within his Department.  The argument I am making is there is very rich talent in this country.  We have people from a vast range of different backgrounds who may have been able to gather that experience in other fields.  They should be able to compete openly to enter public service at ambassadorial level.  It would serve any Minister very well for such people to have that opportunity.  To ensure greater diversity within our public service and to ensure it is no longer a closed shop, competition should be open for positions for ambassadors representing our country and all of its citizens.</p></speech>

To ensure that our diplomatic team is of the highest quality and representative of the people of Ireland, the Department works closely with the PAS to ensure a robust and fair recruitment process for diplomatic grades.  In the last year, the PAS has administered open competitions to the grades of counsellor, first secretary and third secretary.  Further recruitment to the diplomatic service is expected later this year.  All competitions are advertised on the PAS website and via social media.  Officers who have been recruited through the open recruitment competition represent Ireland abroad including as ambassadors.</p> <p>I accept the Senator's point that we should look at having greater diversity.  Knowing how tenacious he is, I have no doubt that this will not be the last time we will hear this issue being raised in the Seanad.</p></speech>

It is to pay tribute to the late David Hill, who was playing with the Scottish Parliament against the D&aacute;il and Seanad team on Saturday and tragically passed away during the match.  We had come to know David immensely well over the past three or four years, both from going to Edinburgh to play and from them coming here.  David was an incredibly nice young man.  He had worked for the Scottish Conservative Party for a number of years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He was well respected not only by those in his party but by people across the political spectrum in Scottish politics.  That was a testament to the concept of parliamentary rugby, which is that the political differences that we all experience in political parties are left at the door when we go to play.  David was a young man who was tragically taken away from his family.  I send our heartfelt prayers and thoughts to David's family and to his friends, not only in the Scottish Parliament but also in wider society.</p><p>I listened to his boss, Mr. Jamie Greene, Member of the Scottish Parliament, this morning talk about how somebody had kindly left a vase of daffodils on David's desk in the Scottish Parliament.  He said he hoped and felt that the vase of daffodils would serve as a small reminder that even in the darkest depths of winter, spring will come.  I really hope that will come along for David's friends and family as soon as possible.  I acknowledge David's father, Rodger, his mother, Sharon, his step-parents, Lesley and Gordon, his younger siblings, Alex and Georgia, and his two adored nephews, Freddie and Hunter.  It is a horrific tragedy.  It is one of those things, and I do not say this lightly, whereby at whatever stage we are in this life we do not know what our last interaction with a loved one or anyone could be.  That was brought home to many of us on Saturday.</p><p>I pay tribute to the paramedics who spent 35 to 40 minutes working on David on the pitch last Saturday.  We want to send from the Oireachtas to David's family and friends our deepest and most heartfelt sympathies on this most awful tragedy for David Hill and his family.</p></speech>

The Senator knew him personally and I understand he was in his company over the weekend.</p> <p>On behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il, I ask the House to reflect on and remember a former Member of this House who passed away over the past few days, Mr. Paul Kavanagh.  He served here for a period in the 1980s.  He was undoubtedly a dynamic force in Irish business at the time.  He sat on the boards of An Post, Aer Lingus, Eircom and IDA Ireland.  He had groundbreaking skills and abilities in the printing and fulfilment sector and went on to become an internationally renowned businessman, heading up Stream International and Donnelly Documents, a US multinational.  He gave freely of his time to many people to assist them in developing their business.  He was the brains behind the Dublin Digital Hub, which today houses more than 70 companies and employs 700 people.  He was also one of those involved in the International Financial Services Centre and played a part in its development.  I am sure the House will join me in expressing sympathy to his wife, Anne-Marie, his son, Killian, daughters, Fiona and Sinead, and his sisters, Hillary and Colette.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p> <p>The rising price of fuel is having an impact on all aspects of society.  However, it is having a significant and disproportionate impact on the lives of those whose work is caring for people in their homes.  These are workers employed by the HSE in a private capacity and sometimes through section 39 agreements.  The extreme cost they are now undertaking as a result of the increase in the price of fuel is resulting in many of them giving up their work or not taking on that work.  That is having an impact on people who are trying to be looked after in their homes.  If we do not find a way of resolving this problem, there will certainly be a situation where more people will end up in hospital.  They will not be able to be discharged from hospital to return to the home for recuperation because, quite frankly, the home care packages are unable to be delivered.  I have spoken to many people over the past number of weeks who no longer have the same level of care.  They just cannot get the people to provide that care in the home.  That is a crisis that must be dealt with and I appeal to the Ministers for Health and Public Expenditure and Reform to address it without delay.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We are told today, through documents to the Cabinet that have been well reported, that Ireland could be expected to take up to 200,000 refugees in the coming weeks.  That will pose a very significant challenge to the State but I have every expectation we will be able to achieve and address it, especially if what I have seen in my county of Clare over the past two to three weeks is anything to go by.  There is a level of support that communities are putting behind the refugees when they arrive that is phenomenal.  I visited areas over the weekend, including Lisdoonvarna, Ballyvaughan, Kilkee, Shannon and Ennis, where refugees are being catered for in hotels and other community settings.  There is an outpouring of support from Irish people who want to help, coming in the form of fundraising and provision of supplies, and it is a credit to the good nature of Irish people.</p><p>There is some suggestion we are not playing our part because we are not militarily aligned in this conflict.  We do humanitarian support really well and it does not require the State to direct it.  It is in our DNA and in our nature.  I see it even in our young.  I met some of the Ukrainian families in Kilkee over the weekend together with Councillor Cillian Murphy.  When we were chatting with the families I saw in the corner of my eye three young fellows dressed in soccer kits walking into the foyer of the hotel carrying an expensive leather soccer ball.  Perhaps it was a Christmas or birthday gift.  Together with a welcoming card, they handed it over to three young Ukrainian boys.  If that is not the epitome of the kind of support that exists for people who have, sadly, had to leave their homeland, I do not know what is.  Nothing reflects better on the Irish people not just for this generation but the coming generations.  It is that level of community involvement that is required.  It is a spirit of support in our DNA that will see us through what will have to be a great challenge for all aspects of society.</p></speech>

I hope we will issue them with a major c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte and welcome.  I put this against a background of our celebrations for St. Patrick's Day.  I extend my good wishes to the Taoiseach, who I know is stuck in the United States.  I am sure he is not stuck and is using his time constructively.  I wish him well and a speedy recovery before he returns.  I thank and acknowledge the work of our Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, in the United States over the past ten days.  He and the Taoiseach were effectively ambassadors for us, promoting and connecting with the Irish caucus and many others.  We must always be very grateful for the strong Irish-American connection.  We have fostered and developed it, taking advantage of it and leveraging it to a great extent for our own prosperity in the form of jobs and inward investment to the country.  It is something that should be acknowledged.</p> <p>I was in the UK some weeks ago as part of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  I had an invitation to go to St. Martin-in-the-Fields to see at first hand the work going on there for the London Irish, the forgotten Irish for many.  These are not people who left in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s or 1960s.  They are people who left in the late 1980s and 1990s and they are now on the streets of London.  They receive hospitality, care and support.</p> <p>We have a history of being a displaced people and having emigration forced on us as people.  I hope we have learned something and passed the stories down through generations.  I know many of my family ended up in the United States many moons ago but they were richly connected to their humble origins, whether in Laois or the west of Ireland.  They sent back money and kept the link, the hope and the ambition.  Many of them had a successful opportunity to return.  I hope we will be mindful of our past and open our hearts, our doors and our minds.</p> <p>Looking at the history of many politicians in local communities, there has been resistance to direct provision.  I am not in favour of direct provision centres themselves.  I do not want to see people coming in from the Baltic states to be warehoused in direct provision centres.  That is not how to welcome people into a country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope we will all genuinely sustain and prolong our compassion, affection and welcome for the people who are fleeing their country terrorised and that we take some responsibility with our neighbours in the European Union to support and sustain these people and families fleeing their homes. </p><p>It is important we all remember, and I know we do so here, that many Russians living in Ukraine are being forced out of their country.

I played with the Oireachtas rugby team only a couple times in Donnybrook before Six Nations games and I know how close all the players are with those in the other parliaments.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis. </p> <p>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has seen a 49% increase in the number of requests for help with energy costs.  Recent research by Red C has found 37% of folks have cut back on essential heating and electricity.  The backdrop to all this is the most recent Government strategy on energy poverty, according to which, 475,000 households are in or at risk of energy poverty.  There were 30 price increase announcements from energy suppliers last year.  Bord G&aacute;is is introducing price rises of up to 39% next month.  While home heating oil has increased by more &euro;1,000 for 1,000 l this year, it is obvious to everyone there is cost of living crisis.  It is our job and that of the Government to do all we can to support workers and families to address the spiralling cost of heat and other energy costs to ensure households are not locked out of any supports or access to them.  The Government should cancel the scheduled carbon tax increase in May.  These are all actions the Government could take.  We should also seek a derogation from the European Commission to temporarily reduce VAT on bills as people are under great financial pressure.  Implementing just one of these measures, in addition to the &euro;1 billion to which, I am sure the Deputy Leader will tell me, the Government has already committed, would go some way to reflect the scale of the crisis.</p></speech>

It is important to note that up to 100 workers on the island of Ireland who were working with P&amp;O Ferries have been affected by this and have now lost their jobs.  This is a case of Irish Ferries mark II.  Some Members will remember that Irish Ferries engaged in the very same practice in 2005.  It pulled a stunt and tried to fire 543 workers overnight and replace them with non-unionised, low-wage labour.  Thousands of people took to the streets at that time because they recognised a threshold of decency had been breached.  We want to express our solidarity with those who have taken to the streets in protest, particularly in Britain, at this outrageous practice by P&amp;O Ferries.  The Irish Government has said it is limited in what it can do.  We have legislation in this country that provides for notification in the event of collective redundancy to both the workers and the Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, we should never be complacent.  We need to send a message to all employers who are thinking of engaging in the appalling practice of effectively firing and rehiring with labour which, we understand, is one fifth of the national minimum wage in the UK.  That is the wage that is on the table at the moment.  The last thing I want to say today is that while the Irish Government has said it is limited in what it can do here, a review needs to be undertaken of whether there are any State contracts with P&amp;O.  If so, the Government needs to terminate them immediately.  The Government in the Republic of Ireland cannot be seen as condoning or associating itself in any shape or form with a company that treats its workers in this manner.</p></speech>

He was over at the weekend representing the Scottish Parliament and passed away during the match against the Oireachtas rugby team, the D&aacute;il and Seanad XV, early on Saturday afternoon.  I met Mr. Hill the previous night at an engagement that the Scottish office had organised.  I am wearing my Scotland and Ireland flags today in his memory.  He was an absolute gentleman.  He was a really lovely human being.  He loved politics and he loved rugby even more.  They all travelled over on Friday in various different ways - some got direct flights from Scotland, some came via Heathrow and so on.  He was just a really lovely gentleman.  Respect and tributes have come in from all over and particularly from the Scottish political sphere, including everybody from Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, to the leader of the Conservative Party in Scotland.  Some of the tributes note that he was calm, helpful, professional, kind, generous, well liked and highly respected.  To his family, his parents, Rodger and Sharon; his brother, Alex; his sister, Georgia; his nephews, Freddie and Hunter; all of his colleagues in Scottish Parliament; and all of his friends, I just would like to send the deepest sympathies and condolences not just from myself and my party, but from the whole House.  It was an absolute tragedy.  It was something that we never expect to happen in a fairly amateur match.  I know many Members of this House have played in similar events in the past.  It is an absolute tragedy.  If it is appropriate, I ask that we have a minute's silence in his honour and memory at the end of this Order of Business.  Hopefully, there might be a time when the joint Houses here and perhaps the house in Scotland, Holyrood, where he was so well liked and he did so much for that rugby team, particularly, in the Scottish Parliament, can do something in the future to respect and remember him again.  I hope we can agree on a minute's silence.</p></speech>

I ask that we also have a look at the role of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  If we are to be honest, all of us as public representatives and the people who we work for and with are having a nightmare in dealing with a multiplicity of departments of agencies around customer care and customer service.  It is high time we call halt to the shoddy treatment of people by a myriad of Government Departments, semi-State companies and public bodies for the way in which they treat people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In particular, let us reflect upon those elderly people who put pay money to put credit in their phones and dial a company yet are made to wait an hour or two and their credit dwindles out of their account.  In the old days one could press button B and get one's money back but today one is given the option of pressing buttons 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 but  will only be connected to someone else.  People are sick and tired that there is no accountability and no customer care or service.  There was a time when the customer was always right.  Sadly, customer care has been outsourced to call centres, which is a situation that needs to be re-examined and looked at by a multiplicity of agencies, bodies and companies.  I ask for a debate to be arranged and suggest that we bring in the communications regulator to speak to us because the way people are being treated now is unacceptable.  People cannot get answers to basic simple questions yet at the same time companies fob people off.  I hope that the treatment of people and customer care can be prioritised.  We saw Covid used as an excuse and it was said that people were working from home but now people are moving back into their offices so there can be no excuse for the shoddy treatment of people around customer care.  I ask that the Leader facilitates a debate at her earliest convenience.</p></speech>

It is time that the debate took place and I appreciate that the middle of a worldwide crisis in Ukraine is not the best time to have it.  I was rather disappointed to see one of our colleagues, in the other House, bring forward legislation, which they hope to bring into the D&aacute;il in the next few days on the neutrality issue.  I do not think that it is the way forward but I think that there is a need for a discussion and we need to consider carefully where we go with this.  For too long the issue has been bandied about as neutral, non-neutral and all sorts of other things.  We are moving into a situation here by default where statements are being made by Ministers and the Taoiseach, which has moved Ireland's policy position from where it was to a new position of being non-aligned and, in fact, the words "non-neutral" have been used.  It is no secret that I want to send weapons to Ukraine so my position may not necessarily fall into the neutral camp but certainly the debate must take place.  The people are entitled to hear that debate take place.  I am mindful of a period when I was president of the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, and I made a statement; one of my executive members asked me who the hell gave me permission to say what I said.  This House is the House that makes decisions about how we progress the neutrality issue.</p> <p>I want to mention a second issue.  The Government has been very generous and brought forward a payment for those who were front-line workers during the pandemic but we missed out people such as those who worked in organisations like Ability West in County Galway where staff came in every day to deal with people with disabilities of one type or another.  They had to deal with all of the same front-line issues encountered by nurses in hospitals and other front-line workers.  We might have a debate on that at some stage in the future and consider what organisations are entitled to be considered for a front-line payment because staff put themselves at risk every single day when they went in to work  and dealt with people coming in for respite.</p></speech>

So for 11 days, including over the St. Patrick's holiday weekend, the people in and around Wexford town were not guaranteed to have clean water and a reliable supply.  Other parts of the country have experienced the same problem and last year my home town of Gorey had a well publicised case of E.coli.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many of us have said that one of our biggest challenges in the housing field is making sure Irish Water responds.  Clearly, it is not, so I ask again for that debate on Irish Water.</p><p>I am conscious there will be a debate tomorrow on humanitarian issues in respect of Ukraine, but we also need to look at the educational and higher education and research implications of what has happened.  A significant number of refugees who come here will look to integrate into our school system.  Quite a number of them will have experienced trauma and will need additional counselling supports.  There will be language issues in some cases.  It is important that both the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science are able to respond effectively.</p><p>There are a number of anomalies.  If we treat Ukrainian students who come here as EU students, will Ukrainian students already studying here, who are currently classified as non-EU students, now receive the same treatment?  A number of Irish students had been pursuing their education in Ukraine and some in Russia.  They have now come back to Ireland and there is an issue about integrating them into the Irish system, especially because a number of these are in the medical and paramedical fields.  Will the Deputy Leader write to the two Ministers concerned to look at outlining the strategy and organise a specific debate on the education and higher educational needs of those coming here from Ukraine?</p></speech>

I send my condolences regarding their colleague from the Scottish Parliament.  I also support Senator Dooley on the vote of sympathy for former Senator, Mr. Paul Kavanagh.</p> <p>In view of the decision made by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to dismantle the Derrybrien wind farm in Galway, who will pay the fines, &euro;17 million of which have been accrued and which are clocking up at the rate of &euro;15,000 per day?  The ESB should pay them.  I do not see why the taxpayer should have to foot the bill for those fines to Europe.  I would like the Government to make a clear statement on who will pay them and if the State would ask the ESB, which as we have seen made nearly half a billion in profits last year, to pay the fine of &euro;17 million that the State has forwarded and paid to Europe.</p> <p>In that context, we should have a very worthwhile debate on wind generation along the west coast, whether onshore or offshore.  We need a clear policy statement with regard to the big players, the ESB, Coillte and so forth, and we are not getting that.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, should come to the House, put it on the record and give a clear statement.  We have stopped all exploration along any coast in Ireland, we have an abundance of energy and, going forward, the Government has no choice but to make a clear statement.  We are in a hurry as well and we need this to be done as quickly as possible to generate all the energy we can along the west coast.</p></speech>

As someone who has been a blood donor since I was 18, I encourage anyone who is eligible to contact the blood bank and make an appointment to donate.  Only this morning, I got a text to tell me that stocks of my blood type are down to 1.6 days of supply when they should be seven days.  I cannot believe there has been no public campaign to inform gay and bisexual men that, as and from 28 March, the eligibility criteria will change.  From 28 March, a four-month deferral for gay and bisexual men will come into place and oral sex between men will no longer form the basis for a deferral.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is really welcome progress but we really need to move to an individualised risk assessment system for all donors, such as is in place in the North.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has confirmed that this will be the case in Ireland but we have no confirmed date, having only been told that it will be later this year.  I would like to hear the Minister's rationale for this phased approach as opposed to moving directly to individual-based risk assessments.  I would also like clarity as to the date on which that individual assessment system will be introduced.  I would also like confirmation as to whether the Minister will address the anomalies regarding women donating.  Under the new proposals, women who have sex with men who have had sex with other men will face a 12-month ban while that same man will be free to donate.  I ask the Deputy Leader to seek clarity on those questions but also on why this low-key approach to these changes is being taken.  The blood service is importing blood from England while there are potential donors who are completely unaware that they are eligible to give blood and could be making appointments today for next week.  This is a good news story so I have to ask the Deputy Leader why the Government is not letting people know about it, thereby allowing eligible blood donors to donate next week.</p></speech>

It is great news for football fans and our economy, which will be due to net somewhere in the region of &euro;750 million from visitor spending.  It is definitely a more realistic option than going for the 2032 World Cup.  Given that we missed out on hosting games in last year's deferred European championship because of Covid, it is fantastic for football fans to see this happening.  However, only today, we have already seen an issue develop with one of the main venues that could potentially be used for these games.  We only have two: Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium.  The issue pertains to Croke Park.  UEFA prohibits the use of temporary seating at major championship finals.  When the FAI has previously used Croke Park, such temporary seating has been installed on Hill 16.  For the venue to be used, Hill 16 would have to be converted from a terrace to a stand.  It would be ironic if a soccer tournament were to sound the death knell of one of the most famous terraces in the world.</p> <p>A memo has been brought to Cabinet today by the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, in support of the bid, and rightly so.  We need the Government to back this bid as it did the bid for the Rugby World Cup.  However, in doing so I ask the Minister of State to engage with the FAI and UEFA on the stadium issue from tomorrow with a view to allowing the prospect of safe standing.  We have seen this practice return right across Europe.  It came back in England this year, where the Hillsborough disaster initiated the conversion of terraces to stands.  Safe standing has come back in right across Europe.  I ask the Minister of State with responsibility for sport to engage on this issue right from the get-go.  The Government is going to back this bid.  We want to see it happen, we want it to be it successful and we want to see it in Croke Park.  As a sports supporter and a GAA man, I want to see it happening in Croke Park but not at the cost of seeing an end to Hill 16.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, there has been a lot of discussion of the issue and a focus group including the Department, various parents' groups and so on has discussed the potential for a new programme of July provision.  Looking at the figures from 2021, it can be seen that we set aside more than &euro;40 million but not all of this funding was used because a significant number of schools did not take part in July provision.  The reality is that a significant number of children and parents did not get the provision they needed and were entitled to as a result.  I look forward to seeing the proposals from the Department because significant changes to the scheme are needed to make sure that the children who need this provision actually get it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also raise an issue on behalf of a number of parents and advocacy groups with regard to children attending special schools and classes, and the fact that the children cannot be allowed to be excluded from school due to a chronic illness.  They should only be excluded from school based upon public health advice.  The fact is that a large number of schools are sending text messages to parents telling them to keep their children home if they have any symptoms of Covid-19.  The House will be well aware that there are a number of Covid-19 symptoms in existence, many of which mirror a great deal of typical childhood illnesses.  Yes, it is important that schools keep staff and other children safe but they cannot be excluding children who might have hay fever, for example.  That illness can continue on into September or October.</p><p>I ask and remind schools and parents that children with special educational needs have many chronic underlying conditions which have some of these symptoms.  In these circumstances, where these symptoms are known and are the ongoing health features of a child, this should not preclude the attendance of that child from school.  Parents and schools should now focus on new and acute symptoms of Covid-19 in such children.  In circumstances where this arises, and only in these circumstances, should children be kept home from school.</p></speech>

County Clare is one of the counties that has welcomed a significant number of Ukrainian refugees in the past number of days.  Almost 1,000 refugees from Ukraine are now living among us in north and west Clare.  Of those, 500 are in the town of Lisdoonvarna and almost another 200 are in the village of Ballyvaughan, just up the road.  That brings challenges with it but challenges we as a nation, a county and an area are certainly very capable of stepping up to the plate to meet.</p> <p>I appeal to all State agencies to respond, please, in a timely manner and to be quick in their decision-making, bearing in mind the background from which the Ukrainian people have come.  Teachers are needed for the schools as urgently as possible.  We need to be providing a significant number of English classes.  My understanding at the moment is that it is being proposed to have two English classes a week.  There should, however, be at least two English classes a day.  </p> <p>The one thing I have experienced from my engagement with the people from Ukraine is that they are very diverse but very much want to work and contribute to our society.  These are people who were living ordinary lives a number of weeks ago and now find themselves in this terrible situation.  My appeal today, and I am aware that we are having statements on the humanitarian aid programme tomorrow, is that every day matters.  I want each Minister to appoint liaison people within their Departments who will respond to queries from people like ourselves and the many NGOs who are out there working tremendously hard to create and ensure that the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte that we want to see extended to the Ukrainian people who are seeking refuge here with us is acted upon so that they feel welcome.

I wish to acknowledge all of the St. Patrick's Day parades and the community groups who were involved in organising those at such short notice.  The time on which the public health guidelines were lifted to when so many groups around the country co-ordinated bands, clubs, groups and organisations to come together was completely crucial.  It was also a day of solidarity with Ukraine.  As well as celebrating and coming together after a period of time with lockdown and Covid-19 we were also remembering the people of Ukraine.</p> <p>I also point to and acknowledge the investment of over &euro;11 million we are seeing with Omniplex Cinemas in three rural or perhaps regional towns.  This investment is coming to Ballinasloe, Mullingar and Nenagh.  The construction of a five-screen cinema starts today in Ballinasloe.

This House needs to be actively involved in that engagement.  We spoke about having the ability to put a body in place to help the food industry, to help the farmer at the farm gate and to show there is the ability to get a fair price.  It is part of the programme for Government and something we all support.  I would be concerned that this is a watered-down version of the food ombudsman.  The terminology of &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; has been taken out of the legislation in the heads of the Bill and we need clarity regarding whether this new body will have the teeth required to regulate this industry.  We have spoken at length about farmers getting an appropriate price at the farm gate.  This is the legislation we have all been talking about.  It is in the programme for Government and the terminology of &ldquo;food ombudsman&rdquo; was in the programme for Government.  Unfortunately, in the legislation published this afternoon, the heads of the Bill do not have that terminology.  It is about getting the core aim of this Bill right, and that has to be a fair price for the farmers at the farm gate.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am missing something.</p> <p>I give my condolences and sincere sympathy to the family of David Hill and his colleagues, and to our own colleagues who have spoken so eloquently today and from such a heartfelt place.  It could not have been easy for any of them, so our thoughts are with them as well.  I am a big supporter of any kind of cross-community sports.  I think sport is a great leveller and it brings people together.  In fact, this Sunday, in Seaview in Belfast, the Limestone United under-16s football team from north Belfast will take on Palmerstown Football Club, who are from west Dublin, close to where I grew up.  That is being supported by the Cathaoirleach and the Mental Health Commission chief executive, John Farrelly, and there will be an emphasis on mental health on the day.  Sport is a great leveller and a way we can come together.  I know there was a shared island dialogue on this recently as well.</p> <p>I also want to reflect on the 800 P&amp;O workers who were brutally and shamefully sacked a few days ago without any consultation or advance notice.  It is owned by a Dubai-based company called DP World and the action has not been taken under Irish law, but there are an estimated 25 workers from the Republic and 35 from the North.  A strong message needs to go out from this Government that that is just not acceptable.  Is there any opportunity to engage with our counterparts in the North on this issue?  As I said, the message needs to go out that it is not acceptable that they would be replaced by people who are going to work for less.  We need to take that very seriously in terms of provisions here so no other companies can take the same steps.</p></speech>

To Senators McGahon and Horkan and anyone else who was there, I say that I cannot imagine what it would have been like to be there.  It was a really shocking event.  Our thoughts are with David's family, friends and colleagues and everybody who was there at the time.  Senators McGahon and Horkan spoke very eloquently, and I could not have put better their comments on the man and the impact he had.  May he rest in peace.</p> <p>Senator Dooley spoke next.  He raised a couple of issues.  He wanted first to pay tribute to Paul Kavanagh, who served in this House, and to extend our sympathies to Paul's family, including his wife Anne-Marie.</p> <p>Senator Dooley also spoke about the rising cost of fuel, as did Senator Warfield in the context of the cost of living.  The cost of fuel is becoming a massive issue and it is going to continue.  We have to acknowledge that this is not just an Irish problem but an issue globally.  Oil prices are going up and the war in Ukraine is exacerbating the issue, so it is not just being felt here.  There is a cost-of-living debate happening in many other countries.  That is not to say we do not have a job to do here as public representatives to try to deal with it, but it is important to be honest with the public that this is not an easy issue to fix or to solve quickly.  The Government, however, is working hard to try to resolve it.  We saw the fuel allowance lump sum of &euro;125 in the last budget.  We have seen a reduction in the cost of diesel and petrol through excise, 15 cent on diesel and 20 cent on petrol.  I know it is not a lot in the wider scheme of things but it is an attempt to try to bring that cost down.  There was also the energy grant and the &euro;200 rebate to every household in the country, and now we have &euro;100 a week for every haulier to try to reduce the cost of their fuel to do their jobs, to put food onto our shelves and to keep the country running.  The Government is doing its very best to try to manage the rising cost of fuel and the cost of living, which is impacting every household and every business.  We are monitoring it very closely because we know how severe the impact is on so many households.</p> <p>Senator Dooley also spoke about the discussions at Cabinet today level about the possibility that Ireland could see up to 200,000 refugees, which is a phenomenal number of people, come into our country.  It will be an extremely difficult task.  I know from conversations I have had with my local authority in Mayo that we are looking at contingency beds in public halls and any hotel space we can find.  The difficulty is that some hotels have capacity midweek but not at the weekends.  We do not want to shift mums and their children from place to place on a Thursday and back again on a Monday.  This will really push our country and our citizens, every inch of this island, to the limit, but I have no doubt but that with the humanitarian response, the charity and the love we will show people who have arrived here and who will arrive here, we will get through this.  It will not be easy, however.  It will be really difficult.  It is really important for public representatives of all parties and none to try to refrain from any populist commentary that might inflame the situation or speak of it as though it is easy to deal with and easy to solve.  I know most will refrain, but there will always be one or two.  This is not an easy thing to deal with.  It is important that all of us band together during this time because this will not be fixed in the next six weeks.  We are talking months and years of dealing with this issue.  It will expand and become more pressing, so it is important we all collectively, as a country, work together to try to support these people as best we can and hope to God they can get back to their own country as quick as possible and that they have homes to go to.  However, when we see the devastation, it could be some time before Ukraine can be rebuilt and people can be got back to their homes, but that is the ultimate aim.  I know from talking to the Leader of the House that there will be statements on Ukraine dealing with all aspects, whether higher education, education or health, of this matter.  We will deal with this issue in this Chamber on a weekly, rolling basis.  Whatever comes along, there will be an opportunity for all Members to have their say, to contribute on the floor of the House and to work with the Government and our Ministers to try to deal with this issue collectively.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan also spoke about the refugee issue.  He acknowledged the work of our Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, and our Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, in the US over St. Patrick's week, and all our Ministers who went off to represent our country and our people in what is a really important week, not just an important day, for our country in putting Ireland on the international map and building on the immense goodwill we have in so many countries across the globe, something we should never take for granted.</p> <p>Senator Warfield also paid tribute to David Hill.  He also spoke about the cost of fuel in particular but also the cost of living.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I dealt with that in my earlier contribution.  The Senator spoke about how people are cutting back on their central heating.  We certainly have to keep an eye on that issue.  For low-income households this can be the difference between putting food on the table and heating their homes.  We have to be very cautious.</p><p>Senator Sherlock spoke about the P&amp;O staff who were let go, as did Senator Currie.  I concur with both Senators that the manner in which those staff were let go was shocking.  I join with Senator Currie in remarking that we should send a message that it is not acceptable in this country.  The company's location makes it more difficult but we extend our solidarity to the workers North and South.  It is a shocking way to treat any staff member regardless of the reason behind letting them go.</p><p>Senator Horkan paid tribute this morning to David Hill and called for a minute's silence which we will do after this.  The Cathaoirleach will facilitate that.</p><p>Senator Buttimer requested a debate on customer care and customer service and the role of ComReg.  He spoke in particular about the frustration many consumers feel in trying to contact businesses when they need customer services.  Many businesses make them go through lots of hoops before they can speak to a human being.  We will certainly request that debate.</p><p>Senator Craughwell spoke this morning about the need for a debate in this House on neutrality.  That debate was requested by a colleague a couple of weeks ago.  We are working on it.</p></speech>

I will cede to that.  I might add that the debate has already happened among the public.  On many issues, the Oireachtas can be way behind where the people are at.  Nonetheless we have a job to do and it is timely that we would have a debate in the House on that issue.  It will probably be a rolling debate that will evolve over time.  Certainly it is something we need to do.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell also spoke about the &euro;1,000 payment to front-line workers.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, said that if there were challenges or issues where certain workers were excluded, they would look at that.  The attempt that was made by the Government, which was a difficult one to solve, was to try to identify those front-line healthcare workers.  I think in particular of those working in intensive care units in hospitals who were at the front line actually caring for Covid patients at a time when they were unvaccinated and there was pressure on personal protective equipment, PPE.</p></speech>

They were trying to strike the balance.  There were so many workers on the front line including in retail, delivery drivers and every aspect of healthcare, but there was a certain level where they put their lives on the line in a very real way.  Trying to identify those was not an easy task but I take the point the Senator is making.</p></speech>

I take the point.  It is a difficult one to get 100% correct.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of the boil water notice in Wexford town.  There was 11 days of a boil water notice there.  I recall that the Senator raised the issue in respect of Gorey last year in that E. coli situation.  It is no secret that Irish Water is in need of additional funding.  It is certainly worthwhile to have a debate on its role and the work it needs to do.  We will request through the Minister's office to get that at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>The Senator also requested a debate on the implications flowing from the Ukrainian situation for education and higher education.  I have put that request in today as well and will seek it at the earliest opportunity.  We will probably split the debate in two between education and higher education and request both Ministers to come in and answer the questions the Senator raised.  The situation will test our education system at all levels; there is no doubt about it.  I cannot answer the question about the Ukrainian students currently here or Irish students abroad.  Logic would dictate that if there are Ukrainian students here, they should be treated the same.  If there are new rules, they should apply to all.  That would be my view.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of the wind farm in Galway and said that the ESB should pay the fines totalling approximately &euro;17 million.  I suggest that it might be worthwhile putting in a Commencement matter on that issue as it is quite a specific and niche question.</p> <p>Senator Boylan raised the issue of blood donation and the lack of a public awareness campaign as changes are coming in on 28 March.  She suggested that it has been handled as a low-key change.  I am aware of it but perhaps that is due to being in the Oireachtas.  Maybe there is a different level of awareness.  I am not really sure.  Certainly if there is a shortage we should be publicising that the system is now more open in terms of people donating.  I tend to pass out when I give blood so it is something I cannot do as easily as others.  We should not have to be importing blood if we can increase our supply here, which would be good for everybody.  It is absolutely a worthwhile suggestion.</p> <p>Senator Cassells spoke about the likelihood that Ireland along with the UK will host the European football championships.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will not pretend to have vast knowledge of this whole area but I do think it would be a fantastic event for us to host.  I am not aware of the particular issue around Hill 16.  That was news to me this morning but it would probably be worth tabling a Commencement Matter on it because it is quite a specific issue.  Regardless of people's views on different sporting events, Hill 16 probably means something to everybody in the country.  It is a famous terrace and I would hate to see a change made that was not logical or reasonable.  What the Senator said was certainly news to me but it was very interesting and would be worth raising directly with the Minister as a Commencement Matter.  </p><p>Senator Carrigy spoke about July provision and put on the record of the House that the money allocated last year was not spent.  This has been an ongoing issue that has been raised almost every year.  Resources are available but, for some reason, schools are not availing of them and at the end of the day, students lose out.  Reform of that system is long overdue.  If resources are available, they should be spent and children should be prioritised.  If there is a reason schools are not taking up that offer, it needs to be identified and addressed.  It would be worth raising this matter with the Minister for Education - perhaps through a Commencement Matter.  Again, it is quite a specific issue.  Doing so would be quite timely as we are heading into that period.  I concur with the Senator's remarks on the need to exercise a degree of cop-on when it comes to how we deal with younger children who often have sniffly noses.  However, this should not be conflated with having Covid.  A balance must be struck because children must get their education.  We cannot be overzealous in how we apply those rules and must ensure children can get to school within reason.  I hope most schools are doing their best in that regard.  I take on board the serious issue raised by the Senator.  If children are being consistently told to stay at home, it is not an acceptable position.  </p><p>Senator Conway spoke about the Ukrainian refugees and what everyone in Clare is doing.  He spoke about the numbers coming to his county and the fantastic response from all the agencies there.</p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about the St. Patrick's Day parades.  I concur with her remarks.  I was also quite impressed with what people pulled together essentially in the space of two months.  Normally they would plan a St. Patrick's Day parade a few weeks after the previous one.  They only got the green light in January so hats off to all the parade committees across the country that managed to pull those parades together, get schoolchildren involved and get floats out and costumes made.  It was really impressive.  I walked in the parade in my home town of Castlebar and we had the largest crowd I have seen at a parade in years.  It was phenomenal.  For lots of younger children, it was the first parade they could remember going to so it was really important for the community.  They did a great job at such short notice and it is worth acknowledging that.  </p><p>Senator Lombard spoke about the discussions at Cabinet on the food ombudsman.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working very hard on this issue.  The appointment of a food ombudsman has been sought by farming organisations for many years.  I think we will all agree that farmers should be paid a fair price for their produce and that the push for cheaper and cheaper food all of the time, which benefits consumers, can be very damaging to agriculture and the farming sector so we must strike the right balance, which is where the ombudsman comes in.  The Senator posed questions about whether it is being watered down or whether it will have teeth.  We have to trust that the Minister is listening to the farming organisations,  and I know he is, and see what is produced in terms of legislation.  We will judge the legislation when we have it in front of us.  We cannot pre-empt what might come through those discussions.  </p><p>Senator Currie finished the Order of Business by concurring with the remarks regarding David Hill and referring to Limestone United in Belfast playing-----</p></speech>

This Bill is aimed at replacing the Garda compensation scheme that is currently in operation with a new statutory scheme that will reduce the waiting times and costs associated with claims for malicious injury to garda&iacute; or their family members.  The key aims of the Bill are to reduce the length of time it takes for Garda compensation claims to be dealt with from the initial application through to award, to ensure settlement and resolution of claims can be reached earlier in the process and to set out clear time limits relating to each stage of the process.  It also aims to reduce the number of applications proceeding to court by allowing for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to assess quantum in the first instance, which will in turn reduce the legal and administrative costs associated with the scheme.  At present, with backlogs in the High Court, it can take up to four years for a case for Garda compensation to be heard.  That results in significant legal costs, which are covered entirely by the State.</p> <p>Before I move to the provisions of the Bill, I will outline broadly how the new scheme is proposed to operate.  The member, or his or her specified dependant in the case of a fatal injury, will apply to the Garda Commissioner for initial assessment of his or her case within six months of the injury.  The Garda Commissioner will arrange for a reporting officer to determine if the person is an eligible applicant and, if so, to prepare a written report within a specified time period, to conclude whether the injury or death appears to have been caused as a result of a malicious incident as defined in the Bill.  If the report concludes the injury or death appears to have been caused as a result of a malicious incident, the member or his or her specified dependant is entitled to an assessment of compensation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If the report concludes the injury or death was not caused as a result of a malicious incident, the member can seek an independent review of that finding.  An independent review officer will determine whether the finding of a reporting officer should be confirmed or overturned.  If overturned, the member is entitled to an assessment of compensation.</p><p>Where a member is entitled to an assessment of compensation, the Garda Commissioner will arrange for an application to be made to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on his or her behalf.  PIAB will process the application in accordance with the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act of 2003, as amended, and will make an assessment by reference to the personal injury guidelines.  If either party rejects it, the applicant will receive authorisation from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to proceed to court.  The State Claims Agency will manage the court proceedings on behalf of the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>I will now turn the detail of the Bill.  The Bill is divided into seven Parts and I will outline its key provisions.  Part 1 sets out the Title of the Bill and other legislation that the Bill interacts with and provides for commencement orders for the coming into force of the Bill once enacted.  It sets out the relevant definitions for the Bill, including the key definitions of "malicious incident" and "member".</p><p>The current Acts make a distinction between injuries of a minor and non-minor nature.  This Bill removes this distinction and ensures all injuries inflicted as a result of a malicious incident are covered by this scheme.  The transitional arrangements that will apply to applications received prior to the commencement of the scheme are set out in section 5.  For those applications where a determination on whether a member has been maliciously injured has not yet been made in my Department, these applications will fall under the new process as outlined in this Bill.  In cases where the Minister has given authorisation for an application for compensation to proceed to the High Court, those claims will proceed as if the 1941 to 1945 Acts have not been repealed, and applications already initiated in the High Court will remain there.  In other words, there will be no change for these proceedings.</p><p>Part 2 deals with the application for initial assessment to the Garda Commissioner.  The applicant is defined in section 8 and may make an application to the Garda Commissioner specified in section 9.  It captures all persons previously permitted to make claims under the 1941 to 1945 Acts.  Section 10 states the time limit for making an application, which is six months from the date of the injury or knowledge of the injury, with provision made for late applications in certain circumstances.</p><p>Part 3 sets out the appointment of a reporting officer to assess an application.  The criteria for the preliminary examination and the determination of an application are detailed in this Part as well.  It gives clear timeframes for the completion of a determination, which is four months, with the possibility of an extension of a further two months.  Where a determination is made that the application can proceed to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, it sets a timeframe of 30 days for the Garda Commissioner to make the application on behalf of the applicant.</p><p>Part 4 provides for the procedures for the independent review process, the creation of a review panel for independent assessment, the criteria for the preparation of a report and clear timelines for the process.  The time limit for making an application is 30 days from the date of notice issued to the applicant set out in section 16.  A review officer will have three months within which to either make a determination to either confirm or set aside the original decision issued.</p><p>Part 5 sets out the application and amendment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act of 2003.  It permits the assessment of quantum by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board in Garda compensation cases and provides for the application of the cost provisions in that Act.  It allows for certain modifications to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act of 2003 for Garda claims to facilitate the new process.  However, the process for acceptance or rejection of an assessment by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will apply in the same way that it does for other personal injuries actions.  This means that where either the applicant or the Garda Commissioner rejects an assessment, an authorisation will issue to the applicant to lodge a claim in the relevant court.</p><p>Part 6 sets out the particulars where proceedings are being brought on foot of an authorisation by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board under the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act of 2003.  The court will assess whether the injury or death, as the case may be, was the result of a malicious incident, and it will also assess the level of compensation.  This Bill mirrors the criteria set out in the Garda Compensation Acts 1941 to 1945, while including the requirement to have regard to the personal injuries guidelines, which will streamline cases with ordinary personal injury claims.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This part does not mention which court the proceedings should be lodged to.  This is to allow for the bringing of proceedings to a court which has monetary jurisdiction for the claim, thereby removing the need for all Garda compensation claims to be brought before the High Court.

As a party, Fianna F&aacute;il, the party of Government, supports this Government legislation which is effectively bringing Garda compensation claims within the remit of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB.  As a former member of the finance committee, which often discussed the cost of insurance, I know much of the cost of the process was not about what the person due the compensation was getting and much of it was caught up in administrative costs, legal fees and so on.  I accept that if some people are members of the legal profession and they were making good money out of this, perhaps they might not be overly impressed with some of this legislation.  However, from a State perspective and from an applicant&rsquo;s perspective, anything that ensures those who are putting forward their claims can do it in a more efficient and timely way - and in a way that gets them their compensation more quickly as they are entitled to - and also streamlines the process on behalf of the State, is positive.</p> <p>The Bill is aimed at decreasing the length of time it takes to dispose of a Garda compensation claim from initial application to award by providing for clear time limits in regard to each stage of the process.  The new process is aimed at ensuring that avenues for a settlement and resolution are available at the earliest possible stage and that cases do not end up before the courts and are not necessarily dealt with by the High Court where the amounts claimed in compensation could be awarded by a lower court.  Provisions in regard to legal costs penalties for failure to settle or for choosing the wrong level of court will now apply to Garda compensation claims in the same way that they apply to other personal injuries schemes.  </p> <p>I welcome this legislation.  There was a commitment that this would be done.  In his speech, the Minister of State gave a very good summary of the legislation in his last few paragraphs.  It is about updating the current process to streamline applications.  It overhauls the process while retaining the parameters of the current Acts to ensure those that can apply and the criteria for consideration of assessments remain.</p> <p>I say this as somebody whose grandfather was a member of the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a very long time - almost all of his career.  I certainly want to see people who are injured and who have a legitimate claim get the compensation they are entitled to in a quick and fair manner, and that they are not dragged through a long, drawn-out process when that does not need to be the case.  The reason there is a compensation claim in the first place was because there was some level of injury and those people have already suffered enough.  Let us make sure they get what they are entitled to more quickly and efficiently, and that we do not end up having a lot of unnecessary legal costs and unnecessary time spent in delay to get what they are entitled to.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

As a barrister, as a Minister and as Attorney General, it struck me that the previous legislation was well past its sell-by date and had many defects in it.  It is good to have one simple method whereby members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are entitled to compensation have a clear path to compensation which is not strewn with obstacles or unnecessary expense.</p> <p>Second, it seems to me the legislation is designed to, and probably will, achieve greater fairness as between members of the Garda.  It was my experience, and I make no criticism of anybody in this, that some members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na got more for their injuries than others simply because of the attitude or disposition of the judge before whom the case came to be decided in the High Court.  Some judges were effusive in their support for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and tended to express that in the level of awards they made, whereas other judges were pulling back a little to try to be objective and to look at it in simple terms, comparable to other members of the public who suffered similar-type injuries.  From that point of view, it is a good idea that the scheme of this Bill will, in effect, ensure there is a degree of standardisation of approach by reason of the PIAB aspect of the matter and also by reference to the newly installed personal injuries guidelines.</p> <p>I would make the point that some cognisance has to be taken of the fact that a broken leg is one thing, but a broken leg maliciously caused to a person by the driving of a car at a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can have a very different psychological effect on the member.  I hope the legislation, when it is through these Houses, makes it very clear that the psychological trauma associated with many injuries is fully maintained, and it is not just simply a matter of a broken leg due to falling down a stairs or in a public house equating to somebody who has a car driven at him or her and has sustained a broken leg in those circumstances.</p> <p>There is one other thing I want to mention.  I notice that the Bill proposes to extend its coverage to Criminal Assets Bureau members, who, I understand, are not members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but operate arising out of the same functions that they carry out under the criminal assets legislation.  I support that, of course, but the one thing I would query is the complete exclusion of civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from the remit of the Bill.  It seems to me that, going forward, we will have a situation where many technical functions associated with criminal investigations now carried out by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will also be carried out by civilian employees or staff members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I notice they are excluded from the term &ldquo;member&rdquo; for the purposes of the legislation.  It occurs to me that it may be they will find themselves on the wrong end of criminal violence and threats made against them in the future, for example, scenes of crime investigators or people who are handling the administrative side of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who could come under intimidation from organised crime and the like.  I just raise the issue as to whether it is entirely wise to exclude them from a scheme of compensation, given they may be in the firing line, even though they are not technically members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that point.  I can see there are probably complexities going either way in this regard.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It seems to me that if there is malice directed towards, and injury inflicted on, a civilian employee of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by reason of his or her occupation as such, a major distinction should not be drawn between that employee and members of the force, as properly described.</p><p>The final point I want to make is that I very much welcome that members of the Garda Reserve are included in the provisions of this legislation.  We must get the reserve up and running again.  It has been allowed to fall into a state of semi-redundancy and it needs to be revitalised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-22a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032200002#GG00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Seanad for the debate.  There are very few occupations in this country where a person goes out to work and is never sure whether he or she will come home or, as my colleague, Senator McDowell, has pointed out, whether he or she may come home with a broken leg and that may only be the outward symbol of what happened.  There are vicious attacks every day of the week on members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In 2020, more than 200 such attacks took place.  A significant number of members of the force have given their lives in the course of their duty.</p> <p>There is one only regrettable part of the Bill that I see, namely, the provision that if a person does not go through the PIAB and instead decides to go to the courts, where a reward that is lower than what was on offer is given, he or she will be caught for full court fees.  I understand why that provision is there but it will act, in effect, as a sort of a gun to people's head.  I hope that when injuries are assessed, it is done based on the occupation of the individuals and the risks to their lives they undertook in going to work each day.  I welcome the Bill and I hope it leads to speedy settlements.  My brother, who, sadly, is not with us anymore, suffered horrendous injuries while serving as a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  He had to wait meet many years for a settlement to come through.  That should never be the case.  If the Bill expedites that process, it will be a good thing.</p></speech>

T&aacute; a fhios agam nach mbeidh gach aturnae agus gach abhc&oacute;ide sa St&aacute;t s&aacute;sta leis an mBille ach, ag an am c&eacute;anna, feicim an f&aacute;th go bhfuil s&eacute; ann.  I understand the relevance of this Bill and the reason it is being introduced.  In my profession, I have seen instances in which garda&iacute; have had to react to violent circumstances, such as when a melee breaks out.  Where members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are present in such situations, people turn to them, expecting them to react and solve the problem.  There is no amount anyone could pay me to be the person to whom people turn to resolve the melee, the violence or whatever it is.  I put on the record my extraordinary admiration for the work An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does and for the harm in which ordinary members put themselves while doing their job.  It is not to be underestimated by any of us here.</p> <p>That said, it always has seemed strange to me that there was a separate stream for compensation for garda&iacute;.  There was a list in the High Court that was set apart from other personal injuries matters, whereby garda&iacute; had to go through a different process from that applying to ordinary citizens to get recompense for injuries they may have suffered, particularly in the course of what amounts to a workplace accident, albeit in extraordinary circumstances.  "Incident" might be a better word than "accident" as the Bill refers to a "malicious incident" in one of the earlier sections.  It also seems strange that there are so many Acts governing this issue and even this Bill to undo all of that is very weighty.  It is substantial legislation and, as I said, I understand the intention behind it.</p> <p>Notwithstanding that, there are parts of the Bill with which I have a difficulty, one of which Senator McDowell has outlined.  An issue we have pushed in this House and as policy of Government is the civilianisation of certain functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We want to do away with a situation where a garda who might be very experienced, who has gone through the training regime of Templemore and all the other things that go with that and who, having put himself or herself through all of that to be a qualified person on the street, in a detective role or whatever it might be, ends up filling out passport forms or something like that.  This is a terribly wasteful use of the resource that is members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We all agree that we should move towards a situation where those roles are civilianised and there are administrators within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who carry out that work, thereby reducing the administrative burden on the members who have gone through the qualification process.</p> <p>It is difficult to say to a person sitting behind the desk in a Garda station when somebody comes in, kicks off and the person is assaulted, that he or she, sitting behind the desk, is somehow not in the same category as the person wearing the Garda uniform who is sitting 3 ft from him or her in the public office or another office inside the station.  How can we ask people to be part of a civilian administration within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while telling them they will not be accorded the same minium standards we are giving to garda&iacute; in protecting their rights and providing compensation in the event of a malicious incident that resulted in injury to them?  It does not make sense that any person working within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether in a front-line role or otherwise, would not be covered by this legislation under the definition of "member" in section 2.  Will the Minister of State give consideration to whether the scope of the Bill can be expanded to include all of those people?</p> <p>It is welcome that the definition of "malicious incident" in section 2(1) includes former members.  That is very important because it gives full scope to the Bill in terms of those who have worked as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I welcome that the definition goes beyond the strict parameters of someone who is wearing a uniform or whatever it might be.</p> <p>We should not underestimate the effort that has gone into the Bill.  The Minister of State has indicated that it will save costs, which is, of course, important.  Notwithstanding that I am a practising barrister - the Minister of State is not currently practising but we have been in court together in the past - I do, of course, endorse the effort to reduce the State's legal bill in whatever way is practicable, not with a view to penalising people but with the aim of streamlining the process.  This Bill undoubtedly does that.  Effort, time and expense went into the generation of the legislation by way of the time given by officials and all the other processes that had to be gone through.  I may be straying slightly from the subject of the Bill here but it strikes me as incongruous, therefore, that we have a situation whereby criminal legal aid has not been restored.  I realise this comes under the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but it is a justice issue.  It is a matter the Department of Justice should highlight because it is creating problems within the criminal justice system that are equally important to tackle as those addressed in these provisions.  Legal practitioners are still dealing with a massive cut, of more than a third in almost every case, in the legal aid that is available to them under the criminal legal aid scheme.  This means that barristers and solicitors, both new and existing practitioners, are leaving that area of the law in favour of other areas in which they can make a sustainable living.  It is incongruous that this problem persists given all the effort, time and attention that has been given to the issue on which the legislation focuses.  I am not denigrating its importance, which I recognise, but there are other issues that are equally important to address.  As someone who practises in the criminal area, I would even say they are more important.  This is an area in which the Department of Justice should equally say to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that there is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p> <p>The streamlining process set out in the Bill reduces the time and cost to the State.  There is no benefit to the people who are injured in having a lengthy, more complex or more expensive legal process.  It makes sense to engage the services of the PIAB in addressing these issues.  Previously, a Garda compensation claim had to go through the list in the High Court, thereby raising the level of that case beyond what it might necessarily warrant.  It is appropriate now that the full spectrum of court jurisdictions are available to people who seek compensation.  On the whole, therefore, I welcome the Bill.  Its provisions make sense.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board what I said about criminal legal aid and other gaps there may be in the provisions.  I look forward to the passage of the Bill through the House.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in will support this Bill, which repeals and replaces the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945, which are the basis for dealing with Garda compensation claims.  The main aim of the Bill is to provide a new compensation scheme for malicious injuries, including fatal injury inflicted upon garda&iacute; in the course of their duties.  I acknowledge that it is designed to make the claims process easier and, we hope, quicker for those who need to use it.  It will be less expensive for the State while maintaining the parameters of the right to compensation for garda&iacute; or their dependants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It also seeks to ensure that settlement and resolution of claims can be reached earlier in the process.  The present compensation scheme allows for an injured member, or in the case of death their specified dependents, to make an application to the Minister for authorisation to apply to the High Court for compensation.  Most actions proceed on a no-fault basis and both parties require legal representation in the High Court.  The costs arising from this are borne entirely by the State.</p><p>This Bill provides for an application to be made to the Garda Commissioner, who appoints a reporting officer to determine if the applicant is eligible under the Bill and whether the injury is a result of a malicious incident.  If the report confirms it is malicious, an application is made to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, by the Commissioner.  When an assessment is made by PIAB, it can be accepted or rejected by either party.  Where it is rejected, PIAB will issue an authorisation to the applicant to lodge court proceedings.  While in the past the State took full responsibility for court costs, this changes with this Bill and the applicant may have to cover legal costs.  That is where there are concerns about the Bill.  If the Garda Commissioner makes the application on behalf of the Garda member and the claim is managed by the State Claims Agency, it could result in the member feeling powerless or distanced in the initial application stage.  I hope that is not how it will transpire for most claimants but it is a concern.  They can reject the PIAB assessment if they do not agree with it, but they will then have to pay the legal fees to pursue the application further.</p><p>We have to consider that claimants may not feel comfortable engaging with the system and would prefer to engage with a solicitor and go through the courts.  Many solicitors say this is because claims are complex and cannot be detailed accurately through PIAB, and this may also be true for members of the Garda when a malicious incident affects their ability to return to work or leads to circumstances deemed too complex to be dealt with by PIAB.  Due to their day-to-day work, garda&iacute; are vulnerable to being injured in road collisions or while helping the public, or to being targeted because of their work.  The State needs to be prepared to support garda&iacute;.</p><p>I acknowledge that saving money and speeding up the compensation system are important, but they should not be the only guiding factors when it comes to assisting injured members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, we will support the Bill as we appreciate what is trying to be achieved.  It has been a constructive debate so far and I was struck by the points made by Senators Ward and McDowell.  We look forward to further debate and perhaps some amendments on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I thank An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the work it does every day in all our communities.  In recent days with St. Patrick's Day parades, etc., we have seen the work garda&iacute; do in our communities and it must always be recognised.  As Senator Craughwell has said, over 200 attacks took place in 2020, which indicates how much compensation we need to give to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the work its members do and how much thanks we need to give those members every time they put on that uniform and head out through the door.</p> <p>The Bill is to replace the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Compensation) Acts 1941 and 1945.  Those Acts provide for compensation in respect of death or injury which is maliciously inflicted upon a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na while on duty or in connection with their duties.  The current scheme operates on the basis that an injured member, or specified dependants in the case of death, may apply to the Minister for Justice for authorisation to apply to the High Court for compensation in respect of the injury received.</p> <p>I agree with the Minister of State that this Bill will streamline the way in which compensation claims by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are dealt with and will reduce the administrative costs and legal fees associated with the current system, as well as ensuring that garda&iacute; and their families can get compensation in a simpler and more efficient process.

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is important legislation.  We should remember we are talking about men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who serve to protect us all.  If we ever doubt the value of the role of members of the Garda, we saw it in Covid and see it every day.  Senator McDowell made a telling reference to a broken leg and the maliciousness thereof, and extrapolated that out to the types of injuries members receive every day and have received.</p> <p>Men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been injured in the line of duty will provide harrowing account of their experiences, in some cases involving the death of a colleague or injury to themselves or a colleague.  We all welcome the streamlining of the compensatory process but this is about front-line men and women who protect us and who are called at the worst and the best of times.  I hope there will be no procrastination, roadblocks or obfuscation concerning the compensatory process.  My colleague and friend, Senator Ward, made a telling point on the civilianisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of front-of-office workers, who were also referred to by Senator McDowell.  In Cork, with which I am familiar, civilians who work in the front-of-office space should not be treated differently from members in terms of what is being put forward.  We have all long advocated the need for civilianisation of roles to free up members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for front-line duty.  Administrative roles are important but we cannot have a two-tier situation involving people working in public offices or public spaces.  It is a concern many of us have about what we are debating.</p> <p>This is important and timely legislation.  We are making it a simple process.  Senator McDowell spoke about the pathway to compensation.  It is important that there is equity and fairness in the compensation process and in the model of delivery for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I hope we do it in a transparent and open way.  This morning we heard the testimony of a young girl injured in an accident who was unhappy with the amount of money she was awarded in her compensation claim.  She was knocked down in a horrific accident on her way to school.  The psychological effects and trauma suffered by men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the line of duty should not be forgotten and should be at the forefront of what we do.</p> <p>Mar fhocal scoir, I thank members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for their work.  It was a mistake that we did not prioritise their vaccination in the heat and teeth of Covid but we have been tremendously served by that body since its formation and the foundation of the State.  I hope we continue to support its work.  We owe its members a debt of gratitude for what they do for us every day.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-22a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032200002#JJ00300"><p>I thank the Senators for their contributions and the broad support they have provided.  I acknowledge the huge work that is done by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in putting their lives at risk on a daily basis, as a number of Senators pointed out.  Indeed, Senator Craughwell pointed out that this is one profession where when you go out you do not if you are going to return home.  They have done tremendous work.  Let us reflect on the pandemic and what the Garda did then not just in enforcing peace and safety but the community work on a daily basis, reaching out throughout Ireland and ensuring that people were safe.  Yesterday I was in Rosslare Europort for five hours.  I spent considerable time with members  of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na down there who are on the front line dealing with the very traumatic and tragic situation of Ukrainians arriving in the port.  I witnessed their humanitarian approach.  While they have legal duties to fulfil, they behaved in a compassionate manner and showed their understanding of these people who were very distressed and tired arriving after a long journey from Ukraine to Rosslare, which takes 24 hours on a boat from France.  This Bill provides a new fit-for-purpose Garda compensation scheme.  Importantly what it will do is help reduce the time that garda&iacute; face at the moment when seeking justifiable compensation when they have been maliciously injured on the front line.  It will also reduce the cost of administering the scheme.  That is important so that we can get a more streamlined, effective scheme in place that reduces the stress of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na members but also reduces the cost to the State.  It does this by setting out clear timeframes for each stage to ensure there is a swift resolution of the claims made.</p> <p>The Bill also provides more time for applicants.  It increases the time to make an application from three to six months.  Not having to make a decision so quickly gives the garda&iacute; more opportunity to assess the situation in which they have found themselves.  Use of PIAB for assessing the award for Garda compensation also ensures that there is now an independent assessment.  As Senator McDowell pointed out, it will also ensure greater consistency of awards across the board.  The guidelines that PIAB has will also assist in that regard.</p> <p>It is hoped that this Bill will mean that the majority of cases will be resolved without the need of court proceedings, which, in turn, will reduce the level of stress and the level of legal costs to the State and increase the speed of resolution.  With recourse to the lower courts now available rather than the necessity to bring each claim before the High Court, it will mean a lower level of costs associated with some of the claims that need to proceed to court.  This is an important change.</p> <p>I wish to signal that the Minister may bring forward one or two small technical amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage.  The amendments relate to the application forms to be prescribed by the Minister for Justice.  It may not be desirable to have a requirement for these forms to be prescribed by regulation as it will be subject to change each time the PIAB form changes and, therefore, a technical amendment may be brought to remove the requirement to prescribe these forms by way of regulation.</p> <p>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I welcome Senator Horkan's support and the acknowledgement of the importance of getting this compensation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without delay.  I have responded to a number of comments by Senator McDowell.  In regard to civilian staff, a point raised by Senators McDowell and Buttimer, they are not included in the provisions of the Bill, nor are they included under the current provisions of the Acts of 1941 to 1945.  This is due to the fact that they are not engaged in front-line policing, which carries with it an increased risk of injury or death on duty in comparison with other types of policing duties.  I acknowledge that there is an increased civilianisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Increasingly, roles are being given to members of the staff so it will certainly be kept under consideration.  I will bring this to the attention of the Minister.  </p> <p>An appeal is possible under this legislation. </p></speech>

Psychological injury very much is taken into account.</p> <p>I acknowledge Senator Ward welcoming this and for pointing out the increased civilianisation.  This is something we need to keep an eye on.  The Senator also welcomed the inclusion of former members.  As he rightly pointed out, the Department of Justice does not have any role in criminal legal aid restoration.  He is factually correct that there has been a one third-plus cut that has not been restored to members of the legal profession whereas cuts have been restored to almost every other sector of society.  While I have no role in that matter I will certainly bring it to the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Senator also welcomed the full spectrum of court jurisdictions being available, which is important.</p> <p>Senator Gavan also recognised that this will be quicker and easier for those who need compensation and welcomed that for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Senator Wall also welcomed this and Senator Buttimer acknowledged the front-line role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I welcome the support of Senators for this Bill.  I acknowledge the couple of matters that need to be given further consideration.  I will bring those to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

On his behalf I thank the Senators for their time today and in their deliberation of the Bill on Second Stage.  I also thank my colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  This Bill has broad support and is welcome legislation.  It ensures employees can be protected where through no fault of their own they were laid off temporarily because of Covid-19, and they will now have financial compensation if subsequently made redundant.  This is a recognition that it came as a result of State intervention arising from the pandemic, and employers will not be on the hook for the payment.</p> <p>This is a very welcome development and there are necessary protections in place for employees but it does not put undue financial pressure on an employer.  We hope many employees will retain their employment now that Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted and the economy is fully open again.  Unfortunately, because of a change in circumstances some people will be made redundant.  It is important for protections to be put in place for such employees.  The economic indications remain positive and employment rates are high.  We want to ensure this continues.  I thank Senators for ensuring the swift passage of the Bill through Committee and Remaining Stages this evening and for their support on previous Stages.</p></speech>

He is new to dealing with the Bill in this Chamber but not to the background of this legislation.  I also welcome the three farmers who have taken time off from their farms to come here from Kerry, Laois and Donegal.  I am conscious everybody is busy and people have many things going on, but the kernel of this matter is the issue of adequate compensation.  Ministers have said the floor of the Seanad is not where we negotiate a final settlement or deal, and I acknowledge that.  All I have sought on behalf of these farmers is fair play, and I have no skin in this game, if I may be excused for the pun.</p> <p>When a Government issues a decree to close any business, and that could be a poultry farm or something else tomorrow, there may be valid reasons for doing so, such as for animal health reasons, for example, but it is important it be recognised we are closing an industry and closing off livelihoods and incomes.  Layers of knowledge and expertise have been built up in this business.  I know the Minister of State's constituency well and he represents a rural community.  In the context of a just transition, we talk about supporting rural communities.  Change does come and it is inevitable.</p> <p>Where I and most Senators stand in the context of this issue concerns the need to support these people in respect of their livelihoods and those of their families and to acknowledge the major investment they have put into the sector.  Neither I nor anyone else here is in favour of continuing mink farming.  That debate is long over.  I am also conscious this matter was debated at length in the D&aacute;il.  I have taken the time to look at what Deputies said during that debate.  I cannot pass judgment on what they decided to do, but we are members of the Upper House and we have the opportunity to amend, polish or seek to bring some changes to this legislation.</p> <p>I believe the Minister of State will agree with my main point, but I would like to hear him say it at some stage.  We want to stand in solidarity with these people in respect of giving them a fair deal.  I am not going to decide what that is, but they must get a fair deal that recognises their enormous contribution.  I refer to the costs of lost income, demolition, and environmental and other assessments that must be included in the mix.  We have leverage here.  I will put myself in the boots of these mink farmers, so to speak, and say they have leverage now.  They will have none once this legislation is passed, other than the goodwill and the good words of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Ministers of State and the Department officials.</p> <p>I am not here to doubt the goodwill of the Minister, the Ministers of State or the officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We must, however, view this situation from the farmers' perspective as well.  It is grand they have been told there will be a negotiation or some arrangement, but it must be fair and meaningful.  What concerns me when these people leave this House tonight or on Thursday night is whether they will have any leverage or any comeback afterwards.  We will certainly not have any comeback with the Department.</p> <p>I acknowledge the extensive work of the Minister of State in agriculture and that he is a fair man to deal with and represents a rural constituency.  Regarding tonight's work, I am just trying to set the scene regarding where I am coming from on this issue and where my support is directed.  I support a fair transition and compensation for these farmers.  I think the Minister of State.</p></speech>

We have discussed it at length, gone around the House and asked the Department for clarification and to address issues regarding a just transition for these communities.  Three communities will be affected, with 35 jobs lost and 35 families affected, and the three farming families will lose their incomes.  This will happen not because of economic issues but because of a Government policy decision.  We have been trying to hammer out in this House a way to ensure there will be a fair transition for these families, the families of the workers and the three communities overall.</p> <p>The Minister of State is very much aware that the terminology of a just transition was brought forward to help communities deal with changes in environments because of Government policy.  Climate change has been an example everyone has used in respect of the need for a just transition.  When it came to this issue, we asked the Department for clarity regarding how it proposed to bring about a just transition for these three communities.  We did not get much.  The Minister of State has given guarantees on the record and they must be reiterated.  The guarantees to take a fair approach to these communities are important.  Otherwise, we will be dealing with a scenario where the representatives of these family farms will have one arm tied behind their back when they negotiate with the Department.</p> <p>I also raised the issue of having a mediator put in place to work with the Department and these three family farms on compensation.  We are not here to negotiate on their behalf; far from that.  Statements have been made regarding the Seanad trying to negotiate a deal.  It is anything but that.  We are trying to put a process in place where a fair deal can be instituted for both sides.  More important will be how it looks.  We pass legislation, we give full power to the Department and then it dictates what will happen.  The worst scenario here would be that these families would, unfortunately, end up suffering because of what will happen.</p> <p>This legislation is not about fur farmers; it is about the agricultural community overall.  There could be dramatic changes in the decades to come and this legislation could be used as the benchmark in dealing with those.  That is a major fear for every farming sector.  The measures to be taken under this legislation might be seen in future as ones that worked and as ones to be repeated.  Therefore, this is not just about the fur farming industry but about the entire agricultural community and how it could be grossly impacted by this enabling legislation that could be used as a stick with which to beat it.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State reaffirm the commitments given by the other Minister of State in the House that a fair package will be put in place for these communities and for these family farms - they are going to be no more because of a Government decision - to allow all concerned to move forward.  We all realise there is time pressure associated with this legislation and that we must make progress.  What we are trying to do, however, is to be constructive.  Articles in the newspapers this weekend were unhelpful, to say the least.  If anything, we are trying to fight for these communities and to fight for fair compensation for the farming community.  If I am condemned for that, I will be condemned for it.  What I am trying to do is to ensure there will be a fair package for everyone.</p></speech>

There is unity across this House about being in favour of ending mink farming.  Nobody here is calling for an extension of mink farming.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would have liked to have seen it abolished a long time ago given my experiences as an ecologist dealing with escaped mink and the damage they do to the natural environment.  There is a unity of voice in the Chamber when it comes to mink farming.  Now is the time it has to be abolished.  The Government is introducing legislation to do this.  Again, there is a unity of purpose in coming forward with amendments.  Unfortunately, they were ruled out of order because they put a cost on the State.  They were very sensible amendments on environmental impact assessments to prevent the lowballing of demolition processes, putting in place a training scheme fund for the workers and using five years rather than ten years in the method to calculate compensation.  We know ten years is standard practice in other jurisdictions.  Colleagues in the House have put forward other amendments, all trying to address the same issue, namely, a fair package for workers who are being told by the Government they are now out of work.  The Government has made a policy decision that has resulted in them no longer having a job.</p><p>I am looking down the road at climate action and the importance of a just transition.  If we really believe in a just transition and it is not just about a sound bite, then it is about bringing together workers, community, employers and government in social dialogue and about the investments needed for the fair transformation of society to a low-carbon economy.  In 2018, when the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was in opposition he introduced a just transition Bill in the D&aacute;il.  He stated decarbonising our society requires changing everything, including our entire energy, food production, transport and industrial systems.  He said we needed to get this change right, particularly in supporting and maintaining workers' rights, and that social justice and ecological justice go together.  It is interesting that in his first act as Minister, when he introduced the climate Bill, there was not a single reference in it to just transition.  Alarm bells were ringing then for members of the Opposition.  The climate committee worked very strongly together.  We were given umpteen assurances from the Government that the final climate Act would address just transition.  It does not go far enough.  Eminently sensible amendments on a just transition with regard to climate action were rejected.  If we look at our Scottish counterparts, their climate Act has a just transition principles section.  The entire Bill is drafted on the policy of just transition.</p><p>The reason I raise this is that we are debating legislation today that will put people out of work.  This will also happen with climate action.  In this situation we are talking about three farms and 30 workers in total.  The Government is offering them a fairly insulting package.  As Senator Boyhan said, we are not negotiating on the floor of the Seanad but we are not confident in what the Government is offering the workers.  The workers are in the Chamber.  They want to hear strong commitments.  Once the Bill goes through, the leverage is gone.  We only have the Minister's word on whether he will step up to the plate and deliver a just transition for the mink farmers.  I have to say if this is the way we are looking at and approaching a just transition, I am very concerned about the road ahead and how we will meet our climate targets.</p><p>On the previous occasion I was in the Chamber debating this Bill, I made the point that I am from Dublin and I know it is tough enough already trying to sell climate action to people who are living in energy poverty.  Rural Deputies and Senators will go into rural communities that will see enormous changes in how we produce food and heat our homes.  What we are doing with the mink farmers does not bode well.  I do not envy anybody who can point to this legislation and say we have treated workers correctly because we have not.</p><p>There is unity of voice today.  Nobody is arguing for a delay in ending mink farming.  What we want to hear from the Minister is what he will do to ensure the affected workers and farmers have a fair and decent package that will set a precedent for the just transition in all of the other sectors in which we will have to have a just transition.</p></speech>

He said the legislation provides for statutory redundancy.  That is what the law of the State provides for.  He then went on to say there is capacity in the regulations to reflect other costs and the impact on employees.  Here is the problem.  This says absolutely nothing.</p> <p>One of the major disappointments I have is that to date the Minister has refused to meet again with the farmers and the workers.  As I understand it, the line from the Minister is that he will not meet them until the Bill is passed.  I have to challenge this with a very reasonable question.  Why would he not sit down with these people given all of the points that have been made by all of the parties about the importance of setting the right precedent for compensation for rural families and rural communities?  We need to see more from the Government and the Minister.</p> <p>There is something unique happening here.  This is not being debated on party political lines.  Members from all parties have stood up and spoken passionately about the need to defend these people and ensure they are given security, compensation and a chance to rebuild their lives because the Government is shutting down their industry.  Like others, I emphasise that I support this decision.  We are not in the business of delaying the Bill but we are in the business of ensuring, in as far as we can, that the people in the Gallery and their colleagues get fair compensation.</p> <p>As a rural man, the Minister will appreciate the old saying about not buying a pig in a bag.  The problem is that this is what the Minister is asking these people to do.  As a good Sinn F&eacute;in representative, I will be constructive as always and I will help the Minister with the words we need to hear from him this evening.  We need to hear that on top of statutory redundancy, there will be an enhanced redundancy package based on weeks per year of service.  This is what would happen normally in the private sector.  As a former union negotiator, I sat down with employers and hammered out a deal.  God knows, I would not get what I wanted and nor would the employer but we would work out a deal based on weeks per year of service and that deal would be a fair one.  If what we are going to get from the Minister this evening, and I hope it is not because I am trying to be constructive, is more words about capacity in the regulations to reflect other costs and the impact on employees, it will mean nothing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That means nothing because, to be absolutely frank, the Minister of State could turn around after the Bill is passed and say, "Fair play to you lads.  We are going to give each of you an extra &euro;500.  Good luck."  Let me be clear; I do not believe that is what the Minister of State wants to do.  I believe that, like others in this room, he wants to see a fair deal here but I have real fears that the Department will absolutely resist that for the very reasons set out by Senators Lombard and Boylan, including that it would set a precedent for just transition.  However, we would not be being fair and honourable to rural communities throughout Ireland if we did not stand up and insist that just transition means just that in this instance.  </p><p>We are not asking for the Minister of State to negotiate here in the room.  We are asking for a clear formula of words that indicates that there will be a proper enhanced redundancy package based on a given number of weeks per year of service.  I would really appreciate it if the Minister of State would repeat that comment in his responses.  That would be tremendously helpful.</p><p>We need clarity on this.  The key thing that really worries me is that there is no reason a Minister could not sit down with these people while this Bill is going through.  In fact, I would suggest that, if a Minister had done that, we could perhaps have already advanced beyond this stage.  The assurances that these workers are looking for are nothing if not reasonable.  They need to be delivered.  The good news is that it is in the Minister of State's hands to do that.  It is very simple.  It is in his hands to do that this evening by delivering a clear message as to the detail of an enhanced redundancy package to give assurance to these workers.  If he gives that clear assurance, I would hope that all of us could move on and see this Bill through.  Without that assurance, I would have to be direct and say it is not good enough not just for the people behind me and their colleagues, but for rural Ireland.  There is a lot of talk about rural Ireland in this Chamber but this evening we will see whether there is to be real delivery.  That means making a very clear and concrete statement that gives assurance to these people.  </p><p>What does it do for their confidence when yet another day passes while there is a refusal to meet with them?  I do not mean the Minister of State personally but the chief Minister is refusing to meet with them.  Their confidence is at rock bottom.  They have no faith in this Government to provide them with fair compensation.  That is the truth.  The Minister of State and the Minister would know that if they met with them and spoke to them.  In his response, I urge the Minister of State to simply give a commitment to sit down with them this week to meet their concerns head on and to give them assurance, allowing us to move on.  We want to move on.  I put it to the Minister of State respectfully that it is the Government that is holding up this Bill by its refusal to engage and to give decent and fair assurances to these families and workers.  The good news is that the Minister of State has an opportunity right here and right now to do just that.  I look forward to his constructive response.</p></speech>

I will be brief because the remainder of this evening's proceedings will be very much determined by the Minister of State's response and contribution.  I will not pre-empt that.  The majority of the money that has been invested by the three farmers involved was invested on the basis of specifications provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  They went to enormous expense to create the fantastic facilities they have, which have satisfied the Department's inspections.  If the Department had such a major input in the spending of this money, I plead that it now be fair to these people in the unravelling and unwinding of their businesses and in compensating them for the enormous expense they went to in order to run such a good show.  They continuously met with the Department's approval, but at enormous expense.</p> <p>These individuals aside, we are continuously pumping money into rural Ireland to create jobs.  Why not let the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine pump in money on this occasion to maintain the jobs that are already there?  Why not give these people the seed capital to set up alternative enterprises, thereby maintaining the employment they already provide to their current employees?  Why can we not do that now, at square one, rather than letting those jobs and businesses be lost to these remote rural areas before some other Department has to pump in money in six months' time to recreate the jobs that are already there?  We need to avoid all that additional cost, time and pain.  I will not say any more at this stage because I want to hear the Minister of State's address.</p></speech>

This is the second House of our Parliament.  It is really a blocking House and that is what the House has done.  It has held up this legislation and, in my view, it was right to do so.  I have not met any of these farmers.  I do not know them but everybody knows when they feel something is not fair.  The view has been expressed right across this House, by Members from all parties and by Independent Members, that what has been offered to workers and to the farmers and employers is not fair.  I am disappointed that the Department has not met with the farmers in recent weeks.  This House has given ample time for those meetings to take place.</p> <p>This Bill strikes me as being much the same as the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  That Act went through this House and put a great imposition on small retailers the length and breadth of this country.  It put impossible restrictions on some of the small retailers who sold alcohol.  This House saw that at the time.  The Government was not too happy with the House, just as I believe it is not happy that this Bill is being held up.  This House feels that there is an injustice here.  As previous speakers have said today and during our last session on this Bill, there is not a sense of fairness in this Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to give an indication to this House of what is going to take place after this legislation is passed or that he will stop the progress of the legislation for another while to allow meetings to take place.  In other words, I ask him to give an indication that something positive is going to happen.  </p> <p>The last time I spoke on this Bill, I said that the hardest thing my wife and I have had to do was to close down a business.  It is not that easy to close a business.  Everybody comes after one, including creditors, Revenue, people seeking redundancy and everybody else.  One needs a fair pot of money to close a business.  As has been pointed out, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is setting a precedent in closing down these farmers' businesses.  Some of them have been in business for 35 years.  That is a long time to spend building up a business.  It takes a long time to build up a business.  We have heard that every assistance will be given to them to create alternative businesses.  If these alternative businesses are going to be so lucrative, they would already exist and employ people, but they do not exist.  When one considers the amount of money needed to develop an enterprise in an area such as poultry production, egg production or pig production of a magnitude comparable to the enterprises of those people who are now making a wage and employing people, the amount of money they are getting to close down pales into insignificance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We cannot have bicycle shops and all of that stuff all over the countryside.  Everybody knows that only one such enterprise is profitable in a given area.  Few enterprises like coffee shops along walking routes make money to any great degree.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to treat these people in a very fair manner and look very favourably on what might be the outcome of his negotiations with them, even if it is after the legislation is passed.  They are not being treated well, to be quite honest.  The only obligation on the farmers is to pay statutory redundancy to workers.  There is a good bit of talking to be done regarding the Bill.  As previous speakers have said, this could be the start of things to come in regard to the just transition that has to take place.  If it is, we are not getting off to a very good start with this Bill.  I hope the Minister of State gives a strong indication to the House that there will be changes to what we have heard heretofore.</p></speech>

It is my first time to address this issue in the Seanad.  I am doing so in place of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  I am aware of the concerns which have been articulated by Senators.  I would like to acknowledge the points made by Senators Boyhan, Lombard, Boylan, Gavan, Daly and Burke.  I read a previous debate in the House on this matter before I took this debate today.  The Senators are absolutely right.  The role of the Seanad is to be a check and balance and to highlight issues and concerns that Members have or which people have raised.</p> <p>I have also heard colleagues in the House across the political divide make the point that this is not the House for detailed negotiation, yet some of what has been sought is detailed negotiation.  That can be dressed up.  It is all well and good to be reasonable in making points, but this is a Bill that is looking at a process.  I take on board the points and concerns raised, but there are limits to what the Bill can do in terms of the finer level of detail it can go into.</p> <p>The Minister has already made a decision.  In response to Senator Lombard, I am happy to reaffirm the commitments that have been made.  With regard to the workers, a decision was made to make extra payments to fur farming businesses for distribution to the workers as part of the compensation package.  There is an extra fund to support retraining and reskilling requirements.  This scheme will address the specific needs of employees in that regard.  The detail of the scheme will be in the regulations.</p> <p>Like all primary legislation, the Bill should not have a level of detail that is very prescriptive.  There is a package for workers.  The matter of five-year averaging was raised, and it was suggested that the relevant period could be ten years.  In terms of seeking reassurances, the independent assessor will have a key role to play.  If individual businesses or farmers feel very strongly about the ten-year period, as they do, an offer has been made to them to come back with more details that show the cyclical nature of the business.  That will be considered as part of the process.  To have a five-year averaging period is unusual; the normal period is three years.  Again, we are getting into a level of detail that is a challenge.  The cost of environmental assessments, including demolition costs, is a point that has been made previously.</p> <p>The Bill is about two key commitments in the programme for Government.  It is enabling legislation to get us to a point where schemes can be put in place, work can happen and certainty can be provided.  I want to acknowledge how hard this has been for individual farmers and staff.  As hard as the process has been, I imagine the length of time the uncertainty has continued is a contributory challenge to this.  People want the best deal for themselves and their businesses, families and workers, but they also want to get to a point where we can move to the stage of getting through the finer detail as part of the regulation and independent process.</p> <p>Senator Daly referred to the role of the Department in the specifications in the Bill.  Due to the nature of the business activity concerned, it is absolutely right that there is a high level of specification.  I acknowledge that the businesses and farmers involved carried out their business to that standard.  Plenty of inspections were carried out, as one would expect.  All requirements were met and that business was done very well.  The decision has been made.  It is fair to say that there is cross-party agreement on the cessation of fur farming in Ireland.  We now need to work through having legislation that puts in place a process that allows us to bring out the regulations to make that happen.</p></speech>

I have a couple of queries to try to tease things out a little further.  The Minister of State spoke about "extra payments" and funds for retraining and reskilling.  I do not think I am misquoting him.  First of all, I want to acknowledge that he is trying to be constructive.  I am not trying to be difficult, but "extra payments" can mean absolutely anything.  This happens less and less these days, unfortunately, but what normally happens when people lose their jobs is that good employers negotiate a package which is based around years of service and compensation per years of service.  The Minister of State has not said those words, yet those words do not commit him to any particular amount of money but rather a principle that has been well established across our economy for many decades.  The difficulty with "extra payments", to use the words the Minister of State did, is that they can be as little or as much as possible.  It is guesswork.  </p> <p>If the Minister of State addressed the other issue that I and others have raised, and committed to meet farmers this week and sit down with them to describe what the extra payments could be, that would help us enormously.  I am trying to be constructive.  Just to be clear, there is absolutely no reason a Minister or Minister of State should not sit down with these people now.  There is no legal impediment.  The lack of such a meeting is at the heart of many of the difficulties we are collectively trying to deal with today.</p> <p>To be helpful, it is important that the Minister of State elaborates on the phrase "extra payments", with specific reference to an enhanced redundancy package.  Those three words would be very helpful.  If the Minister of State went on to say that such a package would be based on additional weeks per year of service, that would be even more helpful.  This is not pinning the Minister of State to any particular amount of money.  We are not negotiating; rather, we are setting out the principles around which a negotiation should take place.  Any decent Government would agree to those principles.  They have been well established in industrial relations for a lot longer than I have been around.  It would be helpful if the Minister of State could comment on that and finally, and crucially, agree to sit down with these people.  There is no reason he cannot do that.</p></speech>

I fail to understand the compensation because there are highs and lows in businesses.  Compensation based on a ten-year period would give a fairer reflection.  There is evidence to back that up.  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, on a couple of occasions he was here with regard to the lines of communication.  They have been lacking, to be honest.  There is no point in saying anything different.</p> <p>I have been in business for a while.  There is a 27-page report.  The cost is six figures in excess of &euro;100,000.  However, no representative of Grant Thornton has stepped on any of the farms.  I do not get that.  I fail to understand it.  It does not give a fair reflection of what is on the ground.  As Senator Daly outlined in his contribution, significant investment has been made in specs and investment in the individual farms.  That has not been recognised.</p> <p>There is an ongoing issue across the House.  The Minister will be well aware, from his own constituency, of the example I will give.  Some 40 families are affected.  A local school, as a result of the closure of these farms, will lose a teacher.  They are the impacts on rural Ireland.  As an Oireachtas Member from west Galway, I am fairly familiar with the impact that the loss of a teacher has on a rural school.  I welcome the Minister of State's earlier comments but I ask for clarity on a couple of issues.  I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

We have had hours on this debate and building trust has been a big issue for us.  I acknowledge the contribution made by my learned colleague from Galway, Senator Crowe, about the lack of communication.  That is a significant issue we have had here.</p> <p>When we have met the farmers, the Minister gave us the impression there would be engagement.  The level of engagement has not been satisfactory and because of that, we are here for our third session.  We will probably be here until 10 p.m.  That is an unfortunate limit because of the lack of communication.</p> <p>I will go back to my core point about a precedent.  The Minister of State mentioned terminology.  The precedent would have been five years for a compensation package but there has never been a precedent of us closing an industry.  That is key.  This is the first time we have stepped up and said Government policy dictates that the industry is gone.</p> <p>We do not know what will be next.  My major fear is we do not know what industry will be rolled out next, for whatever view, and will be gone.  We need to look at where the precedent goes.  Will this be a stick that will come back to beat us?  The Department's report stated that there was a cycle in this industry.  We are debating what that cycle is.  That is a very fair debate.  We take the view that the Department says it is five years.  We say it is ten years.  The Department will not include 2021.  Why not?  It was one of the best years.  The years 2016 to 2020 are included but not 2021.  An awful lot of issues need to be looked at.</p> <p>Lack of trust has become a considerable issue.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's contribution and it is very important that we have that kind of contribution but that trust needs to be built from tonight forward.  Three family farms are effectively closed because of what we have decided to do.  We need to make sure that we support them and their communities in order that they can move on towards a just transition.  That kind of approach is required.</p></speech>

With regard to our amendments that were ruled out of order, I am aware that a ten-year cycle is taken in other jurisdictions.  As others have said, it appears that the years selected on which to base the compensation seem to be the loss-making years.  Will the Minister of State elaborate on where the five years came from?  Why are we not looking at how this was done in other jurisdictions when it came to closing down this industry and using the ten-year method?</p> <p>The fact that the Department was reluctant to visit any of the farms prior to this legislation is concerning.  My understanding is that, initially, the Department suggested using Google Maps to calculate the costs of the demolition.  Will the Minister confirm that is correct?  Will he confirm that only one of the three farms have been visited by the Department?  That is only on the back of the persistence of the farmers in begging and pleading with the Department to come out to look at the farms before passing this legislation and the calculation around the demolition.</p> <p>One of our amendments called for an environmental impact assessment because we do not know whether there is asbestos on site.  There are concerns among the farmers that there would be low-balling in terms of the compensation for the demolition.  Will the Minister outline why the five years happens to correspond with the five loss-making years?  If one's compensation is based on that and one is making a loss, one's compensation will not amount to very much.  Is it true that the Department initially suggested using Google Maps to calculate the demolition costs?  Three farms is all we are talking about.  Why could the Department not visit all three to get a proper gauge of the demolition costs?</p></speech>

He did not go quite far enough but I appreciate he is working with other Ministers and I respect that.  Other Members have made some points.  Before I make my own, I am conscious this is not a judicial appointments Bill.  We could go on talking about this for the coming months, as we have done in the past.  I do not think anyone wants to do that.  We have considerable business to cover tonight, clearly, on the basis we are making progress.  We will not complete it tonight.  That is a certainty at this point.  That is unfortunate.</p> <p>There is a considerable amount to get through.  I would like to get past this section.  Why not have the best five years of the ten-year cycle?  There were good years and bad years.  The Minister of State knows there are good years and bad years in farming.  There are seasonal and breeding conditions.  A considerable number of external conditions impact on income.</p> <p>If something is important, one can say it time and again to drive the message home.  I do not have a difficulty saying that.  These people today are doing something that is totally within the law.  These people have licences to operate.  They are fully compliant in terms of all the regulatory and Revenue requirements.  They operate within the law.  A very important point to make is that these are law-abiding entrepreneurs.  They are in this sector but it could be any sector.  Sometimes, we lose sight of that.  These people are not operating in some sort of covert way.  They are decent, proper, professional people.  Whether I like their trade or not, is not a matter that should come into the issue.  We know they are looking for fair play.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State might indicate whether the draft regulations have even been drafted.  I presume clever people in the Department are working on them because this is important.  I accept we are not negotiating a final settlement on the floor of the Seanad but people spoke earlier about trust and confidence in the process.  It is about leverage.  That is all they have.  They have the leverage of this House.  Ultimately, we will be called upon.  We will be voting on this.  We will have an opportunity to stand up and be counted in respect of our commitments to these farmers, just transition and our commitment to rural communities and rural enterprise.  That is a certainty too.  I am trying to put myself in the boots of these farmers, so to speak.  How can they go away tonight having absolute confidence they will get a fair crack of the whip that acknowledges their investment, their future and that of their families and employees?  I ask for even greater flexibility to be afforded in terms of the years that would be used in the cycle to calculate decent and fair compensation for them.</p></speech>

Senator Gavan asked a couple of specific questions.  I go back to his earlier statement that he is not asking to negotiate in this room.  I will not negotiate in this room; I do not have the mandate to do that.  I will bring the points raised in this forum back to the Minister.  I accept the points made about trust, communication, frustration and concern that have been well articulated by Senators.</p> <p>A point raised by a number of Members, including Senators Burke, Boylan and Lombard, is the profitability assessment.  Whether we are talking about three, five or ten years, this is about a process to determine the value of the company.  Whatever year or time period is chosen, in terms of valuing a company, a three-year cycle would normally take away that element of a particular year being good or bad.  To my mind, three years would be the norm.  We are talking about five years.  If the farmers involved want to make the case for ten years and argue that, given the cyclical nature of the business, there is a cycle and pattern every ten years, they can bring forward the evidence to prove that, we will look at it and that will feed into part of the process.  I give a commitment in this Chamber that if a strong case can be made for why a ten-year cycle is suitable for this business, and not just in respect of profitability, price of pelts and different countries, and a pattern can be shown, it will be looked at and that evidence will be fed in.</p> <p>This is probably part of the problem when looking at primary legislation that deals with specifics.  We can get into a level of granular detail that is not the ideal way to use primary legislation.  Getting into that level of detail is effectively negotiating on the floor of this House.  I respect everyone's bona fides and understand why they are making these points.  At the back of this, there is that concern about leverage.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke about the point of the regulations.  There is a first draft of the regulations.  I understand farmers have been supplied with them.  Ultimately, there will be no regulations without the legislation.  The legislation must be passed.  Any drafts of regulations are just that - drafts - until such time as we have legislation passed so that we can work on that final detail.</p> <p>Senator Burke asked about the independent assessor.  The assessor will be appointed as part of the regulations to work through some of those finer details.  Regarding the case the Senator mentioned, Department officials have visited all three farms.  There are maps, and mapping systems are used as part of an ongoing process.  Our inspectors have been visiting these farms and there is knowledge of them going back years.  My understanding is all of the farms have been visited.</p> <p>Regarding asbestos, again, we are getting into a level of detail.  Obviously, when determining costs for demolition or repurposing, the state of those buildings or what they are made from would be a part of that.</p></speech>

I certainly did not know it.  He confirmed to the House that draft regulations were prepared and said his understanding is farmers were supplied with them.  Will he confirm that?  Would it be possible for Senators to see those regulations between now and the next consideration of this Bill?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-22a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032200002#XX00400"><p>I am not saying the Minister of State is not correct but he is saying Department officials visited all the farms, but it was not about fur farming.  In terms of inspections around fur farming, has anybody visited all three farms regarding demolition costs?  My understanding is the Grant Thornton report, which cost &euro;100,000, was a desk-based exercise from Dublin that did not involve anybody from Grant Thornton visiting any of the farms.  The Department then recommended Google Maps and only one farm was visited in terms of demolition costs.  I do not doubt Department officials have visited these farms for years to inspect whether they are within the letter of the law, but were all three inspected in terms of demolition costs?</p></speech>

In the majority of those cases, a company that knows it is going to be sold or taken over in the next two or three years takes measures to increase its sales or do something to make itself more profitable.  However, those people did not have that timeframe.  This came as a bolt out of the blue to them.  The Minister of State is not comparing like with like when he says the compensation period should be three to five years and anything outside of that has never been heard of.  In many cases, companies have a period in which they can boost their sales or profitability but that period is not afforded to those people at all.</p></speech>

I was responding to his question about where the three to five year period came from.  That is the general principle.  It is about identifying the profitability of the company.  To use ten years, it would need to be proven that the business had a cyclical nature.  It is about trying to get away from one set year that might have been a bad year.  Three years would normally give a fairly good mix of good, bad or medium years.  Five years is a bigger spread and is the time period proposed by the Department, but if there is an example to say the nature of this business very clearly involves a ten-year cycle, where it has shown itself to be fairly stable despite ups and downs over the course of those ten years, evidence of this should be put forward and it will be looked at.  I do not think anybody in this Chamber is trying to discount that, but if a case is to be made for ten years, which would not be the norm because it would be a very long period of time to use to assess the profitability of a company, it would need to be proven why that industry requires that.</p> <p>In response to Senator Boyhan, it goes back to the point about drafts.  I understand the farmers were furnished with them.  The draft regulations are not regulations until legislation is passed.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I had to take an urgent family call.  I was not here when he responded.  It is for that reason I need to ask the question again.  He may very well have answered it.  The clarity I am seeking is in respect of his confirming that there will be an enhanced redundancy package for the workers and that it will be based on additional weeks' pay per year of service.  To explain that, statutory redundancy, as the Minister of State will know, is two weeks' pay per year of service.  I would expect the package we are discussing to be based on additional weeks' pay per year of service.  If that principle could be established, it would be helpful.  I apologise again for having to step out.</p></speech>

I understand that process.  The Minister of State has confirmed to the House the position on the draft regulations.  Of course, they will always evolve and move.  I accept that.  The Minister of State has confirmed that the draft regulations were sent to the farmers.  The continuation of that question is whether the Minister of State can make available tomorrow a copy of those draft regulations.  That would give us some comfort in the direction in which the Department may be going.  I would like to look at them in the context of my ongoing review of this legislation and further amendments that may be due or coming the Minister of State's or the Department's way.  It would therefore be very helpful if the Minister of State could confirm this evening that he will make those draft regulations available to us tomorrow.</p></speech>

The point I made when the Senator stepped out was that I had written out three specific sentences he wants me to put on the record of the House.  However, I brought the debate back to the Senator's initial contribution, in which he said he was not asking anyone in this room to negotiate.  The level of detail he is talking about, to my mind, constitutes negotiating.  I will not get into that level of negotiating here tonight.  I do not believe that is what primary legislation is about.</p> <p>I will raise with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, the points Senator Boyhan raised about his desire to see the draft legislation.  This is not my side of the Department and it is not in my gift to talk about that here, but I will bring that point back to the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-22a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032200002#YY00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and his understanding that I had to step out.  I am disappointed, however, because I am making a clear distinction.  I am not asking the Minister of State to negotiate here in the Chamber; I am asking him to agree principles of negotiation.  A long-established principle of negotiation in industrial relations is that the allocation of an enhanced redundancy package is agreed based on years of service.  For example, some years ago I negotiated a package for a group of workers that guaranteed them six weeks' pay per year of service.  The statutory entitlement, as the Minister of State will know, is two weeks' pay.  Another package in which I was involved guaranteed nine weeks' pay per year of service.</p> <p>The point is that the principle is of an enhanced package based on years of service.  Let us be clear: I am not asking the Minister of State to negotiate what that package will be; I am simply asking him to be explicit about the principle of how he would go about negotiating that package.  The difficulty we have here is clear and it comes back to Senator Boylan's and Senator Lombard's point about what a just transition means.  If we cannot establish decent principles as to what a just transition means for when other jobs are lost, which we all acknowledge will happen in rural Ireland, then we will have done a huge disservice to rural Ireland and the communities living there.</p> <p>I do not see why the Minister of State cannot simply acknowledge that the good principles that have been in existence in industrial relations for many decades will be applied in this case and that an enhanced redundancy package will be negotiated based on additional weeks' pay per year of service.  I am not asking the Minister of State to negotiate what the number of additional weeks will be; I am asking him to accept the principle.  If it is good enough for the private sector, which it has been for decades, surely to God it should be good enough for this Government, which is closing this industry down.</p></speech>

I understand where the Minister of State is coming from.  I know he is not coming new to this, but this is his first time debating this legislation in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I fully understand and respect that.</p> <p>We talked earlier about trust and communication.  I am a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are Senators.  I have made a very simple request.  The Minister of State has confirmed to the House that the draft regulations are in operation and have been prepared.  I accept that they are evolving and moving and are fluid.  By their very nature they have to be.  I understand that.  They are in draft form.  I understand that.  They cannot be finalised until the legislation is finalised.  I understand that.</p> <p>However, the Minister of State has also confirmed that these draft regulations will be circulated to the farmers, whom we are representing, who are in the Public Gallery and whom we are talking about and supporting.  To bridge that communication and that trust, I am simply asking the Minister of State, his official here or somebody else to say there is absolutely no problem with this.  There should be no problem with looking at the draft regulations.  It would give us some comfort and understanding in the direction in which the Department may be going.</p> <p>I do not want to tie the Minister of State's hands in respect of the regulations.  I fully respect that.  He says he will go back to the Minister and relay our concerns to him.  I understand and appreciate that Deputy McConalogue is an exceptionally busy Minister and that there are an awful lot of other demands on everyone in the Department.  All I am asking is for somebody to give an undertaking or to give someone else an instruction to send a copy of the regulations, albeit in draft form, to us tomorrow in order to give us a greater understanding in our preparatory work.  We will be back in here on Thursday and, by the likes of it, all next week and possibly the week after.  The more we can get co-operation on all sides, including me, work this through and have greater understanding, the better in order that we can wrap this thing up as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I know it is the Minister of State's first time debating this legislation in this House.  When it comes to trust and communication, however, the deadline for Report Stage amendments was today at 11.30 a.m.  That is the indication the Department is giving in respect of listening to the Members of this House and what will be accepted and not accepted tonight.  That does not build trust and is not very respectful of this House, but it is not the first time we have seen that happen.  That is not the Minister of State's fault; it is just the experience of the Opposition under this Government.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan talks about getting a look at the draft regulations.  That would be easier.  Yes, they are in draft form and are evolving.  Given, however, that it is very unlikely the Minister of State will accept amendments because, as I said, the deadline for Report Stage amendments was 11.30 a.m. this morning, I think he can share the draft regulations with us.  It is unlikely the legislation will change and, therefore, it is unlikely the regulations will change very much.  It seems that people are set in their minds as to how this is going to go.</p> <p>If the Minister of State were to share the draft regulations, I think it would go a long way towards building trust across the House and everybody who has concerns for the workers and concerns about the precedent of ensuring that a just transition is not just a sound bite but actually a process with principles.  It would be really helpful if the Minister of State could give that commitment on the draft regulations tonight.</p></speech>

His interpretation of negotiation and mine are somewhat different.  He does not think what he says involves negotiation; I think it does.  I have made my view on that clear enough.  We can keep talking about it but I will not get into that level of detail here tonight.</p> <p>As for the draft regulations, I have committed to bringing to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, the Senators' request to see the draft regulations and that he would furnish them.  Senator Boyhan talked about trust.  To my mind, when Senators have talked about that trust it has been largely about the trust of the farmers, and I accept that.  If enough Members of this House are raising these points, that trust is not what it should be.  My understanding, however, is that the farmers have been involved in this process from the start.  The fact that they have been supplied with the draft regulations is an indication of that.  I was given a commitment that they would continue to be part of that process all the way through.  Having the draft of the submissions would lead me to believe that that will continue to be the case into the future.</p></speech>

He has a job to do, as do I.  I will take away one thing.  I am not asking the Minister of State to reply to me.  I have listened to what he has said and he has clearly set out his case.  My takeaway from that is the Minister of State will take this request to the officials and Minister tomorrow, and that is fair enough.  One way or the other, I ask that they let us know the position tomorrow because we now need to prepare our debate and move on.  I know where the Minister of State is coming from, as well as his mandate and the constraints on him.</p> <p>I ask the officials to come back to tomorrow at some stage and indicate the position.  I do not foresee that there will be a difficulty.  There are many ways of getting this information.  If the information has gone to farmers and everyone is discussing it, I do not know why the people writing the legislation do not have that information.  At least the Minister of State will, kindly, take my request away.  All I ask for in return is confirmation one way or the other for Members on the position regarding that request.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-22a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032200002#ZZ00200"><p>I want to come back to the Minister of State on this again because I can understand why people are so worried.  To be clear, I do not think I am splitting hairs.  The difficulty is that, over many years when the State let people go, it established and respected the principle of an enhanced redundancy package.  One example is what has happened regarding the terrible job losses in Shannon Airport in recent years.  That always happened on the basis of an enhanced package.</p> <p>To be clear, if the Minister of State cannot give a commitment that the State will abide by the principle that has been used by the State on numerous occasions, as well as across the private sector, then that leads me to believe the Department does not want to give these people an enhanced redundancy package.  That is how it sounds.  I am not asking the Minister of State to negotiate anything.  Rather, I am asking him to commit to the same principle the State has used on many occasions in terms of an enhanced redundancy package based on weeks per year of service.  There is nothing new here.  It is a well-established principle.  The problem is that if the Minister of State cannot give that commitment to the people affected, regardless of whether he likes it, the message the Department is giving is that people can sing for an enhanced redundancy package.</p> <p>I have dealt with employers who have not given anything above statutory redundancy.  They did exactly what the Department is doing right now.  That is how it works.  I do not want these people to be under any illusion as to what is happening here today.  The Minister of State can change that because he is in charge.  He can simply say he is not negotiating anything here but he accepts the principle of an enhanced redundancy package based on weeks per year of service.  That commits the Minister of State to nothing other than the principle.</p> <p>The other difficulty I have is that when we combine the reluctance of the Minister of State to subscribe to that very simple principle with the continual refusal of the Department to negotiate with these people, is it any wonder they have no faith in the process?  That leads me to my final question.  What is the Minister of State going to do to build confidence for the people in the Gallery today?  With the greatest of respect, he has not done it so far.</p></speech>

Where the planting is done in a 20 m strip, however, there is no upper limit on the area that can be planted under the definition of &quot;native tree area&quot;.  The Bill does not impose an upper limit on the overall area that can be planted in a 20 m strip.  This means major areas could end up being afforested without licence.</p><p>Amendment No. 7 seeks to provide for consistency in that no matter how trees are planted, whether in a plot or strip, the overall area cannot exceed 1 ha.  It is a real concern that, as drafted, these provisions on the strip could be exploited for commercial purposes as there is nothing in the Bill that prevents that and there is no separation distance specified between the strips.  We have heard assurances from the Minister who was here before that planting is not for commercial use, but there is nothing under these provisions to stop the planting of, for example, willow for biomass without the need for a licence.</p><p>As I said, we are seeking assurances that planting will not go over 1 ha just because tree planting is in a strip.  My reading of the Bill is it could end up incentivising the planting of trees in long strips given that situations where a 20 m strip can be planted are not specified.  Significant environmental sensitivities and legal requirements need to be considered in respect of planting by rivers, for example.  Planting can damage riparian edges or destroy nesting holes for birds like kingfishers.  It can destroy or disturb above ground resting places for otters, which are called couches and are heavily protected under the habitats directive.  There are issues around siltation, which can be carried downstream into sensitive areas, including sites that are important for the freshwater pearl mussel, of which Ireland has important populations in a European context.  Consequently, we have conservation and obligations due to the fact we have important populations of pearl mussel.</p><p>Similarly, allowing for the strip without any restriction on how long it can be will allow for planting along roads and motorways, which can have serious impacts on other species that have utilised the open areas by roads in some places, including birds of prey.  Anybody who uses motorways will see birds of prey hunting along them and resting on lighting.  Birds of prey have been used to foraging outside of their natural areas.</p><p>That is the rationale for the amendment, which was submitted by Senator Higgins.  I would like to hear assurances from the Minister of State that the Bill will not incentivise the planting of strips.  We want planting to be restricted to a hectare.  I want to hear what the Minister of State has to say around how to prevent these issues arising.</p></speech>

Having a Bill that is about one thing and then including an important area around forestry at the last minute is not a good way to do business.  The Environmental Pillar has been in touch with all Senators about this.  I do not think anybody is doubting the bona fides of the Minister of State, Deputy Hackett.  However, when we are drafting legislation, are we doing so for whatever Minister can come in and for whatever eventuality arises?</p> <p>The Environmental Pillar has major concerns about unlicensed areas essentially being used for commercial purposes and has stated the Bill does nothing to support native tree planting or prevent foreign seed stock from coming in or both.  In the letter it sent to us, the organisation states the right tree in the right place under the right management can benefit climate, but potentially well-meaning policies such as the forestry provisions can have negative consequences.  It goes on to state that unless there are sufficient controls in place, which is what the amendment seeks to do, ensuring afforestation happens in the right places on the right scale may be difficult.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would ask the Minister if State if he would consider taking into account Senator Higgins's amendments.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-03-22a.216" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022032200002#AAA00200"><p>I thank Senators Boylan and Moynihan for the points they raised regarding amendment No. 7 and, by extension, amendment No. 8.  The definitions outlined in amendments Nos. 7(a) and (b), and amendments Nos. 8(a) and (b) remove the provision to create narrow strips of native trees.  Creating these areas in undisturbed water setbacks can be used to deliver meaningful ecosystem services that protect and enhance water quality and aquatic ecosystems.  The creation of these permanent semi-natural landscape features alongside streams, rivers and lakes will protect and enhance water quality and aquatic habitats into the future.  It is important that this provision is retained in the Bill.</p> <p>Amendment No. 8(c), proposes to insert restrictions on harvesting for commercial purposes.  However, the removal of some trees through thinning is considered good forest practice as it creates more growing space for the remaining trees.  These small areas of native species lend themselves to small-scale harvesting methods.  Landowners will need to apply for a tree felling licence before they undertake any tree felling.</p> <p>These plantings will be permanent in nature and not just for the duration of the scheme.  These areas will be afforded the protection under the Forestry Act 2014.  Therefore, proposed amendment No. 8(d) is not required.</p> <p>The planting of trees from a local native seed stock as detailed in amendment No. 8(e) is a worthy suggestion.  However, experience with the native woodland scheme has shown that there is simply not enough seed supply to ensure the roll-out of a new scheme.  Native tree seeds from different areas can also improve the resilience of forests and allows them to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change.  </p> <p>The composition of tree species to be planted as referred to in amendment No. 8(f) will be fully considered during the strategic environmental assessment, SEA, and appropriate assessment.  In general, the planting of multiple species is good practice.  The exact requirements will be set out in the scheme design and associated qualifying criteria.  </p> <p>Amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 11 propose to limit of the size of the proposed native tree areas that are less than 20 m by introducing the limit on the overall area that can be planted.  Given the potential of these areas to protect and enhance water quality into the future, it is important to be ambitious in this regard.  If a restriction is required, it will be identified during the SEA and appropriate assessment.</p> <p>In relation to amendment No. 12, the maximum percentage of Scots pine to be included stands at 25%.  The amount has been limited to ensure forests dominated by conifer species are not created.  However, it is also important the amount of Scots pine that can be planted is not overly limited as this would remove the potential benefits afforded by the species.  For example, on certain sites, Scots pine will provide shelter, assisting the nearby broadleaf trees to grow and develop.  In advance of the implementation of the scheme, the Department will be undertaking a SEA, which the public will be able to participate in.  Following the completion of the SEA and subject to its findings, my Department will be in a position to finalise a scheme and the associated qualifying criteria.  This may result in the introduction of a level for Scots pine being less than 25%.</p> <p>As to amendment No. 17 which proposes to add five additions to the areas which can be planted, subsections I, II, III and V have already been addressed in amendment No. 8.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, did not accept the amendment.  Subsection IV is new and will now be considered.  The amendment proposes to add text to facilitate the inclusion of conditions with regard to appropriate stocking levels to the species proposed, soil types and characteristics of the location.  These proposed conditions will be considered in the context of the scheme design and specifications.  For these reasons, I am not accepting amendments Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, and amendment No. 17.</p></speech>

In the D&aacute;il, the Minister indicated that this data is already available, or rather that it can be extrapolated from the data that is available.

My Department provides very comprehensive forestry statistics on a weekly basis through the forestry dashboard.  Information is provided on afforestation, eroding and felling.  Monthly statistics are also provided on a broader range of statistics that are available on the Department's website.  At the end of each year, comprehensive statistical information is provided on county basis in the annual forest sector statistics publication.</p> <p>The requirement to provide these statistics is not statutorily based, but has evolved over time to meet the requirements of stakeholders in the forest sector.  This allows for changes to be readily made to the information being sought.  My preferred approach is to retain this current flexible approach to providing statistics.</p> <p>The request tabled in this amendment was recently the subject of a parliamentary question.  My Department confirmed that the level of afforestation per local electoral area and the level of which is broadleaf will be provided by the end of March of this year.

The reason we are doing that is that forestry policy, as has been discussed here at length for the past two years, has failed utterly.  There has been a systemic failure to deliver on targets that have been set and to ensure the forestry policy does exactly what it should do, which is to deliver for the environment, communities and the economy.  The argument is the amendment will call on the Minister to bring any scheme that arises from the legislation to the D&aacute;il for approval so that it has that democratic oversight which has been lacking in the forestry industry to date.</p></speech>

The consultation process will engage with statutory authorities, outside bodies and the public.  Members of the Oireachtas are also free to participate in this process to shape any future scheme.  However, it is important to stress that in section 9(d) of the Bill there is a requirement on the Minister to provide, by regulation, for a scheme to facilitate the planting of native tree areas.  This provides that the legislation to establish a scheme must be consistent with and based on the legislation adopted by the Oireachtas in the primary legislation being considered in this Bill.

Article 15 of the Constitution vests the sole and exclusive power for making legislation in the Oireachtas.  With these provisions the Minister is seeking extraordinary discretion in the making of regulations and will have to ensure they are compliant with a significant body of EU environmental legislation and Ireland's obligations under the Aarhus Convention.  It is no secret that Ireland's track record on regulations complying with EU law and the Aarhus Convention is not good and is a serious concern.  In fact, we were recently called out at a public meeting about our failure to comply with EU legislation when it comes to the environment.  The consequences of those failures can be seen in the catastrophic failure to restore and conserve even our most important species and habitats in our Natura 2000 or European sites.</p> <p>It is both desirable and appropriate that the regulations would be laid before and be agreed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly as those provisions are introduced in this way.  As was said earlier, it is tacking on forestry amendments to an animal health and welfare Bill.  I had animal health and welfare amendments that were ruled out of order, but here we are talking about forestry under animal health and welfare.  The manner in which these provisions were introduced meant that we entirely avoided pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have had limited opportunity to hear properly about them from multiple stakeholders.  The idea was to rush it through, but given the issues regarding mink farming that has not happened today.  However, the provisions the Minister is seeking are an extraordinary discretion.  Amendment No. 27 calling for the regulations to have the oversight of the Oireachtas is not a big request, especially given our track record in environmental compliance.</p></speech>

The amendment does not seek to constrain the Government in designing the scheme but simply asks that when people seek to avail of it, due consideration is given to the existing afforestation in the same manner as other criteria which are already included in the Bill, such as public safety and pest control.  The rationale for this amendment is that we have seen in certain parts of the country, particularly around Leitrim, communities that have been inundated with forestry plantations.  They have walls of conifers and their light and views are blocked.  In addition, with forestry plantations many jobs leave the area because the land has been transferred from agriculture to forestry.  We do not want to add to the burden of those who have been inundated with forestry plantations.  That is the rationale for the amendment.  One only has to go to those parts of the country to see our reason for this.  The existing levels of afforestation should be taken into account in the criteria.</p></speech>

Set-back distances are most critical when a building is surrounded by forests.  In the general afforestation scheme, provisions are made for tree planting adjacent to buildings through the scheme requirements.  For example, our existing requirements in our afforestation scheme state that the set-back distance from dwelling houses and associated buildings is 60 m, or 30 m where written consent of the owner is granted prior to approval, and must be observed.  At a minimum, the requirements of the afforestation scheme will also be applied to any scheme to support the small-scale planting of native trees.  These requirements will be detailed in the terms and conditions of the scheme and it is not necessary to include them in primary legislation.  In addition to set-back distances from domestic dwellings, there may be other conditions we will need to include in the terms and conditions of the scheme to protect environmental features.  These will be included in any new scheme as it is developed.</p> <p>I assure Senators that as part of the design of the scheme, my Department will undertake an SEA in which the public will be able to participate to ensure there is transparency in the decision-making process throughout the SEA process.  Following the completion of the SEA and subject to its findings, the Department will finalise a design of the scheme and associated qualifying criteria.  This may result in the introduction of additional measures with regard to the level of forest cover adjacent to domestic dwellings, including other environmental features.  All necessary best practice with regard to planting adjacent to domestic dwellings will be included in the terms and conditions of any new scheme that is designed.</p></speech>

No. 477 of 2011). </blockquote>(5) Regulations under subsection (1) shall not apply to planting on peat soils where the climate change implications are unclear.&rdquo;,&rdquo;.   </blockquote> <p>This amendment seeks to limit the operation of the unlicensed planting of forestry enabled by these provisions so that it cannot happen on peat soils, where the effects on climate change are complex and often the opposite of what we are trying to achieve in respect of climate change, in the context the Minister establishes with these changes.  They should make reference to the best scientific advice we have available to us from the February 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report on the negative consequences for climate change from poorly considered afforestation and afforestation on peat soils.  We have heard of maladaptation when it comes to planting on peat soils.</p><p>The amendment seeks to address the issue of afforestation on peat soils where the climate change implications are unclear.  The Climate Change Advisory Council advised of its concerns about unintended emissions and warned against planting on peat soils.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While the council said that it was supportive of enhanced afforestation as an offset for emissions in the agricultural land use sector, it highlighted the risks associated with the "poor siting of, mono-species afforestation".  The council stated in its carbon budget technical report: "Afforestation needs to be properly planned to ensure it does not result in unintended emissions or negatively impact biodiversity or water quality and should not, for example, be undertaken on peatlands which would turn a present-day carbon sink into a future carbon source."  We have heard at length, both at the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action and, to a lesser extent, at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, that the best thing that we can do with peatlands is to re-wet them, where possible, and convert them back into carbon sinks.  The afforestation of peatlands is, therefore, not the best use of that land and of addressing our carbon emissions.</p><p>The Environmental Pillar's letter, of 2 March, to Senators on these provisions expressed their extreme concern.  They reflected that the Climate Change Advisory Council's view and advice on the dangers of poorly considered and located afforestation stating: "This is supported by a growing body of international research which highlights that the Government's approach of using overly simplistic targets for land-use change such as the number of trees planted or annual afforestation rates, can be misleading, contributing to policy failure, misuse of carbon offsets and even increase greenhouse gas emissions."  The simplistic target-based approach is exactly what we are trying to mitigate against with this amendment in order that we get the best outcomes and avoid the worst by limiting the planting of unlicensed forestry on peat soils so they that must go through a stricter licensing regime.  Then we can all be sure that the legal assessments necessary are conducted and the public can properly have a say in the environmental decision-making.</p><p>I have explained the rationale behind the amendment.  It is based on the best science and on the advice given by the Climate Change Advisory Council.  It takes on board what the IPCC has said about maladaption and the concerns expressed by the Environmental Pillar.  I hope that the Minister of State will consider accepting this amendment.</p></speech>

I recognise that climate change and other legacy issues have been created by the afforestation of peat soils in the past.  However, we have examples of woodlands, such as birch, naturally occurring on peat soils.  The types of soil to be afforested will be given full consideration during the strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment.</p> <p>The Land Types for Afforestation document sets out the potential eligibility of land for support under the afforestation scheme.  Unsuitable land includes a range of sites that are deemed to be unsuitable for afforestation under the scheme due to site factors.  At a minimum, the requirements of the Land Types for Afforestation document will be also applied to any scheme to support the small scale planting of native tree areas.  For these reasons, I am not accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

The tree is included in the appendices to the Bill.  My only concern is to learn the rationale behind that.  We know that the leaves of the Taxus baccata or common yew are poisonous.  The official briefing produced by Teagasc states: &quot;The leaves are poisonous to most livestock, and the seeds are also toxic to animals and children.&quot;  However, we are now proposing to keep the tree on the index.</p><p>Simply, Taxus baccata is very expensive to grow, and it is difficult to grow, seed and germinate.  I cannot see too many farmers wanting it and I know that many farmers have cut it down.  It is pretty logical that we would not include the yew.  I acknowledge that we do not have that many indigenous native conifers or evergreens and that presents problems.</p><p>I understand what happened with the other three amendments, which were about pines as well.  I had tabled amendments but, unfortunately, I was not in the House.  I am not going to talk about them now but I will when we discuss the section later.</p><p>Finally, I think the yew tree should be excluded.  Its inclusion does not make sense particularly when Teagasc tells us and all the experts, with whom the Minister of State will be familiar, know this too.  Taxus baccata is on the list proposed in this legislation.  Wherever someone looks it up, it will be stated that the leaves of the common yew are poisonous to most livestock and the seeds are also toxic to animals and children, and, therefore, the planting of native trees is going to present difficulties.  It is pretty logical that we should exclude the common yew and I am interested in the Minister of State's response. </p></speech>

There are a small number of naturally occurring yew forests in Ireland, which are a protected habitat type and, therefore, the inclusion of the yew in any scheme will need to be carefully considered to ensure that the integrity of the existing new forests are not compromised.</p> <p>While yew can be poisonous, as the Senator outlined, it is a native species and, if appropriately sited, has value to be included in the scheme.  Individual yew trees are commonly associated with hazel and holly, and are an important woodland type found mainly on shallow limestone soils.  It will not be mandatory for any landowner to plant yew.

I was fortunate to work in Reenadinna wood in Killarney National Park, the only native yew wood in the country.  To be honest, it has not been very well protected by the State.  In fact, as part of the millennium scheme, diggers were brought in across the limestone pavement to put up a fence to keep the deer out, but that undertaking managed to trap the deer inside the woods.Therefore, there has not been very good protection of yew habitats.  Regarding native tree species, my point concerns those that should be added to the list as opposed to those that should come off it and that is the context for amendment No. 31.</p></speech>

These plants flower early and are a good source of food for pollinators, for insects foraging and for those foraging on the berries in the autumn.  They also provide excellent cover and shelter for nesting and roosting.  The idea is to add these species to the list.

It is important, however, to note that since the introduction of agri-environmental schemes in 1994 that the establishment of 6605 km of new hedgerows has been supported by the Department, where hawthorn and blackthorn are the dominant species.

These hawthorns are our trees.  They are listed in The Hillier Manual of Trees and Shrubs.  These are not shrubs.  I do not know what anybody who comes in and tells the Minister of State that hawthorns are shrubs is doing or where he or she is coming from.  If that is the sort of advice that the Minister of State is getting, then I am now really concerned.  These are trees.  I studied horticulture.  I have planted these species and I have planted them in my garden.  I do not understand this description.  These species are recommended and they are rich in biodiversity in respect of the berries, the seeds and the flowers.  Equally, they are also hard to impregnate and to get into, so they act to protect bird life in them.  That is one of the great things about them.  Additionally, they will grow anywhere.  If anything, I could understand if it had been a case of the Minister coming in and saying we have too many of these species and that they are all over the place.

I am not going to rehash the amendment, but I would be interested in the Minister of State putting on the record his view, or that of the departmental officials, in respect of that percentage not being reduced.  I had suggested we reduce it.  This is just a commentary now, but I made that suggestion because of what we know about Scots pine.  My colleague, Senator Boylan, is correct when she talked about the indigenous pine species found in the Burren.  In fairness to the school of botany in Trinity College, it did a great deal of work on this and has written a paper on it.  A disease, dothistroma, or needle blight, is now threatening pines.  It is caused by a fungal pathogen.  This is not me making stuff up.  This is according to Teagasc and people in the National Botanic Gardens and in the school of botany in Trinity College.  The symptoms appear as red bands on needles that are affected, and this leads to premature needle death.</p><p>This is now a common issue for pines, yet we are now going to say that it is permissible for people to plant up to 25% of these trees.  I think we need to be cautious.  We had experience of Dutch elm disease years ago.  I am concerned when such a large percentage of planting is concentrated on one species.  I am not against pines of any description, but I am conscious that we now have ash dieback and we are seeing the real devastation that is causing around the country.  When there is heavy investment in one species, especially in small plantations, I think we should tread softly.  I am not expecting the Minister of State to change anything in this legislation here today, but I would like the Department to be mindful that this fungal pathogen is now presenting us with a serious threat concerning our pine species.  We are getting reports about it every day.  There are EU passports, etc., that cover health in this area.  This is something, however, that we should be concerned about and that is why I urge caution regarding this percentage of pine being planted in these mixed plantings.  This is something we can be conscious of and, as the Minister of State said, these are ongoing issues and ones we must be seriously careful about.  </p></speech>

Many of the issues raised are important and the Minister of State and the Department recognise that and the answers have demonstrated it.  Fundamentally, this section is about ensuring that we have a scheme to provide incentives for farmers and other landowners to plant small areas of native woodland.  That is the point that we want to get to and it is fair to say we are passionate about this.  I have spoken to the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, about this matter many times and her passion for this shines through.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many of the issues raised are important, such as whether one plants on peaty soil.  The Minister of State has outlined where birch has been found to contribute to biodiversity in certain circumstances.  Another important issue concerns the presence of otters, as raised by Deputy Boylan.  That is why SEA and appropriate assessment of the scheme is the most appropriate thing that could happen.</p><p>The Minister of State has given a commitment.  Three Ministers have given commitments in this Chamber around full consultation.  I hope that means what the Minister of State says it means and that there will be consultation on it.  We will ensure that happens.  Regulations are an important part of the legislative process and of making sure schemes work on the ground.  Not everything can or should be put into primary legislation.  However, it is fair that we have an opportunity to put on the record through this process what we want to see in the regulations and that has been done.  </p><p>I will come back on Report Stage.  I thank everybody for their engagement on it, including those engaging from the public.  I hope that continues through the consultation process.</p></speech>

On Senator Boylan's point, Scots pine is still a recommended species in our afforestation scheme but monitoring of that disease is ongoing.  The Senator highlighted the damage the likes of Dutch elm disease have done before.  We are acutely aware of the challenges in those areas and are keeping a close eye on them.</p></speech>

Is that correct?  It is not just the likes of birch, which self-seed and are pioneers.  It could be any of the listed trees.</p></speech>

It is generally scrub.  My understanding is that we are exempting the planting of any trees on the native tree species list.  Is that correct?  That is where our concern is.  It is not what would happen in terms of natural rewilding or building up of scrub but the deliberate planting of any trees on that list on peatland.</p> <p>The Minister of State's assurance was that birch grows on peatland but it is a pioneer species so it generally comes in, self-seeds and forms scrub.  We are trying to protect against the deliberate planting of trees listed as native tree species on peatland.  It is not restricted to birch.</p></speech>

It is about the land types for afforestation.  Documents set out the potential eligibility of land for support under the scheme.  The response refers more to the suitability of the land in terms of individual species.  The reference to birch was as an example that naturally occurs on peat.  I am not sure beyond that.  I will ask for clarification for the Minister on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Concerning section 9, when a person applies for planning permission for forestry, would it be possible for everything to be dealt with, including the planning application, the sowing of trees, the road work and the harvesting, in one application?  It is cumbersome for somebody who makes a planning application for afforestation to have to go through a lot of licences.  This should be done in one pass involving planning permissions, the licence to construct the roads, the licence to fell trees and so forth.  That should be streamlined into one pass.</p></speech>

On section 8, it is an amendment to Schedule 3 of the Act of 2013.

The legislation will prohibit fur farming and makes provision for a fair and reasonable scheme of compensation that my Department will make available to the three farm businesses affected by the prohibition which currently operate legitimately.  The forestry provisions introduce a limited exemption from a licence around small-scale tree planting which takes place as part of a scheme.  This can contribute to Ireland's targets in relation to a wide range of climate priorities, particularly climate change, biodiversity and water quality.  It will re-engage landowners with afforestation and enhance our ability to achieve the commitments set out in the programme for Government and the climate action plan.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Martin Heydon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2286"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2286&amp;amp;pid=MartinHeydon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank Senators for their engagement, and not just this evening.
