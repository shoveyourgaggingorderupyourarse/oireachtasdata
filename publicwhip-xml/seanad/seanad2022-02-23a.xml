He is very kind.  It is a great honour to have my family here today.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, here today to speak on EU plans to support the people of Ukraine and the measures to be put in place to mitigate against the potential impact of sanctions in respect of energy and grain costs.  This is potentially the most devastating European conflict since the Second World War.  There are over 41 million people in Ukraine, which is the second largest country on the European continent after Russia.  It has been an independent country since the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, has valuable access to the Black Sea and is bordered by seven countries, namely, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Moldova.  We see Russia sending in so-called peacekeepers to a sovereign country and declaring the provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent.  As the Minister has stated, Ireland's support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders and its right to choose its own foreign and security policy path is unwavering. </p> <p>In terms of diplomacy and the outright aggression we see now by Russia, will the Minister update the House as to how the EU plans to support the safety of the Ukrainian people?  Presidents of the European Commission and the European Council say that this is illegal and unacceptable and that it violates international law and Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  What can be done for financial assistance?</p> <p>At a trade level, only recently the BBC pointed to how Russia has been setting up large foreign exchange reserves, up to $630 billion, to sanction-proof its economy since the imposition of sanctions in 2014 over Crimea.  In this regard, Russia supplies a huge amount, nearly 40 to 50%, of gas to Europe.  In recent sanctions, Germany has suspended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.  Even in the last couple of days, the price of a barrel of oil have increased massively and is now close to $100 a barrel.  Russia and Ukraine account for nearly one third of the world's grain.  Their wheat exports are incredible.  The impact this will have on food prices is considerable.  In terms of the export of grain and of wheat production, Russia has surpassed itself.  In 2000 it produced approximately 30 million tonnes of grain annually and exported only 696,000 tonnes.  In 2010, it doubled that production to 60 million tonnes and exported 18 million tonnes.  In 2020 it produced a record 85 million tonnes and exported 35 million tonnes.  It plays a huge part in global food markets.  Ukraine exports 24 million tonnes.  Together, they account for more than one third of the world market.  Given the presence of so many Russian troops surrounding Ukraine, the incursion into Donetsk and Luhansk and the potential for a full-scale invasion, will the Minister give an update from an Irish perspective on his recent meeting in Brussels and the plans for these potential economic impacts?  I acknowledge the incredible work by his Department and the strong support from Senator Seery Kearney for Irish families involved in surrogacy at the moment.  How do we as a small nation with a strong voice and a seat on the UN Security Council support democracy? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#B00100"><p>I welcome this opportunity.  I also welcome Senator Dolan's family to the Seanad Chamber today.  They should be very proud of their sister and daughter in the context of the role she continues to play in this House.</p> <p>At the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, we decided to provide &euro;1.2 billion in macro-financial assistance to Ukraine.  We hope this package will assist the Government and people of Ukraine in addressing some of the difficulties the Russian military build-up in and around their country, which has been destabilising their economy and society, is causing.  The European Union is one of the largest humanitarian donors to eastern Ukraine.  Since 2014, the EU and its member states have contributed over &euro;1 billion in humanitarian and early recovery aid to support the needs of people in the areas directly affected by the conflict and those who have fled conflict areas.  Many people do not realise it, but there has been an ongoing war in eastern Ukraine which has claimed the lives of about 14,000 people in recent years.  The EU is advancing its contingency planning in the event of increased levels of need in the coming weeks.</p> <p>On 15 February 2022, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine advocated that the EU Civil Protection Mechanism requesting in-kind assistance, including medical and shelter supplies and communications equipment, be triggered.  Ireland is among a number of EU member states that responded to this request with an offer of medical supplies.</p> <p>Russia's decision in the past two days regarding the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts is totally unacceptable.  The decision is illegal and violates Ukraine's territorial integrity and sovereignty.  It also breaches the UN Charter.  In order to uphold international law, the EU must react in a firm and proportionate manner in co-ordination with its partners.  Ireland has therefore expressed strong support for EU sanctions.</p> <p>The package of sanctions under discussion by EU foreign ministers targets those responsible for these decisions as well as those involved in the defence sector and in disinformation.  Financial measures target the banks financing Russian decision makers and cut off access to the EU's capital and financial markets for the Central Bank of Russia.  Economic relations between the breakaway parts of Donetsk and Luhansk and the EU will also be targeted.  These measures are proportionate and absolutely necessary.  Additional measures will be taken if the situation escalates further.</p> <p>The impact of sanctions on energy and food prices remains to be seen, particularly in light of any additional sanctions that the EU may impose or retaliatory measures by Russia, which undoubtedly will happen.  We know that sanctions will not be cost-free for Ireland or other EU member states, but we are left with little choice given Russia's behaviour.  There is absolutely no way the European Union, along with the United States, the United Kingdom and many others, can stand idly by and watch a country with the power of Russia simply ignore the sovereignty of its neighbouring state and construct a basis for sending in so-called peacekeepers who are arriving in tanks and attack helicopters.  These are not peacekeepers.  This is essentially about, as the US President has described, carving out part of Ukraine and Russia taking it by force.  Unfortunately, in the two regions we are talking about, separatists will now be supported by the Russian military, not only to secure the area they already control but, because they only control about one third of those two regions, we are looking now at the potential of very serious conflict between Russia and Ukraine in relation to the remaining areas of those two regions that are currently controlled by Ukraine.  This is an escalating and very worrying situation.</p> <p>Ireland&rsquo;s role in this matter must be to support EU collective action and also insist constantly on a diplomatic intervention.  Ultimately, we are trying to prevent war, not plan for how we would respond to war when it takes place.  The priority must be to prevent it in the first place.  That is why intensive diplomatic engagement must also be part of this strategy, as well as deterrent through increased sanctions.</p></speech>

I welcome the acknowledgement of funding of over &euro;1.2 billion in macro-financial assistance to Ukraine.  Cyberdefence is also crucial because there is serious destabilisation taking place in Ukraine at the moment.</p> <p>It is crucial that we realise that the sanctions have to be effective.  They have to change the course of action.  As the Minister said, it is about ensuring that we have peace in Ukraine and that we are all working towards that goal.  However, in the face of this outright aggression, we have to ensure those sanctions have an immediate impact on the Russian economy and trade.  This, along with the EU targeting of banks and so on, which the Minister mentioned, is probably how we will go forward.  We are in the eye of the storm.  I appreciate all the work the Minister is doing, both with EU foreign ministers and at the UN.  I thank him.</p></speech>

In many ways, that view is directly supported by the UN Secretary General, who has been very clear that the UN sees what is happening as a complete breach of international law and the UN Charter.  Russia has to bear the responsibility for that.  There is no justification for this in the context of Russia&rsquo;s security concerns and so on.  The EU has made it very clear that it is, of course, willing to enter into dialogue with Russia on security matters more generally across Europe.  That offer is still there.  However, Russia effectively claiming portions of Ukraine, and publicly stating that it no longer recognises Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty, must trigger a response by the international community and that is what is happening now.</p> <p>I thank Senator Dolan for raising this issue in the Seanad.  As the Senator appreciates, it is essential that at this crucial time for European security, the EU stands staunch and unwavering in support of Ukraine&rsquo;s sovereignty.  This means macro-financial assistance, as I outlined.  It also means sanctions on Russia, should they be necessary, and these will increase, if necessary.</p> <p>It is true that there may be some economic cost arising from these sanctions.  Impacts could arise, in particular, from possible Russian counter-sanctions and the likely fall in the value of the rouble, making Irish exports more expensive, and from economic impacts across European trading partners as well.  The Government is preparing appropriate contingency plans to mitigate potential impacts to the Irish economy.  We have had a number of meetings on that across Departments, as sanctions will not be cost-free for Ireland and other EU member states.  However, we are left with little choice, given Russia&rsquo;s behaviour and stated intentions.  The cost of ignoring such behaviour would, in the end, be far greater for everybody.</p> <p>I hope that in the coming days we will find mechanisms that can de-escalate some of the language of the past number of days and some of the actions behind that.  However, there is an increasing sense of pessimism in terms of where this is moving now.  As I said, hopefully that pessimism can be reversed.  For now, the focus has to be on appropriate sanctions, but with preparedness to go much further if we need to, to act as a further deterrent, as well as an intensive approach towards diplomatic intervention.</p></speech>

This is the first time I have addressed him.  I congratulate him on his appointment and offer him continued best wishes.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to discuss this matter of the utmost importance, which will continue to impact more and more women as time goes by.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a wonderful tradition of sport in this country and our sportswomen are going from strength to strength.  From qualifying for this summer's Hockey World Cup, to Leona Maguire's rise through the world ranks and captain Lucy Mulhall leading the team into their first-ever HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series final in Seville, this small country has been put on the map of women's sport internationally.  It is a wonderful example to the girls and young women in the country and is worth protecting.</p><p>However, there is currently a glaring issue with fair competition when it comes women's sport in Ireland.  It stems from the introduction of self-ID legislation in 2015.  Through that legislation, the State declared that being a women is in fact a feeling and that biological reality is not especially relevant when it comes to the business of being a woman.  We are now told that men who say they are women are also women and merely had been born in the wrong body.  The notion of bodies is important for women in many areas but none more than sport and that is what I am here to speak about.  I tell the Minister of State that bodies, not identities, play sport.  The publicly-funded lobby group Transgender Equality Network Ireland, TENI, is campaigning for inclusion in sport.  This is a misnomer.  Men who identify as women already have a category of sport open to them, namely, the male category.  What this lobby group is actually seeking is the erasure of the single-sex female category and its replacement with a mixed-sex one.  This will obliterate fair competition in women's sport and will endanger female athletes in contact sports.  Does the Minister of State recognise the role biological sex plays in women's sport?  What steps will be taken to preserve female sports, given the danger posed by self-ID legislation?</p><p>Irish sportswomen are excelling but the support for that has not always been forthcoming.  It was not that long ago our women's soccer team were forced to change in airport toilets and return their tracksuits to share with other teams.  The spectre of humiliation is never far away.  However, this latest attack on women's sport will have the highest impact of all.  Across the pond, US President Joe Biden dismantled the Title IX provision, allowing for biological males to compete in female sports.  Since then, the sporting world has looked on in disbelief as a man who previously swam in the US elite men's college competition now claims to identify as a woman and has just gone on to win a set of records in three different events.  The same individual will compete against an Irish female Olympian in collegiate competition in the coming months, so we can already see the impact this is having on our sportswomen.  Strikingly, there are no examples of women who identify as men taking podium places or threatening records held by men.  However, there are examples of women who identify as men competing and succeeding on women's teams.  This is entirely appropriate as they are of the same sex.  Men's sport remains untouched by gender ideology.  Across the world, sportsmen and sportswomen are speaking out against the erasure of women's sports.  They include Martina Navratilova, Daley Thompson, Michael Phelps, Sharron Davies and notably, two bio-males who now identify as women, namely, Caitlyn Jenner and Ren&eacute;e Richards.  In light of this, will the Minister of State confirm he supports fair competition and safety for women and girls in their chosen sport?  How does he plan to protect these rights when all single-sex provisions have been dismantled through self-ID?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Keogan for raising this matter.  Equality in sport is a key priority for both myself and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  Our overall vision for women in sport is one where women have an equal opportunity to achieve their full potential while enjoying a lifelong involvement in sport.  A fundamental aim of the Government's National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to increase the levels of participation in sport and physical activity across the population, with a specific focus on less-represented groups including women and girls.  Much work is happening and good progress is being made not just in increasing active participation but also in the important areas of leadership and management roles in sport.</p> <p>The Women in Sport funding programme is a very important support for sporting bodies in putting programmes in place to increase women's participation in their sports and to progress their strategic objectives for women in sport.  The programme has been in place since 2005 and since then, over &euro;20 million has been invested through the national governing bodies of sport and the local sports partnerships around the country.  In 2018, funding under this sport programme was &euro;600,000.  Last year, Sport Ireland announced an investment of &euro;4 million for the two years 2021 and 2022.  This significant increase in funding ensures opportunities continue to be provided for women to participate in sport.  I was pleased to secure increased funding for Sport Ireland in the budget for 2022, bringing its total current expenditure budget to over &euro;96 million compared to &euro;92 million last year.  This will enable Sport Ireland to continue to support governing bodies and local sports partnerships in delivering programmes for all participants, male and female.</p> <p>There is a growing momentum towards better integration of the three governing bodies involved in Gaelic games, namely, the GAA, Ladies Gaelic Football Association and the Camogie Association.  The three organisations are working on a pathway to amalgamation.  I am very supportive of such moves, which reflect much of what is already happening at club level and would further ensure parity of treatment for female players within the Gaelic games family.  One of my priorities last year was to eliminate the funding gap that existed in grant funding for male and female Gaelic players.  I am very pleased to have achieved that aim and to have ensured that we have now parity in that grant funding.  Additional funding has been provided for enhanced support of female intercounty Gaelic players on an equivalent basis to that being provided for their male counterparts, thus bringing the total amount available for female players in this context to &euro;2.4 million.</p> <p>The aim in the National Sports Policy 2018-2027 is to eliminate the gender participation gap in sport entirely by 2027.  The 2019 Irish Sports Monitor report showed that the gender gap in sports participation was 3.4%, which is narrower than at any point over the past ten years.  While the Irish Sports Monitor report for the first quarter of 2021 showed the gender gap was eliminated during the Covid-19 restrictions, the latest Irish Sports Monitor figures for quarter 3 show a gender gap beginning to re-emerge as restrictions were lifted.  In quarter 3, male sports participation had returned to pre-pandemic levels at 48%, while female sports participation was at 38%, which is 7% behind the level measured in 2019.  The emerging gradient is a cause for focus and ongoing monitoring.  To this end, many national governing bodies are delivering women in sport and programmes funded by the Dormant Accounts Fund this winter.  These actively target populations that have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic including females, economically and socially disadvantaged communities, people with a disability and ethnic minorities.</p> <p>Addressing women's participation at all levels in sport is an important element of the national sports policy.  That includes women in leadership positions such as governing bodies.  The national sports policy set a target of 30% gender representation on boards by the end of 2023, which we have increased in our action plan for sport to 40%.  It is a particular priority for me to enable women to take more leadership positions in sport and the 40% reflects this prioritisation.  I will conclude my statement when I come back in.</p></speech>

Certainly, what he has outlined and indeed done himself with regard to funding women's sport and its organisations has been very impressive.  However, the question I have is that when we speak about women, we need a definition of that category and we need to protect that category of women within sport.  I understand that last year, a freedom of information request went into Sport Ireland asking about this and it stated it had not even discussed self-identifying males competing against females.  This is about safeguarding and protecting women's sport.  We owe it to the females who compete competitively and who have put years and years of their lives into training in their sports to protect that and ensure this is fair and competitive to them.  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on this issue and ensure the provision of this level and equal playing field, which will remain as a safe space for females going forward.  Maybe he can address that issue.</p></speech>

The last year has, as we know, been dominated by amazing moments for women's sport and our sportswomen very deservedly received many plaudits in the recent months.  The Senator's own of County Meath has had tremendous success in Croke Park.  It was one of the best games, despite my county being on the losing side of it.  Sportswomen like Rachel Blackmore, Leona Maguire, Kelly Harrington, Fionnuala McCormack, Amy Hunter and Emma Slevin, along with female players in many teams across all codes provided great sporting moments for us all.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jack Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2429"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2429&amp;amp;pid=JackChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All of these moments are inspiring the next generation of women and girls to take up sport, get out and get active and be the next generation of sporting heroes who will inspire us in the years and decades ahead.  I acknowledge the work being done by Sport Ireland, the governing bodies and the network of local sports partnerships in developing programmes and contributing to the increase in the number of women and girls taking part in sport.</p><p>I expect 2022 to be another great year for women's sport.  From a policy perspective, I will do everything to ensure our sportswomen are supported across the board.  I am sure that if the Senator has direct questions for Sport Ireland, it will respond.  I am not privy to the freedom of information request but I am sure the agency will revert to the Senator.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting my Commencement matter on credit unions.  I read with great interest an article on the issue in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  I am sure the Minister of State had some feedback about it, as I did.  People were genuinely encouraged by the article.  The substance of the feedback I received from the credit union movement, including the Irish League of Credit Unions, was that it would like the Minister of State to make the regulatory changes to enable credit unions to significantly increase their footprint in the mortgage market.  We all know about the issues with KBC, Bank of Ireland and AIB.  Indeed, my local AIB branch has closed.  Post offices and banks are closing in communities and there is a desire for the credit union movement to grow and expand.</p><p>I am a member of my local credit union and I fully support the movement.  It is an amazing organisation, rooted in community.  Traditionally, it has been served by volunteers, although it is using from that model to a more professional one and all the staff are paid.  The credit union movement has done a great service to citizens and to people in communities who have sought to take out small loans.  As people have prospered and their wealth has grown, however, they have moved on and the movement is substantially funded and is in a position to increase their contribution to the mortgage market, which the Minister of State has identified.  The movement wants him and the Government to honour the commitment in the programme for Government for credit unions to become key providers of community banking, and it has a good case.  He indicated credit unions would fill the gap left by the departure of Ulster Bank and KBC from the Irish market and start lending more mortgages.  Credit unions are ready, willing and able and have the capacity, funding and professionalism in place to carry out those objectives, so what is the problem?  How can we enable the credit union movement to grow and provide a wide range of community banking with a focus on mortgages?</p><p>I think I am pushing an open door with the Minister of State, who is committed to this.  Clearly, there are issues I might not be aware of, and the new policy framework review that he has mentioned is important.  This presents opportunities for the Government to empower credit unions to realise their full potential, fill the gap left by Ulster Bank and KBC and offer a real alternative in our communities, with a focus on mortgages.  The commitment the Government agreed to in the programme for Government is important and I would like to see a timeline for the introduction and roll-out of that commitment.</p></speech>

He has a long-term interest in credit unions.  He has raised this matter often in the past and will no doubt continue to do so because they have such a key role in Irish society.  I look forward to a longer debate on credit unions taking place in the House on 2 March and I know the Senators present will contribute to that debate.</p> <p>The Government recognises the importance of credit unions and the programme for Government contains commitments to both reviewing the policy framework within which credit unions operate and enabling the credit union movement to grow.  That is precisely what I am doing at the moment and I am almost at the final stages of that process.  If I were to summarise what I want credit unions to do, I want them to grow their lending.  As the Senator pointed out, they have substantial deposits and investments but it is important they increase their lending too because that is how they will become sustainable.  The programme for Government also contains a commitment to supporting credit unions in the expansion of services to encourage community development.</p> <p>I was appointed Minister of State with specific responsibility for credit unions, and I am the first Minister of State ever to have been given that responsibility.  I have carried out extensive stakeholder engagement with a broad range of credit union stakeholders in the past year or so.  A summary of the proposals has been shared with all the credit union representative bodies and the final stakeholder engagement session has been scheduled for early March.  To give some background, over the course of the past year and beyond, departmental officials carried out extensive negotiations and discussions with all the credit union key stakeholders.  I have attended well over 20 meetings with the credit union sector over the past six or eight months.  Towards the end of last year, we were almost at the final stages of getting various proposals from the sector as to what it wanted in the legislation and there was substantial agreement on that.</p> <p>Even so, I gave a commitment that, before I finalised it and brought the decision to the Government, I would return for one final session to sign off with all the representative bodies.  I have issued that document to them and they received it over the weekend.  There will be a session in early March with all the representative bodies, chaired by me, and I hope that we will thereafter get full sign-off, before it then goes to the Government to lead to legislation.  Any legislative proposals arising will go to Cabinet shortly thereafter.  The proposals being considered should assist credit unions to invest in collaborative ventures that could be used to expand their mortgage offering.</p> <p>It is worth noting that, as it stands, credit unions can and do provide mortgages.  Fourteen of the 213 credit unions engage in mortgage-lending at various levels.  As at the end of September last, credit unions had a mortgage book of &euro;260 million, which has grown 26% year on year, although not all credit unions provide mortgages.  Twenty of the credit unions account for 76% of all new house loans advanced, while 50 credit unions account for 98% of all new house loans advanced.  Following the review of the lending framework, the Central Bank introduced new lending regulations in January 2020.  At a combined mortgage and SME lending rate of 7.5% of assets, this provides capacity to provide up to approximately &euro;1.1 billion of additional mortgage and SME loans, or &euro;1.7 billion in total, and that was finalised only two years ago.  Furthermore, additional lending capacity of up to 15% of asserts is available to credit unions, which can apply within certain conditions to the Central Bank for that.  Four applications have thus far been approved, while one is in the process of being examined.</p></speech>

I thank the Leader and her office for arranging all that.</p> <p>The key question is how we can get credit unions to lend more, and that is important.  There is a mortgage market, but we are seeing the winding-down and withdrawal of banks in communities.  The strongest aspect of credit unions is that they are community based.  They are embedded in our communities.  There is an opportunity now for them to get established, although we will have to see how they perform and can grow.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State suggested that credit unions lend, but not all credit unions are in a position to do so, as he has acknowledged.</p><p>The credit union movement has a role in banking and will assist people in getting mortgages.  I acknowledge the significant role that it plays in SME financing as well as in personal financing for people who have been turned away.  As the Minister of State knows, the great scandal of banking in this country is that people cannot even meet anyone in their banks or get support from banks.  The banks have a short memory.  We as a nation bailed them out, but we cannot even get them to open their doors now.  People certainly cannot get banks to speak to them other than via phone.  I see a role for credit unions in building close financial relationships.  I thank the Minister of State for his support in this matter.</p></speech>

That is well established but I wanted to reiterate it.</p> <p>The regulations developed by the Central Bank, which were updated just two years ago, provide substantial capacity for credit unions, in particular larger ones, to grow their mortgage markets.  In the past year, the Central Bank has approved two groups to provide credit union funding to approved housing bodies, AHBs, for the first time ever.  Every credit union can invest in the fund for AHBs directly.</p> <p>The programme for Government refers to community banking.  The Irish League of Credit Unions issued a letter over the weekend that most Oireachtas Members will have seen.  According to it, the Irish League of Credit Unions was ready and willing to engage with me and my officials constructively on achieving this aim.  That meeting has been scheduled for within the next fortnight.  I look forward to returning to the House in due course with legislation to improve the environment for credit unions.</p></speech>

It is a matter that we all understand and the Minister of State shares my passion for doing all that we can to tackle it.  We are in the midst of an energy crisis.  Families are suffering from energy poverty, as outlined as recently as last week by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  We are also in the midst of a climate crisis, but we have ambitious plans underpinned by the climate action plan and our commitments under COP26.</p> <p>This is a complex issue.  From one perspective, it is about the complexity involved in ensuring the stability of the energy grid across the island of Ireland.  On the other hand, wasting energy is a moral issue.  Hundreds of millions of euro worth of energy are dumped in Ireland instead of being used to tackle energy poverty.  As individuals, we all know that we should not waste electricity or other forms of energy because it will cost us in our pockets and is bad for the environment.  Furthermore, most of us grew up in homes where the consequences of leaving the immersion on were severe.</p> <p>When I first heard of the scale of renewable energy that was being dumped in Ireland, I thought it was immoral, given that hundreds of thousands of families were in energy poverty.  I recognise that there are technical and electricity grid-based challenges that need to be addressed, but if there is political and regulatory will, it can be achieved.</p> <p>This is where EnergyCloud comes in.  It is a not-for-profit organisation with a mission to create solutions and divert to Irish homes surplus renewable energy that would otherwise be wasted, with a primary focus on those households in fuel poverty.  The much-needed electricity costs emergency benefit scheme will credit domestic electricity customers with &euro;200 at a cost of &euro;400 million.  This is a one-off exceptional payment that is designed to tackle the cost of energy.</p> <p>Regarding the renewable energy that is being dumped, I examined the potential retail cost to consumers and what it could cost families in fuel poverty.  According to EirGrid, 1,448 GWh of zero-carbon energy from wind generation was dumped in 2020.  This was equivalent to 11.4% of the total available wind energy.  Based on Electric Ireland's 24-hour standard rate of 21.2 cent per KWh, the 1,448 GWh of dumped energy cost families more than &euro;305 million, excluding VAT.  The Minister of State will agree that this is immoral.  It is likely that the 2021 and 2022 figures will be even higher.  In less than four years, more than &euro;1 billion in energy will have been dumped.</p> <p>Something can be done about this.  Last year, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, launched the first phase of EnergyCloud, which involved a project with Cl&uacute;id Housing.  The goal of this initial phase is to reduce renewable energy wastage and divert energy towards the social good of heating water in fuel-poor homes.  At the launch, the Minister stated that the simplicity of the project's approach was that it could utilise the existing infrastructure in the home, such as hot water tanks, to receive surplus renewable energy at a time when it was not needed on the grid.  The use of existing infrastructure in the home reduces the capital expenditure required for this project and allows organisations like Cl&uacute;id to upgrade their properties quickly in order to avail of surplus renewable energy.</p> <p>Through our local authorities and AHBs, the State can play a leading role in helping to use surplus renewable energy while tackling energy poverty and ensuring that there is no waste.</p></speech>

I will address her specific questions in my supplementary response but give her my written answer first.</p> <p>Given the unprecedented rise in electricity and gas prices, reducing the burden of fuel poverty is a matter of serious concern for the Government.  A suite of measures is being developed and deployed by the Government to help reduce the impact of fuel poverty in the short and long terms.  The Government is concerned that recent electricity and gas price increases caused by international conditions are putting increasing pressure on consumers, particularly those in a more vulnerable economic condition.</p> <p>It is important to recognise that these price increases are not caused by governmental or regulatory decisions, as price regulation in this sector ended many years ago.  Suppliers compete with one another on price and set their own prices accordingly, as one would expect in a competitive commercial market.  It is also important to point out that all European markets are experiencing these price increases.  While Ireland has its own specific circumstances, the rise in energy costs is not unique to us.  The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the upward trend in international gas prices, which has brought them to an unprecedented high.  In Europe, wholesale natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2020 for a variety of international reasons.  Current indications are that these higher prices will continue at a significantly greater level than in early 2020 for the foreseeable future.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices because the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the international price of gas, given that gas is a primary fossil fuel used in the generation of electricity.</p> <p>As well as the package of measures that the Government recently introduced to combat the increases in the cost of living, I am convinced that the roll-out of renewable energy will, in the long term, reduce Ireland's susceptibility to spikes in international fuel prices.  The Government is committed to ensuring that, by 2030, up to 80% of our electricity will come from renewable resources.  This renewable energy will help to protect us from fluctuations in gas prices caused by global supply and trade issues.  In this way, we will increase our energy security.</p> <p>The first renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auction for onshore wind and solar projects was held in 2020, with 63 projects progressing currently.  The next auction process has begun, with the auction scheduled to take place in May.  It will deliver a major increase in renewable electricity generation by the end of 2024.  A third RESS onshore auction is under development.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is finalising the terms and conditions of the first of three planned offshore renewable energy auctions this decade to deliver 5 GW of offshore wind energy by 2030.</p> <p>The Government is tackling the impact on households of increasing energy costs through the tax and social welfare system.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This was set out in the budget in 2022.  The fuel allowance is one of a range of income supports paid by the Department of Social Protection, which also includes general social welfare schemes and the living alone payment increases to support those living alone and at a higher risk of poverty, along with the household benefits package.  Targeted supports are also provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs, for example, in the case of people with ill health.</p><p>Over the long term, the Government's energy efficiency and renewable energy measures are key.  Government policy is driving investment in energy efficiency, investment in renewables, enhancing electricity interconnection and deepening the internal energy market.  I will take energy efficiency as an example.  Energy efficiency measures are not just essential to reduce emissions from our housing sector; they are also central to addressing the root causes of energy poverty and to improving health and social inclusion outcomes while at the same time contributing to decarbonisation.</p><p>Separately, grants for cavity wall and attic insulation will more than triple as part of the Government's response to the current exceptionally high energy prices.  For example, in the case of a semi-detached home, the attic insulation grant is going to increase from &euro;400 to &euro;1,300.  The cavity wall insulation grant will increase from &euro;400 to &euro;1,200.  These are highly cost-effective upgrades.  They are measures that can be deployed rapidly and at scale this year and it is expected that these works will pay back in between one and two years in most houses.  The new grant rates will cover approximately 80% of the typical cost of these measures and will be available to all homeowners.</p><p>Using surplus renewable energy on the grid is another measure that could also potentially help alleviate fuel poverty and help our carbon emissions.  One innovative technological solution that is currently being trialled is a solution between EnergyCloud and Cl&uacute;id Housing, our largest approved housing body.  The current project will initially see 50 families benefit.  However, it is clear from Cl&uacute;id and EnergyCloud that they have an ambitious target to support families in each of more than 8,300 Cl&uacute;id properties throughout Ireland.  This technology uses existing infrastructure in the home, such as a hot-water fuel tank, to receive surplus renewable energy at times when it is not needed on the energy grid.  I welcome the trial and hope to see it become widespread in the coming years as just one in our suite of measures to help alleviate fuel poverty.</p></speech>

However, as I mentioned, &euro;305 million worth of retail value is being dumped annually.  The redeployment of renewable energy to heat hot water in homes could also displace significant volumes of CO2 and avoid millions of euro in carbon penalties to Ireland.  Crucially, that can be done now as that technology is in place.  We just need the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to work with the State to make it happen.  As the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has stated, we already have those domestic hot-water tanks in our homes.  EirGrid announced that the all-Ireland wind power record was set earlier this month and as someone who was out running cross-country at the weekend, I can attest that it was quite breezy and those wind speeds were considerable.</p> <p>We are not being told the value of what is being dumped.  While all the people are having to make stark choices about their own homes, the State is sleeping on this dumping.  There is an opportunity to engage with EnergyCloud to explore the solutions available, to use this energy in social housing homes and to reduce the impact of fuel poverty.  The Government needs to sit down with all the participants in this process and decide if we should continue to dump 100% renewable energy that could be used to address fuel poverty.  Where there is a will, there is always a way.</p></speech>

The electricity system is changing because of this big transition to renewable energy.  One of the things that is changing is that we sometimes suddenly find ourselves in great surplus and in great deficit at other times because of the weather.  Although the weather is predictable, the pattern in which our electricity is generated is different from the way it was in the past, when a power station could be turned on and off more easily.  Sometimes we are in a position of surplus but electricity cannot easily be stored.  We know about Turlough Hill, where water can be pumped up a hill and brought down, but we are limited in how much we can use that kind of thing.</p> <p>We do have electricity interconnections with other countries.  That is another way to balance the situation and get money back.  We are close to getting the North-South interconnector ready.  We are working with the French to put in the Celtic interconnector, which should also help.  The idea of using surplus energy to heat water tanks in people's homes is a form of battery.  It is a form of storing energy.  That water obviously can be used.  It can be used to heat the home, have a shower or whatever else.  I am interested to hear about EnergyCloud.  I will be contacting the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I will ask him about the progress on that scheme.  I would love to see it rolled out.  Organisations such as Cl&uacute;id directly target people in energy poverty, which is exactly what we are trying to do.  Much work is done before the budget to make sure that the changes that happen in the budget do not disadvantage people who are in energy poverty, leave them colder in their homes or unable to pay their bills.  We work carefully with the Economic and Social Research Institute to make sure that the budget is progressive and a lot of work is done in that regard.  I was interested to hear about the issues the Senator has raised and I thank her for bringing them to my attention.</p></speech>

He has been very active in this area.  It is a privilege to have him here in Leinster House today.  I know the view about increasing accessibility, generally, is shared by all within the Seanad.</p> <p>Following the discussion yesterday regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, I wish to raise the impact this will have on global food security.  Russia and Ukraine export more than one quarter of the world's wheat.  While, in Ireland, we do not import significant quantities from that region, any disruption will have a big impact on global supply chains.  When we talk about wheat, in particular, we are talking about basic foodstuffs and bread.  We know, because of Brexit, that much flour imported here through the UK is from North American wheat.  Rules of origin standards have meant that the WTO tariff is often applied at full whack of &euro;172 per tonne on flour imported through the UK.  There are a couple of potential solutions.  I have raised before the work of two Wexford brothers, Andrew and Raymond Kavanagh from Ballycarney, who were looking to establish a commercial flour mill in Ireland in order that we are no longer reliant on imports.  In the context of the supports being made available under the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, looking at supporting commercial flour mills is useful, but we also need to support our own farmers who are growing quality wheat.</p> <p>I would like a debate, in a broader context, on food security.  This question is linked to the impact on global supply chains.  However, if we look at the likely impact of what is happening in Russia and Ukraine will have on other parts of the world, we will see rising grain prices in countries such as Turkey and in the Middle East.  Half of the wheat used in Lebanon is imported from Ukraine; 22% in Yemen; 43% in Libya and 14% in Egypt.  We all know, because of the tensions that already exist within some of those countries, that to have a situation in which food security arises would be even more concerning.  I ask for a debate on food security here in Ireland which also links to the broader questions of the rising cost of living on an international basis.</p></speech>

Obviously, electric cars require electric charging points.  In contacting the ESB three years ago, I was informed that:</p> <blockquote> 	... the ESB is working on a plan to roll out high-powered charging across national and motorway routes across the country to facilitate inter-urban driving for electric vehicles.  Whilst we haven't confirmed the charging point locations at this point, given that we are focusing on national and motorway routes, it is unlikely the chargers that will be installed as part of the initiative would be located [in my village of Moycullen at the time]. </blockquote> <p>Nor would they be installed in other areas, as it were, on regional and national secondary routes, such as Oughterard, Barna and An Spid&eacute;al.  These areas are much travelled by tourists, in particular, and the growing population which aspires to being able to drive an electric car and it is Government policy to increase the roll-out of electric cars in time.</p><p>I sought an update in the past week and it was confirmed by the ESB that, &quot;there are no plans to change the focus of the roll-out plan for e-car charging infrastructure&quot;.  I ask for a debate on the issue of electrics and seek an update from the Minister on this matter.  If we are serious about climate, and I know Government has put a huge focus on climate action, there is a requirement for public charging points.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are a number of points in private hotels and obviously, that is an attraction and incentive for those hotels and is something positive for them to market themselves but there is a requirement in areas where there are regional and national secondary routes.</p><p>I will touch on an area I worked on in my role as a Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources and that relates to the issue of angling.  It is an issue that does not get enough attention.  I am calling for a debate on angling with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  At the time I was Minister of State in 2018, I initiated a by-law to protect the great western lakes of Lough Sheelin, Lough Conn, Lough Cullin, Lough Corrib, Lough Mask, Lough Carra and Lough Arrow from the threat of the invasive pike.  It is a cause of much concern to the angling community in the west that this by-law fell in court.  It was challenged because an appropriate assessment was not done, yet, at the same time, two controversial by-laws are on the Statute Book that go back to 2006.  For example, by-law No. 809, 2006, prohibits "a person to take or kill any pike greater than 50 cm in length measured in a straight line from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail".  The large pike that breeds and lays many eggs and that gobbles up all the small trout and salmon on our great western lakes cannot be taken.  This needs to be changed.  I ask for a debate on the issue of angling in this House. </p></speech>

I am particularly pleased that we will discuss two citizens' assemblies.  I will not get into too much debate because we have set aside two hours this afternoon; I thank the Leader and her office staff for arranging that.  I will indicate some concern about the proposal by the Government.  This motion was amended, but there is still no change.  That is the prerogative of the Government but there is a proposal that 12 councillors will be on the citizens' assembly representing the four Dublin local authorities.  Fingal County Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and South Dublin County Council have 40 members each, while there are in excess of 60 to 64 members in Dublin City Council.  I would like Senators to consider that in the next few hours because the view is there should be more representation than that.  I look forward and am happy to go through that issue.  I would like some support for the amendment, which I have already flagged to Dublin city and county councillors this morning.</p> <p>I will turn to the issue of the mushroom industry.  I had thought the Leader would be in the Chamber and  I acknowledge her enormous work, as well as that of the Acting Leader, on the mushroom sector.  I know Senator Malcolm Byrne has raised the issue of mushroom production in Wexford.  It is also in Wicklow and Monaghan.  We are still no further on.  We had very protracted discussions on the mushroom sector at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine meeting last night and it appears no Minister is prepared to take responsibility and come to the House.  The committee has taken steps to address that, including writing to the Ceann Comhairle.  That is another issue but I ask for a renewed debate on the milling of peat in the short term for the horticultural sector.   </p></speech>

I thank them for joining us today.</p></speech>

I wish to raise an issue around the circular economy.  The term "circular economy" will become one of those new buzzwords like "climate emergency" and "sustainable" everything.  I want it to be explained in a very clear way so we do not think that if we keep mentioning the word "sustainable" it will make a difference.  The circular economy is where we look at the amount of waste we are producing, be it from clothes, cars, rubbish or food, and do something about it.</p> <p>Recently, I had the great pleasure of going to Ballymun to visit one of the most inspiring places I have been to in an awfully long time, the Rediscovery Centre.  This building was repurposed thanks to a great woman, Dr. Sarah Miller, and her staff.  They turned an old district heating system into a place that has training and sees the repair of bikes, clothes, furniture and paint.  It is an inspirational place.  As we move towards the challenges we face around climate, and the biodiversity crisis we are in now, I urge every Member in the Government and the Opposition to go to this place and bring back their inspiration to their local authority.  I have since engaged with my local authority in looking to set up something similar.  Not only can we take what has been done at the Rediscovery Centre, which is completely inspiring, we could take it one step further, link in with the education and training boards and get certification for the people who are being trained up.  They can then on go to create green jobs.  That is where it is at, at this stage.  It is not about buying another reusable water bottle or green product.  That is still consumerism.  We have to look past that and look at degrowth and the circular economy.  These kinds of places could result in jobs, with access to business supports.</p> <p>Irish households create 14 million tonnes of waste every year.  In Ireland, we send 63,000 tonnes of textiles to landfill per year.  Almost half of what we donate to charity shops and clothes banks enters the global textile trade, often with devastating consequences for the countries on which they are offloaded.  Per head of population, Ireland is among the highest waste producers in Europe.  We have to buy less stuff and we have to try to reuse and upcycle all we have.  That is where we at, at this stage.  Everything is coming from petrol, precious metals or precious ores in the ground that take a lot of carbon to produce.  Ireland, per head of population, is among the highest waste producers in Europe.  Every year, our waste would fill Croke Park to the top of the stands.  It is estimated that almost 14 million tonnes of waste was generated in Ireland in 2018, across all sectors and households, corresponding to 2.9 tonnes per person.</p> <p>Producing plastic products through recycling plastic reduces energy requirements by 66%.  I cannot believe we are still talking about recycling, but it is about reducing, reusing and recycling.  We have to take it seriously and we have to do more about it.  As Government representatives, we have to take this seriously, look at what we can do and support things such as the Rediscovery Centre being replicated throughout Ireland.</p> <p>I ask the House to request the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who has done a lot of work on this, to come to the Chamber to better inform us of the plans for, and progress he has made on, the circular economy in Ireland.  </p></speech>

When I worked in Global Action Plan in Ballymun, I worked closely with Dr. Miller and the Rediscovery Centre.  It is an incredible resource.  I was going to say I was happy the Minister of State was in the Gallery because of what I was going to speak about today.  I will not have the opportunity to speak during the citizens' assembly debate but I would like to raise a number of issues that should feature in the biodiversity citizens' assembly, one of which is the role the State is playing in actively destroying habitats and undermining our wildlife laws.</p> <p>In the past week, we have had two separate reports outlining where the Office of Public Works, OPW, has breached animal welfare laws, one in Emo Court and the second in Barryscourt Castle, Cork, by disturbing bat roosts without the proper licence.  Work in Barryscourt began in 2016 but a bat specialist was not called into the 600-year-old castle until 2020.  I am more familiar with the case of Emo Court because I have been given the runaround by the OPW and the National Parks and Wildlife Service for the past number of months.  It was only through a freedom of information request that I was able to expose the fact that despite an ecologist visiting Emo Court in 2019 and saying works could not go ahead because the mitigation could not ensure the safety of the bat roost, the OPW ploughed ahead.  When I say, "ploughed ahead", it ploughed ahead.  It was only when it was reported by people who rightly whistleblew on this that the National Parks and Wildlife Service went out to investigate the site in January 2020.  The only evidence of bats they found was swept-up bat droppings and a dead bat.  To make matters worse, it appears the National Parks and Wildlife Service, instead of doing its job, which would have been to file a criminal complaint regarding the works the OPW undertook without a licence, it appears licences were retrospectively granted and a prosecution has not been pursued.  When we talk about a biodiversity crisis, if biodiversity is not safe within State bodies and they are going out and actively destroying it, and if a second body is facilitating one body in doing so, what hope do we have on private land?</p> <p>It is also the case that the OPW has form in this area.  It is not just these two individual cases.  We only have to look at what it is doing to rivers throughout the country.  I recommend that everybody looks at the Twitter account of environmental consultants ECOFACT, run by Dr. Will O'Connor, who constantly exposes the brutal works carried out by the OPW.  It recently destroyed otter, kingfisher and lamprey habitats on the Nenagh River and yet the OPW gave itself a very good rating in its environmental audit of those works.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will not be able to say this in the debate so I am calling for the citizens' assembly to address the role of the OPW because I would not trust it with a fly at the moment.  The assembly must also look at who monitors the work the OPW is carrying out.  When it comes to wildlife crime, nobody can be above the law.</p></speech>

Under the plan every 18-year-old leaving care in Wales will be offered &pound;1,600 a month over two years under a basic income pilot.  This will be the highest amount to be offered on a scheme of its kind anywhere in the world.  It is expected that about 500 people will be eligible to join the scheme, which will be taxed and counted as income by the UK Government.  That means it would affect someone's eligibility for benefits.  It will be unconditional and will not be withdrawn if participants get a job.  Officials are saying it will be equivalent to a real living wage and will be taxed at the basic rate.  It is an interesting proposals and something we need to look at closely here.  The Welsh Minister for Social Justice, Jane Hutt MS, said the plans would "deliver financial stability for a generation of young people that need it most".  A teenager who has foster parents and was interviewed about this said the pilot could make care leavers "equal with everyone else".  Another interviewee said that people in care are "disadvantaged financially and this will bring us level".  She also said it would be a safety net for those who have been in care who may not have support from their families and she noted that: "many have been damaged, physical and mentally - this can help pay for private counselling or therapy as often public waiting lists for these services are so long."  That is not dissimilar to our situation in Ireland.</p> <p>This plan for care leavers takes the concept of universal basic income, UBI, and applies it to a particular group so it is not UBI in its fullest form.  However, it highlights how we can use the concept of UBI to support groups in a way that does not require eternal means testing and all these other things we have.  To match the level of basic income for care leavers at about the real living wage is a bold move.  In economic terms, if the project is successful and results in better paid work and healthier lives, the argument is that the long-term benefits would flow back into the economy.  While this is not is a pilot of UBI, its outcomes will be relevant to the debate around that and that will be important to watch from here.</p> <p>We have a plan for a UBI-style income scheme for artists coming down the pipeline in Ireland and that is currently being worked out but this proposed scheme in Wales is one for us to really watch.  We should then consider whether we need to look at something bold, brave and radical to support our care leavers in Ireland.  I know there are many people on either side of UBI .  It comes down to one&rsquo;s personal economics and whether one thinks it should be purely about economic growth or whether we value people&rsquo;s happiness in other measures.  I would like us to have a conversation, not only about how we support care leavers when they leave care but whether we need to look at some sort of bold, brave and radical plan for supporting care leavers in order to level out the playing field for people who have already been disadvantaged.</p></speech>

To put this into perspective, in the UK and Ireland last year, Tesco forecast its profits to be more than &euro;3 billion.  Savings made by this decision will not even amount to a drop in the bucket of that enormous figure, yet it will have an extremely negative impact on those 100 employees and their families.  Having spoken to some of the employees, including some who have worked in their positions for more than 25 years, they have told me how they worked right through the pandemic, how on occasion they have been assaulted in their work, and so on.  They have shown loyalty to the company which makes billions of euro profit every year.  That loyalty has now been thrown in their faces.  They are being asked to reapply for part-time positions and to state the obvious their terms and conditions would be lesser and different.  Tesco likes to say &ldquo;Every Little Helps&rdquo; but it has no concerns about what helps their employees who have collectively given hundreds of years of service to the company, regardless of how little the figure is in the grand scheme of things for their profits.  Anything little that helps its bottom line will be done, notwithstanding the impact it will have on 100 families in Galway and across the country.</p> <p>We have lots of fantastic companies in this country that treat their staff with respect and dignity and that appreciate the service their staff provide.  With its actions, unfortunately Tesco is making it clear that it does not belong in that category.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Troy, and with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, because it is totally unacceptable for a company that is recording profits in the billions to be so dismissive of its employees in this country.</p></speech>

I thank the Cathaoirleach for his comments earlier.  As is the case for so many colleagues, today is about being able to bring our families into the House.  It is a true occasion because it is the first time we can do that in two years.  I thank the Cathaoirleach, my colleagues and the ushers for making this a special occasion.  Being a representative is about pride in where I come from.  My family has an awful lot to do with that.  I want to acknowledge my mother, Teresa Dolan n&eacute;e Caulfield, who trained as a nurse in London many years ago and then moved back home.  If there was ever a woman who could be an inspiration, it would be my mum.  There is nothing she could not do, be it nursing, farming, calving or tiling floors.  She is incredible.  It is her birthday this week and she is here for that special occasion.  My father, Tony Dolan, is a farmer who has a true love of the land.  He should be in this job rather than me because sometimes I am terrible with names and faces but he knows every square inch of that farm, be it in Jennings' or out in Moore, and he knows the townlands all around it and the people.  He has such a love of people and of meeting people and the lockdown has been so hard over the last two years for so many people, especially our older people.  I acknowledge that my Dad, a true farmer and his brother, Paddy Dolan, would have always been in the mart and in the Duck Inn in Ballinasloe.  The pride that my parents and family have in where they come from is what I have as well.  My brothers Brian, Darragh and David helped throughout this whole journey and in making this so special.  We are having a 100-year centenary.  My father was born in 1932 and he is a true citizen of this country.  In this House, where we strive to represent our country in the challenges ahead, the bar has been set by so many and that drives us in public service.  It is a special day and one I will treasure for all time.</p> <p>We are supporting the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, and my colleague, Deputy Stanton, in a measure they are looking at to support open access to school buildings after hours.  It is to support local communities and school organisations will benefit.  Our request and what we have been working with the Minister on is that this would be a requisite of the CL&Aacute;R programme and funding for school buildings and sports areas.  This could be to do with playgrounds, Astroturf or basketball courts but it is important that it is done in consultation with principals, school boards of management and parents associations.  We might see how we can make this work in practice.  School buildings and sports areas are wonderful resources for every town and village and we see the benefit for local communities when they can use these facilities after hours.</p></speech>

I am little envious that I do not have my mother anymore.  Senator Hoey does not have her father anymore and Senator Carrigy does not have his mother anymore but it is so lovely to see that Senator Dolan is able to share these moments with her parents.</p><p>On Monday the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance published its annual report card, which provides an analysis of Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party&rsquo;s Programme for Government: Our Shared Future, and how it performed for children in 2021.  The report examines the promises made to the children in the programme for Government and grades the Government on its performance in bringing about those promised changes.  The report states:</p> <blockquote> 	2021 was far from a normal year and, to its credit, the Government made good progress in some areas.  To reflect this, a &lsquo;B&rsquo; grade was awarded on the commitment to create new pathways for long-term undocumented people and their children.  There were three &lsquo;B-&rsquo; grades for work to end the Direct Provision system, for reform of the childcare system and for the long-awaited guidelines on reduced timetables.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Things were less stellar at the other end of the spectrum with two &lsquo;E&rsquo; grades awarded &ndash; the lowest in Report Card 2022.  The first of these is given for the increase in the number of children and their families experiencing homelessness.  The fact that there were nearly 300 more children and young people in emergency accommodation at the end of the 2021 compared to the beginning of that year, is deeply disappointing particularly given the positive actions taken in 2020 resulting in a fall in homeless families. </blockquote> <p>It is worth spending some time with the report but a few figures give a sobering snapshot of the work to be done.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Just under 2,500 children are homeless, as are 929 young adults.  Some 1,795 children and young people are in direct provision.  Some 84% of those aged eight to ten years are on social media platforms despite being below the age restriction.  There are 2,384 children on the waiting list for a child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, appointment of whom 170 have waited for more than a year.  It is all there in the report.  How best to help the children of Ireland?  It might be a good time to have a debate on this.  </p></speech>

It is lovely to see the great pride she has in them and I am sure that it is reciprocated because they can be very proud of Senator Dolan and the wonderful work that she is doing here in the Seanad.</p> <p>I welcome the announcement by the Cabinet that the long-awaited task force on the Shannon Estuary is about to commence and that advertisements will go out seeking indications of interest in becoming a member of its board.  If this Government goes full term, as I believe it will, in 2025 I will have been a public representative for 40 years.  In all that time I have had great joys and great disappointments.  The Shannon Estuary has been the greatest struggle and disappointment of my political life.  We have been promised so many false dawns.  We were going to have a car assembly factory there, a zinc refinery and a major transhipment hub.  I gave 16 years as a director of the local port company in Foynes, which was very profitable and go-ahead.  We wasted so many wonderful opportunities from a lack of Government commitment and I am talking about my own party as well as everybody else.  </p> <p>Next week we will get the definitive result from An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, project, which I devoutly hope will get the go-ahead.  The Government has indicated that it will accept An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision.  When it comes to the objectors, 99% do not reside in my community.  There is 99% support for that project in the community in north Kerry.  I hope that if and when permission is given, these objectors will accept that and let us get on with creating jobs and creating new infrastructure and giving a whole new lease of life to the estuary.</p> <p>I also welcome the report published yesterday by Alcohol Action Ireland in conjunction with the UCC school of public health on alcohol.  We have had many debates here on alcohol but I would like to point out some alarming statistics in the report.  It states that up to four people daily die in Ireland of alcohol-related disease.  Alcohol is a factor in 5% of all deaths in the country.  More than 25% of suicides, male and female, are alcohol-related.  These statistics may be underestimates.  I am not a killjoy.  I drank when I was able; I cannot drink any more.  It is wonderful to see people enjoying a drink in moderation.  That said, we need to step up a gear.  I am calling for a State-sponsored alcohol office to be opened by the Government, the introduction of a broadcast watershed for alcohol advertising on radio and television and clearer labelling of the danger of alcohol products, akin to what we get when we open our cigarette packets.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#K00300"><p>Before Senator Dolan's parents leave, I want to wish her mum a very happy birthday.  It is wonderful to see all her family here.  I know it was a very proud day for her when she was elected, as it was for all of us.  I know that it is a proud day to have the opportunity to visit here and see the goings on.  They are very welcome.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne welcomed Matthew McGrath and I add my voice and that of the House to that welcome.  He has led a campaign about accessibility to beaches.  He is lucky that he lives in Gorey.  It is such a lovely town with beautiful beaches all around.  That is something that we all very much support.  Senator Malcolm Byrne also spoke about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the consequent concern about food security that arise as well as the humanitarian concerns.  We are all very concerned about the global supply of wheat, flour, bread etc.  He is right in saying that we need to support commercial flour mills here.  We need to have a debate about food security.  That links in with a point raised by Senator Boyhan on the mushroom sector.  We have gone no further on the agricultural peat issue.  Deputy Cahill, the excellent Chair of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, told me last night that it was impossible to get a Minister to come before the committee to speak about this issue.  That is absolutely wrong and we need to do as much as we can to ensure our food security.  One question, on international matters, leads on the other.  </p> <p>Senator Kyne sought two debates.  One is on electric cars and the need for electricity points needed on local, regional and national routes.  He is correct in saying that we need to accelerate the roll-out.  It is unfortunate that three years after the original request, that the ESB has not changed its focus in respect of the smaller, more rural areas which need electric points to encourage people to invest in electric cars.  That is Government policy.  We will look for a debate on that.  He also raised the issue of angling and a by-law that he had introduced that fell and two controversial by-laws that require debate.  He might introduce that by-law into the Seanad.  We could have a good debate then.  </p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke of the citizens' assembly and the need for more representation from councillors across Dublin.  I am sure that is something that we all support.</p> <p>Senator Garvey spoke about the circular economy.  She mentioned the work that Dr. Sarah Miller has done in the Rediscovery Centre, Ballymun, with workshops and projects on recycling and reusing, particularly around the repair of bicycles and furniture, as well as the bringing in of paint.  People often have paint left over from jobs.  It is a perfect idea.  Senator Garvey has encouraged all public representatives to visit and see how we can create jobs in the green area.  She suggested that we look for a debate from the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, who has done a lot of work in the area.  We will look for that debate.</p> <p>Senator Boylan spoke about the conservation of bats, particularly in Emo Court and in Cork.  It is quite wrong that she had to resort to a freedom of information request to get the information she requested.  She also pointed out that licences were retrospectively granted.  That is simply not good enough.  She made a fair point that when we talk about the citizens' assembly and biodiversity, we need to look within the State institutions first.  I agree that should be addressed within the citizens' assembly.</p> <p>Senator Hoey spoke about a pilot scheme in Wales for those leaving care, which ensures that people have extra funding.  It is the same principle of universal support income.  It would go to a small group of people to help level the playing field.  Life in care is difficult and when you leave care as an 18-year-old, life is even more difficult.  Support, including financial support, and care are needed.  It is something that we could ask the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to look at.  </p> <p>Senator Crowe raised Tesco's decision to outsource security work and the impact on 100 workers both inside and outside of Galway.  He rightly made the point that they were people who gave incredible loyalty to the firm.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As he mentioned, some have worked there for more than 25 years, including throughout the pandemic.  We know how difficult the pandemic was for people working on the front lines, as these people were.  Sadly, they received insults from many others.  They have been asked to reapply under certain terms and conditions.  We will raise the matter with the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, on the Senator's behalf.</p><p>Senator Dolan spoke about her pride in her place and in her family.  She also raised a point about open access to school buildings after school hours.  I cannot believe that it is not being done at this stage.  Given the significant investment in school buildings &ndash; all of our new schools are state-of-the-art, and rightly so &ndash; it is wrong that schools in many small towns and communities do not provide access after hours.  In particular, every school should allow outside access to halls that can be used for sport or other activities.  I support the Senator's call.</p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about the performance grade awarded by the Children's Rights Alliance.  I happened to hear some of the interview with Ms Tanya Ward on radio the day before yesterday.  Regarding the grading system, she rightly spoke about where we had scored well as a country, which is important, but also about where we had not, particularly in terms of the use of social media.  I agree with the Senator that we should seek a debate with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  It is a matter that we should cast an eye on annually.</p><p>Senator O'Sullivan spoke about the Shannon Estuary task force as well as the highs and lows of his political life.  He mentioned that this was his greatest disappointment.  I am glad that he has had other high notes.  I hope that the next week's decision on Shannon LNG will be positive and act as a definitive point.  As we saw with the Glanbia plant in Mitchelstown, recourse being taken to court time and again delays processes and jobs.  The cost of these manufacturing hubs, for want of a better term, has escalated so much that it is stopping progress within the regions.  These rural regions need those jobs and industries.</p><p>The Senator also spoke about the report by Alcohol Action.  I listened to a segment on it this morning.  The statistics were frightening.  For example, 25% of suicides are alcohol-related, alcohol is a factor in 5% of deaths overall and four people die from alcohol-related illness every day.  The Senator made particular requests for a State-sponsored alcohol office and clearer labelling.  I am sure that there will be support for those requests.  I agree with him that we need to raise awareness more.</p></speech>

We are honoured to have them and are delighted that they recognise the importance of this forum and connection.  We are conscious of how busy they are and how difficult it is to fit everything into their schedules.  As such, their presence is appreciated and we will try to honour it with the quality of inputs from our Members.  I have no doubt that the MEPs will be impressed by that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">An Leas-Chathaoirleach:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome my colleagues who are here in great numbers.  Their engagement with this process is appreciated.  From the outset, An Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, has energetically embarked on a programme of Seanad reform.  Central to that is the engagement with the European Parliament through our MEPs and the European institutions.  I have worked with An Cathaoirleach and our excellent administrative team specifically on this European project.  By agreement, I have taken a particularly active and lead role in this important project and I take that very serious, as does An Cathaoirleach and Members, as evidenced by their attendance today.</p><p>There will be further stages of this process and further meetings with our MEPs on specific topics and themed evenings etc.  That is all to come, as was suggested by our distinguished colleague, Senator Boyhan.  There will also be an involvement by the Seanad in the scrutiny of EU legislation.  It is important that as part of Seanad reform and making the Seanad more relevant to contemporary times etc. that we get that link between us and Europe very clearly delineated, established and organic such that it is going on all of the time.  Over 60% of legislative decisions that impact on the lives of people in Ireland, how we live and so on, come directly from Europe in the form of directives, regulations and recommendations.  There is an extraordinarily close link and a real relevance of Europe which is often missed by some people.  European legislation is very impactful in this country.  It affects our daily lives and we should be very conscious of that.  It is great that the Eurobarometer polls show a strong positivity towards Europe in Ireland.  The polls also reflect a lack of knowledge about Europe.  It is hoped this engagement will form part of bridging that gap and the establishment of a link between this important Chamber of a bicameral Parliament with the European Parliament.  </p><p>We will now move to the business of the evening.  I propose to call the MEPs in alphabetical order, which is purely an objective process.  The entire evening is based on fair procedures, we hope.  The first person to address us is Billy Kelleher, MEP, whom we are delighted to have here with us again.  He is making a significant impact in Europe.  Mr. Kelleher has six minutes to make his address.</p></speech>

Mar is eol do Sheanad&oacute;ir&iacute;, bh&iacute;odh m&eacute; i mo Chomhalta den Teach seo idir 1993 agus 1997.  Chaith m&eacute; go leor ama ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il le p&iacute;osa&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la de reachta&iacute;ocht an tSeanaid mar Aire St&aacute;it.  I rith na mblianta, chreid m&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; go raibh ardchaighde&aacute;n d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta sa Seanad.  T&aacute; r&oacute;l t&aacute;bhachtach agus r&iacute;-thairbheach ag an Seanad go h&aacute;irithe maidir leis an Aontas Eorpach.  Mar sin, is deis iontach &iacute; d&uacute;inne mar Fheisir&iacute; Eorpacha labhairt leis na Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; ar na ceisteanna is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; faoi l&aacute;thair.<br/><br/><b></b>A Leas-Chathaoirligh, Senators, friends, it is truly a great honour to be back in the Seanad after a long absence.  I was a Senator in the early 1990s and I spent a good deal of time in the Seanad as a Member but, sometimes, as a Minister of State being asked questions and trying to answer them and also on legislation.  I have always believed there is a high standard of debate in the Seanad.  It is less partisan and it gives opportunities and more freedom to Members to express their views in a way that is not necessarily always possible in the D&aacute;il.  I very much welcome the role that is now being proposed by the Seanad with regard to scrutiny of the issue of the European Union and making sure we have that connectivity between the national Parliament and the European Parliament.  <br/><br/>Membership of the European Union, a union of 450 million citizens from 27 different member states, has transformed our country.  When we signed the Treaty of Accession 50 years ago, Ireland was a dramatically different country, economically poor and socially conservative.  Despite various challenges over that time, Ireland has emerged as a global economic success story and an island of social progress.  The  European Union also has been a success.  As I have said previously, membership gave us the ability to achieve economic independence and to add to the political independence achieved by the Twenty-six Counties in 1922.  However, our Union is not perfect.  The European Union does make mistakes.  It does not get all things right all of the time.  Moreover, it is also absolutely essential that those mistakes and imperfections are called out publicly, but primarily by those who support the Union.  Very often, we allow those who are opposed to the European Union to be the ones who hold it to account.  It is important that pro-European people, parties and members hold the European Union to account.  <br/><br/>My colleague in the European Parliament, the former Prime Minister of Belgium, Guy Verhofstadt, said during a debate last year on how the Commission was handling the Covid-19 vaccine procurement process that pro-Europeans should be the first to be critical when things go wrong.  Those in Ireland who are pro-European must not allow the debates about the future of the Union to take place without their input.  If we are honest, Irish Governments of different colours have been slower than others in pushing their priorities on a variety of issues.  Prior to Brexit, we were lucky to have the UK leading the fight on many of the issues that are also important to Ireland.  We no longer have that luxury.  We have to do these things ourselves now.<br/><br/>Staying with Brexit, it is fair to say that a major change has taken place in the European Parliament.  Brexit as an issue once dominated the political discourse but it no longer commands the same level of interest.  It is important to send out the message that while we in Ireland may still be very consumed about Brexit, Europe has moved on.  There are technical discussions happening, most recently on the supply of medicines to Northern Ireland.  The deep, meaningful, philosophical, political debates about Brexit in Europe are over.  The euro bubble has moved on to more pressing issues.  Brexit is a matter that I and other Irish MEPs must keep an eye on because there are still issues around the protocol that require Ireland to be alert and ready to act.  <br/><br/>As an MEP I have seen first-hand the impact of attentive national governments on issues going through the European Parliament.  Prior to it assuming the Presidency in January, the French Government was invested in finding out well in advance what was happening in the Parliament and then, crucially, seeking to influence its outcome for its interests.  Political Ireland has not yet caught on with the post-Lisbon reality of Parliament being an equal co-legislator with the Council.  While we do get great support from the permanent representative on legislative files, there are many other files that if not dealt with appropriately may cause issues down the road for Ireland.  We know from experience that opinions and own initiative reports from Parliament now influence Commission proposals because of the fact that we are co-legislators.  <br/><br/>Ireland needs to have a conversation on a couple of issues.  One such issue is what exactly membership of the European Union means to it.  Long gone is the idea that we are solely a trading, economic or customs bloc.  We are now a Union of values, ideas and principles.  A great example of this is the ongoing crisis on our eastern frontiers.  Europe's border with Russia, which now stretches over 3,000 km from Lapland in the far north to the Black Sea in the south, is under threat.  That border is also our border.  When one speaks to Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles and Romanians, they are genuinely fearful of an invasion at some stage from Russia.  It is not being alarmist; it is just the way they see the world.  To a certain extent, we are cocooned from that reality.  This is known to all political groupings in the European Union who have members from those countries.  They are genuinely fearful of that concept of Russian tanks being in a part of the European Union at some point in the future.  The impact already in terms of cybersecurity and the threats that are continually being played out in those particular countries by Russia is very significant.  <br/><br/>I again acknowledge the role the Seanad is playing in terms of promoting greater informed debate between it and the European Parliament.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Billy Kelleher:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also look forward to continual engagement on this issue.

It should hopefully provoke responses.</p> <p>Europe has probably been the greatest peace process of all time.

D&eacute;anann s&eacute; sin difr&iacute;ocht mh&oacute;r do st&aacute;das na Gaeilge.  Beidh a l&aacute;n jabanna ar f&aacute;il d'ateangair&iacute; agus d'aistritheoir&iacute; amach anseo.  Molaim mo chomhfheisir&iacute; mar, dh&aacute; bhliain &oacute; shin nuair a chuamar ann ar dt&uacute;s, th&aacute;ngamar le ch&eacute;ile agus d&uacute;ramar go nd&eacute;anfaimis iarracht an Ghaeilge a labhairt sa Pharlaimint.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin d&eacute;anta ag na feisir&iacute;, agus ag Billy Kelleher ach go h&aacute;irithe.  Leanfaimid ar aghaidh mar sin mar n&iacute;l aon mhaitheas sa Ghaeilge a bheith ina teanga oifigi&uacute;il agus oibre muna n-&uacute;s&aacute;idimid &iacute;.  Tugaim aitheantas freisin don Ombudsman Eorpach, Emily O'Reilly.  Nuair a bh&iacute; s&iacute; ag leagan a tuarasc&aacute;il os comhair na Parlaiminte coic&iacute;s &oacute; shin, labhair s&iacute; as Gaeilge amh&aacute;in.  B&aacute; &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad uair a tharla &eacute; sin.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, is d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go nd&eacute;anfaimid &aacute;r nd&iacute;cheall &aacute; dteanga dh&uacute;chais a chur chun cinn.</p> <p>I am also pleased that the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, is making a big effort to reform the Seanad.  I have no hesitation in saying that I voted in the referendum for the retention of the Seanad, because I felt that it has a proper role to play.  It needed reform, not abolition.  I am glad to see that reform developing.  Only this morning, before I came here, I had a meeting, at the request of my Romanian colleagues in the European Parliament, with the ambassador from Romania here in Ireland.  He is just up the road, at 26 Waterloo Road.  I was pleased when he told me that a friendship group has been established between Romanian politicians and Members here.  In particular, he mentioned a few of my own colleagues, such as Senators Sherlock, Buttimer, Conway and so forth.  That is significant for two reasons.  First, in a post-Brexit scenario, and Mr. Kelleher alluded to this, we have lost the British, who are without a doubt our best allies, in the European Parliament.  We therefore have to look for new allies.</p> <p>It is important to have close relationships, particularly at a national level, as well as at a European level, above all with the eastern countries, such as those who have most recently joined the European Parliament.  This will stand us in good stead in the future.  They are looking for allies.  If we can play that leadership role, that will be significant.  As of now, they are totally unrepresented in the key positions in the European institutions.  All of the key people, such as the President of the Commission, the President of the Parliament and the President of the Council, the rotating Presidency, the President of the ECB, are here in the West.  That is not a good thing.  We have a role to play in ensuring that we have a closer liaison with countries.  This is especially the case for those countries that joined the European Union but who were part of the USSR previously.  I am delighted to see that the Seanad can do that, not just in relation to Romania, but with many other countries.  I would like to see that advertised as well.  Otherwise, people will ask what the Seanad is doing.  It was wonderful for me to hear that this morning, straight from the mouth of the ambassador.  He has only been here for six months.  Therefore, much progress has been made and that is important. </p> <p>In Europe, I thankfully have many roles, above all, those that relate to Brexit.  Mr. Kelleher said, and he is right, that there is a certain Brexit weariness in Europe but, at the same time, we have to get on with it.  We have to deal not just with the European Union but with the United Kingdom.  There is a whole pile of areas in which I am involved with this, particularly in my role at the Committee on International Trade.  I represent the trade committee, which meets regularly with the United Kingdom.  The trade committee will have a hearing on the protocol on 21 March because I asked it to do so.  That will be significant.  </p> <p>As well as being a member of the trade committee and representing it in Brexit, I am also on the Committee on Budgetary Control.  Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, of whom I am sure Senators will have heard, leads the European Union discussions.  He feeds what is happening into the committee.  One of the things I asked him at our meeting last week in Strasbourg, was to undertake a survey regarding the current state of the protocol in Northern Ireland.  I think that he will do that, because it is significant from our point of view.  The facts show that the protocol is working.  It is working particularly for Northern Ireland.  Trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland is up 65%.  Of course, there are those who wanted Brexit, but for whom this was the last thing that they wanted.  They never expected it to benefit the Republic.  They thought that it would benefit a global Britain.  They probably were not prepared for that.  However, that is the reality. </p> <p>My second point - which has come across clearly and I am glad of that - is that the European Union does not really play politics, as one might have to do at a national level.  It works according to what it is entitled to do, which comes under the treaties.  It observes the treaties.  When an agreement is done, as was done with the the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, the EU is honour-bound to live by that, and it will do so.  The idea of getting rid of the protocol will not be entertained.  It would have knock-on effects and we will be working on that.  There has been huge progress in the practicalities of it.  They will be as flexible as possible.  That will happen into the future.</p> <p>My last point is on the Ukraine and Russia.  The European Union stands 100% united in its view on what is happening.  I must say that I was somewhat disappointed when we had a vote on that situation, as late as in December.  It would surprise the Senators to see the number of MEPs from Ireland who did not support Ukraine and who sided with Russia.  That should be looked at.  That is not good, particularly when one looks at our history.  We spent 700 years trying to get our freedom.  </p></speech>

Now it is a particular pleasure to welcome back - as everyone here did informally earlier in the corridors and elsewhere &ndash; one of our own.  While former Senator Kelleher is a former distinguished Member of the Seanad, I personally served with former Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan and many people here did.  She was one of our very respected, warm and excellent colleagues.  It is a homecoming day for her.  She very recently left us, so we welcome back former Senator O&rsquo;Sullivan and we look forward to her address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.67" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms. Grace O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#Y00500"><p>It is wonderful to be back in the Seanad Chamber.  The last time I was here, the Chamber was being renovated.  Fair dues.  It has been a brilliant day to be here and to see it looking so well.  I say &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to all my of my former colleagues, to friends, to my fellow MEPs and to the administration staff here in the Seanad today.   As a former Member of the House, and as a former member of the Civil Engagement Group here in the Seanad from 2016-2019, it gives me great pleasure to be here, in this particular year, when we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  For those I have not met, I am a mother, and I call myself a peace, climate and social justice activist.  I am an ecologist and I have been a Green Party MEP for Ireland's South consituency since 2019.</p> <p>As the Senators are no doubt aware, and as my colleagues have said, the European Parliament was elected as a legislative structure to unite European citizens&rsquo; voices, since 1979.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was elected 40 years after this first election on the back of a green wave that could not have arrived at a more urgent time.  I have spent most of my life actively campaigning on ecological and environmental issues and finding ways to make my work in the issues on which I campaign connect with people on the ground.</p><p>My past work with Greenpeace, my work as an ecologist, previous work in the Seanad and current work in the European Parliament are all very much interconnected.  The focus of my work as a legislator in the European Parliament continues to be driven by that passion for the environment, biodiversity and creating a fairer planet for all.</p><p>Key work that I started here in the Seanad, for example, when I introduced a Bill on microbeads and microplastic pollution, continues apace for me at European level where later this year, I will work as a shadow rapporteur on the waste packaging directive.  This legislation comes out of the ENVI committee, that is, the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety of which I am a member.</p><p>This committee is also where my work on the environment action programme to 2030 originated.  This programme is far-reaching, decade-long legislation relating to the environment.  I have been honoured to be the European Parliament's lead negotiator on this legislation.  I am proud that after putting in a tremendous, hard teamworking effort over the past year, we successfully steered this legislation through very challenging negotiations with the European Commission and European Council, which showed stubborn opposition to introducing some ambitious environmental targets and commitments.  We got it over the line, however.  Next month's plenary meeting in Strasbourg will have the final votes on this legislation, which will see progress and actions on areas such as environmentally harmful subsidies, a well-being economy, soil protection and equally important conditions that ensure success in roll-out and implementation such as policy coherence, monitoring frameworks and binding targets.  In particular, I am proud of the commitment to set down a deadline in the EU for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies that is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5&deg;C as per the lower limit laid down in the Paris Agreement.  I can tell Senators that this was hard fought.</p><p>Going back in time again to reiterate the importance of that sense of connectedness I think is so vital, when I was 21, I joined Greenpeace and over the next 20 years, I was engaged in activism on peace, human rights and environment issues all over the world.  Something I carry with me from that time is a sense of not just being a citizen of Europe and Ireland but being a global citizen.  As such, I am a proud member of a number of delegations in the European Parliament, including the delegation for relations with Palestine, a country for which I know many Senators campaign and work very hard.  If Senator Black was in the Chamber, she would be glad to hear me mention Palestine because I know of the huge work she has done in that area.</p><p>Another experience I take forward from my days in Greenpeace, and having been to Antarctica twice and seeing its beautiful richness, is that I tabled a resolution in the European Parliament to create two massive marine protected areas covering more than 3 million sq. km of southern ocean in the Antarctic.  This is the largest area ever proposed to become a marine protected area.  Work related to marine protection is really important for me, not only in Europe and globally but here on the home front.  As spokesperson for the Green Party on the marine, I know that I am supported by Senator Pippa Hackett and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who engaged with me on the marine and planning protection work.</p><p>I am a member of the PECH committee, that is, the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries, where I engaged over the past two years on really important legislation on the reform of the EU fisheries control system.  This is an area in which the parliament wields significant control and power, with a direct impact on ocean sustainability and fishers livelihoods from how catches are recorded in logbooks to inspections, weighing and infringement procedures.  Irish fishers have often raised concerns about how the EU regulates these areas but our concern is that there will be more leniency towards industrial fishers while not supporting small-scale fishers.  Well-managed fisheries are of high importance to us.</p><p>The bottom line for me has always been about nurturing nature because we are part of the natural system.  I look forward to hearing about Senators' work and answering their questions and to working collaboratively with Senators from all parties and none, as they say.  If we are to make progress, we have to work collectively together.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach very much.</p></speech>

It is lovely to have her back.  One of her big stated objectives is to hand over the planet to the next generation in better condition than we got it, if we can.  That gives me a great cue to welcome the young people to the Visitors Gallery.  What we do here is completely about their future.  I am delighted to welcome them.</p> <p>We will move now to the addresses by party spokespersons.  We will stick rigidly to times.  We have three minutes per spokesperson.  First, to speak on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group we have the president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, party, which is a very good link between the European stage and our Parliament.  I call Senator Dooley.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#Z00300"><p>I welcome the three MEPs and thank them for their presentations.  Mr. Kelleher at the outset talked about the Seanad being a Chamber of non-partisan politics and that is partly true.  It is also well recognised that the three MEPs among us work collectively on behalf of the Irish people and the island of Ireland when they work in the European Parliament, notwithstanding the fact that they are in different groups and come from different political backgrounds.  That is one of the important things about the way in which the island of Ireland has been represented both North and South when the North was part of the European Union.  Regardless of the tradition or the party, those who represented did so in a collegial way and in the best interests.  I am glad that is largely continuing.</p> <p>They have all set out their very clear objectives.  They have identified their concerns and they reflect on the concerns of this House and the wider people.  If we were here two and a half years ago, the entire debate would have been dominated by Brexit.  It has not gone away or been resolved.  The outcome is not clear but it has somewhat faded in significance because of the geopolitical situation between Russia and Ukraine, and not just the potential for war on the mainland of Europe, something we thought would be the furthest thing we would be thinking about right now with the development of the European Union and its continuous growth.  As the Cathaoirleach said at the outset, it is, and was, designed to be one of the greatest peace projects in the history of Europe.</p> <p>Notwithstanding that, we have seen the emergence of a policy by the leader of Russia over a prolonged period.  It is growing in strength and stature again and reasserting itself in an aggressive way towards its nearest neighbour.  In the first instance, that is deeply disturbing from a political perspective.  It has major ramifications for us economically, which obviously are secondary to the humanitarian issues that will be experienced on the ground.  Following on from the pandemic, it is something that is deeply concerning when we consider the extent to which most countries in Europe have borrowed very significantly to address the health crisis attached to Covid-19 and are now figuring out where they move or what kinds of policies move forward from an economic perspective.  To have the uncertainty of this aggression thrown in certainly shows that nothing remains the same at European level.   We move from Brexit to Covid-19 and now to the potential for, as some might indicate, a third world war, something which obviously we hope does not happen.</p> <p>I thank our guests sincerely for their ongoing engagement, which, as the Cathaoirleach indicated, is part of an engagement with us in a two-way dialogue.  I know all the MEPs keep in contact with a group.  I suppose I have more contact with Mr. Kelleher because of the party affiliation.  The way in which he communicates with the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentarians and the wider public he represents is certainly exemplary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We would want to recognise his assistant, Mr. Donnacha Maguire, who is also in the Chamber today.  He neatly fitted in among the young people there and he did not even stand out as being anything other than one of them.  Of course, that helps to keep Mr. Kelleher in vogue with the younger population.  </p></speech>

As I served on the European Committee of the Regions for a number of years, I know the importance of that collaboration and of working with your colleagues right across the different countries.  Quite often there is much commonality, to which many of them referred in their briefing today.  Many of the same issues arise but sometimes it is necessary to fly the Irish flag together as well because sometimes there are things that may possibly impact Ireland that do not impact other countries.  I am very aware of that.  All of them have spoken about the issues that are of importance.  I wish to raise two or three things today.  One is on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the issues facing Irish farmers.  Certainly it is a huge issue in Ireland, as I am sure all the MEPs are aware.  There is a big fear factor there.  The consultation is going on and much is happening both here in Ireland and also in Europe.  I would like to hear the views of the MEPs in this regard.  Also, on the EU digital green deal, many of us here are from the regions, as are the MEPs, who are from the Munster region.  There are many companies looking at such things as airports and ports on our doorstep, which are an economic driver for the different regions.  Several of the MEPs present serve on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.  What are their views as to how we fit in or how we can further improve things in terms of Munster?  In regard to Brexit, we are all very aware that our nearest EU neighbour is now France, as Brexit is still looming.  They referred to the relationships between Ireland and the North and it is very important that that is built upon.  In regard to connectivity with Europe, how do they see things happening now that things still are not settled or sorted out?  As I only have three minutes, these are just a couple of short questions but I look forward to their responses.</p></speech>

As our visitors are aware, there are two independent groups within the Seanad.  First I welcome the MEPs, Mr. Kelleher, Mr. Kelly and, in particular, Ms O'Sullivan.  It is great to see her back.  I remember the first time I met her was when she came out canvassing for the Seanad.  We ran on the same panel.  Her energy and enthusiasm were boundless.  Of course, we immediately identified her as the Greenpeace Green.  She was all of that and she deserved her place here.  We missed her so I want to single her out in particular among her colleagues.  I also acknowledge Mr. Maguire, who worked tirelessly around the building and was known.  I see him down there.  When they go to Europe they suddenly change somewhat but he has not.  I barely recognised him there.  I did not see the other half of him below the glass.  He is a wonderful servant and I know Mr. Kelleher and the Fianna F&aacute;il group in particular are exceptionally lucky to have him on their team.</p> <p>I wish to say two or three things.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  What I am going to talk about, very briefly, is agriculture, food and the marine.  This is the area on which Oireachtas committee I am on.  The ongoing challenge for us both in Ireland and in Europe is sustainable agriculture, sustainable food production, the environment, the European Green Deal, green architecture and the policies that flow within them.  We are all on a journey.  My concern is that we all travel at a different pace and a different time along that journey but we have to unite in terms of the rural and the urban.  We must explain where we are coming from on our different perspectives.  We all look to Europe as champions in terms of the European Green Deal, green architecture and the green policy and vision.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is working in that area and I interface with her on the committee.  It is a challenge and it is difficult.  At times we might appear to be at one another's throats in terms of our perspective but we are all on a journey.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, dare I say it, are on a journey too and are travelling well on that journey might I add, as someone who is on the outside looking in.  My only request of the MEPs is that I would like them to look again at the Committee of the Regions.  I am familiar with many of my colleagues on the Committee of the Regions and they tell me there is a disconnect between the Committee of the Regions and that very important work on subsidiarity in terms of Europe and how we relate back home in our countries.  There are huge challenges and huge opportunities for the Committee of the Regions and I hear from them that there is a disconnect between it and the European Parliament and other activities, layers and levels within the Parliament and indeed with the MEPs.  My one request is, can we see if we can improve and work on that area?  </p></speech>

Labhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; inniu mar gheall ar athr&uacute; aer&aacute;ide amh&aacute;in.</p> <p>Mary Robinson, one of my heroes, was in recently to celebrate 100 years of the Seanad and she said it would be remiss of us not to discuss climate every single day in the Seanad.  So I choose to do so today.  I am only in the Green Party because I care about climate change and biodiversity but I would really like to see every party as concerned as we are.  Then we would not need to be in existence.  I do not see it happening at a European level.  I am deeply concerned because as a member state of the European Union, Ireland is led by the EU and in some ways we have had some good environmental things come in but we have also had some other issues.  For instance, food labelling is a huge issue in Ireland for Irish producers.</p> <p>We cannot sustain ourselves without food and in light of climate change and biodiversity, if we do not look at food properly we are going to be in serious trouble as an island nation.  We have not the proper supports to stop the complete destruction of our fish stocks even though we know now that it is illegal and they cannot come in but then it happens and I do not know what we are doing about it at an EU level.  Ms O'Sullivan has done some work on it but it has to come from everybody.  It cannot just be left to the Greens.  We are not going to solve any problems if it is just left to the Greens.  </p> <p>The other big thing was the Mercosur deal.  Not only is it cutting down the rainforest, it is bringing meat from the other side of the planet when we have a surplus of beef and milk here in our own country for which farmers are getting underpaid.  In the meantime, we are also talking about maybe exporting pigs to China.  The whole thing is completely insane.  If we look at food alone, we will not be able to deal with climate.  If we look at food and try to solve the food issue, it will make a huge inroad into dealing with the climate issue.  We have to see that these things are linked.  If we do not sort out the biodiversity crisis we will not be able to grow food.  If you do not have biodiversity, you do not have insects that pollinate.  Most people here know, hopefully, that if you do not pollinate, you do not get fruit or vegetables because they come after the flower has been pollinated.  This issue is far beyond the Green Party.  I do not care if we do not get any credit for anything but it has to be taken really seriously.  Going to Europe many times as a teenager is what inspired me.  Thirty years ago, I went to Germany and saw solutions there that we still do not have here yet.  We in the Green Party are in government but we are a small party in government.  Ireland is a small island in Europe but if we do not take it seriously, the people who are not taking climate seriously will be the ones who will be up in arms, probably literally, when billions of people are migrating to Europe as a result of our failing to take climate and biodiversity seriously.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#BB00200"><p>I welcome our three colleagues from the European Parliament.  Mr. Kelleher and Mr. Kelly will forgive me if give a particularly warm welcome to our former colleague, Ms Grace O'Sullivan, because she was such an exceptional Member of the Seanad.  I am sure I would have said the same about Mr. Kelleher if I had been here at the same time as he was, or perhaps not.  He is right.  Ms O'Sullivan was an exceptional Member.  She fought valiantly on a range of issues, and she was superb at building alliances.  I have no doubt she is continuing that work.  It is great to see her.</p> <p>I want to take up the point Mr. Kelleher began with in describing the European Union as a union of values.  It is important to have a conversation around those values today if we can.  In that respect, I wish to raise two or three issues on which the MEPs might reflect.  The first is the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, waiver.  Surely if we are serious about European values, then we must address the fact that whereas, thankfully, there are very high vaccination rates across most of Europe, vaccination rates across Africa are 11%.  Unfortunately, the European Commission is the key blocking vehicle in allowing a TRIPS waiver.  Even last week, in talks with the African Union, it did not allow the word "waiver" to appear in the report of the dialogue.  That is just wrong.  I am very proud of the fact that this Seanad on a cross-party basis called for a TRIPS waiver before Christmas.  There was some initial opposition from the Government, but it melted away because all of the Members here from every party stood up and said this is what needs to happen.  The views of the three MEPs in that regard would be welcome, in particular as the Government, unfortunately, continues to drag its heels.  Even last week, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, did not speak out in favour of a TRIPS waiver; in fact, he did quite the opposite.  It is important to hear Irish voices in Europe make that clear call here this afternoon if possible.</p> <p>In a similar vein, as a member of the Council of Europe, I am particularly concerned about the plight of migrants in recent years.  As the MEPs know, 20,000 migrants have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.  We have serious concern about the proposed European pact on migration.  I am pleased that the Council of Europe passed a motion calling for a comprehensive human rights assessment by the European Commission on the compatibility of each of the proposed measures in the pact with case law of the European Court of Human Rights.  It is hard to take seriously talk of European values when human beings are drowned in the Mediterranean and when MEPs vote against increased search and rescue missions, unfortunately including some in this room this afternoon.  We need to speak out very clearly on the need for state-led search and rescue missions because, otherwise, how can we ever talk of values.</p> <p>Finally, I wish to ask about the position on the proposed EU directive on the minimum wage.  It is a very important directive regarding collective bargaining rights so I would like to hear the views of the MEPs on that as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#BB00300"><p>I extend a warm welcome to all of the MEPs, including our former Civil Engagement group, CEG, colleague, Ms Grace O'Sullivan.  There are a few areas of interest that are very important, some of which have been covered previously by Senator Gavan, such as the TRIPS waiver.  The MEPs will be aware that this House unanimously called for Ireland to support the TRIPS waiver.  It was deeply disappointing to see Ireland take one of the positions against that in the summit between the European Union and the African Union last week.  Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African President, spoke about the fact that if we are not able to find each other on a matter of life and death and what this would do for the relationship between Europe and Africa.  The European position in that regard, as well as being a moral and human rights failure, is also a diplomatic failure and will damage trust on the key issues of climate and environment where we need co-operation.</p> <p>I would welcome if the MEPs could comment a little on some of the environmental areas they mentioned such as the new regulations that are coming in.  One of the key points is the move away from fossil fuel subsidies.  There seems to be a real battle at European level now between, for example, green hydrogen, which Ireland is in a position to champion, and the dragging on of gas networks.  In a way, when we see that Nord Stream 2 cannot proceed now, it shows the fragility of dependence on such fossil fuel infrastructure.  Could the MEPs comment on the taxonomy?  Ireland has been clear that we should not be putting gas into a taxonomy and labelling it as sustainable because that directs money away from the kinds of renewable energy and green hydrogen Ireland should champion.</p> <p>Ms O'Sullivan has done extensive work on the oceans, including the motions on the marine protected areas when she was in the House.  Whales are dying and washing up around Europe at the moment.  There is a need for real enforcement of the environmental impact tools that we have regarding oceans, not just the marine protected areas, which are becoming very pertinent.  They were very pertinent recently even in respect of military activity outside Ireland's waters but also across Europe.  Military activity is having an impact on the oceans but it also has an impact on emissions and it is important to count and measure that because it does affect the planet.</p> <p>I wish to comment on the business and human rights legislation.  Senator Black and others have worked in this area.  Is there an opportunity to address such issues, for example, through the due diligence legislation and the citizens' initiative calling for a prohibition on the use of supply chains involving settlement goods?</p> <p>I have so many issues I wish to raise.

That is a big challenge.  For example, Senator Gavan referred to migrants and the need for us to have a compassionate way of dealing with people who come through the asylum process or who just present themselves at borders who are fleeing persecution or war-torn areas.  The difficulty is that the European Commission and the European Parliament have published very detailed documents on this particular issue, but the Council at member state level is causing difficulties in trying to move the issue forward.  That is a very problematic area for us.  The parliament has consistently tried to move, along with the Commission, to have a humane, uniform way of dealing with people who either enter through the asylum process or arrive at borders fleeing persecution.  Until such time as the Council gets its act together, we are moribund in trying to deal with that particular issue.  That is a significant problem.  I accept the criticism of it.  We are asking the Union to do something that the member states that make it up will not allow it to do.</p> <p>The European Green Deal, the Common Agricultural Policy, the biodiversity strategy, the farm to fork strategy, energy security, cybersecurity and the digital economy are all buzzwords and phrases, but at the end of the day what they are about in the coming years is that we are trying to define a policy that will shift our dependence on carbon emissions through to carbon neutrality.  We have targets for 2030 and 2050 as well.  We are bound by national legislation in terms of what Senators have passed in here, but also by our obligations under the Paris Agreement and the policies that were adopted by the European Parliament recently on the reduction in carbon emissions.</p> <p>In response to Senator Higgins, one of the issues in moving from where we are to where we want to be is that many countries, primarily in eastern Europe, are very dependent on coal and fossil fuels in general for generating electricity.  The question is if we can transition from where we are now to carbon neutrality by 2050 without using transition fuels like gas, for example.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Billy Kelleher:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a great debate around taxonomy and what would be included as sustainable or what would be excluded.  If certain issues are excluded, it may not be possible to transition, particularly for countries with economies that are significantly dependent on coal.  When we mention nuclear energy in this country and in this discussion, alarm bells are raised.  We also have to acknowledge that 12 member states either have nuclear energy or are developing it.  That is a significant number.</p><p>From our perspective in Ireland, one area where we are lethargic and could do a lot is biomethane and anaerobic digestion.  We could address some of the agricultural challenges we will have in the coming years and transition the economy by using solar, wind and biomethane energy as a way of fuelling transportation, for home heating, etc.  The rest of Europe is far ahead of us in this area, which would have a profound impact on agricultural production.  Waste from agriculture, municipal waste and other forms of waste we generate regularly would be used to make the transition.  That would be well within our remit if we could accept that it will play a significant role in the years ahead.</p></speech>

The European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 package have been the main focus of the European Union in recent years, at least until Russia threatened Ukraine.  The EU is the only unit in global politics to come up with a strategy for reducing emissions by such an amount.  The EU was also to the forefront at COP26 and so on.  The targets are in place, including in Fit for 55.  The EU is putting the policies together to achieve those targets and most of its work makes sense.</p> <p>Renewable energies are the future of energy and the sooner we have them, the sooner we will be able to wean ourselves off the various fossil fuels.  For this reason, our focus in Ireland should be on ensuring we can deploy renewables as quickly as possible.  I am working in this area.  I am a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I am the rapporteur for the energy performance of buildings directive and I was a rapporteur for the renewable energy directive.  As such, I have been deeply involved in this issue.</p> <p>We need to speed up the deployment of renewables.  One of my proposals, which I believe the EU will take on board, is that renewable projects should have a Fit for 55 label on them.  This would help projects to secure permits and planning quicker.  We know planning in Ireland is a nightmare, as several people in the wind industry have told me.  Those are the issues we need to focus on if we want to wean ourselves off fossil fuels as soon as possible.</p> <p>We are inclined to be idealistic.  We say we want renewables in the future, so we should get rid of fossil fuels in the meantime.  We have to keep the lights on and have energy.  How will we do that?  Gas is the cleanest of the fossil fuels by far.  We have seen the situation in Russia.  It does not make sense to be dependent on one gas pipeline from the United Kingdom, which is no longer bound by European Union rules.  We will need gas for 20 or 30 years, as even the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has said.  Gas infrastructure can be redeployed to take hydrogen, so that is another positive.</p> <p>We need two strategies.  First, we should speed up renewables and make it easier for people who want to invest in them to get their projects up and running.  A Fit for 55 label will help that.  Second, we should find out what we need in the meantime and make sure there is security for those who want to invest in the country.  Ordinary citizens should also know there will not be outages into the future.</p></speech>

We have severe problems with the way this regulation is being presented.  To call gas and nuclear sustainable mechanisms for creating energy is outrageous.</p></speech>

We need all the financial institutes and mechanisms to support that move.  However, if we decide to label nuclear and gas as green and sustainable energies, it will be a regressive step.  We will be on a backwards path and we will never get to where we need to go.  That is not only true for Ireland but for the EU.</p> <p>There are alternatives and the current regulation is absurd in my view.  We cannot call gas and nuclear sustainable.  They could go into some other category.  As a citizen of the EU which speaks of values, we will be getting our values wrong if we do that.  I hope the Irish Government will listen to what I am saying.  I have written to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and others to let them know our view on that.  We undoubtedly need the financing but we need it to be mobilised in the direction of real renewable energies.</p> <p>The Greens-European Free Alliance in the European Parliament was proactive on the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, waiver.  In a time of a grave global pandemic there is no question that a waiver should be put in place.  We will pursue that as far as we can.  As was said, this is about the values and morality of the EU.  We are not looking at a level playing field for everyone and we are allowing some to do better, which is not on.</p> <p>Senators asked so many questions and I am sorry we cannot address them all now.  Perhaps I will speak to Senators outside before I leave.</p></speech>

I do so from a practical point of view.  As I said, I have led, in many respects, the whole drive for renewables in Europe and to decarbonise our economy but gas is the best by far of the transition fuels.  We are hearing an awful lot about LNG.  It is coming from all over the world.  The alternative is to depend for power on Russia, which is madness at this stage.  Only yesterday the German Chancellor cancelled Nord Stream 2.  It was the right thing to do but it means less gas.  What are we going to do?  Should we turn the lights off and wait for the renewables to occur?  That is the practical alternative and is something that does not make sense.</p> <p>As Senator O'Sullivan said, 99% of people in north Kerry want this.  Are they all against climate change?  No, they are not.  However, if one goes down to the Shannon Estuary and looks at what is down there, one will see a massive trawler full of coal that has come from Russia to keep the lights on by having Moneypoint running on coal.  That is the alternative.  Does one want gas or coal?  That is the essential aspect.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</p></speech>

We want to progress towards neither because both are greenhouse gas emitters.  Mr. Kelly says we want to decarbonise our economy.  Unfortunately, it is more that just our economy.  It is society.  It is the very future or the planet we live on.</p> <p>I absolutely appreciate and respect very much what Senator O'Sullivan and Mr. Kelly said.  As a long-term activist pushing towards genuine sustainability, I mention the funding.  We should remember the European Investment Bank, EIB, has said it will not use the taxonomy as is.  The EIB will not use it as a classification system because it says it is flawed.  Thus, we have big investment institutes that are already saying this taxonomy regulation will not be fit for purpose before it has even got over the line.  We cannot even let it get to that line.</p> <p>The point I am trying to make and will continue to make is we need all our efforts, all the funding mechanisms, and all the legislation and initiative coming through the Government to push towards renewable energy.  I am aware this is the so-called transition stage but we must ensure the investment is in clean renewables.  As we have said - and I heard this when I was in school way back in the 1970s - we have the natural resources.  We have the wind and the waves.  We have capacity.  However, if we do not get a move on, climate change will overwhelm us.  We see it in our climate patterns.  We see the writing is on the wall.  The glaciers are melting to the north in the Arctic and to the south in the Antarctic.  We are in for extreme problems if we do not get a move on.</p></speech>

As was already pointed out, legislation was passed in this House with regard to our climate change obligations.  LNG will in my view be a significant component in the transition.  I am working on a file on green bonds, whereby the funding of the transition will be classified.  Certainly, the issues of nuclear and gas were and are very contentious in Europe.  Bear in mind, as I said already, many countries either have nuclear or are building it.  France recently announced it is going to build six to 12 new nuclear reactors over the next number of years.</p> <p>From the point of view of Ballylongford and the development there, we must accept we are very lethargic in our ability to get issues through planning processes, be they wind farms, the Ballylongford development or major infrastructure developments.  Everybody has a right and entitlement to object but we should at least have a streamlined process that is not dragged out for years and years.  Something we seem to be very good at in this country is the continual appeals process right through, as we saw recently, to the Supreme Court etc.  We need, therefore, to streamline that process.</p> <p>We must accept we will need LNG in the short to medium term while we build up our capacity in renewables.  This will mainly be through wind but also solar, anaerobic digestion, methane and hydrogen.  Ballylongford or other similar developments will be part of that.  When we are developing these projects we must do so mindful they are short term in terms of dependence on LNG and that they are strategically developed for the longer-term use of biomethanes and for other forms of gas generated through sustainability.  That is in my view the critical component when we are developing these.</p> <p>I am aware that Ballylongford and others have looked at the idea that in the short term they are using LNG but that in the long term they would be technologically suitable to be converted to biomethanes.  That is really the debate we should be having.  We all accept we must get to carbon neutrality by 2050.  The question is whether we accept it is going to be a difficult journey or pretend it is going to be very easy.</p></speech>

I welcome my three good colleagues and friends to the Chamber.  It is a great privilege to have them here.  I especially acknowledge Mr. Kelly for his long service and for achieving MEP of the Year.  I raise with the MEPs the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  What is their view on Ireland's ratification of that and the fact the optional protocol has not as yet been activated here?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How is the UNCRPD progressing in other European countries?  Is there a shining example of best practice in its implementation from which we can glean learnings?  What country in Europe would the MEPs identify as one the Government should view as the standard bearer?  What do they think the European Parliament can do to improve equality of access for people with disabilities, especially in the area of employment?  In this country, 80% of persons with disabilities find themselves having great difficulty gaining access to employment.  This is a major issue that needs to be addressed at European level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.115" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Billy Kelleher" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#EE00200"><p>One of the difficulties we have is a lot of employment rights legislation is still a member state competency.  We have had this difficulty in Ireland for many years when it comes to accessibility for people with disabilities to employment, in addition to many other services.  We have not adopted and ratified in full the UNCRPD.  Other countries have not done so either, but the point is that the legislation which underpins this is primarily a national competency.  We have been singularly slow in trying to ensure that services are in place and there are rights and obligations.  Even in the Civil Service and the public service, we have failed many times in the context of the number of people with disabilities who are employed in the public service in this country.  Accessibility, not just physical accessibility but accessibility to services, is something on which we have a lot of work to do.</p> <p>The countries that do it best are primarily Nordic.  Sweden and Finland, for example, have exceptional systems of rights for people with disabilities.  We should just take the good that has been done in those countries in terms of legislation and obligations on employers, for example, the public service, to ensure people with disabilities have access to services and employment, in addition to parity.  That is an area where we need to do a lot of work.</p> <p>The European Parliament has consistently called for the full adoption of the UNCPRD, as it has for conventions on many issues, including women's rights and the areas of disability and migrant rights.  However, member states - I keep saying this but it is not to pass the buck - consistently state this is an issue of subsidiarity and the member state will decide.  The Council is slow to grant these particular concessions to move all these areas to where there is uniformity throughout the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.116" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Grace O'Sullivan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#EE00300"><p>I thank the Senator for his question.  When the issue of disability is raised, two things spring to my mind.  One is accessing services for people with disabilities, but also accessing services for carers and people who work with people with disabilities.  It is an area that is very close to my heart as my daughter, aged 30, has intellectual and physical disabilities.  I am worn out and very disappointed by the lack of services and opportunities for people with disabilities in this country, especially in the area of residential support and care, where I know there are families who are at their wits' end trying to get support services for their family members.  In addition, carers who apply for the carer's allowance or carer's benefit are waiting months and months before they receive remuneration for the hours they are doing.  The hours they are being remunerated for are only a fraction of the actual hours they are doing; you know that and I know that.</p> <p>The Green Party group in the European Parliament, which I am part of, is very active in the area of trying to get acknowledgement of, and recognition for, the needs of people with disabilities.  We always talk as if this is a level playing field.  There is no level playing field for people with disabilities, be those physical or intellectual.  They are, unfortunately, on the back foot and it is just not good enough.</p></speech>

He is an example of how to overcome a disability and have a very successful political career, which he is to be complimented on.  I remember when I became uachtar&aacute;n of the GAA, one of the first things I was privileged to do was host the Special Olympics in Croke Park. It was the first time they were held outside the United States.  There is a legacy from that, especially as regards sport, etc., and an awareness of what can be done, particularly at local level.  There is an awful lot being done at local level in the area of the Special Olympics and, internationally, Mary Davis has spoken in that regard.</p> <p>I have come across other areas that should be complimented.  One is the question of social farming.  Senator O'Sullivan will know that I visited a place in his neck of the woods in Ballybunion, where people with Down's syndrome went to different farms for one day a week and did some work.  It was a highlight in their lives.  A lot can be done in that regard.  Another area I found interesting came up when I attended a seminar a few years ago at European level on tourism for those with disabilities.  One point that was strongly made, which struck me, is we are talking about putting facilities in place for those with disabilities, but have we actually consulted with them?  That is another thing.  Ireland could give the lead in that regard and I would like to see it happening.  We are good in many ways, but we can do an awful lot.  I agree with Ms O'Sullivan on that, and on the issues of access and employment.  We should ask people what they need rather than doing what we think they might need.</p> <p>Senator Conway's point is very important.  It tests our humanitarianism and our genuine respect for treating everybody equally, but we have to consult with people and then take on board what they do, primarily at national level.  There is very good legislation at European level, but only last week we discussed going back to full participation in the Parliament and one of the things said was that everybody would have to speak from the rostrum.  Somebody asked whether we had allowed for people with disabilities and how they were going to get to the rostrum.  We have to be more aware of this issue in every aspect.</p></speech>

E. Claire Cronin.  The ambassador is distinguished in many ways as she was the first woman to be the majority leader in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.  Her great-uncle served in the House of Representatives.  Her uncle served in the military during the Second World War, in addition to serving in the House of Representatives, and was also the mayor of Brockton, Massachusetts.  I know the ambassador is looking forward to her time in Ireland and that she will represent her country with great distinction while she is here.  We look forward to deepening the relationships between Ireland and the United States.  I imagine that there is no place more Irish than Boston, especially in March.  We are grateful for the ambassador's presence in the Chamber and for her service as a legislator in the United States of America.  We look forward to her service here as an ambassador.  I thank her for coming.</p> <p>We have before us other distinguished guests I will point out to the ambassador.  They include members of the European Parliament; former Senator and now MEP Grace O'Sullivan, Se&aacute;n Kelly MEP, who was also president of the GAA - I do not know which is a more taxing job, being an MEP or a president of the GAA - and a previous Senator of this House at the tender age of 25, Billy Kelleher, now an MEP, and a former Deputy and Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">An Cathaoirleach:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are being questioned by Senators, inclusive of the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, who is next to address the MEPs.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to remind the MEPs that the most northerly county in their constituency, County Offaly, is one of those counties most challenged by our economic decarbonisation.  This is not conjecture; it is fact.  It has been widely and well documented, most recently in the Indecon report 2021.  I am asking that the MEPs do everything in their power at this final stage to ensure the just transition submission reflects the special case for Offaly, as has been widely highlighted to date.  I would welcome their support on that.</p></speech>

She has our full support on that.  It is critically important that we recognise that any transition has to be a fair and just and that we leave nobody behind.</p> <p>I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister of State legislation I worked on in regard to the eighth environment action programme.  In the European Union, there has been no law or directive on soil health.  I know this is of interest to the Minister of State.  I recently managed to get the eighth environment action programme over the line.  It will be signed off and voted on in plenary in Strasbourg next month.  I managed to put into that programme the deadline of 2023 in respect of which we would have soil regulation in the European Union.  It amazes me that we have legislation on air quality and clean water but we have no legislation on soil and soil health.  That will be critically important as we go forward.  We will have this legislation by 2023.  As MEPs in the European Parliament, we will collaborate to make sure it is sound and robust and that it will recognise the importance of carbon sequestration and how healthy soil helps to sequest.</p> <p>A Senator mentioned the importance of food and how we grow it.  The Minister of State is, I know, pushing very hard to ensure we increase our organic production.  As she has often stated, it is through having the right tree in the right place that we will see more healthy forestry.  To grow that food and those trees, we will need healthy soil.  I am very proud that by 2023 we will have legislation on soil in the EU.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.122" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#FF00400"><p>I agree with the Minister of State on the need for a just transition fund.  When it was first brought in by the European Parliament a few years ago, it was designed for the coal regions, especially in Poland and other places like that.  The rapporteur happened to be the former Polish Prime Minister, Jerzy Buzek, who is a very good friend of mine, and I raised with him the need to include the peatlands as well in order that it would apply to Ireland.  In fairness, he took it on board.  We now have to make sure it works.  The idea is that nobody should be left behind, especially communities.  Where it is necessary to close an emissions burning factory, we have to make sure the community is not left behind.  That is the purpose of the just transition fund.</p> <p>Ms O'Sullivan referred to forestry and so forth.  I know the Minister of State is working hard on that and has made a big improvement in the area but it is farcical and almost embarrassing at European level for Ireland to set a target for forestry of 8,000 ha per annum and then achieve only 2,000 ha in that regard.  It is not the farmers' fault or the investors' fault.  They are ready and willing to plant the forests, but they are being held back by complicated or unnecessary regulation or legislation that has been introduced over the years.  That is a fact.  Many sought to put the blame for this on Europe but research shows that it does not apply in many of the European countries.  I agree with the Minister of State that we need to have more forests and reduce red tape.  She will need support to do that.  It will not be possible for her to do it on her own.  The Government needs to set a target of 8,000 ha for delivery next year and it must seek to achieve that target.  That would be a plus.  It would help to reduce emissions.</p> <p>I agree also with the Minister of State that the foresters and not the state should own the carbon.</p></speech>

It was specifically for the purpose of transitioning from coal to cleaner fuels, as mentioned by Mr. Kelly and others who are involved from the European perspective.  I recall that Deputy Barry Cowen lobbied the previous Commission intensely on this issue.  He engaged a great deal with the Commission to ensure peatlands were included.</p> <p>When Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, which is further north, were wound down in terms of electricity generation, that had an immediate impact on people in the sense that their livelihoods were taken from them but there was nothing immediate in place to ensure there was a fair transition.  There was a reduction in peat harvesting and the re-wetting of bogs, primarily in Offaly.  Any assessment must accept that Offaly is the county most affected.  When I met local authority members from Offaly and others my concern was that we would have a scattergun approach, politically we would try to include everybody and just transition would not have a meaningful impact on any particular community that was very much affected by the closure of peat burning facilities and the cessation of peat harvesting.  For all of those reasons, I also hope the just transition fund is fair and does what it is meant to do, that is, assess the impact on communities when we decarbonise fossil fuels.  When we take them out of the equation, we must have in place training and job opportunities and infrastructural developments that will transition people's lives as well.  I hope that will be the case.</p> <p>When I met the groups, I expressed the concern that we were trying to include everybody and every area in the just transition and it specifically was not for that purpose.  The sum of &euro;85 million was eventually made available, with matching funds from the Irish Government.  I hope that will go to the areas most affected, which by any assessment is Offaly in terms of the impact decarbonisation is having on that area.</p></speech>

I was following the debate from my office and I picked up on one or two points in Senator Higgins's contribution, which, owing to time constraints, were not addressed in the responses.  I will reiterate some of those points.  On the proposed EU legislation on business and human rights, which includes due diligence on supply chains, I ask that the MEPs speak directly to what this would mean in regard to goods from illegal settlements, scope 3 emissions, responsibility for the management of precious minerals and the embodied energy in buildings, which may be specifically of interest to Ms O'Sullivan who, during her time here with the Civil Engagement Group, tabled legislation on vacant and derelict sites.</p></speech>

I want to put that on the record.</p><p>On the occupied territories, it is very interesting to be a member of the Green group in the European Parliament, to be on the delegation on Palestine and to see how difficult it is within the EU.  I am being very honest and frank about this.  I felt much more progressive here in this Chamber talking about Palestine and the occupied territories, the supply chain and the opportunity for sanctions and so on than I do in the European Parliament.  I find it much more difficult to try to mobilise support around the position of the Senator and her colleague Senator Black and that of the Civil Engagement Group, which adopted a strong and vocal position here and the introduction of highly progressive legislation.  It is quite remarkable to see how Ireland is very much championing the Palestinian cause.  It is difficult for the Government to balance it sometimes.  It is of huge public interest here in Ireland partly because of our own culture and how we identify with the Palestinian people and their cause.  I have to be honest and say that it is difficult in the European Union.  The drive that comes from here and from this Chamber is really important.  It gives us opportunities.  I was able to bring Senator Black over to the European Parliament to meet some key people there.  We area a nation that is well thought of diplomatically.  I would ask colleagues to forge on and really push the issue here at home because that gives us strength in the European Parliament to push from there.</p></speech>

This has been raised numerous times in the European Parliament itself.  Josep Borrell, the High Commissioner, has said that he has no objections to us ensuring that we bring in some form of ban on goods coming from occupied territories.  Of course, when we try to get traction on it, some member states are vehemently opposed to it.  That may be for historical reasons but that is no comfort to the Palestinian people.  I visited Palestine and sponsored a Bill through the D&aacute;il on the occupied territories before I left the House.  It is a different conflict but I note Donetsk and Luhansk are both being sanctioned and products coming from those two regions that have been illegally occupied by the Russians may have goods banned from them.  That being the case for Donetsk and Luhansk, that is, being unable to export product to the European Union, I would say that the same should be for Palestine.  I am very much of that view.  I acknowledge the conflict in Ukraine is an immediate and massive issue but the Palestinian issue has been dragging on for so long.</p> <p>When I visited Ramallah and met the Palestinian representative bodies, they had the Tricolour flying that day.  They really believed that this was a symbolic gesture and that the world was listening.  Unfortunately while the world may listen, partially, it has done nothing  to address the situation.  I believe that one or two large countries in the European Union are vehemently opposed to any sanctions on the occupied territories.  That is for historical reasons.  Germany is one, for example, and it simply does not want to discuss this matter.  But we do have to discuss it.  We owe that much to the Palestinian people.  In the Parliament itself, there is an appetite for it.  What we need to do is unlock the big member states. </p></speech>

It is a very difficult situation because it goes against the grain of the European Union which was founded on the principles of peace, prosperity, fairness and human rights to have any place having an advantage in exporting goods to the EU or getting benefits that they should not have.  It is something that we often discuss in Parliament.  Mr. Kelleher is right.  We can vote for something in Parliament but it must be implemented by the Council too and it includes those who will be opposed for different reasons.  There is no question around the Parliament standing up for human rights.  Every single month, when we go to Strasbourg we have Urgency Resolution debates where we discuss the abuse of human rights around the world.  For instance, a week ago we had an Urgency Resolution debate about the Philippines where we asked that the generalised scheme of preferences plus, GSP+, on being able to export goods to the EU without tariffs would be withdrawn.  That was passed unanimously, almost, by the Parliament.  It is not often you get unanimity in Parliament because there are so many diverse groups.  However, when it comes to human rights we are broad-minded and strong on it, I think.  The same applies to China and the Uyghurs.  People do not want to see places that are exploiting people or engaging in forced labour and so on having an advantage.  There is an increased focus on it now particularly since the pandemic.  Hopefully it can be done collectively and incorporating the Palestinian situation, as Billy Kelleher and Grace O'Sullivan said.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Kelly on the commitment shown by our MEPs on human rights in particular.  I really dislike the title of the programme, Fit For 55.  It sounds like a seniors exercise class at my local gym.  If there was one change possible, I would ask for that.</p> <p>Our MEPs work very effectively together at EU level particularly on certain issues as we have seen here.  However, I want to raise the elephant in the room, which is the stance taken by certain of our MEPs.  Their support for dictators and regimes that oppress human rights is deeply concerning.  Particularly in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the decision of some Irish MEPs to effectively stand up for what has happened is deeply wrong.  We in this Chamber have called it out.  I ask those here as Members of the European Parliament to equally call out not only the Irish MEPs but also those right around the Continent who do so.</p></speech>

We have discussed many things today.  Will our guests give an overview of where they think CAP reform is going?  It is probably the most important legislation for the agricultural community.  It has gone back from the European Parliament to the Commission.  Are the Members happy with where they think the new proposals are going?  Some Members voted for the proposals and some against.  It is probably the most significant package of measures brought forward for farming for the next decade.</p> <p>I refer to the just transition and the transition away from gas.  That has been debated well today.  Looking at Cork, it is a hub for energy, particularly gas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The need for us to have a policy that is more appropriate to the current needs of our society, in particular over the short term, is very important.</p></speech>

It has been a very worthwhile discussion.  To follow on from what Senator Malcolm Byrne said, I ask that they call out some of their colleagues, who went a different route in terms of supporting Russia and others.</p> <p>I was at the launch of a regional enterprise plan last Friday for the mid-west region of Tipperary, Clare and Limerick.  The region has recorded the highest employment growth in the country.  I think it was more than 13%, which is very positive.  They spoke about opportunities that region and Ireland south, in general, have.  They spoke in terms of Foynes and Shannon.  The T&aacute;naiste has set up a Shannon Estuary economic task force to look at the opportunities for the region.  I am very interested in their take on what the Government and the European Parliament can do to support that.</p> <p>This is a good opportunity to raise my last point, given how the discussions have gone.  Mr. Kelly has spoken before about a hydrogen strategy.  Will he take the opportunity to expand on that?</p></speech>

On that basis, they will have six minutes each, which I am sure is more than adequate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Billy Kelleher" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#HH00400"><p>In response to Senator Malcolm Byrne, we have consistently called those members out in the sense that we normally vote against them on these issues.  I refer to Irish MEPs.  There is a body of MEPs out there and what is strange that they come from both the extreme left and extreme right and seem to coalesce around this issue of support for Russia, China and others who champion the abuse of human rights.  That is a significant challenge.  I am rarely on the same page, in terms of voting, with members who propose those viewpoints.  We have to consistently highlight the fact that these are not representative of the overall views of Irish people, the Government and Irish elected representatives.</p> <p>Of course, we live in a democracy.  We do not want to sanction free speech.  At the same time, however, we are obligated to exercise our views and to ensure they are heard as well, in terms of condemning the actions of countries that those MEPs support, such as Russia, Iran and other countries in which there are horrendous cases of human rights abuses.  We must always condemn them, as well as those who support and advocate for them.  We consistently do so.</p> <p>With regard to Senator Lombard's views on CAP reform and just transition, the CAP reform is probably the most significant policy to be published.  Two things will underpin it.  First and foremost is the strategic plan that will be presented by the Government to the European Commission and whether that will be approved in the coming days.  The CAP proposal, which came from the European Parliament and was eventually agreed last year, allowed member states certain flexibility.  Of course, when one gives member states flexibility, one gives them choices and when one gives them choices, people have different opinions as to where those priorities should be.  That was always an issue.  Convergence, the capping of payments and complementary redistributed income support for sustainability, CRISS, payments are contentious in Ireland.</p> <p>However, from a CAP perspective, the real issues that will impact on farming in the years ahead, leaving aside market volatility, which we see with pig farmers, though we also see positivities at present in terms of beef, sheep, milk and cereal prices, are the biodiversity and farm to fork strategies that will flow from CAP.  They will have very stringent obligations on farming.</p> <p>That is why I go back to the issue around just transition.  The single biggest opportunity for the Irish agricultural industry and, potentially, the single biggest failing for the Government, if it does not act on it, will be the need to embrace anaerobic digestion and to incentivise and encourage investment in those areas in order that we mitigate the impacts agriculture will have on the environment.  It is a win-win.  Germany, France, Denmark, the Netherlands and many other countries are light years ahead of us on that issue.  We very much need to advocate for that.  It is in our control and we can do so.</p> <p>With regard to the issue of the Shannon Estuary and what can be done, I was very disappointed that Equinor left the market for wind energy, but I do see significant opportunities on the west coast for deepwater wind energy generation.  The science and technology is there.  We need to ensure we streamline planning and permission processes in place, as Mr. Kelly outlined, in order that investors have confidence they can get in here and they know, after a number of years, they will either get permission or not to go ahead with something.  However, investors will not stay around for ten, 12 or 14 years waiting for permission to be granted.  They will go elsewhere.</p> <p>Foynes is strategically located from the perspective of servicing and maintenance of offshore wind energy.  Of course, it is centred around the University of Limerick with Galway up the road, and Cork down the road.  The south-west and west regions are ripe for opportunity.  One has Shannon Airport, the University of Limerick, Foynes deepwater port, the estuary and potential in Ballylongford and all the other areas feeding in there.</p> <p>It should and will be a hive of business activity in the years ahead.  However, we cannot have the continued prevarication around the granting of strategic planning permissions.  They must be streamlined.  People should have their right and entitlement to object but it cannot go on indefinitely, which is the case at present.  </p> <p>I thank the Members.  It is nice to come back to see this House.  I have very fond memories of the place.  Certainly, what the Seanad does in terms of advocating or holding to account, observing and scrutinising legislation that flows from Europe is a very significant issue.  As was said at the outset, some 60% to 70% of the legislation that is enacted through this House will have come from the promptings of the European Union, through policy, directive or regulation.  That is quite a significant amount of legislation.</p> <p>We are in a new dispensation in our relationship with Europe.  We are post Brexit.  We will have to be more alert around the issues that are of strategic importance to Ireland.  We saw that in terms of the corporation tax.  The UK left and very soon the pressure would come on countries that were holding the line on the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  We have to be more assertive and more strategic in Europe.  The Seanad plays a significant role in that in terms of keeping us to account, keeping us informed and scrutinising policies from the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#HH00500"><p>I agree completely with Senator Malcolm Byrne.  We had a debate and vote on Russia and Ukraine in the European Parliament before Christmas.  Some 548 MEPs voted in favour, 69 voted against and 54 abstained.  Of the Irish MEPs, seven of 13 voted in favour.  That does not send a great message to our friends in Ukraine and is worth looking at.  I will leave it at that because anybody who is any way sane will see that what Russia is doing to Ukraine is totally off the charts.</p> <p>I compliment Senator Lombard on his good work on CAP and so forth.  I agree with Mr. Kelleher.  We have not emphasised enough the opportunities for farmers to improve in their performance.  First, we cannot have a situation where emissions go up.  Second, emissions have to come down by at least 22% and it is hoped, by more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are areas that are not being exploited enough to make this happen.  One is the area of solar panels on the massive sheds we have throughout the country.  Mr. Kelleher is absolutely right with regard to anaerobic digestion.  It would solve a lot of problems.  There could be one in almost every parish.  It would be a huge factor in reducing emissions for farmers.  Of course we also have practices such as genetics, protected urea etc.  All of these measures can help.  Something that must be made clear is the vast majority of farmers are farming because they like farming.  They like the land.  They do not want to be in a position where they are destroying the environment.  It is a question of putting the measures in place to help them improve the situation.  The bottom line is that emissions have to come down.</p><p>Senator Ahearn asked a very good question.  What he spoke about is a huge opportunity.  I am delighted the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, announced a task force for the area.  It is something he promised in the programme for Government almost two years ago.  It is very encouraging.  It has great opportunities.  Let us look at the positives.  We all want renewable energy and we want it 100% renewable but it will take time.  Senator Ahearn mentioned planning, as did I.  Senator Malcolm Byrne does not agree with the Fit for 55 label but it is there and we have to live with it.</p><p>Offshore wind off the west coast is off the charts with potential but we need the infrastructure at the coast to harness it.  Shannon Foynes Port has everything going for it.  It is one of the deepest seawater ports in Europe at 32 m deep.  It needs no dredging.  It has natural dredging.  There are great advantages there.  The chief executive officer, Pat Keating, and others have done huge work.  It has benefited from European funds including the Cohesion Fund.  A lot more than LNG would be able to come in once the gas is brought in.  There is also a pile of ancillary industries that could be brought forward.  They could use gas to get rid of the coal in Moneypoint.  It could also transfer in due course to hydrogen and biogas.  The offshore wind could also be used for hydrogen.  All of this has huge potential.  It would take in Senator Ahearn's county of Tipperary and all the places around it because it would have a knock-on effect.  These are the main points that have been mentioned and I will leave it at that.  I thank the Seanad and the Cathaoirleach for the invitation.  It was wonderful to be here.  Today's discussion with us reflects the wisdom of the Irish people in saying they wanted to retain the Seanad.  It has taken the criticism on board.  It has brought a positive new dimension and image to the Seanad and long may it continue to do so.</p></speech>

I wish there was gender balance across both Houses and across local government in Ireland.  I hope it is something we will strive towards.  We must strive towards it as we need gender equality.  It is very important.</p> <p>I will begin by responding to Senator Malcolm Byrne.  Reputation is everything.  We do our best as members of the European Parliament to represent those who voted for us.  As Mr. Kelleher said, we are living in a democracy.  I would say that at times when I speak in the Parliament my colleagues here are cringing.  We are there to represent our views.  The specific point the Senator raised is interesting.  No names were mentioned but I know what he was referring to.  Sometimes within the MEPs' own political groups there might not be agreement with how some members vote and behave.  I always like to strive toward working in collaboration.  Perhaps following on from the Senator's point, there is a job for Irish MEPs to spend some time together and to discuss various issues.</p> <p>Covid has been difficult and there is no doubt about it.  We have not met in person.  Formerly Mr. Kelly used to meet Irish delegations.  We really have not had that opportunity.  We had one meeting at which we were all together.  It was convened by the former Commissioner, Phil Hogan.  Mentioning Mr. Hogan, so much water has gone under the bridge since then.  That was the only time we really met as a collective.  As I have said, reputation is everything and at times it is important that we sing from the same hymn sheet.  Others have their opportunities and their own sets of values.  We can vote in certain ways and then we sit back and watch.</p> <p>Senator Lombard mentioned the CAP.  Everything we do, certainly in the parliamentary group of which the Green Party is a member, is in the context of the climate and biodiversity crisis.  Inasmuch as we did not vote for the CAP because we did not feel it was ambitious enough in the context of the Paris Agreement, nevertheless there are very good initiatives within the biodiversity strategy set out by the European Commission and in the farm to fork strategy.  We hope Ireland will take the best view on climate, biodiversity and supporting farmers.  There is no doubt about this.  I agree with Mr. Kelly.  I have always said that farmers are the custodians of the land.  They want the best but they may need to be supported in this regard within the context of rising greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity.  It is very important that we recognise the context we are working in.  For me having the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, at the table is very welcome given that her background is in running a family farm.</p> <p>A just transition goes without saying.  One of the areas on which I have worked very hard in recent months in the European Parliament is on a well-being economy in order that we move beyond GDP.  We see that GDP and the way we are operating at present serve neither the people nor the planet.  Other countries, such as New Zealand, Iceland and several others, are taking the lead in this regard.  They are becoming well-being economies.  They look at the well-being of the people and not just economic growth without the context of why we are trying to float our economy as high as we possibly can.  We have to look at how we are doing it and not the why, and how it is impacting on people's health.  From a Green perspective, we are looking at climate adaptation.  Here in Ireland, it is a question of how do we adapt to rising sea levels and changing temperatures.  How do we mitigate?  We must also look at a circular economy and how we are doing business so we do not create waste just to dispose of it but that we create an environment where all resources are looked at in a circular fashion.</p> <p>Another point that is very important for my group in the European Parliament is the area of production and consumption, how we produce things and how we consume.  Something we are consuming at a very high rate is energy.  It is not enough to say we will keep pumping in energy resources.  We also have to look at how we can mitigate and work with citizens, particularly younger people who are leading the charge.  They are saying to us we cannot sustain our lifestyles as we are doing and that we will have to reform.  They are leading on this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Grace O'Sullivan, MEP:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have to get in behind the young people in terms of consumption and drive down areas where there are inefficiencies.  That is just a good business model.  In regard to Senator Ahearn's region, both Mr. Kelly and Mr. Kelleher have spoken very well on that.  Without a doubt there are significant opportunities in the Clare, Shannon and Tipperary region, as well as offshore.  The potential of offshore renewable energy offers great opportunities.</p></speech>

That is heartening in the context not only of Seanad reform but of the European project and our links to Europe.  That is important.</p> <p>The second thing, and it makes me proud when I say this very genuinely, and I think I reflect the thinking of everyone in the room, is that we can be so proud of the quality of the people who are representing us in the European Parliament, and their depth of knowledge, vision and capacity for collegiality when the Irish flag needs to be flown.  I am certainly very proud, as is everyone else here, with the quality of people.

The Assembly shall consider,<i>inter alia</i>:   	- the international, European, national, regional and local dimensions to the biodiversity emergency; structures best suited for Dublin, and to bring forward proposals in that regard; the Assembly shall consider, <i>inter alia</i>:<br /><br />- the strengths and weaknesses of the current model of local government in Dublin;<br /><br />- the potential benefits, risks, challenges and opportunities associated with a directly elected Mayor for Dublin;<br /><br />- what functions could be transferred from central government to regional or local government in Dublin, and how this should be funded;<br /><br />- the appropriate structure for local and regional government, councils and authorities, looking at models in other capital cities (e.g. a single elected Dublin authority with a mayor and no local councils, a two-tier structure like London or Paris with a mayor, regional assembly and local or borough councils, or a mayoral structure like Greater Manchester with a &lsquo;super&rsquo; mayor sitting above the existing local authorities); and<br /><br />- the perspectives of the general public, representative groups, advocacy groups, the sitting councillors of the 4 local authorities, the Dublin <i>Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la</i>and Members of the European Parliament, local authority senior officials and staff, experts and policy makers;and notes that the Assemblies shall:<br /><br />- commence and run in parallel;<br /><br />- hold their inaugural meetings in April 2022;<br /><br />- adopt work programmes designed to allow for the completion of consideration of the topics within an eight-month period;<br /><br />- conclude their work and submit their Reports ideally no later than nine months from their respective dates of commencement, and sooner if possible;<br /><br />- have authority to determine a revised timeline for completion in the event of unexpected disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic or other extraordinary circumstances;<br /><br />- implement continuous improvement and adopt innovative working methods informed by learnings from previous Citizens&rsquo; Assemblies and international best practice, including in relation to the methodology for member recruitment, to the running of Assemblies subject to public<br /><br />health measures, and to developing internal capacity to ensure the quality of the deliberative process;<br /><br />- preclude from membership of the Assemblies any individual who is either: <blockquote> 	(i) a politician currently serving in either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament;<br /><br />(ii) a lobbyist as provided for under the Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015; or<br /><br />(iii) a person unwilling to commit to adhering to public health measures as prescribed by Government and public health authorities from time to time; </blockquote>- have separate Chairpersons appointed to each Assembly, each for a period of up to twelve months, with scope to extend the term should circumstances warrant, and that an honorarium should be paid to each Chairperson based on a <i>per diem</i>rate to be sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform;<br /><br />- make payment of a nominal honorarium to Assembly members to recognise their civic commitment; <br /><br />- have staff assigned to provide a Secretariat to the Assemblies and to support the Chairpersons;<br /><br />- agree their own rules of procedure and work programmes to enable the effective conduct of their business in as economical and efficient a manner as possible;<br /><br />- determine all issues by a majority of the votes of members present and voting, other than the Chairperson who will have a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes;<br /><br />- operate in an open and transparent manner, including by live streaming public proceedings; and<br /><br />- make a report and recommendation(s) to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the matters before them; on receipt, the Houses of the Oireachtas will refer each report for consideration to a relevant Committee of both Houses; the Committees will, in turn, bring their conclusions to the Houses of the Oireachtas for debate; furthermore, the Government will provide in the Houses of the Oireachtas a response to each recommendation of the Assemblies and, if accepting some or all of the recommendations, will indicate the timeframe it envisages for implementing those recommendations.  </blockquote></speech>

Over the past decade, citizens' assemblies have become established as an important part of the Irish democratic process, with previous forums making recommendations on a variety of matters including marriage equality, the eighth amendment, climate change and, most recently, gender equality.  The views expressed by citizens' assemblies have on a number of occasions led to constitutional change and significant enhancements to the State in which we live and the way we live our lives.</p> <p>Ireland is widely regarded as a world leader in deliberative democracy.  Over the past ten years we have welcomed dozens of international visitors to our shores keen to learn from our experience of citizens' assemblies.  I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many hundreds of ordinary citizens, the academic community and Members of the Oireachtas who played a central role in the previous assemblies for their hard work and their commitment to public service.</p> <p>The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future contains a commitment to progress the establishment of a number of new citizens' assemblies, including on biodiversity loss, drugs use, the future of education and the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited to Dublin.  The most recent citizens' assembly, which was on gender equality, concluded its work and published its report in June 2021.  In the intervening period, the Covid-19 pandemic has meant that it has not been possible until now to arrange for the establishment and running of further assemblies.  The easing of public health restrictions announced on 21 January means that it is once again possible to plan for the running of citizens' assemblies with in-person meetings.</p> <p>On Tuesday, 8 February, the Government agreed to the establishment of two citizens' assemblies, one dealing with biodiversity loss and the other with the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.  It is the Government's intention that these two assemblies will be quickly followed by two further assemblies on drugs use and the future of education.</p> <p>Today, on behalf of the Government, I am pleased to bring forward to Seanad &Eacute;ireann this motion approving the establishment of the citizens' assembly on biodiversity loss and a Dublin citizens' assembly.  The issues to be considered by these assemblies are important and Government wants to move with some urgency to get both assemblies up and running.  It is envisaged that the inaugural meeting of the assemblies will take place in April this year, with the assemblies concluding their work and submitting their reports, ideally by the end of the year at the latest or earlier if possible.  This will be the first time that two assemblies will run concurrently.  Naturally, it will give rise to some logistical challenges, but it can also be seen as an opportunity to design an operational model that can allow for a greater number of citizens' assemblies to run in the future.</p> <p>It is envisaged that a citizens' assembly on drug use will follow these two assemblies, with the intention of running it concurrently with an assembly on the future of education.  It is the Government's intention to establish these next two assemblies at the earliest opportunity.</p> <p>The sequencing of the citizens' assemblies does not indicate or imply a hierarchy of importance.  It is, however, a clear recognition that each of the four assemblies committed to in the programme for Government need adequate time, space and resources to operate as the high-quality deliberative forums that they are intended to be.  To rush the work of the assemblies or to run too many concurrently would only serve to diminish the quality of the deliberative process, to undervalue the commitment of the members who give of their time to serve on the assemblies and, ultimately, to determine the credibility of the assemblies.</p> <p>The motion before the Seanad calls for both assemblies to conclude their work and submit their reports no later than nine months from their date of establishment and earlier if possible.  If, as envisaged, they get under way in April, they should ideally have reported to the Oireachtas by December at the latest and earlier if possible.  Should one or both of the assemblies submit their reports earlier than December, there is every prospect of getting at least one of the next citizens' assemblies up and running later this year.  Any decision on the establishment of the citizens' assemblies on drug use and on the future of education will, of course, will be subject to a Government decision and resolutions of D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann at that time.</p> <p>The motion before the House proposes that the assemblies should, like those that preceded them, report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which, on receipt of the final reports of the assemblies, will refer those to relevant Oireachtas committees for consideration.  In addition, it is proposed that the Government will provide, in the Houses of the Oireachtas, a response to the recommendations of the assembly and an indication of a proposed course of action.</p> <p>Eligibility for membership of the assemblies is wider than before.  For the first time, it will go beyond the electoral register to include all residents in the State.  This new initiative opens up the membership to non-Irish and those normally hard-to-reach groups who, for a variety of reasons, are not on the electoral register.  All residents in this country are affected by the issues to be considered and I am certain that these new representatives will add to the diversity of the group and make a valuable contribution to the proceedings.</p> <p>The use of polling companies to recruit the assembly members on the three previous occasions in the past ten years posed significant logistical and administrative challenges and occasionally resulted in suboptimal outcomes.  In line with best international practice, it is proposed that on this occasion recruitment will be done by a mailing campaign, with 20,000 randomly selected households invited to apply to participate in the biodiversity loss assembly and 14,000 invited to partake in the Dublin assembly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jack Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2429"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2429&amp;amp;pid=JackChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From those who respond indicating a willingness to take part, members will be selected on the basis of gender, age, geography and a number of other factors to ensure they are broadly representative of wider society.  We have learned much from the experience of previous assemblies and I am confident this change in approach will greatly enhance the quality of the random selection methodology.</p><p>The citizens' assembly on biodiversity loss will include an independent chairperson and 99 members of the general public selected using a stratified random selection process based on the GeoDirectory of households across the country.  The Dublin citizens' assembly will include an independent chairperson and 67 members of the general public, again selected using a stratified random selection process based on the GeoDirectory of households in Dublin city and county.  It will also include a total of 12 councillors from across the four local authorities in Dublin, bringing the total membership of that assembly to 80.  I am sure the inclusion of councillors will add to the quality of deliberation and that the other members will benefit greatly from their strategic and operational experience at all levels of local government.  Similar to the first constitutional convention, where the membership comprised one third politicians, every effort will be made to ensure equality of voice among the membership.</p><p>On foot of a recommendation from the chair of the most recent citizens' assembly, the terms of reference for each assembly have been designed so that they are sufficiently well defined to provide a clear focus for the assembly while at the same time not being so prescriptive as to inhibit the scope of the assemblies to define their work programmes as they deem appropriate.</p><p>The terms of reference for the citizens' assembly on biodiversity derive principally from the resolution passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 9 May 2019, which declared a climate and biodiversity emergency and called for the citizens' assembly to examine how the State can improve its response to the issue of biodiversity loss.  The terms of reference for the Dublin citizens' assembly deliver on a commitment in the programme for Government to establish a citizens' assembly to consider the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited for Dublin.</p><p>The decision to move ahead with two new assemblies and, for the first time, run them concurrently underscores the fact that citizens' assemblies are no longer merely an interesting experiment in deliberative democracy.  Successive assemblies have amply demonstrated how the process enhances Ireland's democratic system.  Engaging members of the general public in considering and proposing solutions to societal challenges not only makes a unique and valuable contribution to the deliberative processes for the Government and the Oireachtas but it also enhances the public sphere, where matters of public importance are debated, in turn raising public awareness and understanding of the matters under consideration.

It follows from a successful approach to dealing with matters that have been sensitive and often difficult to grapple with at a political level for a variety of reasons.</p> <p>I always had concerns about citizens' assemblies until such time as they became really important and were fruitful.  I had always questioned, perhaps as an observer before I was directly involved in politics, why on a daily basis politicians elected by the public are unable to deal with what are often complex matters.  Of course it has nothing to do with the intellectual capacity of the individuals and more often it is a question of finding a difficulty in grappling with matters that appear from time to time to run contrary to where public opinion is perceived to be at.</p> <p>The citizens' assemblies, and particularly the recent example relating to the repeal of the eighth amendment, have demonstrated that the public had moved very considerably ahead of the political mindset.  We had various different debates in this House and the one across the corridor in believing a particular position and, ultimately, this was not in tune with the public.  Whatever my misgivings may have been about running parallel systems of debate on important matters, these assemblies have found a role and way of assisting the political process in addressing complex matters.  This leads to an informed and insightful debate with real people who are not looking over their shoulder with an electoral mandate.  They are getting an opportunity to debate in a dispassionate way with the benefit of all the information in a relatively benign environment.  The outcomes we have seen so far have been positive and I have no doubt the same result will come from these proposed assemblies.</p> <p>One might initially see issues relating to biodiversity as a no-brainer but of course that is not the case.  No different from any required changes, there must be an element of give and take, and we see that particularly with matters around climate change generally.  The question has been sold heretofore on the basis of what ultimately we cannot do and how this affects people's lives and economic activity as we know it.  What is often lost in the rush to judgment by some who would seek to gain political advantage from being seen to be against something is what are the real benefits and potential opportunities.</p> <p>We do not have to delve too deeply into the climate change agenda to realise the importance of addressing it now for future generations.  There are also opportunities to benefit all of us in the short to medium term with the likes of green technology and jobs in the green sector.  We can look to areas with which I am very familiar, which have poor land and peat, and what is happening in the midlands.  What is being done around a just transition is not perfect at all but there are people who worked on the bogs and looked like they were losing their jobs harvesting peat from Bord na M&oacute;na sites who are now back reconstituting what had been degraded or lost.  They are rewetting those bogs.  There are opportunities in addressing questions of climate change and biodiversity.  There are costs for production but there are also benefits on the other side.  I do not want to be prescriptive at this stage about what might be discussed or what might be the outcome but while there are potential losses there are also potential gains.  I hope with access to expert evidence, advice and information throughout the process, those wise people will reach an appropriate deliberation and outcome that will come back here ultimately for appropriate legislative proposals.</p> <p>On the education side, it is long overdue that we look at and manage education.  The religious orders have done an immense amount of good work in establishing our education system and without them we would not be where we are today.  We must move on, nonetheless, from the system we have had and we must have a much more secular approach in the delivery of education.  That will find favour with some of the religious orders.  I hope we can see some significant plans and procedures coming back before us in the not too distant future.  I look forward to having an input into the debate at that stage.  I wish the Minister of State and all those involved well.  I look forward to the deliberations and outcomes that will be presented to us in due course.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty with the Government's proposals in general and I support them.  I will focus on my amendment because I want to seek more representation from the local representatives of the Minister of State's party, Fine Gael, Independents and those from other parties and none.</p> <p>The Government is proposing that 12 councillors will be part of the assembly, with the selection process as random or not prescribed.  We can take a little journey around the area.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council have 40 members.  Dublin City Council has 63 members.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In total, between the four local authorities in Dublin, there are 183 elected members of local government.  That is important.  The Minister of State is proposing that there be 80 members on the assembly.  I am simply suggesting we increase that number by 12, to bring it to 92 members.  The logic of that is that he is proposing 12 councillors but I am proposing 24 because I want there to be representation.  Some groups are smaller and are minorities, while others are bigger groups.  I happen to be close to all groupings and there are a substantial number of Independents among them.  No one should be put at a disadvantage, as may be the case for members of smaller parties.</p><p>I am disappointed the motion does not refer to the d'Hondt system or gender balance.  On one hand we have people talking about being part of women's groups or advocating for them in terms of gender balance, and rightly so, yet somehow this legislation is silent on gender balance and proportionality.  That is an issue of concern to me and many of the Dublin city and county councillors.</p><p>I have engaged comprehensively with many groups across Dublin city and county.  After all, the motion has been amended.  It is the second motion in respect of this matter.  It was changed on the understanding that there were some concerns.  It was right to revisit it.  I am simply suggesting that the number be increased by 12.  My amendment proposes, "a Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, to be known as the Dublin Citizens&rsquo; Assembly, with a total of 92 members, including an independent Chairperson, 67 randomly-selected members of the public living in Dublin City and County".  It changes only a few words of the motion.  I am suggesting there be 24 councillors rather than 12, as proposed by the Minister of State.  The amendment continues that those councillors should be, "selected from across the four local authorities using the d&rsquo;Hondt system, while being mindful of the need for gender balance, to consider the type of local government structures best suited for Dublin".  I have no problem with any of this.  My simple concern is that we need to widen it out.  My amendment would give each of the four local authorities six members.</p><p>The Minister of State has not set out how the councillors will be selected.  Will there be more or fewer from each of Dublin City Council, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council?  That is not prescribed in the motion.  I know the Minister of State wants to keep it flexible and his hand slightly removed from it.  I respect and understand what he is attempting to do.  I want to be supportive and constructive but I also want to bring the voice of city and county councillors from across that spectrum of four councils.  I do so by suggesting a simple measure that would increase the representation from 12 to 24 councillors to give a greater opportunity for participation and ensure we have that gender balance opportunity.  I do not think the increase I have proposed is unreasonable.  The total number of members would still be below 100.  It would be manageable.  We have had very successful citizens' assemblies with approximately 100 members.  I do not think it is too much to ask for if we are going to be consistent about how we advocate for gender balance, the d'Hondt system and fair play for all the political groups.  All these city and county councillors have a mandate having been democratically elected.  They represent communities.  They have gone to the electorate and got votes.  I refer to the diversity, talent and skills of city and county councillors across the spectrum in Dublin.  They will bring meaningful engagement to the process.  They will not dominate the process but, rather, will engage with it.</p><p>I make my case to the Senators who are present to please join with me in supporting this reasonable ask.  I am seeking to increase the representation of city and county councillors from 12 to 24 and to allow for a d'Hondt system to be in place, which represents fairness in the system, and to address the issue of gender balance on which we have all spoken.  I do not think anyone should be against the amendment.  I cannot understand why anyone would be against it, other than possibly due to the party whip system.  The Minister of State has to do what he has to do.  I know where he is coming from.  I just want to make that case.  I hope I can get support for the amendment.</p></speech>

I am very supportive of deliberative democracy.  As the Minister of State rightly said, it is not an experiment any more.  It has become a vital cog in the wheel of democracy.  He is right that we will be running assemblies concurrently.  That is new, as is going beyond the electoral register.  I hope both those innovations add value to the process.</p> <p>Obviously, I support a citizens' assembly on biodiversity loss and one on the type of directly elected mayor and local government structures best suited to Dublin.  I am also very supportive of citizens' assemblies on drugs and the reform of education.  I hope those will be prioritised.  All Members know reform of the leaving certificate is needed.  People are calling for that to happen now.  There has been a similar urgency for a very long time in respect of drugs.  Other Senators will speak on that more passionately than I will.</p> <p>I am here because of the 183 local councillors.  The Minister of State was a councillor on the same council as me.  I refer to the pattern in terms of the loss of powers of local councillors in the past decade.  We are discussing bringing in a directly elected mayor.  That is a positive but obviously there are chief executives and the aim is to balance where we are now.  We also need to address the balance for the local councillors in Dublin who are not part of municipal districts and have to go to the county council as area committees.  I was one of those councillors.  We need good people on councils and we need them to feel they are adding value to their areas.</p> <p>The Minister of State is from Castleknock, an area I represented.  There are community groups in areas such as Castleknock that want to be able to have more influence on their development plans.  There are urban planning frameworks and there are hopes in the context of development plans for more influence through things such as the same kind of set-up there is with the Town Centre First approach, but that needs to be reflected in the council structures.  We need councillors to have more powers.  We need local communities to be able to rely on their councillors to deliver what they want.  We have seen how communities have flourished during Covid.  People want to be able to continue to build identities, identify with their areas and have that influence.  I am here for those 183 councillors.  I want to ensure we are getting the balance right not just for the chief executive and the mayor, but also for them.</p></speech>

I welcome the motion.  I believe in the concept of a directly elected mayor.  That idea of subsidiarity and democratic accountability at local level is tremendously important.  In that regard, there is a big gap in the motion.  Nothing in the motion will actually empower councillors to any greater extent than they are currently empowered.  I have for a long time and on many occasions in this House complained about the fact that in the past two decades or more, successive Governments have stripped powers away from local councillors and vested those powers in unelected and largely unaccountable officials at local level - chief executives, directors of services and other council officials.  To a large extent, councillors do not have the power to effect change on issues of planning or anything else one likes at local level, right down to road works and potholes.  That relegates councillors to the position of being local ambassadors to the chief executive of a local authority.  Having a directly elected mayor will not change that but one thing it will do is introduce democratic accountability at local level in terms of executive decisions that are made at that level.  It is entirely appropriate that we would have a person with that role and mandate from the people who are looked after by that local authority.  A citizens' assembly can do that.</p> <p>The Government has tried to do this before.  I was part of the colloquium that existed before 2019 among the four Dublin local authorities that ultimately rejected the notion, albeit arguably on a technicality.  In tandem with the directly elected mayor, there is a need for reform to ensure this does not create another layer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of the things I find greatly regrettable and, to my mind, inexplicable is that where this has already happened with a directly elected mayor in Limerick, the chief executive of the new council, even though he should be wielding less power and have less responsibility, is now paid more than he was beforehand.  The citizens in Limerick, the taxpayers, ratepayers and local property tax payers, are now paying a chief executive of the council, who has less responsibility and presumably less power, and they are paying for a new directly elected mayor and all of the other supports that are going to have to go with that person.  To my mind, this makes no sense at all.  There is great merit in the suggestion of a directly elected mayor but it must be done in a way that delivers for the people.  It must be done in a way that works with the councillors who are there already.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State very much on behalf of all of the people in Clare, for all of the sports capital grants that the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, gave out.  Everybody was very happy because after two years of no fundraising it brought a lot of joy to people all around the county.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaoibh.</p> <p>It is important that we have these citizens' assemblies.  The climate action plan would not be here now only that we had a good Citizens' Assembly on climate.  We know that assemblies are a good thing and we know that they work.  It is important to get them off the ground as soon as possible.  It is very important that we have an assembly on biodiversity.  I have spoken at length about biodiversity loss.  It is very important we get this kicked off as soon as possible.</p> <p>A directly elected mayor would be good for democracy of course but I will not dwell on that too much.  We have a promise of two more assemblies, one on drugs and one on constitutional reform and the right to housing.  These need to be pinned down to a serious timeline.</p> <p>The Green Party fully understands and appreciates the necessity to hold a citizens' assembly on drug use as soon as possible.  This is why we secured a commitment to hold it.  We got that in the programme for Government.  We fully expect, as the Taoiseach confirmed last week in the D&aacute;il, that the citizens' assembly on drug use will be in place and ready to commence its work later this year, and not in 2023 as some have said.  The reason I am here is to get clarity on that.  Even though I am from a small rural village, whether one is from Dublin's inner city or from the back of west Clare, drugs are ruining our country.  We have not dealt with this properly and we will not until the citizens' assembly is set up.  It would be good to get a commitment for the timeline on that citizens' assembly sooner, not next year but this year.  We have a lot of staff, a lot of civil servants, a lot of Senators and a lot of Deputies.  Surely to God we can get that started.</p> <p>We have a lot of capable and well-paid civil servants so we should be able to get that citizens' assembly off the ground this year and not next year.  It has to be this year because people are dying every day and there is a lot of abuse.  There are many ripple effects of drug use and drug dependency that we have never really dealt with as a country.  Sometimes I am seeing things on our streets that I have not seen since the early 1980s.  It is at every level of society.  It is not just in socially disadvantaged areas.  It is in every corner of society, and we know that.  I just wanted to speak from the heart to say that it is really good we have the biodiversity assembly and one for the directly elected mayor, but I do not believe that we as people can afford to wait on the drugs issues if our true job as politicians is to represent the people, or to delay to any length despite what has been said.  The Taoiseach has committed to it happening this year.  This is what I want to reinforce today.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.  I welcome the motion, as other colleagues have done.</p> <p>I will quickly refer to the issue of biodiversity.  It is crucial, timely and important that this citizens' assembly would be held, and that the hard work, graft and effort of that citizens' assembly is not left on the shelf.  I could go into a whole load of statistics, and to be fair to Senator Garvey she has raised the biodiversity crisis often in the House, but one statistic jumped out at me which is that currently 1 million animal and plant species are facing extinction.  That is the largest number in our history.  As part of that, I hope an assembly would look at all of the mechanical things we can do to try to offset, challenge, tackle and reverse the biodiversity crisis.  I also hope that it looks at the economic models that drive the biodiversity crisis and that drive plant, species and animal extinction around the world.  That is the notion of infinite profit or infinite growth on finite resources.  I wish the citizens' assembly well in its work, given that the stakes are so high regarding that issue.</p> <p>On the directly elected mayors and local government, I equally welcome that engagement and wish it well.  As someone with experience of local government in the North, it always strikes me that there is a stark difference in the experience of colleagues in the Twenty-six Counties, and just how much power and authority rests with the unelected members of local government.  It strikes me as quite stark.  Anything that looks to address that imbalance and which gives more responsibility and authority to those elected by the citizens, is a welcome step forward and one that we should encourage.</p> <p>I support the amendment, as other colleagues have done, from Senator Ruane on a citizens' assembly on drugs.  Much like the biodiversity crisis, it is a live and imminent issue out there in our society.  Because of that, it warrants an urgent response from the Government for the establishment of such a citizens' assembly.  I look forward to hearing Senator Ruane's contribution in that regard.</p> <p>I will conclude by raising an issue that has also been raised by colleagues in the D&aacute;il.  In May 2021, the Seanad passed a Fianna F&aacute;il motion on the Good Friday Agreement.  The motion was amended to call on the Government to establish a citizens' assembly to responsibly plan and prepare for constitutional change.  The Minister of State will be aware, and colleagues across the House are aware, that there is growing momentum around that call in Irish society.  I note last night's announcement from Ireland's Future that it plans to hold a conference on this very theme in the 3 Arena, or the Point Depot as many of us still know it, in October of this year.  That is the will of this House.  It is the express will of the Seanad that the citizens' assembly on constitutional change would be established.  We call on the Government to do that unanimously, as it passed through the House without opposition in May 2021.</p> <p>There are lots of issues upon which we could call for citizens' assemblies, but there are big touchstone issues of our time and big moments.  Other colleagues have referred to the last number of citizens' assemblies that looked at the issue of the repeal of the eighth amendment and marriage equality.  They were big touchstone moments where people sensed a change and cried out for that change.  People wanted to be involved in the citizens' assemblies in helping to drive and shape that change.  Whether it is the issue of constitutional change and a new and reconciled Ireland, whether it is tackling the challenges and threats posed to communities by drugs, and assisting and supporting those communities and individuals who are suffering as a result of drugs, or whether it is the biodiversity crisis, these are themes that warrant the fullest attention and the fullest and broadest engagement, contribution and dialogue from these institutions from local government and most importantly, given what we are talking about today, the ordinary citizens out there.  I welcome the motion before us and I support it.</p></speech>

Like Senator Currie, I very much support the idea of deliberative democracy.  We have inherited an old parliamentary system from the British, which we have not changed in any way shape or form.  Having had the marriage equality and repeal of the eighth amendment assemblies, we know there is a value in citizens' assemblies taking those very complex issues and deliberating on them with heart and rigour, and coming up with solutions that had otherwise befuddled political communities.  That was particularly the case with the repeal the eighth amendment, which took 30 years and a lot of stop-starts to do it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I remember being involved in the 2001 referendum campaign where we were essentially looking to roll back on the X case.  Bearing in mind my experience of how difficult that campaign was, I am still sometimes shocked that 15 years later we had got to the situation where we were repealing the eighth amendment.  It was in no small measure due to the compassion of the members of the Citizens' Assembly.  If we had left it up to these Houses, we would still be fighting to organise it.</p><p>A directly elected mayor in Dublin is very badly needed.  We are even behind our neighbours whose parliamentary system we inherited in terms of having a single political responsible accountable person in local government.  We have handed it over to the chief executives - not even a city manager - and directors of services, who are not accountable and are not chiming with the needs of what people on the ground want.  We have seen the example of the amount of student accommodation being built in Dublin city and a chief executive who did not understand frustrations over the developments that are happening.</p><p>I wish to speak to Senator Ruane's amendment.  I heard Government Members speaking last night and today about how important it is.  I am concerned that the Minister of State who is meant to be driving this agenda is not convinced of the need for decriminalisation and is certainly not driving it in government by setting up a citizens' assembly on the issue.  I grew up in Dolphin's Barn in inner city Dublin in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.  From a very young age I had internalised the heroin crisis and the AIDS epidemic that happened in those areas at the time.  This can be a very difficult issue for me emotionally.</p><p>The case for decriminalisation and a health-based approach to drugs and substance misusers has been more than won owing to the advocacy of people like Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Senator Ruane who have argued that fully.  It is a complex issue, but it is not actually that complex.  Every day people are dying on our streets from drug overdoses.  I understand the concerns of people in some communities who do not necessarily want injection centres close to them.  It is based on fear.  People need to sit down and talk to people with addictions to realise the positive impact on their communities of taking drugs out of the criminal underworld and taking a health response to the issue.</p><p>I am disappointed that when we are setting up two citizens' assemblies this is not one of the top priorities.  This is the only citizen's assembly where we are talking about people's lives; it is a life-and-death matter that potentially transforms communities.  If somebody falls into the drug use at a very young age it is very difficult for them to pull their life out of it.  Those mistakes that people make at a very young age can follow them around for the rest of their lives - an issue Senator Ruane has worked on in terms of spent convictions.</p><p>Based on the example of Portugal, we know we can take a different approach.  This is a medical issue and not a justice or policing issue, which has failed badly.  I hope the Minister of State comes back before the summer with a proposal for a citizens' assembly, which is supported by many Government Deputies.  The people who have been working on this have lost patience.  I would have expected this to be at the top of the agenda.</p></speech>

I confess that I have never been a particular fan of citizens' conventions, notwithstanding the comments of others earlier.  Some have served a purpose.  As a practising politician I get the abuse and hardship that we all get on doorsteps and at meetings.  Some people seem to be of the view that the Houses of the Oireachtas or local authorities could not possibly make decisions but a citizens' assembly could, which I do not accept.  They may have proven themselves to a degree.  For example, on the issue of repealing the eighth amendment, a considerable amount of work was done in advance by Dr. James Reilly with the introduction of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill in the lead-up to the repeal.  That was a very important debate at the time and I was in the midst of that at a difficult time on a very important issue.</p> <p>That said, citizens' assemblies are part of the process and are supported by the Government.  These two issues are important, as are others.  I do not in any way dispute the importance of issues such as drugs and others.  I know there is a commitment to have citizens' assemblies for those at a future date.</p> <p>One of the issues I have is with having 100 people.  Certain counties may end up without any representation.  Excluding the citizens' assembly on a Dublin mayor which is a Dublin-based issue, I have advocated to my party leader that for national issues like biodiversity, drugs etc., there should be simultaneous regional conventions in the four provinces or wherever.  With the new technology, they can take place simultaneously and would allow for a higher level of participation.  We certainly would not have the issue of certain counties without any voice.</p> <p>Regarding the substantive issue of the two motions, I agree on the importance of the convention on biodiversity loss.  Regional balance would be important there for the obvious reasons that country people would have a strong voice in this as well.  It is not just an issue of somebody coming out to the countryside and admiring the countryside.  It is important that people living in rural areas are aware of the issues as well and have an input into it.</p> <p>Protecting biodiversity is very important.  We have had a sea change in this country compared with what would have happened years ago where State agencies such as Teagasc and its precursor gave grants for the removal of biodiversity through the removal of landscape features, scrub and woodland for drainage of lands.  Since the inception of the rural environmental protection scheme in the mid-1990s, the focus has been on the protection of biodiversity.  That said, there are still examples of a loss of habitat and biodiversity.  I hope the changes that have been agreed in the new round of the Common Agricultural Policy post-2023 will have greater focus on environmental issues and will allow for the protection of more of these areas.  In order for an area to become eligible to be declared as a forage area, a farmer had to remove the habitat that was there.  It is nonsense in this day and age that in order to ensure that farmers were getting money under disadvantaged area scheme or under the basic payment scheme in respect of forage areas the only solution was actually to remove in some cases smaller or in other cases larger areas of habitat.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There have been issues and there has been a sea change in policy.  That is to be welcomed but it is important to have a wide geographic spread of participants.  If there is not, it could be perceived as biasing the results, which would be unfortunate in the extreme.</p><p>Regarding the Dublin citizens' assembly, I sympathise with the views of Senator Boyhan.  While I have not gone out to seek councillors' views, I have not been contacted by Dublin councillors about this.  It is a question of how many is enough.  Is 24, as suggested, enough?  Is 20 enough, or is the figure stipulated here sufficient?  Again, why is the membership of the Dublin citizens' assembly to be 80 and not 100, which it would be in other cases?  Those are technical issues, but, if the number were increased, it would allow for better participation of councillors.</p><p>Council amalgamation was pursued in Waterford and Limerick.  Limerick accepted the plebiscite on a directly elected mayor.  The legislation has been somewhat stalled.  Perhaps the appetite is not as strong.  Even though the result of the plebiscite was positive in support of the proposal, it may be somewhat stalled.  We do not have an example within the country of a directly elected mayor working.  Therefore, it is important that we look to our closest neighbour, including some of the larger mayorships in Manchester, Liverpool and elsewhere.  That would be a positive.</p><p>These are positives in respect of the two issues.  Down the line, in the very near future, the drugs issue and others should and must be assessed.</p></speech>

This Chamber has proven more harmful to my mental health than my drug use ever did.  I apologise for finding this very hard.  There are many policies we can all speak about.  The likes of the drugs policy has many threads.  Decriminalisation is one of them.  Blood-borne viruses, family support, suicide, dual diagnosis, imprisonment, and women and family are others.  Every single Department is affected by drug use.  Every single organisation that works in communities is affected by drug use.  It is everybody's issue, not just an issue for the services that provide addiction support.  It seeps into everything, whether you are working for Barnardos, with women, with children in care or for the prison system.  It features everywhere.  However, when I speak about it or try to platform it, it does not feel like it is felt everywhere.  Intellectually, people know about it, but in their communities they can do a 360&deg; turn without seeing the pain, harm, misery and deaths.</p> <p>I find it very hard to speak here about policy without allowing it to seep into me that there is not a hierarchy.  There has to be a hierarchy because a decision gets made.  People sit around a table and decide what goes first.  It is not picked out of a hat.  A conversation happens at the table where what goes first is decided.  All I hear and all people like me and my community hear is that we were not top of the agenda.  We feel people do not really and truly understand what is going on in communities.  There are families in my community who have to teach their three-, four- or five-year-old children what the recovery position is.  There are women in their 70s who have to check in the morning whether their sons' chests are rising or falling to make sure their breathing has not slowed down from benzo use in the middle of the night.</p> <p>I get that drug use is in all postcode areas and counties, but, while some in those areas can point to the people who are impacted, I can point to those who are not.  That is the difference.  The difference for me and my community is that being affected by drugs or drug use is not the exception.  It is not the exception to know one, two, three or four people who have died of an overdose; it is the rule, the norm.  That is the difference between the experience of others and the one I am trying to put forward in the hope people will not dismiss it by saying we all understand addiction.  I am not saying people do not, but it is very different in how it is presented in particular communities.</p> <p>When I worked in the drugs sector, I remember standing every year in Dolphin House while the names of every single person who died were called out.  There were two or three women who had lost four, five or six children.  They had outlived all their children, who had all died of drug use.  Therefore, for every person someone in this Chamber knows has had an addiction, there are women who have lost every single one of their children to it, or to prison or crime.  There are women who have found their children hanging from the rafters because they could not get access to services for nasal cocaine use.  They could not get therapeutic services.  The numbers of deaths in their communities are considerable.</p> <p>This is also very much a women's issue.  In the past few weeks, all I have been hearing about were platforms for women and women's issues, but 33% of the 400 people who access crack cocaine services in Tallaght are women.  The majority of them are mothers.  Where are their advocates?  Who is fighting for their platform?  For us, the citizens' assembly was the space to make that happen.  Although people will say it will happen in autumn or 2023, we are measuring the delay in lives.  We are measuring it in the loss of our families and communities.  Every single second or day that the discussion is not happening presents a problem.</p> <p>Services can barely keep their doors open.  We keep talking about the cost of living.  Nobody discusses the fact that services must keep their radiators off to keep service provision going for people who need intervention owing to drugs.  The services cannot pay the ESB bill and at the same time provide intervention.  There are services that are doing nothing but administration in an effort to find funding to carry out the interventions.  The Simon Communities report stated 70% of its detox service users are homeless because of drug addiction.  For me, every single Department and issue is somewhat affected by the drugs issue, but I do not see where it is being prioritised.</p> <p>The hardest month I have had in this Chamber since I was elected was the one since the health committee considered the drugs strategy.  This is because of the little bit of hope that I had that my time here could be worth something.  So many times, I have regretted becoming educated.  Imagine that.  I do not want to have to be conscious or aware that this is how badly we are being failed.  Imagine me wanting to go back to the moment when I decided not to be a problematic drug user.  When I was, at least I really did not understand or see the facts that we are being failed at a systematic level and that neither my friends nor I were failures for being drug users.  Rather, we were being failed at a much higher level through systematic violence against our communities.  The moment you have that awareness and consciousness, you cannot go back and learn it may have been in your power to do something differently.  That is where I am at today after six years in this Chamber.  When the citizens' assembly is not being called and we have a drugs Minister who does not understand his brief, I just feel no one cares and no one is listening.  Now I am at the stage where I am saying, "Please help us; someone, actually help us." I have moved past being a politician to the point of despair.  Therefore, I ask Members to vote for the amendment.  We should not be considering a lord mayor in this round.  We just should not be doing it.  We could have a councillors' assembly or another approach.  There is urgency and we need to save lives, but we are deciding there is a hierarchy and not to address this issue now.  That is a decision of the Government.</p></speech>

On the local government structures for Dublin, for instance, it is a failure of imagination and determination at a political level rather than some issue on which the great majority of Dubliners, however congregated, are to come up with some magnificent formula that is going to change things dramatically.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The issues are obvious.  It is not an easy problem.  The issues arising from dividing power between an executive and elected councillors are fairly straightforward and do not need or merit a citizens&rsquo; assembly.  I support Senator Boyhan&rsquo;s amendment simply to say that there are people who have experience of this and to marginalise them in the process of looking at political reform seems to me to be foolish.</p><p>I want to address Senator Ruane&rsquo;s amendment.  The point she makes is 100% correct.  There are comfortable parts of this city and our society where even if drugs are everywhere, they are manageable.  Some families and communities have enough resources to deal with the more extreme forms of drug abuse and the consequences.  As the Senator said, there are entire communities where drug abuse is either the norm or its consequences are a daily reality in terms of the quality of life and of family life, longevity, health and all of the rest.  I work in another part of the city and I cross the Liffey every day.  One thing that struck me in recent weeks is that on O'Donovan Rossa Bridge, there is open drug dealing going on every day just 100 yd from the Bridewell Garda station.  What really horrifies me are the young men with missing legs in wheelchairs because they are the visible signs of drug abuse.  As Senator Ruane has pointed out, it is the people who were buried or cremated that I do not think about or see at all.  We do not see those who died by suicide and all of the others we are failing.  When I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I was deeply concerned about whether we could deal with the drug problem through criminal justice alone and I do not think we can.  In one sense, the critique that Senator Ruane offers is correct.  There is almost a partnership between the criminal justice system and gangland to have a whole way of life, economy and set of activities and functions in terms of policing and breaking the law and the like which have become endemic and ineradicable at the moment.</p><p>Therefore, just like the eighth amendment, which was a serious and far-reaching issue where a deep soul-searching had to be engaged in to see where people actually stood when push came to shove, we now have to do the same regarding drugs.  The issues are not free from controversy.  I remember being lobbied extensively by mothers of drug addicts who told me not to legalise drugs and that if we made cannabis freely available there would be consequences because they claimed heroin would follow in its tracks.  That was at a time before crack cocaine was available.  We also have the American example of the opioid crisis to contend with.  It is not an easy subject but the real issue as I see it is that we that simply cannot go on as we are.  We cannot have the appalling consequences that Senator Ruane pointed out, such as people losing limbs or their lives or doing appalling things to one another to sustain their drug habit.  We cannot have people committing suicide, families being wrecked and kids being thrown out of their homes and becoming homeless.  All of these things must be addressed by our society.  </p><p>It was mentioned earlier that maybe Portugal has the answer and a health-based approach to drug abuse and the consumption of drugs is the only way forward.  If that is the case, let us grasp that and at least discuss it.  If we are going to have a succession of citizens&rsquo; assemblies from now on, this is one issue where politicians are, as I was, afraid to say that they are going to legalise cannabis.  I was asked how we can keep cannabis away from teenagers, 12-year-olds or whoever else?  That was an issue on which I was lobbied.  This is an occasion where we need to establish a citizens&rsquo; assembly and have a good public discussion of the subject.  It cannot be kicked down the road.</p><p>In terms of priorities, people are dying and committing suicide, families are being broken up, people are going out on the streets, robbing and doing appalling things to each other in houses and all the rest arising out of the drug problem.  I agree with Senator Ruane.  This should be brought forward.  </p></speech>

I am listening and I hear her.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  The Minister of State is very welcome.  We know that two of the key commitments in the programme for Government are to establish citizens&rsquo; assemblies on biodiversity and on the local government structures best suited to Dublin.  </p> <p>Notwithstanding the very powerful argument made by Senator Ruane, a debate involving all of the stakeholders around local government structures for Dublin is very important and certainly would have an impact right around the country.  I welcome the proposal to run the separate assemblies concurrently, with inaugural meetings planned for April 2022.  We know this is the first time that two assemblies will run concurrently and it presents an opportunity to design an operational model that can allow for a greater number of citizens&rsquo; assemblies to be run.  We have certainly seen their value over the past few years.  While at the start I was perhaps not convinced about their value, I absolutely believe in their value now.</p> <p>We all know that biodiversity is in crisis globally.  One million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, the highest number in our history.  The destruction of habitats, pollution, climate change, the illegal wildlife trade and overfishing are all issues that we as a country need to tackle head on.  There is no doubt but that we need to see a real and transformative change from a biodiversity perspective.</p> <p>As for the citizens' assembly on the local government structures best suited to Dublin, a directly elected mayor for Dublin could drive forward transport, planning, investment plans and municipal services and could deal with issues such as drugs in a clear and coherent manner.  I acknowledge that there will be 80 members, 67 of whom will be randomly selected from the public living in Dublin city and county and the remaining 12 being councillors.  Senator Boyhan raised this matter on the Order of Business.  I agree with him that we need to ensure that councillors&rsquo; voices are to the fore in this process in order to ensure that the voices of the communities they represent are to the fore.  There are excellent councillors all around Dublin from all parties and none, elected by their peers.  Their input is valuable and vital to the process and could help to develop a model that could be replicated across the country.</p> <p>However, as my party spokesperson on education, and someone who is passionate about the transformative power of education, I cannot let the opportunity pass without raising the citizens&rsquo; assembly on the future of education.  The 2020 programme for Government contained a commitment to hold a citizens&rsquo; assembly on the future of education and to ensure that the voices of young people and those being educated are central, which is important.</p> <p>The idea for the assembly arose at a 2018 symposium in the Burren College of Art, which had creativity in education as its theme.  In my view, it is most certainly needed.  I have had a number of conversations with Catherine Byrne and Shane Bergin, who are the instigators of this proposal.  They are committed to the philosophy and the transformative power of education, and the need to educate our young people to be full citizens of our country and participate in all of its different aspects.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are three crucial issues to discuss for the assembly on education to be a success.  We need to begin to think of how we can utilise the citizens' assembly process to transform our education systems, namely, the timing of this assembly, its focus and how it will operate.  The Taoiseach suggested in recent comments that the assembly on education will run in parallel with one on drugs.  Certain comments suggest that these will commence once the two assemblies that we are talking about today are complete.  I and many in the education sector are mindful of the work that will need to be done to establish any assembly's terms of reference.  It will be helpful to learn more about exactly when the assembly on education will take place and how its terms of reference will be established.  I will push for this within my own party.</p><p>At a time when the Department of Education is due to report on reform of the senior cycle and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is preparing a new curriculum for primary education, a citizens' assembly will provide for a space to ask the bigger questions about what education needs to be and what its goal should be.  The past two years have been a huge challenge for everybody in education, whether they are young people, their teachers, their parents or the wider school communities.  As we emerge from this challenging space, I believe a citizens' assembly offers us the ideal space to discuss the purposes and process for education in this country.  It is time for an honest conversation about education and its value.</p><p>How will this operate in practice?  The programme for Government states that the voices of young people and those being educated are central but we need to start thinking now of how we can facilitate that and bring the voices of young people into this debate.  While I welcome this discussion of citizens' assemblies on biodiversity and on reform of local government structures for Dublin, I believe we need to widen our discussions and allow background work to start on other issues such as education, drugs and a number of others.  If we can run two assemblies concurrently, then we can start concurrent preparatory works on citizens' assemblies on education and on drugs.</p></speech>

I was involved in the process when we passed the plebiscite in Limerick.  It was put to Limerick, Cork and Waterford but we were the only place to pass it.  I believe it is a positive way to go.  Citizens, 12 elected members and people with expertise will be involved.  It is important.  When we ran an information campaign in Limerick about the plebiscite, people had clear questions that they wanted answered.  It was as important for people in the city to have a voice as it was for people in the county.  Dublin needs a unified voice.  There are different issues in the four local electoral areas and they need to be addressed, which is why it is important to have a good balance from each area.  The legislation for Limerick is at an advanced stage.  I am undertaking a thesis about a directly elected mayor for Limerick.  I am eager to see what will happen with the proposals for Dublin.  It is important that the views of the people who will be faced with this and with the decision in the future on the plebiscite are considered.</p> <p>I have looked at what happened in New Zealand and the UK.  There are interesting examples across the world.  When Leicester in England first introduced this, within the first two or three years, people said it should be got rid of and that it was not working.  In a recent survey, the public stated that they think it is great and that it has put Leicester on a better footing than other similarly-sized cities.  There are many advantages in this regard.</p> <p>I commend the Minister of State on bringing forward the citizens' assembly for a directly elected mayor and for the reform of local government.  It is the largest reform of local government that Limerick has seen in more than 100 years.  We are all concerned about biodiversity and the planet and the many changes coming down the line.  I believe it is the right way to go and I support the Minister of State in his proposals.</p></speech>

There is not one word that I would disagree with.  I hope that the Government is listening.  What Senator Ruane has talked about is important.  She has talked about people's lives, communities and realities.  She is in here day after day, talking to us about this issue.  I agree with her frustration about whether people are listening and whether we are committing to effecting real change for these communities, which have been devastated by systemic let-downs.</p> <p>When we talk about drugs, we tend to talk about users.  We talk about communities, concerns of locals and the police.  We use really dehumanising terms such as "users".  We talk about "they", as if they are other, far-away people who are not worthy of our time or consideration because somehow they are other and away from us, and we do not have to face that every day.  Some of us in the Chamber face that every day and it is wrong for us not to listen to that person.  It is not fair to put it all on that person.  It is not fair for Senator Ruane to have to constantly stand up to bare her soul and her community just to try to get us to listen, to then have her, six years later, asking for someone to please do something.  That is not good enough.  It is not acceptable.  It is not what this House is set up for or what we, as politicians, or the Government should be doing.</p> <p>When we use terms such as "they" and "users, we are talking about people, mothers, fathers, someone's son, someone's best friend from school, communities, someone's neighbour and people who have been in and out of these Houses.  All people deserve care, compassion and dignity.  Everyone, including people who are addicted and affected by drugs, deserve timely consideration in the political system.  Most especially deserving of consideration is a group of people who are dying at a rate of one a day due to overdoses.  This does not include the other deaths and systemic failures that come from drug use in those communities.  That is just one figure that has been talked about a lot over the past couple of weeks.  Many more lives have been devastated and affected by this than just the ones we are talking about every single day.</p> <p>We need to tease out, discuss and re-evaluate our society's approach to our placing of care and compassion.  We need to place care, compassion and dignity at the centre, which we cannot do if we do not first stop to consider their needs and lives.  I believe a citizens' assembly is essential to this.  Sometimes, citizens' assemblies can be really good.  They help us to tease out complex questions which we are not sure of the answer to or about which way the State wishes to go.  That includes issues such as abortion.  It turned out that the citizens' assembly to address it was bang on the money.  Some of what is discussed at citizens' assemblies may require a referendum to constitute but they certainly will involve resetting or having a significant paradigm shift in society.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On this particular issue of drugs, this could involve legalising or decriminalising which, incidentally, are two entirely different things.  I implore legislators to learn the difference between decriminalisation and legalisation because it is very disheartening to hear in meetings with a Minister or of the Joint Committee on Health these words being bandied about without any real understanding or acknowledgement of how those words or legal frameworks will affect the communities we are discussing.  If nothing else, I ask Members to go away and learn about those issues.</p><p>The citizens' assembly may discuss cannabis, harder drugs, the who, what, where, when and why, gangs and social, recreational and addictive drug use.  All of these issues are complex and difficult and the members of the citizens' assembly will need time to get informed, face their fears, get facts and be educated.  I keep using the word "time" because, as Senator Ruane said, we do not have time.  The citizens' assembly is being given considerable time but every time more time is given and it is pushed out and further away, lives are lost.</p><p>Senator Ruane has raised a crucial issue.  The Labour Party and many other Senators on this side of the House support her amendment.  This is about lives and the value we put on them.  The Government today, from what I am hearing, is saying those lives do not matter and there are other issues of greater importance.  I was at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health to which Senator Ruane referred.  I felt like I was back in the time of Ronald Reagan when people spoke about drug users as "they" who were this or that.  "They" are real people who are dying.  They are doing these things because of a systemic failure at a political level.</p><p>Will the citizens' assembly solve everything?  No, it will not.  However, that the Government cannot see the wood for the trees on this particular issue and will not prioritise the issue tells me all I need to know about what it is going to do for drug users.  Quite frankly, it seems like it will do absolutely nothing and that is a crying shame.  </p><p>If Government Senators cannot vote for Senator Ruane's amendment, I ask that they at least not vote against it.  I do not know what way their Whip system is working on the motion.  They should not express support in their words and then do the opposite in their actions.  I reiterate that this is about lives.  The Government has the power to say today, or over the next couple of days, whether these lives matter.  We, on this side of the House, are saying they do matter and it would do no harm for Government Senators to put their money where their mouth is and, through their votes and actions, also say they matter.</p></speech>

Listening to Senator Ruane, I thought of some of the friends I went to school with who have died from taking drugs and drug addiction.  I also think of some young Traveller men.  The high rate of suicide within the Traveller community is also caused by drug addiction.  We have a homelessness crisis and Travellers are overrepresented in the prison system, as are working class people.  We have to ask why?  What is addiction?  Addiction can also be taking tablets.  We often forget about that part of addiction.  I know all about addiction and I do not want to talk about it too passionately or too much because it will open up a can of worms for me as a Traveller woman from a big family.  I have addiction inside and outside of my family and I choose not to speak about it.</p> <p>I am not as strong as Senator Ruane.  She has been here for six years, standing by herself and looking for equality for people who take drugs.  Hate the addiction, not the person.  That is the message I have heard today.  Senator Ruane is a stronger woman than I am.  I have seen people die.  All I have to do is to walk into Dublin city centre.  I used to walk from the Spire back to Labre Park in Ballyfermot and the halting site where I was born and reared and where I have seen drug addiction and where, even today, I see young men with mental health problems.  There is little or no support for them and I will speak about that tomorrow in the House.  I would not walk the street now.  I would not say I am afraid but I am very hurt to see fine, good-looking, well-reared women and young fellas on the streets crying out for support and help and it is not there.  We need the citizens' assembly set up as soon as possible.  There is no reason we cannot do it.  We could do it if the political will was there, and it is up to the Government to do it.  As many Senators pointed out, this is our responsibility.</p> <p>I have two little girls, a five-month-old and a two-year-old, and even though we are in Donegal, that does not mean they are never going to see drugs.  I want a better future for them and, by God, I am sure the Taoiseach wants a better future for his grandchildren in years down the line.  Every one of us wants that.  </p> <p>I ran for election to the Seanad two years ago.  I travelled around the country visiting county councillors.  Someone once told me not to cut off my nose to spite my face.  Today, I am going to cut off my nose to spite my face - whatever will be, will be.  If I want to come back to this House going forward, I will need the support of county councillors.  I do not believe we should have a citizens' assembly for county councillors.  A citizens' assembly is about citizens, not local government, and we have to be very clear on that.  We should value all our county councillors, not just the 180 councillors in Dublin but all councillors in the 32 counties of Ireland.  We should get them all together to speak about the reform of local authorities and local government and allow them to have that well-deserved space of their own. </p> <p>Our job in this House is to look after the people and work with the people.  It is not about local government.  I know damn well that the 76 county councillors who gave me their first preference vote, especially Independent councillors in Meath and Donegal, will say we should set up a citizens' assembly on drugs where we can deal with and listen to people who are taking drugs.</p></speech>

They are less powerful than the tool of proportional representation, which is the greatest political innovation that Ireland can bring to the world.  Confidence in citizens' assemblies depends on their being taken seriously.  For example, it will be vital that we see in the next two years actual constitutional referendums coming out of the citizens' assembly on gender equality.  These must be real constitutional referendum recommendations and votes, as suggested by the citizens.</p> <p>I am concerned about the risk of citizens' assemblies on biodiversity and local government being used for evasion.  Local government is being chipped away all of the time.  We see, even in the planning area, how it is being chipped away.  I would love to see every local councillor in Ireland being able to debate the future of local government and have their voices strengthened versus, for example, county and city managers.  That is different from a citizens' assembly, rather than a diluting of it.</p></speech>

Again, are we kicking this further down the road?</p> <p>Citizens' assemblies are powerful not as a tool of delay, evasion or moving a topic out of the realm of power it is in but when we use them to confront and engage in the difficult and important topics that do not get talked about and that people find hard to talk about, even though they may be experiencing them.  Everyone and some communities in particular have experiences, as we have heard.  These are topics that need to be addressed and engaged with, where there are fears, prejudices and misinformation.  These are where we can actually move from conversations of heat into conversations of light.  That was what happened on the eighth amendment and issues such as marriage equality.  The citizens' assemblies allowed us to create hope and shine light in areas that were difficult and hidden away.  The Seanad has always led on human rights issues and in ensuring those difficult and very intimate experiences of the Irish public are supported and recognised by the State.  We should lead on this.  I urge everyone to support Senator Ruane's amendment.  We should certainly have a third citizens' assembly.  That message is clear.</p></speech>

Many people have spoken about her community today.  Senator Ruane's community is my community.  A person I loved dearly died because of addiction.  It is the most horrible death.  It is not something you will only find in the poorer areas of society.  You will find it in every single corner of society and you will see it destroy families.  I have seen it destroy some of the finest people I have known in my life.  I know a very well-heeled and very well-off couple whose son was addicted.  I spoke to them and they spoke about the pain of cutting him off and forcing him out because they could no longer have him in their home.  We are talking about a citizens' assembly for a mayor of Dublin.  Come on.  For God's sake, let us get real and talk about the real issues that exist in this society.  We cannot continue to close our eyes and pretend this is something that only happens over there with the poor people.  It is not; it happens everywhere.  In every single street, every single household either has somebody or knows somebody who is dogged by the curse of addiction.  I do not care what kind of addiction it is.  Every one of them is bad, from the clean addiction of gambling down to the worst drug addictions, alcoholism and all of that.  There is nothing more painful.  With regard to the particular addict I am talking about, I recall getting a call telling me to go to the hospital because this is it and that I should contact the rest of my family.  I recall thinking that was it but, instead of passing on, the person in question recovered stronger.  I remember having a discussion about invincibility.  This person said that nothing would kill them, but it did.  </p><p>I support Senator Ruane, as does anybody with a heart and a mind.  It is not just her community, it is this goddamn country and every country.  The scourge of addiction, drug abuse and alcohol abuse is everywhere.  Maybe it is time for us to sit down as adults and discuss this.  We should not just discuss the nice things, but also some of the bloody horrible things that go on in this world.  Perhaps now is the time for it.  I commend Senator Ruane.  From the day she first came in here, she has fought for those who are unable to fight for themselves.  I will support her today and anybody with a heart and a mind will also support her today or at least do her the courtesy of not voting against her amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#VV00200"><p>I thank the Members of this House for their passionate and constructive contributions to today's debate.  I have listened very carefully to everyone's views and will convey many of the suggestions back to the Government and to the assembly secretariat, as appropriate.  We have had some excellent contributions and I absolutely and fully take on board the constructive and sincere points people have made.  I might address them later on in my closing statement.</p> <p>Clearly, there is considerable support in Seanad &Eacute;ireann for the work of citizens' assemblies more generally.  It is important for citizens' assemblies that Seanad &Eacute;ireann recognise and validate the contribution that the assemblies make to the deliberations of the Legislature.  As I said in my opening remarks, citizens' assemblies serve to enhance the quality of Ireland's democratic system.  Members of the public have an important contribution to make in addressing complex societal challenges and, as a nation, we have all benefited significantly from the work of the three previous assemblies.  As the legislative branch of Government, the Oireachtas has the responsibility to contextualise, design and enact legislation to meet the evolving needs of a modern State.  To do that to the best of our ability, the elected representatives of the people have always sought the views of, and listened to, their constituents and the public at large.  The high-quality deliberative process that takes place within a citizens' assembly should be considered as complementary to this practice, which has always been at the heart of the democratic system in this country.</p> <p>Understandably, there are differences of opinion about the best sequence of citizens' assemblies.  The Government has taken a position on the matter and has decided to establish and run the assemblies on the directly-elected Dublin mayor and on biodiversity loss first, to be followed as quickly as possible by assemblies on drug use and the future of education.  As I said in my opening statement, the sequencing of these assemblies does not indicate or imply a hierarchy of importance.  It is a recognition that each of the four assemblies committed to in the programme for Government needs adequate time, space and resources to operate as the high-quality deliberative forums they are intended to be.  As I also said in my opening remarks, it would not be feasible or sensible to attempt to run more than two assemblies in parallel.  Indeed, much remains to be seen about the benefits and downsides of running two assemblies consecutively.  This is the first time that it has been attempted.</p> <p>To reiterate, it is the Government's clear intention that the first two assemblies be established at the earliest opportunity and that they also conclude their work at the earliest opportunity.  The terms of reference for the assemblies indicate that they should have their inaugural meetings in early April and report to the Oireachtas by the end of the year at the latest, and earlier if possible.  That is an ambitious timescale but one that allows for the establishment of the assemblies on drug use and the future of education at the earliest opportunity, ideally later this year.</p> <p>It is important also to say that the Government's proposal to include 12 elected councillors on the Dublin citizens' assembly has been carefully calibrated.  On the one hand, it is important that the Dublin citizens' assembly have input from elected councillors.  On the other hand, we must ensure the right balance between members of the public and elected councillors.  Informed by past experience, including from the constitutional convention, the Government is satisfied that its proposals for the Dublin citizens' assembly strikes the right balance in this regard.</p> <p>I will go through some of the remarks made by Senators.  In Senator Dooley's response, he supported the establishment of the assemblies.  I believe I have addressed the issue Senator Boyhan raised.  He is seeking the inclusion of 24 councillors in the assembly.  Other Members of this House want no councillors to be members.  We have tried to strike the right balance there.  There will be representation of parties and Independent councillors across the four councils as a whole.  It is important that, in choosing the nominees, there is cognisance of gender balance.  That is something we are trying to ensure not only among the councillor members but across the spectrum of the selection process I outlined in my opening statement.   </p> <p>Senator Currie referenced the importance of establishing a citizens' assembly on drugs.  I take on board the collective view of this House, and that of the D&aacute;il which was expressed to me when I was there yesterday.  People want to see a citizens' assembly on drugs established quickly.  We take that with sincerity.  We will try to conclude the two we are establishing quickly with a view to setting the other one up in the later part of this year.  </p> <p>To speak to the programme for Government and Government policy on drug use, I was a drug spokesperson in 2016 and 2017 and I share many of the concerns and the views that people have outlined and I know the real experiences of addiction that people face every day.  I know that many people have not been supported by the State.  Services have not been provided and people have been left waiting.  This has happened across communities.  I was a member of the negotiating team in respect of the programme for Government and that programme is very clear that we want a health-led approach to the issue of drugs.  Senator Hoey mentioned care, compassion and dignity in addressing the issue of drugs.  I agree with what everyone said; this issue affects every postcode, every street and everyone across the political spectrum.  It is something we have to confront and address.  The citizens' assembly will play an important role in that regard but it is important that, in parallel and from the perspective of drugs policy and the services we provide, we strengthen the communities we represent and ensure they get the interventions and supports they need, whether with regard to harm reduction, rehabilitation, treatment or drug debt intimidation, an issue which is really impacting many people.  I share and acknowledge many of the concerns that people have raised here today.  As I have said, it is the intention to establish this assembly but also to progress other key areas of drug policy.  We have a duty to follow through on that.  The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and other Ministers are focused on that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Jack Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2429"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2429&amp;amp;pid=JackChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Garvey also mentioned the issue of establishing the citizens' assembly on drugs.  I have addressed that.</p><p>Senator Ward spoke about the importance of accountability.  We will be examining the structures of local government and the importance of ensuring accountability.  I am sure it will form part of that conversation.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke about wanting to have other citizens' assemblies.  Through the shared island unit, the Government is seeking to put the flesh on the bones of the Good Friday Agreement to underpin it with investment.  Through the unit, we are seeing conversations across many policy areas.  Tomorrow we have a shared island unit discussion on sport, for example.  There have been discussions on various aspects such as climate action, sport and tourism.  Building that all-island conversation across key areas is about building a shared island and establishing collaboration and a shared understanding of many issues that affect all aspects of this island.</p><p>Senator Moynihan and many other Senators are supporting Senator Ruane's amendment.  I have tried to respond to it and set out my genuine regard for what people have said.  There is absolute sincerity on this from the Government.  We state in the programme for Government that we want to address the drugs issue using a health-led approach and not the historical approach to drug policy in Ireland.  Senator Kyne addressed the issue of balanced representation through the selection process and the spectrum of 20,000 people being written to that will ensure broad representation.  A lot of work has gone into that.</p><p>I acknowledge the contribution of Senator McDowell to the 2013 Constitutional Convention on the subject of constitutional economic, social and cultural rights.  We have acknowledged his perspective on this and also on Senator Ruane's amendment.  Senator O'Loughlin spoke to the importance of establishing the citizens' assembly on the future of education.  Across the four citizens' assemblies the Government wants to establish, that is also an issue of priority.  Senator Byrne spoke on her experience with the plebiscite in Limerick and her own work on her thesis.  Drafting that legislation is a Government priority and I hope we will see elections following that.</p><p>Senator Hoey gave her perspective on the drugs policy issue and indicated her support for Senator Ruane.  I appreciate what Senator Flynn shared in terms of the experience of many people across society.  We all have to take those experiences and try to mould an appropriate policy response.  The citizens' assembly on drugs, when it is established, will play a key role in resetting the national and also the policy conversation on drugs.  There is good consensus across the political spectrum on the next steps and on having a health-led and much more humane approach to the issue of drugs across society.  This issue impacts many people we know in our daily lives.  We need to respond in a humane way.  </p><p>Senator Higgins spoke on the use of citizens' assemblies to confront and engage with topics and I acknowledge the points she has made.  Senator Craughwell spoke to many of the points others have raised as well.  I certainly share the perspectives that many Senators brought to the House today, as would the Government.  There is a matter of sequencing, and we are carrying that out.  We want the citizens' assemblies established as quickly as possible.  We want to ensure that for all the issues on the table, the four citizens' assemblies have a meaningful policy response from Government.  That is something we are anxious to follow through on.</p><p>In conclusion, the citizens' assemblies will report directly to these Houses and the appropriate committees of the Oireachtas to consider debate and respond to the recommendations of the assemblies.  I am sure that Members present will join me in wishing the members of the two assemblies every success with the work ahead.  I look forward to seeing the fruits of their deliberations.

I welcome the families of the victims of the Stardust fire to the Chamber.  I am proud to introduce the Bill but I would prefer that it was not necessary to do so.  The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Coroners Act of 1962 to facilitate a transparent process of jury selection similar to the process that relates to criminal court cases.</p> <p>Before I speak directly to the Bill, I would like to set out the context in which I am bringing it to the House.  Over 20 years ago, the Department of Justice recognised that the inquest system was not fit for purpose and established a high-level working group to look at how this could be addressed.  In 2000, that expert working group produced a 172-page document outlining the main concerns with the coronial process.  The report called for radical reform and a major reconfiguration of the service.  They rightly pointed out that the coroners service is a service for the living and that it should serve to reassure society as a whole and inform and support those who have been bereaved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The reform process should be evolutionary.  At that time, they said it was important that it would be completed by 2020.  Unfortunately, the only attempt to act on the findings of this report was in 2007 when the then Minister for Justice, Senator McDowell, brought forward a coroner's Bill.  That Bill lapsed with the fall of the then Government, and there appears to be no appetite since then to take on the necessary reform of the inquest process.<br/><br/>In 2021, through frustration at the lack of progress and informed by their experience of working with people directly affected by the failings of coronial process, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, produced an updated report.  This report, like the one of 2000, found that families had experienced further trauma and hardship as a direct consequence of the investigations that followed and that our system can compound and even aggravate the suffering of those affected by the tragic loss of life.  The families who are sitting in the gallery behind me tonight would attest to that fact.  The initial inquest that took place into the fire at the Stardust was rushed and the eminent Professor Phil Scraton, author of the ICCL report, said that it was an abject failure.  To add further insult to injury, the judicial inquiry that followed was, according to Professor Scraton, appalling.  That inquiry made a finding of probably arson, a finding that cast blame on a whole community.  That finding stood on the public record for 28 years.  It was only through the refusal of the families to accept this scurrilous and unfounded accusation that it was finally overturned by an independent review.  It was that same tireless determination that has brought us to the point at which we are today, when new inquests will be heard into the deaths of the 48 young people who tragically lost their lives that terrible night.<br/><br/>It has been a privilege for me to get to know many of the families and to support them in their battle for truth, because they showed an enormous strength of character in the face of what has been systematic abuse by the State for 41 years.  From the manner in which they were informed of their loved ones' death, to the inquests that followed, the whitewash inquires, the insulting compensation and counselling schemes that followed, the families have been failed by this State again and again.  What has not failed the families is the support of the people of Ireland and that has been unwavering.  Anyone over a certain age in Ireland remembers the Stardust.<br/><br/>When the families embarked on the truth postcard campaign, no matter what town in Ireland they were in, people offered their support and to share their story of where they were that night or when the news broke of the scale of the tragedy.  Others spoke of their guilt of how they were they but had escaped, or how they were lucky because they should have been there that night but were called into work.  In one case, a man told me that he fell asleep before he went out.  People took postcards to put in their taxi and shops, and to get their friends and families to sign.  The Dublin Fire Brigade, which remains steadfast in its loyalty to the families, secured thousands of signatures.  In a matter of weeks, 48,000 postcards were signed and delivered to the Attorney General.  It could easily have been 480,000 such was the level of support for the families' campaign for justice.<br/><br/>In September 2019, the Attorney General recognised the overwhelming public interest in this case and rightly agreed to open new inquests.  For the families, it finally feels like justice will prevail and the truth will out.  One of the first requests on the back of that decision by the Attorney General was that any new inquest held would be human rights compliant.  A commitment on this request was given by the Minister's predecessor at the time.  Further assurances were sought, and commitments were given by all party leaders during the 2020 election.  The reason for this was obvious.  It was because the radical reform that was recommended 20 years ago and, again, last year has not happened.  In fact, it has not even begun to happen.  Despite the excellent work done to date by the senior Dublin coroner, Dr. Myra Cullinane, especially in her recent dismissal of the audacious and downright disgraceful attempt by the Butterly legal team to predetermine the outcome of the inquest, some of the concerns we raised when we submitted that request about human rights compliance have been validated.  The issue of the provision of legal aid took months to resolve, yet the issue of cost being a barrier to justice was one of the issues flagged in the first report and in recommendation 22 of the ICCL report.  How did the State think it would be appropriate that after 41 years fighting for justice, the families would be expected to send in their payslips and details of the car they drove just so they could access long-awaited justice?<br/><br/>That leads me to the reason we are here today.  I am proud to introduce this Bill but I should not have to do so.  The Stardust inquest will be the largest and longest inquest in the history of the State.  It will be watched around the world.  Last week's 41st anniversary was broadcast in numerous countries and covered in many newspapers internationally.  Unless steps are taken urgently, the Government will send a message out to the world that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who are, let us not forget, a party to this inquest and will have to answer for the manner in which it preserved the scene of the fire and investigated it afterwards, would be the same body to select the jury.  That is the message the Government is sending out to the world, that there will be no formal transparent process and that the garda&iacute; would present the panel of jurors.  When I asked the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, about this recently, the response was that there is no legal requirement for a jury-led inquest and that somehow having a jury of one's peers is a privilege and not a right.  I commend Dr. Cullinane on her repeated assertions that she does not accept that a juryless inquest is appropriate.  What is more surprising about the fact that the Government is prepared to countenance an inquest without a jury is that when the Attorney General granted the new inquest, he specifically drew parallels with the Hillsborough inquest.  That was not only because there are similarities in the way they were both working-class communities, communities that were initially blamed for what happened, that they were lied to repeatedly by the State and that successive Governments tried for years to cover up what happened, but he also drew parallels because it was the jury that played a crucial role in the Hillsborough inquest.<br/><br/>The Bill I present today is a simple piece of legislation.  It amends the Coroners Act 1962 to allow the coroner to select a jury using the provisions of the Juries Act 1976.  The jurors would be identified from the electoral register, provided that they were eligible under section 6 and 7 of the Juries Act, and they would be summoned by the county registrar.  The selection of persons on the panel would be made by open balloting in open court and each party to the inquest would be able to challenge, without cause, a maximum of seven jurors.  Essentially, it would give effect to recommendations 44 and 45 of the ICCL report.  What the Bill does not address is the matter of income protection for jurors.  That is not to say that I do not agree with that.  Jurors at the Stardust inquest might be <i>in situ</i>for months without any income protection, and we cannot expect jurors to survive on air while they fulfil public service obligations while on jury duty.<br/><br/>I appeal to the Minister to give effect to the contents of this Bill and to take on board the legitimate concerns regarding income protection of jurors at this inquest.  I also call on her to give a firm commitment to the families who sit in the Gallery that under no circumstances will it be a case of an inquest without a jury.  I would like the Minister to reflect on the message that it sends out to not only the families and the huge swell of public support they have behind them, but to the world, if we do not have a transparent jury selection process.  She has an opportunity to draw a line under the systematic abuse that the families have endured for decades.  She does not have the same baggage that others in the Government have.  She is a new generation of politician, so I ask her to please prove that she brings with that a new generation of justice.</p></speech>

First and foremost, all our thoughts are with those who died, those who survived that awful fire and those families who lost loved ones.  Many of them are gathered with us here in the Seanad Chamber today.  I am very proud of my colleague, Senator Boylan, and her determination in bringing this legislation before us today.  She has been a steadfast advocate and a champion voice in the European Parliament and in the Oireachtas for the Stardust families.  I know they recognise and appreciate all of her solidarity, support and hard work over many years.  The introduction and the intention behind this succinct legislation is simple.  While I appreciate that all of the consequences, the trauma, the pain, the hurt and the loss associated with the Stardust fire are anything but simple, what this small, short Bill seeks to do is very simple in its intent.  As Senator Boylan has said, I am equally proud that we are bringing this legislation before Members today but I agree with her that we should not have to.  What does that say about a system that would hear the pleas of long-suffering families who want the fullest and most transparent inquest process and not give it to them?  In my role as an elected representative I have had cause to deal with many families campaigning for truth and justice, some of them for as long as the Stardust families and some of them, for even longer.  I have also journeyed with some of them in more recent years towards the uplifting experience of having an inquest and having the memories of their loved ones vindicated.  I have a very minor and humble insight into what this means to the families but I know that none of us can appreciate fully just what a fully human rights-compliant and transparent inquest would mean to the families.</p><p>We have an opportunity here with this legislation, and not just today because I do not want this to be a stand-alone debate.  If we are serious about supporting this Bill, then we have to action it.  We must ensure that we do not come in here today and say all of the right things, including that we support or do not oppose this Bill but then allow it to hang in the air.  There are real time constraints that matter in relation to the implementation of this legislation that would allow for a jury process in relation to the Stardust inquest.  I hope that we will do the right thing by passing this legislation today and I am confident we will.  However, I do not think any of us can allow it to remain on the shelf.  We must act and we must act quickly.</p><p>The importance of a human rights-compliant inquest process cannot be overstated.  As I said, I had cause, on a number of occasions - sometimes in my capacity as an elected representative, sometimes just walking in as an ordinary citizen - to attend the Ballymurphy massacre inquest.  I know the families of the Stardust fire have the support of the Ballymurphy families and, indeed, the Bloody Sunday families.  The Cathaoirleach joined me for a particularly poignant day when the families had the opportunity to read pen portraits about their loved ones at the Ballymurphy massacre inquest.  What that meant to them to have that space and opportunity to do that and to have the necessary counselling support and the support of the courts.  I want to make the point about just how important that is, and just how important it is that the families, as stakeholders, have that space and opportunity.</p><p>In concluding my remarks, we just passed a motion to establish two citizens' assemblies before this debate started.  That is because we see the merit of engaging our peers, listening to one another and allowing citizens to have the space and a stake in issues of importance.  The families of the Stardust fire are not looking for anything exceptional here.  They are not looking for anything privileged or anything to which they should not be fundamentally entitled.  Senator Boylan has outlined clearly the rationale behind this motion.  I sincerely hope that we can agree on it tonight.  However, as I said, we must ensure that it goes on the books to ensure that when the Stardust inquest begins, it has an open and transparent process attached to it.  We must ensure that that is jury-centred and victim-led.  I second the motion.  </p></speech>

I welcome, in particular, the families of the Stardust tragedy.  I sympathise with them on their terrible loss and, indeed, with the fact that they have had to journey on a long road, and one that has gone on for 41 years.  They are still seeking answers.  That is too long.  I can only speak on behalf of myself and my party.  I certainly will do all I can, and I am sure the Minister will as well, to ensure that the families get what they are entitled to, which is closure.</p> <p>I preface the few words I have to say with those comments before continuing.  From a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective, we are certainly not opposing this Bill.  I compliment my colleagues across the way on bringing forward this legislation.  Anybody who brings forward in good faith any legislation or any action that will result in the families getting closure is to be commended.  I have no problem in doing that.  I am advised that the Bill, as is currently presented, will require amendments.  I am also advised that there are significant technical conflicts in the Bill, as currently drafted, with existing legislation, including the Coroners Act 1962, the Juries Act 1976 and the Courts Service Act 1998.  I have no doubt the Minister will elaborate further on those issues in her contribution.  In light of the concerns and particular circumstances of the Stardust inquest, the Government is considering if any appropriate amendments to the law might be required to make special provision for jury selection.  In this instance, it is vitally important that the work is completed as quickly as possible to ensure that there is no further delay with the inquests.  The current position, as the families well know, is that the Stardust inquests were directed by the then Attorney General in December 2019 in accordance with law.  The coroner has not yet empanelled a jury.  It is my understanding that she has not indicated an issue with the current jury selection procedures.  Since the Attorney General recommended the first inquest into the Stardust tragedy, the Government has ensured that the coroner and the families are provided with all necessary supports.  It is only right and proper that this should be the case.  The coroner, Dr. Cullinane, has begun work.  I understand that 11 pre-inquest hearings have been completed to date, with the 12th one scheduled to take place in mid-March.  As I said in my opening comments, I find heartbreaking the road that the families have had to travel, to be quite honest.  It is terrible to think that the families have had tragedy upon tragedy heaped upon them.  First, they suffered the tragedy of losing loved ones, then they had to travel on a journey to find out the truth of what happened those loved ones.  There is no excuse for that.  Successive Governments need to look at themselves in the mirror as to why the families are sitting in the Chamber today, 41 years after their lives were destroyed and turned upside down.  It is important that we look back and learn from looking back.  We must also let today be the first step in us all working together to ensure that the families can finally have the truth and move on with their lives, knowing that they have done all they possibly can to ensure that the memories of their loved ones, who left prematurely, will not have gone in vain, and that they have done all they can to ensure that the truth is out there for everyone to see.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I look forward to the Minister's comments in that regard.

I take this opportunity to welcome the families.  I have no doubt but that this is not their first visit to Leinster House.  They have had plenty of meetings over the years with various Governments, Ministers and taoisigh, and they are still fighting for justice.  I wish them a speedy conclusion, at least from this vantage point, to these issues.</p> <p>I was a member of the Cabinet when a former Attorney General agreed to a fresh inquest into the Stardust tragedy.  I was only six, I think, when the tragedy happened.  I was too young to remember it, but I have certainly read about it and seen footage of its aftermath.  It comes up quite often on "Reeling in the Years", an excellent programme on a wide range of issues.  Anyone not initially familiar with the tragedy would become familiar with it from those scenes.  The incident was harrowing, unbelievable and so cruel.  The aftermath and the verdict at the time were particularly cruel.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill Senator Boylan has introduced.  There is absolutely merit in looking at jury selection in cases such as this.  Reference has been made to a Bill published by Senator McDowell when he was a Minister.  That legislation would have dealt with many of the issues relating to jury selection.  A combination of measures in both Bills, with the assistance of the Department and the Attorney General, could fast-track a definite course of action in respect of this matter.  Jury selection in these cases seems to be at the discretion of the Garda.  I have heard that in certain areas the same or a small group of people come in for every inquest, which is not the way things should be done.  It should be similar to the practice for juries for trials.  It is important that this be changed and that people have full confidence in the process.  I therefore support the Bill.  I hope that the Minister will support it, certainly in its spirit, and that, together with what the former Minister, Senator McDowell, published, we can come to a better system of selection for inquests.</p> <p>I spoke previously about inquests, on a Private Member's Bill in the Lower House, and mentioned a scenario that arose.  I wish to put it on the record again if the Minister is looking at changes and issues in respect of coroners, albeit not specifically in respect of jury selection in this case.  I came across a case in which a next of kin, through some sorts of mistakes, was not invited to the inquest into her own mother's passing.  I wish to put on the record that this did not happen in Galway; I will not say where it happened.  It caused huge upset to that individual, who was looking forward to speaking her mind and giving her thoughts to an inquest into her mother's passing.  The inquest was held and was over by the time she found out about it.  That was heartbreaking for the person involved.  It seemed to be some sort of oversight involving the Garda telling a family member and that word not getting through.  What happened was unbelievable.  That girl was an only child.  Her father had died previously and her mother had died in this case.  She was not notified of the inquest.  I raise that case just in case there are changes down the line in respect of coroners.  It is an issue that has to be rectified.</p> <p>Getting back to the scenario at hand, there are issues.  The points Senator Boylan raised about ensuring that the process is fully transparent have validity.  The families were not satisfied, society was not satisfied and the D&aacute;il and the Oireachtas were not satisfied with the original decision, so it is important in the case of this fresh inquest that the decision has been made that there must be full confidence in the process.  That starts with a jury in respect of which people can have confidence its members are picked fairly and transparently, and randomly, or however it can be done, as is done in other cases.  I hope that the Minister can take on board the spirit of the Bill and work with it to provide a speedy conclusion to this too-long-running saga and that justice will finally be received.</p></speech>

It is an honour to have them here in the Chamber.  They are very welcome here.  These are their Houses.  I am also very proud to call Senator Boylan a colleague.  I commend her on her work, and I am proud to co-sign this legislation.</p> <p>As Senator Boylan stated, the Bill involves a basic amendment to the Coroners Act 1962 to deal with the transparent process of jury selection, as we have in criminal court cases.  More than 20 years ago - it is hard to imagine that 2000 is well over 20 years ago - the Department of Justice recognised that the inquest system was not fit for purpose and it established a working group to look at how that could be addressed.  In 2021, due to frustration with the ongoing lack of progress and the experience of people directly affected by the failings of the coroners process, the ICCL produced an updated report.  That report set out 52 recommendations.  Recommendations 44 and 45 of the report call for juries to be randomly selected from the electoral register and, in high-profile or contested cases, for lawyers representing interested parties to be able to challenge the constitution of the jury.</p> <p>The Stardust inquest will be the largest inquest in the history of the State.  It ill be watched around the world.  The bare minimum that should be expected is that the evidence will be heard by a jury that is selected in a manner that is transparent and representative of wider society.  Likewise, any suggestion that an inquest of this size could be heard without a jury, a suggestion recently made by the Government, should be dismissed under section 40 of the Coroners Act.  The Bill allows for the simple and transparent selection process of the jury at the Stardust inquest, similar to the jury selection for a criminal court case.  Under the current inquest process, the jury is selected by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I said, this inquest will be the largest in the history of the State and will be watched internationally.  At a bare minimum, it should be heard by a jury selected in a manner that is transparent and representative of wider society.  It would not be appropriate for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is part of this inquest, to select that jury.</p> <p>This is simple legislation.  I am proud to co-sign it.  The families have had enough of judge-led investigations.  They have a right to have the evidence heard by a jury of their peers.  My understanding is that the coroner involved in this case wants a jury.  I know that Senator Boylan will come in at the end of the debate to expand on that point.  I welcome the families again to their Houses and thank them for coming.  I am proud to co-sign the Bill and I appreciate that the Government will not oppose it.</p></speech>

I wish to pay tribute to Senator Boylan, who I have watched over the years, as a former MEP and now as a Senator, working with the Stardust families and advocating for them on both national and European levels.  Her commitment to this cause cannot be questioned.</p> <p>It goes without saying that the fact the families have been left without answers and forced to continue to fight for justice for this length of time is one of the great shames in our country.  While the Government is not opposing this Bill, I ask that it takes a serious look at it and tries to enact it before it is too late.  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said, there is a time constraint with this.  This affects not just the Stardust victims and the inquest into that, but it affects a wider group of people as well as the inquest system.  It is important the Bill is in place for a group of people who have had to fight for truth and justice for 41 years.</p> <p>As Senator Boylan said, this is a case very similar to Hillsborough, in that people were blamed for what befell them at that Valentine&rsquo;s disco.  I watched the Hillsborough inquest and saw the relief on the families' faces when they were finally able to point to what happened and when the truth came out.</p> <p>This Bill is simple, although the Fianna F&aacute;il speaker, Senator Gallagher, spoke about a number of things that it could impact and affect.  It is an amendment to the Coroners Act, which is an existing Act.  If that is the case, I hope the Government will look at that and in a timely manner bring forward an alternative.</p> <p>There are two issues that remain outstanding.  The first is the selection of jury and the second is the remuneration of that jury.  It is simply wrong when it comes to an inquest of this size, scale and potential length that juries would not be selected as they would be in criminal cases and would not be remunerated.  It is only right that people have income protection for the effort and time.  It cannot happen if the possibility remains that this inquest, in theory, can happen without a jury.  For these reasons, we support the provisions in the Bill that aim to compensate jurors, which is very important, as well as in respect of jury selection.  If that is not provided for, the potential pool of jurors may be reduced even further and that is no way to run an inquest such as this given its size, scale and length and the fact it is 41 years after justice should have been done.  The victims, survivors, families and local community in Artane deserve just that.</p> <p>The previous Attorney General who is now Supreme Court judge approved the call for this inquest while noting previously that there has been an insufficient inquiry into how the deaths occurred.  I have no doubt the coroner will make every attempt to ensure that this does not happen again, but that has to be supported by the State and in terms of how the inquest is designed.</p> <p>Last year we had the families left ineligible for legal aid.  To be fair, that has been addressed, but it never should have happened.  Now we have the issue relating to jury selection and compensation.  It is unacceptable that the families of the Stardust fire victims seem to come against barrier after barrier.  The stress of all of these oversights and delays adds up.  It adds insult to injury and it has added up over the past 41 years.</p> <p>Essentially, this comes down to establishing the truth.  Those affected by the Stardust tragedy have the right to the truth and the respect that they deserve in finding out the truth about what happened that Valentine&rsquo;s night.  They have consistently not been treated with respect.  That is continuing to this day by way of those oversights in relation to legal aid and jury selection.</p> <p>We fully support this Bill.  There is no comfort without justice and the truth.  The ball is in the Government&rsquo;s court to bring forward an amendment to the Coroners Act to allow this to be dealt with in a timely manner and to finally, after 41 years, give the families the justice they deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#DDD00200"><p>I apologise for being brief in my comments, but I wanted to contribute as I was very moved.  Senator Boylan has championed this issue so passionately and consistently.  She has raised it in every aspect and has looked, campaigned and pushed for justice.  I want to commend Senator Boylan, in particular, on this issue.  It is one of the issues of genuine heart, love and drive for justice that I have seen moved through the Seanad.</p> <p>I want to indicate formally the Civil Engagement Group&rsquo;s support for the Bill and our support for the importance of ensuring that justice is done and delivered in a way which is true to the public.  The public needs to see it being done and to see a jury selected in the same way as in a criminal case and to know it is a genuine cross-section of the public coming forward.  </p> <p>The families have been failed by instruments of the State and by instruments of justice in the past.  It is very important that this process and the inquest reflects the full public and it is not seen as being owned or controlled by any of the instruments which have perhaps fallen short in the past.  In that regard, it is vital that there is a proper, appropriate public selection process and the same process that would apply in a criminal case.  This is a small change and the Minister has made bigger and more dramatic changes, and often changes for justice, in fairness, during her tenure.  Again, this is a small and real change that could be made.</p> <p>Again, the issue of the battle for legal aid has been so substantial that it should certainly not be the case again that we would see an issue of finances affecting who can participate in a jury or who might participate in this.  We need to make sure there is no question in regard to structures of power already or financial limitations serving to limit this being a genuine instrument of justice in terms of the inquiries.  Again, I urge the Minister to support &ndash; I know she will not oppose it - and deliver the changes we need to make sure justice is finally given and a light shown, as needs to be done, on these issues.  Again, I commend the proposers of the Bill and welcome those in the Gallery.</p></speech>

This is one of a long number of traumas that they have faced.  They should not have to be here today.  That is the reality of it.</p> <p>I grew up in Raheny and I was seven years old that night and I remember it very well.  However, no one has the experience that any of the families have in relation to the events of that day.  I was listening to the debate in my office and I heard some of the Senators say it is shocking that we are still here 41 years later.  Actually, we are only starting a process 41 years on.  </p> <p>The families have been waiting for justice all of that time.  Although I am glad we are finally coming to the beginning of that, it should not, as I said, have taken this long.  The original inquest finding was very disappointing, to say the least.  There is now finally an opportunity to establish the facts and give families the truth about what happened that night.</p> <p>However, there have been so many obstacles and delays in the process, whether it is around legal aid, the choice of venue or resourcing.  All of these things have played a part in almost retraumatising people.  So often we come in here and talk about retraumatising people and it is through our legislative process and often through our juries because of the selection process.  I absolutely appreciate and support Senator Boylan&rsquo;s Bill and what she is trying to achieve.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are often technical issues with Bills and that is what later Stages are for.  I hope to hear from the Minister what she can do to replicate this in some way, if the technical aspects of it are as great as we have been led to believe.  Some of these things can be done and can be achieved.  I know that 47 of the 48 families were deemed to be above the threshold for legal aid.  This seems quite surprising.  It shows that the level of trauma the families are going through is not being taken into account and it should be.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, signed regulations to allow legal aid on an exceptional basis for the Stardust inquest regardless of means.  I hope to see progress with this.  It is a very good move.</p><p>Finding a venue has been a challenge.  Why is this the case?  The D&aacute;il and Seanad were in the convention centre.  That happened pretty fast.  The pre-inquest hearings were in the RDS.  Almost inexplicably, that lease is coming to an end this month.  I know the Minister has guaranteed another venue.  This is trauma after trauma.  No one should have to fight this hard for justice.  We call ourselves a developed country but people fight for their own justice and have to advocate for themselves.  We are all here today trying to advocate as well but we should not be here doing so 41 years later.</p><p>I thank the families for coming along.  I am thinking of all of those who are not here this evening.  There are the 48 who lost their lives but more than 200 people were hurt that night as well.  I am thinking of all of them.  Listening to debate after debate and finding venues has an impact on the hundreds of families and on all of us who lived around that time and who used to go past the Stardust and who saw it play out in front of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-23a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022022300002#EEE00200"><p>I welcome the families.  It is important they are here this evening to witness the Bill.  I commend my colleague, Senator Lynn Boylan, not just on this evening but on her tireless work over many years on this issue in support of the families.  I remember exactly where I was when I heard the news about the Stardust.  I was getting up for school at home in Westmeath.  I was 15 years of age.  My father told me something awful had happened in Dublin.  I remember the look of horror on his face as he listened to the radio that morning.  It was the horror any parent or human being would feel when hearing about the unspeakable events unfolding.  It was and remains the biggest disaster the State has ever known.</p> <p>I do not think anyone could have foreseen how those 48 victims and their families would have been blackguarded, ignored, disrespected and treated with contempt by the State for more than four decades.  I salute their courage, resilience and fortitude in never giving up on their quest for truth and justice.  At the heart of their struggle is that small word we rarely hear mentioned in the Chamber, which is "class".  Does anyone seriously think that if these events happened to residents from leafy middle-class suburbs in south Dublin they would have been left waiting more than 40 years for justice?  As the victims were from the working-class community of Artane, they were effectively disregarded by the State.  Worse than this, they were stigmatised by the 1981 tribunal with the deeply flawed conclusion that the fire had been started deliberately.  This conclusion was subsequently overturned 28 years later but the damage had been done.  As one Stardust relative said, calling those children arsonists was the worst thing they ever did.</p> <p>The obstacles the State has put in the way of these relatives has been detailed by my colleague, Senator Boylan.  It took a sit-in in Government Buildings to force an independent review.  After a nationwide campaign of 48,000 signed postcards, they won the right to fresh inquests for their loved ones.  Then followed the scandalous Government stance on legal aid for the families, an issue only resolved after the threat of a judicial review based on the European Convention on Human Rights.  Respectfully I say to my colleague Senator Gallagher, when he says families have been provided with all of the necessary supports it was only after one hell of a battle on the part of the families.</p> <p>I will quote survivor Antoinette Keegan.  She said "we want all the obstacles that&rsquo;s in our way to be removed so when the inquest is ready to start, that we&rsquo;re up and running and ready to go."  She also said, "There are too many undue delays in the whole lot of this and it is time now that they all stop" and that "The inquest will not be proceeding if we don&rsquo;t have a jury."  I do not think anyone here can disagree with one word of this.  The idea the inquest would not have a jury is entirely unacceptable because judge-led investigations have failed these people.</p> <p>The ball is very much in the Minister's court.  She needs not only to not oppose the Bill but she needs to embrace it.  She needs to give a commitment here to fast-track it.  I acknowledge this is a request Senator Kyne made in his speech also.  This is so it can become law in good time for the inquest.  The Government needs to do better.  The response cited by the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, earlier that there is no legal requirement for a jury-led inquest is really insulting to the people behind me.  We have to do better.  The Minister has an opportunity to do better this evening.  How could she countenance the possibility of this inquest not having a jury?  Does she not have a solemn duty, given what these families have been through, to ensure there is a jury, that it is selected openly and in a transparent manner and that it is adequately compensated?  Is this not actually the least the Minister can do?</p> <p>The most disappointing aspect of this, and I hope it will not happen and I am genuinely looking forward, as are all colleagues in the Chamber, to the Minister's response, would be to have this debate and then for nothing to happen as a response.  There is a Bill here.  It is a simple Bill.  If there are changes required, let us make those changes.  We know how quickly legislation can be passed through these two Houses.  We saw it during Covid.  We know that ten years ago, legislation was passed for the banks in just 48 hours.  These people have been waiting 41 years.  Here is an opportunity for the Minister, as a reforming Minister, to do the right thing this evening and endorse the Bill, not just not oppose it but say she will endorse it and ensure there will be a jury, that it will be fairly selected and ensure the inquests go ahead as, I hope, each and every one of us want them to.  I look forward to the words of the Minister.  Please take this opportunity and embrace the Bill and support the families sitting behind us.</p></speech>

I join colleagues in welcoming family members to the Seanad.  I acknowledge each and every one of them.  I acknowledge what they have been through and continue to go through and I wish to say how sorry I am that after 41 years, we are still here.  I acknowledge that 41 years ago, 48 young people went out on a night out, as we all have done, to enjoy themselves and celebrate St. Valentine's Day and never came home.  As colleagues have said, more than 200 other people were injured in the fire and this had an impact not only on their families but on a very close-knit community in north Dublin.  It has marked the community with tragedy forever.  While I was not alive at the time it happened, I know and have seen since then that the country has grieved with each and every one of the families.  We sincerely admire their determination in keeping the memories of their loved ones alive in the years since.  Each of the 48 young people was unique with their own hopes, ambitions and dreams.  All were taken too soon and in the cruellest of ways.  The reverberations of their loss have been felt through the generations of their families.  I have no doubt it has been a heavy loss to bear for each and every one of them.</p> <p>The families have spoken of their need for their voices to be heard to speak for and about their loved ones.  The decision by the former Attorney General in September 2019 to direct fresh inquests into their deaths gives the families this opportunity.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The pen portraits that will be heard at inquests will be a key part of that process.  Just knowing the names of the 48 young people is not enough.  In order to fully acknowledge what the families have lost, we need to understand who they were as people.  We need to learn of their lost potential and the devastating impact this has had on their families, friends and wider communities.</p><p>Several challenges have arisen in arranging an inquest of this scale and complexity.  My Department has genuinely tried to address them constructively and in as sensitive a way as possible.  My role and that of my Department is to support the senior Dublin coroner, Dr. Myra Cullinane, who has been given the task of carrying out the inquests.  It is important to state that, as I know everyone present is aware, the coroner is, by law, fully independent in the conduct of these inquests.  We are here to support her in her work.  Since the Attorney General directed that fresh inquests into the Stardust tragedy are required, my Department and I have again tried to ensure the coroner and, indeed, the family members - those who are here and those who are not - are provided with all the necessary supports.  This includes the fit-out of the bespoke Covid-compliant courtroom in the RDS.   A Senator asked about the delivery, venue and complexities.  Unfortunately, Covid has compounded those complexities.</p><p>Access to civil legal aid has also been provided for the families.  I again acknowledge that took longer than people would like, but it is available regardless of people's means and on an exceptional basis.  Earlier this month, a new venue for the Stardust inquest was confirmed, namely, the Pillar Room in the Rotunda Hospital.  This follows extensive engagement on the part of my Department with the Office of Public Works in order to secure an appropriate venue in advance of the expiry of the RDS contract at the end of the month.  I am pleased the new venue has been warmly welcomed by the families.</p><p>My Department has developed a website for the inquest, assigned additional staff to the office of the Dublin coroner and facilitated the appointment of legal and expert guidance to try to support the coroner in her important work.  Dr. Cullinane has begun that work.  As Senators outlined, 11 pre-inquest hearings have been completed to date, with the 12th scheduled to take place in mid-March.  Where challenges have arisen, we have worked with the coroner and her team to overcome them, with the needs of the families always at the forefront of our minds.  I know the motivation of the Senators in sponsoring this Bill is based on the needs of the families and that is why the Government is not opposing the Bill.</p><p>I am keen to find an appropriate resolution to the issues raised, not just one that complies with the requirements of coronial law and the general principle that service on a jury is part of every citizen's civic duty.  I am also mindful of the fact that a number of pre-inquest hearings have been held and certain matters have been determined.  Of course, I want to be sensitive to the needs of each and every member of the families.  In light of the concerns raised and the particular circumstances of the Stardust inquests, I am considering if appropriate amendments to the law can be made to require to make special provision for jury selection in this instance.  I reassure the families and the sponsoring Senators that this work will be completed as quickly as possible so as to ensure there is no delay to the inquests</p><p>As my colleague outlined, Senator McDowell, during his period as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, published the Coroners Bill 2007, which, among other things, proposed changes to the operation of juries at inquests.  I assure Senators and the House that I will give his proposals, as well as those in the Bill before us, full consideration as we try to find a resolution that will allow the Stardust inquests to proceed in a fair way.</p><p>When he directed the new Stardust inquests, the then Attorney General did so in line with the current coronial law under the Coroners Act 1962.  Section 43 of that Act prescribes the method of jury selection for an inquest.  As has been stated, there is no legal basis to summon one.  In practice, juries are not empanelled for many inquests.  However, I do understand the Dublin coroner considers it to be necessary in the Stardust inquests and I will not stand in her way.  I want to make that clear this evening.  It is important to understand the function of a jury at an inquest is significantly different from that of a jury in a civil or criminal trial.  No matters of liability or exoneration may be pronounced either by the jury or the coroner at an inquest, but I do understand the significance and importance in this instance and the reason that Members and the families who are here wish for it to apply.</p><p>As I stated, the Government will not oppose the Bill, although, as outlined, there are technical difficulties with it.  There are implications for a number of other Acts.  We are considering the Bill and others.  We want to make sure we can progress as quickly as possible.</p><p>As I stated, if the coroner decides, as she has, that a jury is necessary, I will not prevent that from happening.  What I will do, as I have tried to do throughout this entire process and in the past year and a half, is to work with Senators and the families to support them at every stage possible. I assure them it will not be the case that nothing happens after this evening.  We will work speedily to make sure we can resolve this matter.  I again assure the families that I will work with them and make sure everything we do can to support them, and the coroner in her work, is done as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I know the Bill is not perfect, given the nature of the issue and timescale in which it was presented, but at least the Minister is listening to the concerns that have been raised by the families.  I know the coroner herself, Dr. Myra Cullinane, has facilitated the broadest scope or interpretation of the law when it comes to the Stardust inquest because she is working in a flawed system.  It is not just that we need to fix this issue for the Stardust inquest and the very specific concerns relating to jury selection; we need to go back to the recommendations made by the independent working group in 2000 and the 52 recommendations made by the ICCL in 2021.  We need to heed what they are saying.  Ireland is an outlier.  We are not serving people well with our inquest system.  We are failing them, re-traumatising them and making the circumstances of their bereavement worse.  I hope the Minister takes those recommendations on board but there is an obvious time constraint in the context of addressing the issues we are discussing today.</p> <p>The coroner has done as much as she can in terms of interpretation of the law.  She has invited new witnesses who did not give evidence at the previous judge-led inquiries or the original inquests to come forward.  She has facilitated the use of pen portraits which, as Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile stated, had a profound effect at the Ballymurphy inquest.  Not only did they put faces and names to the victims, they gave them personalities and memories and made it clear that these were people who walked the earth and had lives that were taken from them that night.  I again commend the coroner on facilitating those pen portraits in the Stardust inquest process.  What she has clearly stated in the pre-inquest hearings is that she will not accept a non-jury inquest but she also is saying her hands are tied in the context of the selection process and she needs legislative change in order to fix that.</p> <p>I feel reassured that the Minister has heard the concerns expressed tonight, is giving assurances there will not be a non-jury inquest and that she will work speedily to ensure there is no delay to the inquest.  She has also assured us that the concerns in respect of the selection process and the income protection for jurors will be addressed.
