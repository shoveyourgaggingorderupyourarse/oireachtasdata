I welcome my colleague and friend the Minister of State.  It is good to see him in particular, as he has a strong record on planning and environmental considerations and is a major champion of the Aarhus Convention.  It is important this Commencement matter is dealt with in this way.  It is very timely we are dealing with this item today because there is a very substantial piece in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>by Mr. Colm Keena, the legal affairs correspondent, on new proposals around judicial review.  I have a copy of the edition to hand, which I can give to the Minister of State later when we leave the Chamber.  The article suggests new proposals would see an individual having to pay up to &euro;5,000 and a legal entity &euro;10,000 towards a notice party&rsquo;s costs when a notice party successfully defends a judicial review.  That is outrageous and a disgrace and I hope it will not happen on the watch of the Green Party in government.  I do not think it will.  I am confident enough in the Green Party to know it will resist it and I again call for this to not happen.  The fact that this has even got life and been published in this morning's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>must be of concern to environmentalists and to the Green Party.  I opened the newspaper this morning in my office and read of these proposals.</p><p>I return to the kernel of the matter.  We know the housing planning system is in crisis over judicial reviews; the Minister of State knows it, I know it and we all know it.  However, it is not the objectors who are the problem but the fact that there are major concerns about strategic housing developments, SHDs.  Submissions were made in an interim report on SHDs and all of them were ignored.  I have engaged exhaustively with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and its documentation and correspondence and have also gleaned knowledge from my active involvement in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I will state three things: An Bord Plean&aacute;la has lost 90% of completed judicial reviews lodged against its decisions on SHDs; An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been the subject of 33 completed judicial reviews since the SHD fast-track process was launched in 2017; and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has lost 29 judicial reviews, 14 of which it conceded without a hearing and 15 which it conceded following the full court hearings and judgments.  That is the reality I want to put on the record of the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> There is a problem with the SHDs and we need to address it.  There are concerns about development, industry, jobs and homes, and I share them.  The process is flawed; it is a disgrace and should never have been put into the programme for Government but the Green Party had to compromise.  I engaged with the Green Party and it told me it had to compromise, which I recognise, but let us see the end to the SHD process.  Let us not take it out on environmentalists or citizens.  Let us empower city and county councillors and citizens to engage on an SHD application or any other.  The current SHD plan process excludes individuals from a third-party appeal in their local planning authority.  It excludes environmentalist groups, such as Friends of the Earth and An Taisce, which have a view.  It might not always be the right view but it should be aired.  I acknowledge I am talking to a Minister of State who is fiercely committed to all the engagement to which I refer so let us have that engagement.  If we have to have reform, let us have it on the timelines but let us not penalise or punish people for engaging.  Let us adhere to the principles of the Aarhus Convention, to which the Green Party, including the Minister of State, is committed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this issue.  I share his concerns and his interest in the Aarhus Convention and public participation in general.  I am glad of the opportunity to update Senators on the reform of the judicial review provisions in the Planning and Development Act and the related matter of the proposed establishment of the environmental and planning court, both of which are important commitments in Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.</p> <p>The general scheme of the Housing and Planning and Development Bill 2019, which was published in late 2019 and has since been the subject of a public consultation process, sets out an initial outline of the revisions to the judicial review provisions in sections 50 to 50B of the Planning and Developments Acts.  The general scheme was incorporated in the Government's legislation programme for the autumn session of 2020 among the list of the general schemes to undergo pre-legislative scrutiny.  However, given the range of other legislative measures proposed by my Department for scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage in the earlier period of the current Government's tenure, it was not possible to progress the general scheme as envisaged.</p> <p>Further to the programme for Government commitment on the judicial review provisions and having regard to the increasing number of judicial review challenges being taken against planning decisions, particularly regarding large-scale housing developments such as the SHDs, which is undermining efforts to increase housing supply, combined with the knock-on implications for project delivery, including strategic infrastructure developments under the national development plan required to meet the demands of a growing economy, the Government is now anxious that the legislative process on reforming the judicial review provisions can be activated and progressed as soon as possible.</p> <p>My Department is currently engaging with the joint Oireachtas committee on the arrangements in this regard and I hope the process can be facilitated at the earliest opportunity.  However, I assure the House that it is intended that the reforms of the judicial review provisions would be in line with our EU law obligations on public participation under the Aarhus Convention.</p> <p>With regard to the proposed new environmental and planning court, it is intended that it will be established as a division of the High Court simultaneous with the coming into effect of the judicial review reforms.  My Department has already been engaging with the Department of Justice on the legislative and practical aspects associated with the establishment of the new court, which will require the resourcing of further dedicated judges upon establishment.</p> <p>I support Senator Boyhan on the points raised.  Public participation is and should be a cornerstone of our democracy.  I was involved in cases to test the early provisions of the Aarhus Convention when it came into effect in Irish law.  It is critical that community groups and NGOs have the right to participate fully in our judicial system when it comes to planning.  I support that.  There is a commitment within the programme for Government to move away from token consultation towards a more participative and inclusive planning system.  That is something we would all more than welcome. </p></speech>

I am happy with it.  It was a coincidence that today's <i>The Irish Times</i>carried the story.  However, on 15 June 2021, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, wrote to the committee, of which I am a member, and referred to Programme for Government: Our Shared Vision and his requirement to examine again the general scheme of the Housing and Planning and Development Bill 2019, to which the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, referred.  I am fully supportive of the request of the Minister of State, Deputy Burke.  I proposed that this request be accepted by the committee and that we would engage in pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Minister of State expressed his concern and said he hoped the committee would consider the matter.  I thank the Ministers of State, particularly Deputy Peter Burke, because he has been proactive in this area.  That is where we can do a lot of the lifting.  Let us not take our eye off the ball, however.  Let us not punish or disadvantage good environmentalist citizens who want to engage in our process.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, for coming to the House to deal with this Commencement matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#B00400"><p>I have just been handed a copy of the article in question.  In the early stages of the Aarhus Convention being brought into effect in Irish law, I was one of several people who took a case seeking a not prohibitively expensive order to protect us from legal costs given that we were community activists at the time.  It is important that communities, individuals and environmental organisations have the right to take legal proceedings without being unduly affected.  That is what the Aarhus Convention is about.  It is about access to environmental justice, access in a way that is timely and access to environmental information.  It is vital that we have fair and transparent judicial and planning systems.  Again, I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.</p></speech>

This is the first morning on which she is going to chair a session of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  As Members know, her appointment by the Taoiseach as the first member of the Traveller community to serve in the Oireachtas was hailed by Pavee Point and the National Women's Council as historic.  The father of the House, Senator Norris, talked about it as being a huge advance for Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the Oireachtas as a whole.  I now ask Senator Flynn to chair a session of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

It is very nice to see her in the Chair today.  The Minister of State is very welcome to the House.  I am grateful he is taking this Commencement matter.</p> <p>The shared island unit is one of the many commitments in the programme for Government that has interested and excited me.  The historical significance of the unit is underestimated.  For the first time in the State's history, we have a dedicated unit whose sole responsibility is to examine policy, infrastructure and the future of this island on an all-island basis.  We see from the recent announcement on Narrow Water bridge and the Ulster Canal a belief in the importance of the shared island and what it can do.  These projects symbolise a belief in the people of the Border region and what it can achieve.  It is right, as we enter a new century, that we look forward progressively and inclusively, harnessing all the talent and resources that this beautiful island holds.  That is why I ask the Department of the Taoiseach's shared island unit to allocate funds to commence inclusive engagement with schools all across the island.  This would symbolise the belief among our young people and their ability to shape the future.  It is necessary that we seek to encourage our young people to dream, imagine and then create the impossible.  Young people look at things without the many barriers we oldies face.  They are the future.  Helping them now to create the future they dream of is our responsibility.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I absolutely commend the work done to date by the thousands of people who have come together in civic engagement sessions.  It is very welcome.  The Acting Chair, Senator Flynn, has been part of this civic engagement also.  My proposal is possibly a model similar to the BT Young Scientist, whereby we create a space for young people to share their views, create projects and challenge themselves on how we move forward together over the next 100 years.  People on the island have worked together for many centuries.  Let us work together, no matter what the constitutional status of the two jurisdictions.  Get young people talking and tackling the issues of unionism and republicanism, how to improve on the <i>status quo</i>or how to reunite the island.  It is not us who have to live with the consequences of our decisions, it is our children who must do so.  I want them to create the narrative that we can help to implement.<br/><br/>We are in agreement.  From his previous portfolio as education spokesperson, the Minister of State knows, that education creates changes.  It is through education that changes will be made, challenges will be overcome and friendships will be developed.  As a consequence, we will have a positive shared future.  Under this, there will be no doubt this positive future will grow.  Prejudices, mistrust and fear of the unknown will disappear only through this dialogue and increased co-operation.  Education is something in which we all partake and we must educate everyone on the island on our history and our shared history to appreciate one's identity as British or Irish and to encourage a space where one's identity is not threatened by someone else's belief and we can all be confident in ourselves.  This is why I hope the school projects challenging our wonderful young people are a positive step.  I acknowledge the announcement this morning of &euro;40 million for all-Ireland higher education research projects.  It shows the shared island unit has a real emphasis on education and bringing the work of the unit to our secondary schools would be very progressive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#C00200"><p>My best wishes to the Acting Chair, Senator Flynn, not just in the role this morning, which is significant, but I hope for her and her community that it will become routine and part of the normal fabric of our society.  This is very important.  I thank the Acting Chair for all the work she is doing.</p> <p>I thank Senator McGreehan for taking a patriotic approach to the island rather than an ultra-nationalistic approach of division.  Senator McGreehan has taken a unifying approach on the issue of this island, and this is especially relevant given where she comes from on the Border.  I thank her for raising the important role of schools and education.  The Taoiseach has asked me to respond to the points that she has raised.</p> <p>The shared island initiative aims to harness the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement to enhance co-operation, connection and mutual understanding on the island, engaging with all communities and traditions to build consensus around a shared future.  The Taoiseach established the shared island unit in his Department to act as a driver and co-ordinator of this whole-of-government approach.  In the budget, the Government established a shared island fund, committing &euro;500 million in capital funding out to 2025, ring-fenced for investment in North-South projects.  The Taoiseach has already announced substantial investments in long-standing all-Ireland projects that, quite frankly, were hanging around for too long, including the Ulster Canal and Narrow Water bridge.  I thank Senator McGreehan for her work in pursuing the Narrow Water bridge project.  It will be not just nationally important infrastructure but also a crucial piece of local infrastructure on the Cooley Peninsula and in south County Down.  As mentioned, research collaboration on the island is also a priority for the fund.  The Government is working with the Northern Ireland Executive, the British Government and other partners to deliver cross-Border capital investments that meet our objectives to enhance our shared island.</p> <p>The programme for Government also includes a shared island commitment to expand the North-South school exchange programme.  This affirms the Government's commitment under the New Decade, New Approach agreement to build on the success of the first pilot programme of bringing young people together from schools, North and South, with a target of achieving 100 cross-Border engagements per annum within a five-year period.  This objective is being taken into account as part of the development of the EU PEACE PLUS programme from 2022 onwards, under the theme of empowering and investing in young people.  The PEACE PLUS programme is unique because it is funding by the EU, the Irish Government and the British Government.  With all the talk of division and a lack of a joint approach, the PEACE PLUS programme is a practical example of everybody working together and it is very important.</p> <p>A second pilot North-South school exchange programme has received support under the reconciliation fund of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This programme and funding commitment by the Government makes an important contribution to the objective the Senator has raised, of bringing young people in schools throughout the island together, as they look to the future.</p> <p>In launching the shared island initiative last October, the Taoiseach initiated the shared island dialogue, to which Senator McGreehan referred, to foster inclusive civic dialogue on key issues for our shared future.  He highlighted the vital role that young people have to play in shaping the future of this island.  The Taoiseach also addressed the first shared island dialogue with young people in November on the theme of new generations and new voices on the Good Friday Agreement.  The participation and contribution of younger generations has been actively sought in the series of shared island dialogues that have been held so far this year.  This will continue to be a priority in the Government's approach to fostering inclusive civic dialogue as part of the shared island initiative.</p></speech>

We are all on the same page.  I thank the Minister of State for delivering the message from An Taoiseach and I thank An Taoiseach for all his work.  He has been dedicated and he is a huge driver of an all-Ireland conversation.  I very much welcome the North-South school exchange programme.  It is very positive and good news.  I hope it will be expanded into something similar to the BT Young Scientist.  It is an example of how we can create the dialogue, friendships and future we want on this island.  I thank the Minister of State for his time.</p></speech>

I will also bring it to the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach.  Expanding the North-South school exchange programme is a crucial part of the programme for government commitments on a shared island.  We need to bring young people together.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned that I was an education spokesperson.  Quite frankly, the number of educational movements North and South is not as high as we would think.  Half of my class in college was from the North, as was the case in two other classes in Trinity College Dublin at that time.  I was always of the impression that the number was huge because it was in my direct experience but then I found out when I was education spokesperson that it was not.  We do have to address this and get more movement North and South, particularly in higher and further education.  This would lead to significant benefits for everybody, for young people, for reconciliation and for the island.</p></speech>

It is lovely to see her in the Chair today.  I thank the Minister of State for joining us today.  I hope he will provide a pathway to dealing with this very serious issue.  The absence of the Minister in charge is noted.</p><p>I have several questions.  What action is the Government taking to deal with the high levels of radon gas which affect more than 500,000 homes?  Does the Minister intend to provide assistance towards grants for testing for radon gas?  Last week, I spoke about radon, which is a radioactive gas linked to 300 lung cancer cases each year.  I spoke about the lethal gas, which is the second largest cause of lung cancer in this country.  I spoke about it creating 14% of the lung cancer cases which present in our hospitals each year.  I also spoke about the fact that one third of this country is classified as a high radon area by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  What I did not mention last week is the fact that we have particular geology in Ireland which means that this radioactive gas is emitted by igneous rocks.  As a result, radon is trapped by our homes at a higher rate than in other countries.  There are 500,000 homes at risk here.  I was shocked to read in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>that the members of a household in Sligo were exposed to radiation levels equivalent to having 15 chest X-rays every day because of radon gas in the ground beneath their home.  This dose is 22 times higher than the level regarded as acceptable and left the people in the property at increased risk of lung cancer.  The article to which I refer is a year old.  What has been done about the matter?</p><p>Radon gas is odourless, colourless and tasteless.  It seeps through the soil and enters buildings through small cracks, holes or imperfections that may exist in floor areas or gaps around pipes or cables.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is nothing that a household or an employer can do about it.  There is nothing that a family in County Sligo can do about it.  However, there is something that the Government can do about it.  Radon can be tested in homes with a testing kit that costs &euro;50.  If radon is found to be above certain levels, it is recommended that the home undergoes radon remediation works.  An employer that finds radon levels in the workplace that are too high is required, under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, to have radon remediation works carried out to control and eliminate the risks.  Such works may include the installation of a fan-assisted sump.  These sumps can reduce radon levels by up to 90% and cost &euro;1,500.  The costs of &euro;50 and &euro;1,500 may sound like a small sum for such important prevention measures but to homeowners, businesses and employers across the nation who are already stretched with the Covid-19 pandemic, it is no small sum.  The only solution is Government support.</p><p>Lung cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the Republic.  To eliminate 300 radon-induced incidences of lung cancer, this cost is significantly less than &euro;100,000 per case.  In the interest of our citizens and taxpayers as human beings, I urge the Government to provide grants to support the cost of preventative measures.  Aside from the grant that I am urging the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to consider providing, is he taking any action regarding the risks radon poses to the citizens of Ireland?</p><p>In 2014, a joint position statement was issued by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the HSE on radon gas and its dangers.  How many Irish people know of the dangers, understand the risk and know how to protect themselves from the risk?  I dare say it is very few.  The people have been left in the dark about the unusually high levels of exposure to this deadly gas.  There would be shock if more people knew of the risks.  It is a gross injustice that no national awareness campaign has been commissioned by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  </p><p>I am raising this matter because the people of Ireland need to be aware of the risk, the danger and the associated cost.  The Government needs to the ready to help, inform and act.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I must say that it is an issue about which I am most concerned.  We often hear scaremongering when new technologies or particular products are developed that they may pose a health risk.  While that always is debatable, in this case, it is not.  Radon poses a clear risk to health, as the Senator has mentioned.  It is something of which we all need to become more aware.  It is there and can be dealt with.</p> <p>The Government published a national radon control strategy, NRCS, in 2014.  It recommended a broad range of measures aimed at reducing the risk from radon to people living in Ireland.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications - and I apologise that the Minister is not available this morning- chairs the NRCS steering group tasked with implementing the strategy.  The group brings together key Departments and agencies to deal with the issue.</p> <p>The first phase of the strategy had tangible outcomes including the provision of extensive information and the inclusion of a question on radon testing in the conveyancing process for house sales.  That is most significant and will add to general public awareness, aside from being a practically important measure.</p> <p>Phase 2 of the strategy was published in 2019, along with a document on knowledge gaps indicating areas that would benefit from further research.  Phase 2 of the strategy has 33 actions to be implemented over five years and 20 topics within the strategy are to be addressed over the five years.  Supporting households financially is a key priority of the second phase of the strategy.  Behavioural research is also ongoing.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, is carrying out significant work in that area.  Once that work is done, the Government will give careful consideration to designing an appropriate radon financial support scheme for householders.  Another priority of the second phase of the strategy is translating awareness into action.  In a point that applies to both the Government and the public, awareness about radon does not always translate into action.  It is important that we take action because we know about the risks.  While we are always willing to take action as a populace when new perceived health threats emerge, this is a long-standing health threat.  We need to more to tackle it as a populace and we need to be more aware of it.  We also need to do more in terms of Government supports, which are now being provided as part of the strategy. </p> <p>There are some other initiatives that are being undertaken to tackle the issue.  The EPA has rolled out a pilot project in County Wexford to make digital radon monitors available to library members for up to a month to test their homes for radon.  The results of the project will be reviewed.  Hopefully, it will lead to more wide-scale availability of tests.  A major research study has been undertaken in conjunction with the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, on the use of passive sumps. This technology adapts the standby sump currently installed in all new-build homes.  The study has shown encouraging results in field tests carried out in County Wexford.  When available, the results of this project will be considered and recommendations will follow.  In addition, the radon map has been updated.  A significantly enhanced version of the map is on the way.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.</p></speech>

I am not going to give out to him but very little has been done on this issue since 2014.  That is the reality.  The Government aims to retrofit 5,000 homes.  The NUIG study mentioned by the Minister of State, which was carried out by Dr. James McGrath and Dr. Miriam Byrne, found that if the proper ventilation is not installed as part of the retrofitting programme, people could end up being exposed to more than double the levels of radon at home as a result of the retrofitting process that is going to take place.  Therefore, it is a very serious issue.  The retrofitting of homes may not be the answer.  It will not deal with the radon issue.  Unless the ventilation and radon issues are addressed, the retrofitting of 5,000 homes by 2030 will not fix the problem.</p> <p>The only way forward is to roll out the pilot project undertaken in Wexford to make available monitors so that people can check radon levels in their homes and provide grants for sumps if they find that radon levels are over 20%.</p></speech>

There is information available and there are things going on.  I will bring the Senator's concerns to the attention of the Minister.  Progress on the implementation of the radon strategy is reported to Government regularly.  This discussion has been very useful and I have a strong interest in the issue as well.  I will bring the Senator's concerns back to the Government.  I look forward to further actions that will come from the strategy.</p></speech>

I am not going to ask him about anything that the Government does not already agree with in principle.  The Liffey valley is recognised as a special amenity area.  It is an area of outstanding beauty and special recreational value.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State will be aware it is recognised by Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Time has stood still, however.  Nothing of note has happened regarding conservation or to enhance the Strawberry Beds as an amenity area since the early 1990s.  My father was a Deputy then, and time has stood still since.  This is despite the wonderful assets in the area and the stunning natural environment, including Shackleton Mills, which has been described as the jewel in the crown of heritage assets in Fingal.  It has not been developed, but it has been obtained.  It was a water-powered flour mill from the 1770s.  There is also the Silver Bridge, also known as the Farmleigh Bridge, which was built by the Guinness family in the 19th century to supply electricity and water from the Liffey Valley as well as to cater for workers coming from Palmerstown.  Waterstown Park, to which the bridge connects, is another beautiful park in the area, with 300 species of plants, animals and birds, a 5 km track and a natural playground.  Weirs are dotted along the Strawberry Beds which people do not know about.  The best way to enjoy that area is by kayak, because the roads are used as a rat run for the M50.</p><p>I have recently been successful in having the area designated as being for cycling.  Eighteen signs have gone up and lining is going onto the tarmacadam over the summer.  However, I was not successful in getting advisory cycle lanes because that would necessitate having lighting on the road.  All these changes are not enough, however.  Until Covid-19, this area had fallen between two metropolitan stools, namely, Blanchardstown on one side and Fonthill and Lucan on the other.  It has an underutilised strategic purpose.  Opportunities have been missed over the years in this regard, including the 260 acres at St. Edmundsbury which were sold by the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, ten years ago.  There were calls at that time to purchase the land to create a Liffey Valley national park and to join up the lands from Islandbridge to St. Catherine&rsquo;s Park in Leixlip and including Lucan Demesne, which was secured under the auspices of the rainbow Government many years ago.</p><p>During Covid-19, businesses sprouted up in the area as well.  These include the Strawberry Hall, which has evolved with Goats Gruff.  The Wren&rsquo;s Nest is also evolving its businesses now, and the Angler&rsquo;s Rest has been there for many years.  There is also a market at St. Catherine&rsquo;s Park, while Lucan village itself is being marked as a destination town, with &euro;2 million going into the public realm and tourism in that regard.  The Liffey Valley Trail is something I steered, along with Councillor Howard Mahony, when I was on Fingal County Council.  We started a tourism working group, and Councillor Siobhan Shovlin is working on that aspect now as well.  We have launched the trail as a tourism proposition and &euro;140,000 has been secured from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to restore the Silver Bridge.</p><p>In addition, the canal loop is going to join the future greenways on the Royal and Grand canals.  We need to do more in this regard, however.  All these changes are coming because of the beauty and value of this area, yet it is behind and at the periphery.  We would not hide away the history and beauty of the Mona Lisa, yet we are not establishing this area and taking advantage of its potential.  The localism we have witnessed because of the impact of Covid-19 has highlighted the potential more.  Therefore, a feasibility study by the Department of Transport is needed to examine cycling and walking along a route between the Phoenix Park and St. Catherine&rsquo;s Park via the Strawberry Beds.  It is not the busiest commuter route, but it could be of more recreational value.  We must think bigger about this project.  It must encompass Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council and establish and develop the area as an official park and, potentially, as a recreational amenity.</p></speech>

This investment will help support the planned delivery of almost 1,000 km of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025, as well as additional investment in greenways.</p> <p>The Minister was delighted to announce earlier this year an allocation of &euro;240 million to active travel projects in the greater Dublin area and the four regional cities.  This funding will support the addition of 233 new sustainable transport projects to the investment programme of the National Transport Authority, NTA, in 2021.  The NTA will be tasked with overseeing and supporting the development of the high-quality mobility infrastructure across all projects and will also ensure projects are accessible and age-friendly.  Fingal County Council, which is the lead local authority for the Strawberry Beds area, received an allocation of &euro;14.87 million under this funding programme, which is a sizeable allocation and will facilitate progress on numerous projects this year across the Fingal County area.</p> <p>The Minister fully understands that to deliver these projects local authorities require adequate resources to enable them to do so.  As the Senator is also likely aware, the Department of Transport has therefore agreed to fund 218 active travel posts in local authorities throughout the country to ensure delivery of the increased programme of active travel infrastructure.  In January, the Minister wrote to the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to advise that Fingal County Council has been allocated up to 18 additional staff through this funding, and I understand the necessary recruitment processes are under way.  The Department of Transport is also working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the NTA to develop a national cycle network which will ensure investments are focused efficiently, which should outline the cycling routes currently available, identify gaps in the network, and ascertain improvements likely to be required.</p> <p>Regarding the specific matter raised by Senator Currie, the Senator is likely aware that the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA, was approved by the Government in 2016.  Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the NTA must review the transport strategy every six years.  This review assesses the implementation of the current plan and looks to produce an updated strategy which will set out the framework for investment in transport infrastructure and services to take us to 2042.  The scope of the transport strategy encompasses all land transport modes and services in the greater Dublin area, including cycling.  As part of the broad range of inputs into the preparation of the transport strategy, the NTA is updating the 2013 greater Dublin area cycle network plan.  The need for cycling infrastructure and the appropriateness of the road network at and in the vicinity of the Strawberry Beds is being examined as part of that update.  This updated plan will be published for consultation as a background paper for the transport strategy in September 2021.</p> <p>The step change in funding for investment in sustainable transport projects committed to in budget 2021 is proof of the Government's commitment to active travel, and I and the Minister look forward to the delivery of the numerous projects throughout the country over the course of this year.</p></speech>

It is encouraging to hear the cycling infrastructure and the appropriateness of the road network at the Strawberry Beds are on the radar, but I want them to be on the radar in the right way.  This area cannot be a rat run for the M50.  It should not just be there to accommodate people travelling from one side of the city to the other.  The potential of the area to act as a recreational amenity, connected to the local communities, must be placed on the agenda.  This Government is doing much great work in the area of cycling and walking infrastructure and valuing it, so this is an opportunity which cannot be overlooked.</p></speech>

I will also mention some smaller scale initiatives being progressed by the Department of Transport to support and promote efforts to increase active travel.  These include the recently launched safe routes to school programme, which will provide funding to accelerate the delivery of walking and cycling infrastructure on key access routes to schools.  That initiative has already had a great response, with applications from more than 900 schools nationally.  The &euro;15 million additional outdoor infrastructure fund to support local authorities in enhancing outdoor urban space and improving walking and cycling infrastructure through short-term measures will assist with the safe outdoor reopening of society as Ireland gradually emerges from the pandemic.  Finally, a joint initiative with my Department of Rural and Community Development will see the provision of high-quality upcycled bikes and e-bikes for those on low incomes and those most marginalised and disadvantaged.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for coming this morning.  I call for an examination of the earnings of carers, whether family carers, informal carers or carers in general, and social protection for them.  Carers have prevailed in the most difficult circumstances during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We all have to compliment and acknowledge the work they have done during the pandemic.  The Government has referred to carers as the backbone of care provision.  The national carers strategy from 2012 states that we must consider carers as key care partners.</p> <p>Social protection payments for carers fall into five categories.  The carer's allowance is means-tested and is for people on low incomes who are caring for an incapacitated person.  Half-rate carer's allowance is payable with other social welfare payments.  Carer's benefit is a social insurance payment made to someone who gives up work to care for somebody who needs it.  The carer's support grant is a cash payment to carers.  It used to be called the respite grant.  Domiciliary care allowance is a monthly payment.</p> <p>I pay tribute to Family Carers Ireland, which is based in Limerick, where I am from, because it has provided so much support for carers' health, well-being and quality of life over the years.  One of its findings was that 70% of carers find it hard to make ends meet.  It found that 21% of carers struggle financially and have cut back on essentials such as groceries and heating to make ends meet; 29% of carers live in households with a total income of less than &euro;20,000 per year; 57% of carers have experienced or are likely to experience debt as a result of caring; and 39% of the respondents said their financial situation had deteriorated over the last year.  Compared with the general population, family carers were more likely to report themselves as living in households with a gross income of less than &euro;20,000.  The highest rate of carer's allowance for an individual is &euro;385.  That applies where someone caring for two people, which equates to a rate of &euro;9.64 per hour.  There are various other rates.  They are all below the national minimum wage, which is &euro;10.20 per hour.  Carer's benefit for caring for more than one person is &euro;330 which, in a 44.6-hour week, equates to &euro;8.25 per hour.</p> <p>The reality is that carers, especially home carers, provide 24-7 care for 365 days of the year.  It is believed they help to keep people out of hospital.  There are approximately 500,000 carers in Ireland.  It is reckoned that, including home carers, the State saves &euro;20 billion, which is a huge amount of money.  In addition, 19 million unpaid hours a week are provided to people who need care.  Before Covid, thousands of family carers across Ireland were experiencing financial difficulty.  The pandemic has made an already difficult situation much worse.  We must begin to give carers the respect and recognition they deserve.  We must examine their rates of pay and the benefits they are entitled to, because they are providing the State with substantial savings.  The fact that they are caring for loved ones at home is beneficial and helps the longevity of people who are being cared for.  Carers must be paid for the work they do.</p></speech>

The Government acknowledges and I personally acknowledge the important role that family carers play.  We are fully committed to supporting carers in that role.  This commitment is recognised in both the programme for Government and the national carers strategy.  My Department provides a range of income supports to financially assist family carers whose caring responsibilities limit their ability to work.  The main income supports provided include carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance and the carer's support grant.  Over 135,000 carers benefit from regular income supports and spending on these payments in 2021 is expected to be in the region of &euro;1.5 billion.</p> <p>The value of income transfers to family carers has increased by over 50% since 2015.  Carer's allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community.  Carer's allowance is a means-tested social assistance payment awarded to those carers who are caring for certain people who need full-time care and attention.  Carer's allowance is intended to provide an income support for the carer and does not depend on individual care requirements.  Where carers are providing care to more than one person, an increase of 50% is applicable.  Carers may also, subject to certain conditions, qualify for the household benefits package and the free travel scheme.  In some circumstances, carer's allowance can also be paid at a half rate with other social welfare payments such as pensions and disability payments.</p> <p>The number of hours that a carer can work while still being considered to be providing full-time care and attention was increased from 15 to 18.5 per week in January 2020.  As the Senator is aware, in responding to Covid-19, my Department has made special provisions for those who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic.  A carer whose work ceases as a result of Covid-19 and whose situation qualifies him or her for the pandemic unemployment payment will get the payment along with their current carer income support, whether carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  The means test for carer's allowance is one of the most generous in the social protection system.  Currently, &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income is disregarded in the calculation of means for a single person.  The equivalent for someone who is married, in a civil partnership or cohabiting is &euro;665 of combined gross weekly income.  In comparison, the income disregard applied to disability allowance is &euro;140 per week.  It is &euro;20 per day for jobseeker's allowance up to a maximum of &euro;60 and the balance is assessed at 60%.  The weekly income disregard for jobseeker's transitional payment with 50% of the balance assessed as means.</p> <p>Changes to schemes are considered in an overall expenditure and policy context and from an evidence-based perspective.  Increases to the disregard would result in the provision of additional payments to people who may have significant sources of income while reducing the scope to provide income supports to lower income households.  Those existing carers whose sole income is the carer's allowance would not benefit in this circumstance.  Any further improvements or additions to the current income supports, including the earnings threshold for carer's allowance, can only be considered in a budgetary context, taking into account other pressures in the Department of Social Protection and other Departments and the available financial resources.</p></speech>

He has to acknowledge that carers work many hours that are not accounted for.  Many of the people who provide care at home for a loved one never apply for carer's allowance.  They save the State so much money.  This needs to be reviewed.  People need to be asked to work with the Department by informing it of how many hours they provide care for.  The payments sound great but when one works out how many hours people provide care for, it is below the minimum wage.  I would like this issue to be reviewed.  Will the Department consider it in the budget in October?</p></speech>

We have the pre-budget forum next week, which I will attend with the Minister.  I expect we will hear more about the organisations' views on this area.  It is worth noting that despite the substantial extra financial demands due to the pandemic, and in recognition of the vital role that carers provide in our society, my Department announced that the carer's support grant, which the Senator described as the respite grant, would be increased by &euro;150 to a rate of &euro;1,850.  The estimated cost of the carer's support grant in 2021 is over &euro;265 million.  The new rate is the highest ever rate of the payment since its introduction.  I look forward to hearing the views of the carers' organisations next week at the pre-budget forum.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=JoeOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will bring the Senator's point to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.</p></speech>

As we are approaching the recess, I wish her the very best of luck with her impending arrival in September.</p> <p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to the House.  When she was last here to address another Commencement matter I tabled on this issue, I was delighted.  I noted at the time that July provision was to become summer provision and that the budget for summer provision had been increased.  That is important.  This provision is not a luxury for families who have a child with complex additional needs; it is a necessity.  Many of us have heard the stories of the struggles of parents and their children who lost out so profoundly during the Covid lockdowns.  There is no doubt that their development was very much hindered.  Many children regressed in the home-schooling environment and their parents were at their wits' end trying to support them, but they were powerless to help.  I welcome that besides special needs schools, DEIS schools were invited to participate in this programme.  </p> <p>We need to ensure that children who need this vital service can access it.  We need to ensure that every child and family is supported and that those who lost out most during the lockdowns are now given the support they so desperately need.  Having welcomed the announcement that July provision was moving to summer provision and that the funding was to increase from &euro;20 million to &euro;40 million, I was dismayed when a number of parents from south Kildare contacted me to say their school was not running a programme and they could not access places in any other school.  I was disturbed to hear that the DEIS school and the two special schools in Kildare were not running programmes.  I contacted each school and I received feedback from some schools, but not all.  I have spoken to some principals in regard to this matter, but generally the take-up of the programme has been very low.  This is disappointing.  This is not about the funding that has been provided by the Department, but about the outcomes.  It is about ensuring that every child has the opportunity to participate.  </p> <p>Last Friday, I was contacted by the group, Special Needs Schools and Classes, in relation to a survey it had conducted, which found that 60% of the schools their children attend do not offer any in-school programme for the summer.  That is unacceptable.  As a State, we have a duty to care and support the most vulnerable in our society.  I note that only 26% of DEIS schools are running numeracy and literacy camps this summer.  This is not right.  We have more than 4,000 schools in the State, made up of 3,038 primary, 729 post-primary and 140 special schools.  Every school that is eligible to participate should be running a programme.  </p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to detail the current state of play in counties Kildare and Laois as regards this year's summer provision programme and to outline the provision that will be made for those children who cannot access the service through their own school.</p></speech>

It is important Traveller culture and history is embedded within the education sector.</p> <p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for raising this important matter.  The needs of children with special educational needs and children at most risk of educational disadvantage are a huge priority for the Government.  As correctly pointed out by the Senator, these children were adversely impacted by Covid-19 and the closure of schools.  The Government provided guidance and support for schools throughout this period and put in place a supplementary tuition programme for these children in March this year.</p> <p>In May 2021, the Government announced a package of supports to allow primary and post-primary schools to offer a summer programme for students with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage as a Covid-19 pandemic response measure for summer 2021.  As mentioned by the Senator, the funding is not the most important issue, but it is important to note that the funding for this year was doubled from &euro;20 million to &euro;40 million, a 100% increase on the allocation for summer programmes in 2020.  </p> <p>The programme was developed following extensive engagement with education stakeholders, parents and advocacy groups.  It was important to me that any impediments or barriers to schools participating this year would be removed because we wanted to increase the uptake from last year.  We wanted to maintain children's connection with education, build their confidence, increase their motivation and promote well-being for those who are at key transition stages.  We also wanted to help to ensure that they continue their education journey in September, either in school or in further and higher education or training.</p> <p>The programme on offer this summer includes a new two to three week summer programme to all primary schools and an expansion of the existing programmes in special schools and classes and in DEIS schools.  Similar to last year, children with complex needs entering primary school next September are also eligible to participate in summer programmes.  As I said, there was extensive consultation with education stakeholders and advocacy groups.  The Senator will be aware that the closing date was 25 June.  To date, almost one quarter, or 968, of the schools eligible to participate in the summer programme this year have registered their interest to provide 1,346 programmes over the summer.</p> <p>In regard to Senator O'Loughlin's local area, there are 35 schools in Kildare, 29 of which are primary, five are post-primary and one is a special school.  In Laois, there are 24 primary schools taking part.  The summer programme is important this year.  As I mentioned earlier, Covid has had an adverse impact on these students.  We are concerned about regression and the loss of key skills.  That these students can avail of a summer programme is very important. </p> <p>It is important to note that 34,000 children will benefit.  That is a 161% increase on 2020.  The programme is voluntary, not mandatory.  As I said, we have removed the impediments to allow schools to volunteer to participate in the programme for all children.</p></speech>

As I said, I was delighted to note the increase in funding.  I agree with the Minister of State on the need to remove barriers to encourage schools to take part and also in regard to the need for children to maintain connectivity with their places of education.  However, at this point we need to move from the opt-in, opt-out model of summer provision.  This is a vital community service and no State body, be that a school or otherwise, should be able to opt out of supporting vulnerable children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This would have to be negotiated with boards of management and trade unions but the children who need this have to be a priority.</p><p>More work needs to be put into the home-based summer programme.  For every child who needs that programme, their homes may not be the best places to deliver it.  Overcrowding or anything like that has to be taken into consideration when that programme is being offered.  We need to progress this programme and ensure that every child who needs this gets it.</p></speech>

However, it is important to note that the summer provision is an additional service provided by schools.  Teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and support staff work hard all year so it is not something we can mandate.  All we can do is ask and encourage schools and, as I said, remove those barriers.  This year we allowed flexibility in the time so that it is no longer the July provision and the service can also be provided in August.  They are paid in advance, there is a centralised application process, there are arrangements to have greater guidance and there is also a provision to recruit final year and professional master of education, PME, students so that we can have more of a staff base in place to assist schools.  There is also a home-based programme for those children who do not participate in school.  On the DEIS supports, a hot school meals programme will be provided for the summer provision as well as school transport.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of dementia and Alzheimer's day care centres across the country.   It was brought to my attention recently that very few of these centres have reopened.  The person who spoke to me wisely put it that we spend a lot of time talking about pubs, bars and restaurants and very little time talking about the essential services families rely upon that have been shut for a year and a half.  I have spoken to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, who informs me that initially only 14 of the Alzheimer's day centres are to open and that we are looking at 100 opening this week.  That is still a long way off getting all centres open.</p> <p>Families rely on respite care for their loved ones to get time to themselves and recharge so they can get back to doing full-time care work for family members that need it.  For the person suffering with dementia or Alzheimer's, part of ensuring longevity and coping with their condition is having those activities and day care centres.  People deteriorate fast if they do not have access to same.  I am dealing with a case at home where the individual went from having five days per week to having nothing for the past year and a half.  This has put huge pressure on the family to keep him at home and make sure he is looked after.  They are doing a fantastic job but he needs those day services.  Will the Leader submit a request to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to see what we can do about getting the centres open without further delay?</p> <p>I raise the ongoing negotiations involving the hospitality industry.  Today, the industry is meeting a cross-departmental group.  I listened to Adrian Cummins on radio earlier.  He put it well when stating that discussions are taking place but that NPHET will not be at the table.  Those involved know they have to go through NPHET to get their plan off the ground.  I agree with them and support the call for NPHET to get involved in the negotiations with the hospitality sector and find a way to get the industry open in the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>I reiterate a point I made previously: I am not in favour of a Covid pass that would exclude those who have not had the opportunity to have a vaccine or, for whatever reason, cannot take a vaccine from indoor hospitality.  I point to the ridiculous situation whereby many of those young people will be working in hospitality, serving others dinner and drinks and will not able to come around the other side of the bar and have a drink after their shift.  That sends the wrong message.  The Leader has repeatedly made strong calls for rapid antigen testing and that should coincide with the reopening of hospitality to make sure nobody is left behind.</p> <p>This week, the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU will publish its interim report.  It will be launched at 11 a.m. on Thursday.  An invitation will go to all Senators.  I thank committee members and the Cathaoirleach for their support and the committee secretariat for its work over the past six months in putting the report together.  We have made strong recommendations and will resume our meetings in the autumn session to follow up on those recommendations and look into any further developments in the Brexit process that might occur over the summer months.</p></speech>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la has indicated that the new target date for the decision on the building of the Galway city ring road is 27 August.  The latter is the third indicative date given in respect of a decision on this vital project.  The first date was in March and the second was in June, a number of days ago.  The new date is in August and there may possibly be a further extension.  This road is crucial to Galway city, Connemara and the western region in terms of quality of life, traffic congestion, continued investment and tourism.  The project was agreed by the Cabinet in October 2018 and the cost involved at the time was &euro;588 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The commitment of the Government then and, I have no doubt, now is clear.  I expect the project to be part of the review of the national development plan.  Indeed, the project has been in various national development plans going back for the past two decades.  This is a long-running saga in Galway and one on which people are probably sick hearing about but I will continue to show my support for the project to be sanctioned and constructed.  I have always said that if we get planning permission for this project, it will be built.  The commitment is there for it, it is of such vital importance and the cost-benefit analysis has been proven time and again.  The political support in the main is there and it is certainly there from the T&aacute;naiste and former Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, who is very familiar with the importance of the project to Galway and the region.</p><p>The second issue I will touch on is the reopening of our hospitality sector, including restaurants and pubs.  They have been through an horrendous year and three months at this stage.  The expectation was that they would reopen this week.  Unfortunately, that was not to be and they are clearly looking for a definitive date with 19 July being indicated to coincide with the reopening of international travel.  The majority of travellers coming to this country stay in hotels where they can dine but they will not be able to get the feel of real Irish hospitality in our towns, villages and cities, unless they also get the full experience of indoor dining.  We would love to have the Mediterranean climate for our summer but that does not always happen and businesses have tried to accommodate outdoor dining as best they can.  I wish the Restaurants Association of Ireland and the hospitality sector well in their deliberations today and in the coming days and I hope that we can have a definitive opening time and date for the sector.</p></speech>

This product is branded at great cost and expense by Bord Bia on behalf of the State and is exported all over the world.  Up until recently, it was being flown out of the country and three days later it was sitting in the refrigerators of Harrods, and all over London, Paris and Europe.  There has been great innovation in the mushroom sector in its growing methods and in the development of vitamin D and added subsets into the mushroom food as part of this imagination and innovation.  The sector faces wipeout unless the Government urgently brings in legislation to introduce a resumption of peat harvesting on some selected bogs and I deliberately use the term &ldquo;some selected bogs&rdquo;.  I understand the challenges and they are important but the reality is that shipments of peat imports are now arriving into Ireland, despite all of the debate about carbon leakage.  Despite all of the issues we now have, peat and alternative peats are coming in here from the Baltic states, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the UK.  This is total hypocrisy in terms of greenhouse gas policy.</p> <p>I have referred to Bord Bia and the significant budgets it has used, and rightly so.  Bord Bia is an amazing organisation that we can be proud of.  It has done amazing work in the agrifood sector, one which I support.  Last Friday, we debated just transition and we will talk again about it this evening in respect of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill, but just transition is also about jobs, household income and bringing all the people with us.  Most of the representations that I receive are from the workers in the mushroom sector in Monaghan, Kildare, the midlands, and in particular, Wexford.  They are challenged by this.  They tell me - I believe them and I have questioned Teagasc on these matters - that there is no real, practical, viable alternative to milled peat.  I am not making a case for the nursery or forestry staff because I understand that there are alternatives, difficult as they are, but for the mushroom sector, other than vermiculite and other substances, there are no such alternatives.  Let us support the workers, these rural communities and the mushroom sector and bring in emergency legislation to deal with this crisis, which will be a difficulty for us in respect of jobs and incomes for these families in a matter of weeks, not months.</p></speech>

It is a development that is greatly welcomed in the roll-out of the vaccine programme.  I compliment Senator Chambers on her work last week in opposing a two-tier reopening for younger people and, in particular, hospitality workers.  I have no problem with having a two-tier reopening if people refuse to take a vaccine but it is unfair to put people into that situation if they have not had the opportunity to get a vaccine.  I hope that people between the ages of 18 and 34 avail of the 800 pharmacies around the country that are offering a vaccine.  It is welcome that there not appear to have been a great rush of vaccine hesitancy among our young people and they want to get these vaccines.  That, combined with the roll-out of antigen testing in the autumn, will be a significant armoury against the spread of the Delta variant to enable us to get back to some form of normality and for people to be able to resume their lives and jobs.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to raise is the worrying sounds from Government on the reform of the strategic housing development, SHD, process and kite-flying around making people more financially liable for judicial reviews that are taken.  The SHD planning process has not worked.  It is delaying the delivery of houses, which is not what it was intended to do.  The basis for that is that the only opportunity that local residents have for appeals of bad decisions or bad planning is to go through the court system, which is cumbersome, long, and expensive. </p> <p>Rather than examining ways to limit judicial reviews, we need to get back to a planning process that engages local communities while encouraging the need for the development of housing.  A situation is developing where people&rsquo;s voices are feeling very powerless and this process is not achieving what is needed.  All the indications are that the SHD system is going to be replaced by something that is more restrictive in respect of the courts.  We need to have a proper, open, democratic and robust planning decision process and have people buy-in to the delivery of houses.  Most people do not want to oppose housing in their local communities or end up having to take judicial reviews but it is not unreasonable for them to be able to go through a process where they have some of their concerns listened to.  If it is blatant NIMBYism, that will not be listened to because these concerns have to be within the parameters of the planning and development Acts.  It is, however, reasonable for people to have a say on what is sustainable development in their local communities and it would be a regressive step if the one I am hearing about is the one we are going to take.</p></speech>

These, however, went beyond the point of proper examination and scrutiny and turned out to be unnecessarily bruising affairs.  One would only have to ask the father of this House, Senator Norris, for his personal experience.  These elections intruded into people&rsquo;s private lives.  That is not good because it will disincentivise people from getting involved in politics at a time we want to attract people into this space.</p> <p>There is a by-election later this week.  By and large, this has been a clean contest and while I hope it will be a Green Party success, the campaign is a great credit to each candidate and to the media, which has restored some much-needed faith in politics.  I do not want people to be scared; I want to encourage people into politics.  I am naturally delighted that so many people have got to know the Green Party candidate.

The loss of wild pollinators is a cause of concern because 80% of crops depend in part on pollination.  According to the National Biodiversity Data Centre, one third of the wild bee population is facing the threat of extinction.  At Castletown House in my home county, in the constituency of Kildare North, the people there have done amazing work nurturing the meadows at the front to feed the wild insect population.  That large grassland of meadow at the front is now full of clover, buttercups and many types of grass.  Rory Finnegan, the head gardener there, recently gave a wonderful public talk organised by the Green Party in Kildare.  I commend everyone who is working on this, including the Native Irish Honey Bee Society that has, for more than ten years, been deeply concerned about the hybridisation of the Apis mellifera mellifera strain.  It has called for a ban on the importation of non-native honeybees.  Ireland is the last stronghold in northern Europe of the black native honeybee and we should protect it.  The other bees are less frugal, prone to swarming, aggressive and they will dilute the black native Irish honeybee that is special and unique to Ireland.</p></speech>

I wish the talks between the hospitality sector and the Government well today.  We are all anxious to see progress and to see indoor dining becoming possible as soon as it is safe to do so.  I wish to draw attention to one thing.  This morning, Adrian Cummins stated that he wanted all partners in the room and he is right to say that.  In that respect, I notice the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has requested to be a part of those talks and, in fact, wrote to the T&aacute;naiste over the weekend making that request.  It is an eminently sensible idea.  ICTU has already made some sensible proposals in relation to helping the hospitality sector, including the introduction of a continuous antigen testing programme, possibly modelled on meat factories' experience.  To put this into context, who else is going to stand up for front-line workers in the hospitality sector?  Surely, we need a union voice at those talks.  I hope that nobody from the restaurant association or the hotel industry would object to that.  It is a perfectly reasonable request.  I call on the Leader's assistance in supporting that request today, if possible.</p> <p>The second issue I want to raise is in relation to nursing homes.  We are all aware of the real concerns about nursing homes over recent weeks.  There have been serious allegations of neglect and abuse, and, of course, the horrendous death toll in nursing homes.  I refer to the expos&eacute; on "RT&Eacute; Investigates" last week.  I join with others in calling for a public investigation into these issues.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, she has promised to investigate these issues.  It is urgent that we do so and I believe it needs to be a public investigation.  The thing that has concerned me for some time - I have raised this before - is the model that is used.  Over the last 30 years, we have moved from 80% public-sector control of elder care to 80% private-sector control.  That did not happen by accident.  There has been a rapid privatisation of elder care and yet I do not remember it being a cause for debate or discussion across politics, but that is what has happened.</p> <p>I know from my experience as a trade union official that the private-sector for-profit model is based on minimum rates of pay and extremely poor conditions at work.  This results in a significant turnover of staff which in turn relates to a disimprovement in quality of care for our elders and loved ones.  I pose the question: if a nursing home is not prepared to deal with a trade union, could a person trust it to look after his or her loved one?  The reality is that the private nursing home sector at the moment consistently refuses to engage with trade unions.  That is why one will never see a trade unionist talking about what is happening in terms of the pandemic, one only sees the nursing home managers.  That is a fundamental flaw in a poorly structured sector, and I call for a debate on it.</p></speech>

I was thinking of that when I read the annual report of the Ombudsman for Children entitled 2020 Childhood Paused.  At the launch of this report, the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, said that when we are on the other side of this pandemic, we cannot go back to normal.  What he meant by that was that we cannot go back to two-year waiting lists for children seeking psychological help for mental health issues.  We cannot go back to long waiting lists for children with disabilities who are awaiting assessment of needs.  Our normal should not be direct provision and emergency homeless accommodation where families are stuck in one room.  It should not be appalling living conditions at Traveller halting sites.  We have to consider the new normal.  We hope to learn from this experience.</p> <p>The Ombudsman for Children's office dealt with more than 1,180 complaints in 2020.  While the number of calls was slightly down on the previous year, it is hearing from more children directly.  More often, it hears about the new issues affecting children in the pandemic, including the digital divide, the lack of clarity around State examinations, disproportionate effects the pandemic is having on children with disabilities, and children in high risk households who were not able to access remote learning.  Dr. Muldoon said that we need to look at ending homelessness and reducing poverty so that children and families are safe and secure.  Who could disagree with that?</p> <p>I know we had an important debate in this House recently on young people and their needs, and ensuring their voices are heard.  I would like us to continue to keep the focus on the future and what our new normal will look like.  What is the future for Ireland's children?  This is a conversation we need to have.  I am talking about young people such as my little girl, Billie.  What will the future hold for her?  What will the future hold for the next generation of children who are growing up in this era?  I know it is something that we cannot address in this House today, but I would love to see our young people invested in and valued, treated with dignity and respect, and that there are no more inequalities for young people in Ireland.</p></speech>

Often, the unsung members of schools are those on the boards of management who help to keep both our primary and secondary schools running.  It is worth noting that they do this in a totally voluntary capacity.  This year has been a particularly difficult one for them because they had to get used to online meetings and additional tasks in order to open our schools and, importantly, to keep them open.  They deserve our gratitude for the generous time they give in that area.</p> <p>The same is true of management committees in educational centres throughout the country.  There are approximately 21 full-time and nine part-time educational centres in different parts of the country.  I drive past the one in Monaghan every day on my way to this House.  It is always a hub of activity where continuing professional development courses and in-service training are delivered to teachers and it is a vital cog in the educational wheel.  They also deserve great credit because those committees also do that in a voluntary capacity.  As someone once said to me, in regard to what goes on in educational centres, "If the school is the place where children grow, the educational centre is the place where teachers grow".  I wish them all the best for the weather while on summer break.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Finally, I wish to raise again the issue of school secretaries.  Unfortunately, as others go on their school holidays, school secretaries have to go and knock on the door of the Department of Social Protection because they will not get paid while the schools are off for the summer holidays.

I am very troubled by the fact that, unlike last year, the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, which provides specialised support to visually impaired children, seems to have been excluded from the summer scheme for special educational needs and students for this year.  I have tabled a Commencement matter for tomorrow to try to get clarity on this and I hope the Cathaoirleach will accept it.</p> <p>I have two things to raise with the Leader.  We need a debate on long Covid with the Minister for Health.  More and more people are showing symptoms of long Covid, whether it is difficulties with their senses, such as loss of their sense of smell, pains or fatigue, which is a major problem.  We need a defined, dedicated and funded strategy to deal with long Covid.  This is a debate we need to have in this House because Covid will be with us for a long time and people suffering from long Covid need our support and our understanding.  The symptoms in these cases do not go away after seven or 14 days.  I would like to see a summing-up debate on Covid with the Minister for Health before the summer recess, given the fact that Covid has dominated matters this term and since this Seanad was constituted.  Perhaps the Leader could organise that with the Minister.</p> <p>On a more positive note, the Cathaoirleach's part of the country, just like mine, depends very heavily on tourism.  It is great to see tourists starting to come back this year, as they did last year.  Tourism will be one of the cornerstones of rebuilding our economy post the pandemic.  We should have a debate on tourism and the evolving strategy relating to it, particularly what we are going to do to encourage people in America and other countries to travel to Ireland in the years ahead.</p></speech>

I spoke about this briefly last week, but I will say one more thing about it.  Over the weekend we had evidence that the ESB is now installing emergency generating capacity in the Dublin docks because of problems and to avoid blackouts.  If this plan is implemented, and if everyone's ambitions are to be met, we are moving towards a society that will be much more dependent on electricity.  We have turned our back on fossil fuels - or are trying to.  We have limited capacity for hydroelectric generation.  Wind power, onshore and offshore, is opposed by interest groups all over the country, and we want to see when that infrastructure will be built to a satisfactory degree.  However - and this is the most crucial thing - side by side with all the rhetoric about sustainable energy, we are building data centres.  The Apple centre in Athenry, which has recently been revived, will, if fully built out, account for an increased demand for electricity of 8%.  Five data centres would increase our electricity usage by 40%.  There are two schools of thought in the Government.  I say this to the Leader but I am not making a party political point.  There are two departmental schools.  One is that we cannot fail the multinationals, we must do what they want and we must build all these data centres because they are the future.  The other school of thought is that of economic reality as it relates to electricity generation.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has said he is not ruling out nuclear power.  If nuclear power is necessary and is an essential part of the implementation of Government plans, we should be told so and there should be no more hiding behind statements such as "I am not ruling it out".  It is either in or it is out.  Let us hear which it is.</p></speech>

The oppression of a minority, of course, is nothing new.  We know how the Tibetan people have been subjected to brutal persecution and repression for decades.  We have seen throughout the past year the introduction of the national security law and how China has crushed press and legal freedoms in Hong Kong and detained political opponents and dissidents there.  On Wednesday of next week, outside the convention centre, there will be a protest by practitioners of Falun Gong.  They will highlight the Chinese Communist Party's ongoing persecution of minorities.  We know only too well in this House, as we have discussed this before, the issues surrounding the summary detention of Richard O'Halloran, and we have seen others detained by the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>I would hope that <i>The Irish Times</i>would give as much attention in its editorials as it has in its advertising to the Chinese Communist Party.  I am calling again for us to have a debate on China, our relationships with China and human rights abuses by the Communist Party, including issues surrounding the belt and road strategy.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, has confirmed to me that there will be no official Government representation at the Beijing Winter Olympics but I still believe the Government should go further and support others and other countries that have been calling for the Beijing Olympics to be moved.</p><p>We also need to start to call out those who are embarrassing Ireland at a European level by apologising for the actions of the Chinese Communist Party and those MEPs who have condoned the human rights abuses of the Communist Party.  It is no surprise they have done so because they have backed Lukashenko, Assad and Maduro.  We need to call them out in the same way I have in this House called out Fine Gael for its being previously allied in the European People's Party, EPP, with Viktor Orb&aacute;n.  Those who sit on the left in the European Parliament need to decide whether they are on the side of human rights or on the side of the Chinese Communist Party, and we need to make that call now.</p></speech>

There will be more and more dependence on electricity.  There will be more and more electric cars and electric bikes and more electric gadgets in houses, so there will be a huge dependency on electricity.  Where will we get certainty in this regard?</p> <p>I am delighted that the marine planning Bill is being published.  It needs to be put in place, and I ask the Leader that it be brought forward, even if it has to be brought into this House first.  It is crucial legislation that will lead to crucial pieces of infrastructure being brought forward, particularly along the west coast, where we have the highest wind speeds in Europe.  There is also the problem of parking and charging points on streets in our cities and our main towns.  The more electric cars we have the more problems we will have charging those cars.  There will be less and less street space.  We have seen the hospitality end of this, and I am delighted that that sector is getting more space.  There is more space for bicycles and so on around our cities and towns.  There will be a greater need for charging points going forward.  Where will this start and where will it end?  I would like the Leader to arrange for a debate, after the climate Bill has passed, on the practical issues that could arise such as what Senator McDowell has said about various proposed planning applications, the issue I have raised with charging points and parking spaces for cars and so on.  I hope the Leader will arrange a debate on those practical issues in the near future.</p></speech>

For years now, secretarial assistants have been working with their union to try to resolve the issue of unequal pay and as of yet, the Minister for Finance has not even met with them to discuss the matter directly.</p> <p>The Leader's party leader, the T&aacute;naiste, spoke publicly about how Fine Gael is in favour of a living wage and yet the largest cohort of political staff in Leinster House are not guaranteed one.  There are more than 200 secretarial assistants working in Leinster House.  They have a starting salary of &euro;24,000.  To put that in perspective, parliamentary assistants start on approximately &euro;41,000, a Senator starts on more than &euro;69,000 and Deputies make a minimum of &euro;96,000, which is due to go up to nearly &euro;100,000 in the next round of pay rises.</p> <p>Our secretarial assistants keep the lights on, the phones answered and the letters written.  They write our speeches, policy papers and legislation.  They commit hours and hours of their time, outside of the working hours, to help our constituents and they work hard to get many of us, in both Houses, elected.  Despite all of this, they would not even be able to pay rent in most cities in Ireland on the starting wage we give them.</p> <p>I remind the Leader this ongoing issue of pay was raised a number of years ago as part of a wider cultural problem of bullying and harassment in the Oireachtas.  Many strides have been made to address these issues through well-being initiatives and training for Members on how to manage staff.  However, nothing has been done to address the power imbalance which comes when a secretarial assistant is learning less than one fifth of what his or her boss takes home.</p> <p>The Oireachtas should be a place of equals and that starts with guaranteeing an equal standard of living for all our staff.  Secretarial assistants in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il do as many hours as parliamentary assistants and should be paid equally.  They are as committed to their work as we are and they make a valuable contribution to the administration of our work.  I ask the Leader of the House to write to the Minister and invite him to give us an update on this issue.</p> <p>This House passed a motion by a unanimous vote in the last term to end the practice of paying secretarial assistants so little.  I assume we can all agree this unfair pay disparity needs to be addressed before the end of this term, if fair is indeed fair.</p></speech>

We all know that last week a decision was made to pause that reopening, based on dire modelling figures presented to the Cabinet.  Naturally, this has caused significant hurt and anger.  I am especially sorry for those establishments which do not have outdoor seating areas and are restricted from even having limited opportunities to trade.  A large number of those in my constituency in Waterford have been in contact in the past week.</p> <p>Whatever we do, we have to make sure indoor hospitality is reopened in a safe manner and we use every mechanism possible, including antigen testing, to facilitate those who have not had the opportunity to get vaccinated yet.  I am a 34-year-old who has not had the opportunity to register on the HSE portal for a vaccine.  As I said last week, the last time I wished I was a year older, I was 17 and hoping to get into a pub or a nightclub but this time it was so I could get a vaccine to facilitate the same thing.  I was especially happy to see pharmacies now being offered the opportunity to give the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine through their network of approximately 800 pharmacies nationally.  It is really welcome that we have done that and made that decision as a Government.</p> <p>On a related point, it is essential to make sure that the details of any 18- to 34-year-old who goes that route from today are inputted into the HSE COVAX system, because that is being used for the issuing of the EU travel certificate.  We have to make sure anyone who goes that route is not disadvantaged.  I hope the House would agree that it would be appropriate to invite the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, into the House next week ahead of the 19 July reopening of travel.</p></speech>

We all know rents are way too high.  The average rates across the State are &euro;1,250 per month.  In Dublin, average rents are &euro;1,745 per month.  New rents are even higher again.  In Dublin Bay South, a new two-bed apartment can cost between &euro;2,500 and &euro;3,000 per month.  How on earth can working people afford these kinds of rents?  Even people in good jobs are struggling.  The financial burden that renting is putting on hundreds of thousands of renters is enormous.  It is even worse if you are trying to save for a deposit.</p> <p>We are seeing young people and an entire generation being locked out of home ownership and their lives being put on hold.  It is making it more difficult for others to put a secure roof over their heads.  In 2016, Sinn F&eacute;in tabled rent certainty legislation which linked rent to inflation.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael voted that down and because of that, renters are now paying up to &euro;6,500 more per year in rent.  That is the cost of this Government's failure to stand up for renters.</p> <p>Rents are now so high that linking rents to inflation is not enough.  We need an emergency three-year ban on rent increases.  When Sinn F&eacute;in tabled its ban on rent increases Bill a year ago, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party voted it down and because of that vote, renters are paying even higher rents today.  Tomorrow, the Sinn F&eacute;in team in the D&aacute;il will be tabling that Bill again.  The Government is proposing to link rent to inflation which is too little, too late.  Inflation is running at 1.9% and rising.  Renters cannot take any more increases.  I hope our colleagues in government will support Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill tomorrow in the D&aacute;il.  It is time to ban rent increases and it is time to stand up for renters.</p></speech>

The main findings from that report made for some troubling reading.  Its CEO, John Farrelly, noted the review carried out by Dr. Susan Finnerty.  With regard to the number of people detained against their will at inpatient centres in 2020, there were 1,919 admissions or involuntary detentions.  Some 32% of those were applications by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which is the largest such figure in the history of the State and quite worrying, given that it was during a pandemic and people in those circumstances needed help.</p> <p>It noted that 41% of services did not develop comprehensive individual care plans which is another troubling statistic.  Of course, there are ongoing issues with buildings.  There has been significant investment in buildings for mental health services but 55% in terms of compliance, compared with other regulations, is a troubling statistic as well.  This report was pertaining to the statistics from 2020.  I note the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, since she came into this portfolio in the second half of last year.  She has taken on the brief with gusto and is addressing a number of the issues raised in this report from 2020.  It especially highlights the continued investment needed in this sphere.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Leader will share my concern about the fact a day patient service is not longer available in County Meath.  An inpatient service is available at Crosslanes in Drogheda but only day care services are available in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.  I pay tribute to Dearbhla Ayres and all the mental health team who administer services across the midlands and the north east.  There is a need for a debate on these particular statistics with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on the work she is doing and on the long-term strategy given the troubling statistics in terms of the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the need for the Minister to move forward the legislation before the summer recess.</p></speech>

I want to echo that reminder.  I hope the message will go back to the Government that our secretarial assistants should not have to fight for something which has been very well established they need.  Even in the previous Seanad, there was full cross-party support for a call for them to get a proper payscale that recognises their work and incredible contribution to our democracy.</p><p>There was mention of having a summing up debate on Covid.  I do not think we are anywhere near that yet.  The fact is we will continue to see new variants.  One of the reasons for that is the European Commission and, sadly, Ireland, through the position taken by our Minister, Deputy Varadkar, are not supporting a trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, TRIPS, waiver.  They are not supporting a measure which could lead to an escalation and scaling up of supply.  We are told it is not that simple.  The World Health Organization is calling for this.  It knows exactly how complicated and important a TRIPS waiver is.  I have a recent edition of<i>The Lancet, </i>the most respected medical journal in the world, and its cover page reads &quot;Rich countries behaved worse than anyone's worst nightmares&quot;.  That is with respect to Covid.  That is where we are right now.  It is a huge indictment.  We need for all our sakes to make sure the virus does not have infinite space to develop new variants in terms of the population of the world being exposed.  </p><p>Time needs to be provided this evening to debate the other crisis we face, that of climate change.  We saw what was described as a &quot;portal to hell&quot; in terms of the gas fire in the Gulf of Mexico.  The amendments to the final sections of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill relate to whether we will continue to grant licences for oil and gas extraction.  It is really important we have time to debate them.  I hope the Leader can allocate additional time to ensure those crucial points are addressed.  These are existential issues.</p></speech>

To be clear, I fully support the funding, believe in the good work the GAA does and have been involved in the GAA all my life.  The GAA was founded with the stated goal of promoting Irish culture but I fail to see how it is doing that by depriving millions of people across the country of watching our national games.</p> <p>I am aware of many people who have given countless hours to their clubs, the development of the GAA, have dedicated so much to the GAA and have missed out on watching their county team play in recent years because they cannot afford to pay for Sky Sports or because they are in hospital or a nursing home where Sky Sports is not available.  I spoke to a man on Saturday who has been involved in our GAA club for more than 60 years who could only listen to the Galway versus Dublin game on the radio.  The deal was wrong in 2014 and it remains wrong today.  The seven-year broadcasting deal was signed in 2014.  It is up for renegotiation in the coming months.  I have spoken and written to my colleague, Deputy Niamh Smyth, chairperson of the Oireachtas joint committee with responsibility for sport, and requested she invite GAA officials before the committee to discuss this matter, to right the wrong and bring the games back to our people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#P00700"><p>We received a submission this morning from the National Taxi Forum requesting we discuss the plight of taxi drivers.  I am in regular contact with a group and with one of my constituents, Peter Jarvis.  Those in the group have said there are few if any international travellers and little if any shopping or social life.  Everything that would have provided support for taxi drivers is gone.  While we have provided them with the pandemic unemployment payment, and that has been a lifeline and has been very much acknowledged in the submission from the National Taxi Forum, the potential of the industry to recover is not like that of other industries.  There has been grant aid but we need to do more.  I would like a debate in this House regarding their plight.</p> <p>A number of things could be done.  The first is to acknowledge that while taxi drivers come under the remit of the Department of Transport, and that makes sense, these are vehicle-based small businesses.  Each one of the drivers operates as a small business.  Every one of these individuals is supporting their family and home and running their operation as a sole trader.  They work the hours they operate to do that.  If we were to run the employment test we would do that on the basis of they being sole traders.  They would satisfy that test.</p> <p>We need an extension to the ten-year rule.  While there is a need to change the fleet, we could make the requirement for drivers to replace their vehicles inextricably linked with replacing them not only with wheelchair accessible vehicles but with electric vehicles.  We need to freeze the number of taxi licences being granted.  While the State is supporting taxi drivers with the pandemic unemployment payment, it seems ridiculous we are admitting more people into the industry.  There is a failure on the part of the Minister to engage in the context that the industry is currently not financially viable.  We need a debate on this issue as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Senator Seery Kearney is right in that we need a debate and not only on this sector as a number of industries will not recover in the way we hope they will.  They will continue to need supports.  A specific debate on the conditions that exist in the taxi industry is very relevant for us to discuss.  Other colleagues have also asked for debates in the next number of weeks.  Next week&rsquo;s schedule is already accepted and agreed.  I will be proposing the following week&rsquo;s schedule to leaders tomorrow.  We are literally to the pin of our collar.  I have requested from both the Superintendent and the health advisers if we could have access to the D&aacute;il Chamber on a Wednesday and a Thursday but it has been refused.  I am curtailed by having Monday, Tuesday morning and Fridays sittings and I am trying to do the best for all of us.  I hope the Senator will understand I do not have space between now and the recess for that debate.  I will do my very best to fit it in at the beginning of the new term.  All these issues will not go away over the summer, much and all as we would like them to.  It is relevant that we have that debate.</p> <p>Senator Crowe raised an issue that aggravates most people in the country.  It is very relevant that coverage of our national games should be free-to-air for all of us to enjoy.  We should not have to listen on the wireless or in a car to some of the most exciting sports.  We were spoilt for choice over the weekend.  Most of us were dual screening switching between the Tour de France, Wimbledon and Euro 2020.  It is wonderful to have that little glimpse of normality and excitement just to be able to enjoy sport again.  We should write to the Minister on behalf of all of us.  It would great if the Chair of the Oireachtas committee would bring GAA officials before the committee prior to it negotiating any new deal for the next number of years.</p></speech>

That is no problem.</p> <p>I commend Senator Hoey on raising the issue of pay for secretarial assistants, SAs.  The Senator may not be aware that we discuss the issue almost on a weekly basis at our leaders' meetings.  There is work ongoing, but it is very slow, so I take on board her suggestion to write to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  I will be happy to do that on behalf of the House today.  There are two separate issues.  The issue of SA pay is one that is long overdue refining and fixing but all staff of Senators and other parliamentarians should be considered to be parliamentary assistants, rather than secretarial assistants, given the amount of work they do.  They are distinctly different roles but one is inherently connected with the other.  I am very happy to send a letter on behalf of the House today.</p> <p>Senator Higgins referred to a Covid debate.

We will have debates about the impact of Covid for many moons to come.  I will certainly organise a debate on the matter as quickly as I can in September.</p> <p>Senator Cassells asked for a debate on mental health.  It is one of the issues we will speak about for many moons to come.  The increased demand for the services of all providers - private charities and State providers - has increased significantly in the past 15 or 16 months by approximately 40%.  The funding to those organisations from the State has not matched that level of increase.  Many young people and older people will experience significant issues in this regard for many moons to come.  A debate on the matter would be welcome.</p> <p>Senator Boylan raised the issue of rental prices in Dublin.</p> <p>Senator Cummins referred to the HSE advancement of the vaccine to 18- to 34-year-olds.  I wish them well.</p> <p>Several colleagues spoke about the hospitality industry.  The only thing we can do, to be fair, is to support the hospitality sector, both the workers and the owners, in the negotiations in the next couple of weeks.  We want them all to be able to earn their own livelihood and provide services not only to Irish people, but to the people who are now, thankfully, coming to Ireland, and to do so in a safe manner.  I agree with Senator Gavan that decisions can only be made by people at the table.  All concerned should be at the table to find a productive way forward on this issue.  </p> <p>Senator McGreehan raised the centenary memorials that will be take place in the coming years.  Indeed, we will celebrate Seanad 100 next year.  I wish the people organising those events well.</p> <p>Senators Burke and McDowell raised the issue of the generation of electricity and how much more reliant the State will be on electricity generation.  The debate on data centres versus green energy production is not an issue that has just been dealt with by this Cabinet; it has been there for a significant number of years.  It was certainly a relevant issue in the couple of years I was a member of Cabinet.</p></speech>

Senator Paddy Burke is correct with regard to the marine planning Bill.  I will make recommendations today that it be commenced in the Seanad so that we can get that debate and legislation moving in September.  We have golden coasts that are abundant sources of natural energy and we need to get the Bill passed so that we can start using them.  I concur that it is not just on the west coast that we have an abundance of supply; we certainly have an abundance of it on the east coast.

I have requested a date from the Minister but have not received a reply.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about tourists coming back.  The debate in respect of hospitality will be ongoing daily for the next couple of days.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher thoughtfully spoke about the fact as schools, particularly primary schools, have closed for summer in recent weeks, it is an opportune time to pay tribute and thanks not just to the teaching staff, but to all the staff who mind and care for children, as well as all the governing staff who help them in their daily lives in school environments, which are a wonder for children to be able to grow and develop.  As regards the school secretaries issue, I hope he is right that this will be the final year in which we have to discuss secretaries having to arrive at Intreo offices at the end of June.  It is just not good enough.</p> <p>Senator Flynn proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  However, the Senator raised a valid issue as eloquently as only she can.  We need a debate across multiple Departments and services on the future of children and I will try to arrange that as soon as possible when we come back in September.</p> <p>Senator Gavan referred to the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme on nursing homes that was aired the other night.  It was difficult to watch.  I agree with the Senator on this issue.  I know inquiries will be taken on board by the Department of Health and maybe even the HSE but we probably need a public inquiry into this matter.  The purpose of such an inquiry would not necessarily be to apportion blame.  I am sure the situation most private providers and some public providers found themselves in was unprecedented and I do not know how they managed.  We need to shine a light on the lessons that can be learned to make sure that if anything like this ever happens again, the State will step in far more quickly than it did to help nursing homes, probably because of the ideology the Senator spoke about at the beginning of his contribution.  I will try to arrange for the sentiments of the Seanad to be sent to the Minister with regard to any proposed inquiry.</p> <p>Senator Martin spoke about the by-elections and how single elections may be becoming more bruising.  We have seen that elections have become more personality focused, which is an awful pity.  I know that in the cut and thrust of elections candidates jibe one other from a policy perspective, but all Members know how vital it is, whether from a party perspective or another perspective, to have quality candidates who are able to come on board.   We do not need potential candidates to wake up one day and ask themselves if they are mad to go for election; that they should not touch it with a barge pole.  We parliamentarians and society at large will be the ones to suffer if we do not have great people putting themselves forward for election.  I wish all the by-election candidates well on Thursday.  The outcome will be decided by those who show up to vote, rather than those who criticise or stand on the sidelines. </p> <p>Senator Moynihan welcomed the extension of the vaccine to 18- to 34-year-olds and referred to the antigen testing that will be required to help people to reopen their employment venues safely.  She also referred to the SHD planning process.  She has made valid points in that regard and maybe we will try to organise a debate on that in September as quickly as we can.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan referred to the mushroom industry.  It is a bizarre example of carbon leakage that the production of something that is needed for the production of other goods has been stopped and that it has to be imported from thousands of miles away, which makes no sense.  I agree with the Senator that a debate is needed on the matter.  Notwithstanding the climate action Bill that is currently before the House, the particular issue raised by the Senator should be debated in the House, possibly by way of a Commencement matter, or I can ask the Minister to address it subsequently.</p> <p>Senator Kyne spoke about the Galway city ring road.  It seems like we have been waiting for the planning permission decision on the project for ages.  I hope the decision is delivered on schedule in August so that the road can start to be built.  It will have a significant impact on the lives and livelihoods of people in the area.  </p> <p>Senator Chambers spoke about dementia care centres.   While other colleagues were raising issues, I took the opportunity to contact the office of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I can inform the Senator that all dementia care centres will reopen this week, save where they have individual issues.  The Minister of State asked me to convey that any centre with an individual issue relating to training, staffing or finances should contact her Department immediately, which is welcome.  We take it for granted that just because a person is in his or her own home, everything is grand and hunky-dory, but I know from first-hand experience that dementia patients have suffered incredibly as a result of the lack of socialisation in the past 12 months.  It has had a massive impact on them.  Just being able to go to their day centre will have a hugely positive impact so we need to try to get those centres open as quickly as we can.</p> <p>In conclusion, I pay tribute to Senator Chambers on her chairmanship or chairwomanship of the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, as well as all of the committee members, who have worked hard and effectively in the past year.  I wish them well in launching their interim report on Thursday.</p> <p>I am happy to accept the other proposed amendment to the Order of Business.</p></speech>

We had a debate on this provision on Committee Stage so I will not delay proceedings.  The amendment is about delay and it seeks to ensure the publication of guidance to give effect the Bill's provisions would come in immediately after commencement.  This is simply to avoid any further delays in the introduction and implementation of gender pay gap laws.</p> <p>As I said on Committee Stage, we know employers, trade unions and workers across the country are well aware this legislation is coming and is long overdue.  They have been making preparations on this for quite some time and a trade union representative told me last week that many companies had almost given up on it.  They had plans in place for gender pay gap reporting and wage transparency some years ago when the Bill was first mooted and when my Bill went through the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  Due to the fact that it has taken so long, the process has stagnated somewhat in different companies.  There is a real concern about further delays.</p> <p>I commend the Minister on his expediency in moving this forward as soon as he took office.  Given that there were so many delays before he took office and the long period in which we had to prepare for the Bill's introduction, we wanted to change the text from "as soon as is reasonably practicable" to "immediately".  This would give more of a sense of urgency that people across the country are telling us is required.</p></speech>

This is really important and excellent legislation.  There would not be much division among Senators in respect of it.  It is important to note the valid point made by the Senator and I am happy to support it.  Again, I thank the Senator and the Labour Party for the very substantial amendments before us today.</p></speech>

I have spoken in this and the Lower House about my commitment to getting this legislation passed and the mechanisms put in place to support it, including regulations and the website, so we can see delivery of this vital information.  As Senator Bacik acknowledged, responsibility for this legislation was transferred to my Department in October last year and it was not initially with my Department when I took on this role.  In that nine-month period, I prioritised this legislation again because, as Senator Bacik implies, it had taken a long time to germinate to its current position.  We put on the pressure internally and with great assistance from my officials, we discussed in May this year how we could ensure it would be prioritised.  We have delivered the legislation and it is my absolute commitment that we will deliver the regulations as swiftly as possible.</p> <p>The term used is "as soon as reasonably practicable", which is typical of what is used in legislation of this sort.  As I have said, I have put it on record in both Houses that there will be no delay on my Department's side in both drawing up and providing these regulations.  They will be detailed so we cannot just pretend that by putting in the term "immediately", everything will suddenly be done.  There is a detailed set of regulations and there is very significant primary legislation listing the various types of categories under which reporting must take place.  That must be elucidated further in the regulations, which will take some time to complete, but there will be no delay or foot dragging.  We will also look to get the request for tender for the website developed as quickly as possible.  The website is going to be really important as well as this is how we publicise which companies are adhering to or making efforts towards addressing the gender pay gap in their spheres.</p> <p>This House has my absolute commitment to move on this as quickly as possible and I am happy to be accountable to this House on that as we move to the next term.  The change being proposed is not necessary and would not make the process go any more quickly.  As such, I ask Senators not to press this amendment.</p></speech>

Indeed there is more than readiness.  People are well prepared.  This was the reason I raised the Commencement matter on 8 March.  We certainly will be holding the Minister to account once the legislation is passed to ensure it is brought into effect as soon as possible.  I take the Minister's point that he does not intend to see any delays on that.  I will withdraw the amendment on that basis.  I thank the Minister for his very clear response.  </p></speech>

I thank SIPTU for raising with me the need to ensure there is explicit recognition of the role of trade unions in making this legislation effective across workplaces and in working constructively to ensure we address the gender pay gap.  We are all conscious of the 14% gender pay gap that persists in this country and the fact that so many women see this inequity at a collective level.  Because of that, we want to ensure there is a place in the legislation for trade unions and a recognition of their role in making the legislation truly effective.  That is the purpose of these three amendments combined.</p></speech>

I have engaged extensively with trade unions on this and other legislation since I took office.  I place real value on that ongoing dialogue with the trade union movement, particularly in the context of issues involving gender in the workplace, be it on the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill; on the low pay many childcare professionals, the vast majority of whom are female, earn; or in the context of domestic violence leave.  These are all issues on which the Government is working.  I have engaged extensively with the trade union movement on all of those points and I value that engagement, as well as the trade union movement's leadership in many ways on many of these issues.</p> <p>We discussed writing a specific role for trade unions into this legislation on Committee Stage.  I have looked at the Labour Party amendments.  I did make reference on Committee Stage to the fact that the EU directive to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women is being looked at in the context of the European institutions.  There are indications in the early draft that some role for the trade union movement may be explicitly inserted into that legislation and, therefore, there may be a requirement on member states.  It remains my view that I am content to wait and see what will be the specific position given to the trade union movement occasioned from that piece of EU law because we could implement something now that would be quite different from or at variance with the role envisaged by the European institutions and required of us under EU law.  As the Senator is aware, there is a provision in the legislation to allow for its review after four years.  Hopefully, the particular element of EU law we are discussing will be implemented before then but if not, we will have the opportunity at that review to consider whether there needs to be a specific reference to a role for the trade unions in terms of how companies address the gender pay gap that is revealed through the publication of this information.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 4 seeks to insert paragraph (d) into the proposed section 20A(1) that would require employers that are party to a collective agreement with a recognised trade union or staff association to consult with the trade union or staff association concerned prior to and following the publication of the gender pay gap information.  I flagged on Committee Stage that I was concerned that there was no clear detail as to the purposes of those particular consultations.  In particular, when dealing with primary legislation, I felt it would be important that there be clear elucidation.  Were we to put this in, there should be a clearer elucidation of what those discussions and engagements would be about.  I also made the point, which I repeat, that there is nothing to stop an employer in the public or private sector engaging with recognised trade unions or staff associations prior to or following the publication of this information.  In particular, in the case of employers where the publication of that information reveals significant gaps, such consultation could be useful.  At this point, in the context of there not being complete clarity in terms of what those consultations would require and where EU law may require something more specific or generalised in respect of the role of the trade union movement in these negotiations, the amendment proposed today is not the appropriate way to go and I ask Senators not to support it.    </p></speech>

Gender pay discrimination is a serious issue.  As we know, the Bill aims to tackle the existence of pay discrimination but could this section permit employers with fewer than 50 employees to legally discriminate against employees on a gender basis?  Are there plans to amend the section in order that employers are not allowed to engage in pay discrimination based on gender?</p></speech>

Indeed I noted that on Committee Stage.  However, there is concern in the trade union movement that the voluntarist model of collective bargaining in industrial relations has not necessarily served its members as well as it could.  This is a problem we face at broader level.  The Minister says there is nothing to stop employers consulting with unions but the problem is that all too often, we have seen a need for a stronger compulsion and stronger supports in statute for collective bargaining.  That is a more general comment.  I will not press the amendment but I thank SIPTU for raising the issue with me.  I know the Minister has engaged with SIPTU and other unions.  It is crucial that trade unions are engaged with extensively on the implementation of this legislation.  Senator Maria Byrne referred to amendment No. 5 relating to the number of employees.  This is a different point but nonetheless it is an important one.</p></speech>

As soon as it was enacted, my Bill would have applied to all organisations with 50 or more employees.  In that regard, we were simply taking the model of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission legislation, which has a similar remit for all organisations with 50 or more employees.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We believe that was the right number at the time.  To initiate the legislation with respect only to bigger employers would miss a large number of employees.  We are disappointed, therefore, that the Government&rsquo;s legislation will only come into effect incrementally and will only apply to organisations with 50 or more employees after some years.  Given the years of gestation and preparation, it would be appropriate to move the threshold down to 20 employees, as provided for in this amendment.  Other Opposition parties had similar amendments on Committee Stage.  </p><p>There are many small firms in Ireland with small numbers of employees.  In Finland and Sweden the thresholds are 30 employees and ten employees, respectively.  Clearly, allowances must be made to ensure there are no breaches of identity and that the data are anonymised, but again we can see this being done elsewhere in countries with many small firms.  I reintroduced this amendment on Report Stage to highlight this point.  We are concerned, as is the trade union movement and the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland, NWCI, at the slow pace of expansion of the legislation to cover smaller companies.</p></speech>

We spoke at some length on Committee Stage about the gestation of this Bill and the degree of engagement which took place between previous Ministers, employer organisations, trade unions and NGOs, especially those representing women.  An approach was agreed which allowed for an incremental roll-out, specifically recognising that smaller companies would have a less well-developed human resources, HR, infrastructure and many would also be less well able to deal with the significant reporting requirements we are instituting with this legislation.</p> <p>As Senator Bacik pointed out, employers have been waiting for this legislation for some time and, in fairness, they have been waiting for this version of it.  There is a legitimate expectation in respect of how this legislation will be rolled out.  To change that significantly now would be a major move, and one which I have considered.  I have thought about the arguments put forward by the Senator and others in their contributions in this House in recent weeks.  While the larger companies may have the requisite infrastructure in place to begin their reporting requirements immediately, I do not believe smaller companies will be so well prepared.  One consideration in any legislation like this, and it is only one consideration, must be its cost and administrative burden on employers.  </p> <p>We are all aware, especially during these times of Covid-19, that many SMEs have gone through a difficult time in the last 15 months.  Senator Seery Kearney drew attention to the research done by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which highlighted the administrative burden that suddenly extending the scope of this legislation to all employers would have on smaller organisations, especially those without a designated HR capacity.  It is my view that the proposal being brought forward here is unduly onerous at this stage.  I also referred to the identification of the salaries of individual employees and the concern to ensure pseudonymisation was achieved.  It must also be remembered that we amended the Bill on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to allow for a review of its overall functioning to take place after four years.  That will be a good opportunity to consider whether we need to bring the thresholds down further.</p> <p>Regarding Senator Byrne&rsquo;s comment regarding those in firms with fewer than 50 employees being at risk of discrimination, it must be remembered that it is at all times against the equality legislation to discriminate on the grounds of gender.  This legislation does not change that.  It is concerned with information and the provision of specific information regarding differences in pay.  It is never acceptable and definitely not legal to discriminate on the grounds of gender in respect of pay.  I put that reminder on the record of the House.</p> <p>We will have the opportunity to examine the impact of equality legislation as I recently announced a review.  It is great legislation and has served us well but the review will be a useful exercise in looking again at the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 to see how we can continue to strengthen and protect the most vulnerable groups in our society.  I look forward to engaging with Senators on that review.</p></speech>

To have a threshold of fewer than 20 employees at this point would be unduly onerous.  It is not necessary just now.  Having said that, it will be a very valuable aspect to examine in the four-year review of the legislation and how it is rolling out.  I reassure Senator Byrne that the Employment Equality Act 1998 does not allow any discrimination on the basis of gender.  Equally, given that there is a greater prevalence of part-time work among women, the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001 instituted a requirement that part-time workers be given all the same conditions as full-time employees.  That protection has is also in place.  The thrust of this Bill is to ensure transparency and the publication of information by larger companies, rather than to undermine or embellish what is already a requirement and well rehearsed in all employment forums as a protection for female workers.</p></speech>

We had extensive conversations on this issue on Committee Stage but I will reiterate some of the points because they are arising here again.  We have been waiting for this legislation since 2017, and most of us have probably been waiting for it most of our working lives as women.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for accepting an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il because the review will be key.  We must not renegotiate something else at this point or postpone this for another three or four years.  We need this legislation enacted and in place now.  It gives us transparency and an understanding of what is happening across the board in companies.</p> <p>It is not legal to discriminate.  Having said that, it is difficult for individual employees within companies to take cases and that is why this legislation is important.  This is an historic day.  We finally have this Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019 before the House and, hopefully, it will pass today.  I anticipate that all Senators will support it, and some of us just have these small issues with it.</p> <p>Companies have been preparing for this legislation for years.  As I said on Committee Stage, it has been companies of a certain size which have been preparing for and expecting this legislation to come into effect.  Smaller companies were never to be included, so they have not been preparing and ramping up for it.  We must give them time to do that.  Perhaps when we come to review the legislation we will see that things have changed and companies will have more capacity and administrative capacity.  I hope at that stage companies will see how well the legislation is working, how well this kind of transparency reflects on companies and perhaps then those smaller companies might take the leap.  The review might perceive that and take it on board.</p></speech>

We do want to get to the point where companies with fewer than 50 employees will be part of this benchmarking.  There is nothing to stop them doing it voluntarily but we do have to consider, with all of the pressures they are under, especially at present, whether they have the HR infrastructure to cope.  There is also the capacity and resources in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  It will have a role in this, as it is enabled to apply to the Circuit Court for an order requiring employers to comply with the regulations.  This is something we will have to monitor as part of the review in the context of whether employers have the existing capacity to deal with this.  Employers need to be taken into consideration but this is wide-ranging legislation and we need to consider how we support it from an infrastructural point of view.  I agree with the sentiment.  We are moving in the right direction and, as Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, it is an historic day.</p></speech>

In particular, I acknowledge, as Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, that this is historic and I very much welcome the legislation.  I will absolutely be working constructively with the Government to ensure it passes swiftly.  I assure the Minister of that.  I will not seek to delay it in any way.  Reflecting on the comments of Senator Pauline O'Reilly, it is almost 50 years since we passed the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act in 1974, which was supposed to herald an end to all pay discrimination for women.  Women in Ireland have been waiting a very long time to see that bear fruit in terms of equality of pay.  This is the reality.  That Act, which requires individual employees to take action when they experience individual discrimination, simply does not work to address collective pay inequity.  This is why we need this wage transparency legislation, which we have seen work in other jurisdictions.  It has been in place in some jurisdictions for many years.  We have good models.</p> <p>My Bill was introduced in the Seanad in May 2017, four years ago.  That was already at a point when legislation was in place in Britain and companies here were all gearing up and preparing.  Unfortunately, there has been a really unnecessary delay in introducing this.  I do not in any way hold the Minister responsible for this because he has acted very swiftly on it.  It is unfortunate that we have seen such a long delay and that it has contributed to the delays the National Women's Council has spoken about.  The National Women's Council speaks about it taking 270 years to get to pay equality if we do nothing.  I am very glad we are doing something.  This is historic.  The reason I have tabled the amendments is not to delay the Bill but rather to emphasise the urgency of making this law effective.</p></speech>

Again, it is to address the issue I raised on Committee Stage.  This is very much a facilitative Bill and does not provide very much by way of detail as to how the regulations will take effect, what duties will be on employers and how the pay transparency guidelines will be enforced.  The Minister mentioned the lack of detail in my proposed amendment earlier with regard to consultation with trade unions.  We are seeing very little detail in the provisions of the Bill as it stands, as to how it will take effect.  I thanked the Minister on Committee Stage for setting out in a little more detail, for example, the idea of the website.  If one were to read the language of the Bill there really is very little guidance for employers, unions or women in workplaces as to exactly how the legislation is to take effect and what the regulations will contain.  It is expressed in such general and less peremptory terms.  We are simply seeking to highlight this point by substituting the word "shall" for that of "may" in the two places where it arises in the provision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#W00800"><p>I would not entirely agree with Senator Bacik on the lack of detail in the Bill, particularly when we look at section 20A(1)(a) and 20A(1)(b) and the various criteria.  There are eight criteria.  Section 20A(4) contains more details on how the regulations will be shaped.  I would not entirely agree with the Senator.  We have put in quite a significant amount of detail in terms of what will be covered in these regulations.  I accept and I take the bona fides of the Senator in terms of her desire to ensure there is a robust reporting requirement and that it is as broad and far-reaching as possible.  This is an intention I share.  I will be keeping this vision in mind when we design the regulations.  Subsections (4) to (9), inclusive, of section 20A are drafted in such a way as to allow some degree of flexibility when drafting the regulations, should that be necessary.</p> <p>As I have said, the regulations will need to be clear and specific.  It is my intention that they will contain all of the information listed in subsections 20A (4) to (9), inclusive, unless an issue arises at the drafting stage that might need some degree of flexibility.  It is for this purpose that we will provide for some degree of flexibility in terms of using the word "may" rather than "shall".  In legislation and regulations as detailed as these will need to be, this degree of flexibility is important.</p> <p>As I have said, the Bill provides for a flexible framework for the regulations.  The policies and principles are clearly listed in the sections I outlined earlier.  We want to avoid a situation where strictly adhering to the wording may cause confusion for those impacted by the regulations or create some degree of impossibility or another anomaly.  By using the word "may" instead of "shall", we give the drafters of the regulations some degree of flexibility, which is within the context of the significant detail set out in the primary legislation in terms of what these regulations must encompass.  The Senator has a subsequent amendment dealing with the issue of the website and we can perhaps discuss that later.</p></speech>

It is very important that we have flexibility.  If we pass legislation that does not have flexibility when it comes to regulations, we will be no longer able to make regulations that are robust and exactly fit for purpose.  It is only at the time we sit down to make regulations that we can really truly see how to make them as robust as possible.  We are fortunate that we have a Minister who has pulled out all of the stops to put the Bill in front of us in a very timely manner.  Everybody in the House has recognised this.  It is the same Minister who will be involved in the regulations.  Therefore, I trust that he needs this flexibility and we need to make sure it is as robust as possible.  An amendment has been accepted on Report Stage that will ensure it can be reviewed.  Given all of this, I am perfectly satisfied that it must be the word "may" rather than "shall".</p></speech>

Section 20A, as he Minister said, sets out the content of the information and it is great that we have this clarity but the lack of clarity I am referring to is about how it is to be conveyed.  Let me put these questions.  Will it be on a website?  The Minister clarified on Committee Stage that the information would be generated on our website.  Who will administer this website?  Will it be a central website?  Will it be individual websites of employers?  My next amendment addresses this.  Who will maintain and check the data published on the website?  Who will keep it updated?  Who will put out the press releases about it.  I accept that of course some flexibility is required but I am concerned.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is an over-reliance on flexibility at the expense of clarity for employers and employees on how this will take effect.  We know the data the employers will be obliged to provide, but to whom will they provide it and how will it be administered is the key question.  To be fair, it was one of the key questions that Ministers in the previous Government raised with me in regard to my Bill.  Under my Bill, IHREC was given the role of collecting the data from employers, publishing it, monitoring it and enforcing it in regard to breaches and so on.  We were very clear in that legislation on how the publication of gender pay gap information would be managed.  The then Minister and Government said that it was not an appropriate function for IHREC and that it would require a great deal of extra resourcing for IHREC.  I accepted that point, but what we were seeking to do was to provide clarity on how this provision would take effect.  Looking at other jurisdictions, that is a crucial question.  This is not just about detail as to the information that employers provide, it is also about the detail as to how the legislation will take effect.  The day-to-day mechanisms of who collects the data is critical.  The provision in subsections (4) and (5) do not outline in a clear fashion exactly what the regulations will provide with regard to classes of employer, classes of employee and so on, let alone how the data will be maintained.  The concern is the lack of clarity in this regard in the legislation.  That is a fair point to make.  We also had much stronger enforcement powers for IHREC in the original shape of the legislation.  We are concerned not to see any of that in this legislation.  We are also concerned that when the Bill is passed, there will still be a lack of certainty about how it will take effect.</p></speech>

I do not mean that as a criticism of the points the Senator is making.  I spoke briefly on the website, but I note the Senator has another amendment on it.  We will be setting up a centralised website.  Employers are welcome to publish their gender pay gap data on their own websites if they so wish, but there will be one centralised website, which will probably be the most significant part in terms of being able to demonstrate and compare data.  It is hoped it will have searchability functions in order that it will be possible to compare which companies have the greatest gap and the least gap and the like.  The view at the moment is that my Department will administer that website.  As I said, we will be putting out the request for tender on that shortly.  The website will take a bit of work.  I understand that on its first day the UK version had so many hits it crashed.  We want to avoid that type of situation.  The website will be used as a central element in disseminating this really important information, allowing a recognition of good practice and highlighting those employers whose practices are resulting in their female employees receiving significantly less pay than their male counterparts.</p> <p>Returning to the question of replacing "may" with "shall", as proposed in the amendment, I emphasise again the importance of having some degree of flexibility in the design of these regulations.  There will be a degree of complexity in the regulations in terms of meeting the various criteria set out in section 20(A).  I believe it is necessary in this section to provide the degree of flexibility that is provided by "may" rather than "shall".</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for confirming that there will be a centralised website.  My question is in regard to who will administer that website.  Under whose auspices or remit will it fall?  Will it be Revenue, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or some other organisation?  I ask the Minister to confirm what body or authority will administer the website.  </p> <p>I note that the Minister said that employers will be free to publish on their own websites.  The purpose of amendment No. 8 is to make that clear.  There is still a lack of certainty and clarity for employers and workers alike with regard to where the centralised data will be held and who will do the work to draw the comparisons that we have seen so powerfully made, for example on the British and Australian websites.  In other jurisdictions, we have seen a new agency established to run the website and collate the data.  I accept it is a massive task and that is why in our legislation we proposed to devolve that function to IHREC.  We do not get a sense in this Bill of who the task is being devolved to.  That is the key point.</p></speech>

In the age of social media, where they are present, it is too precise.  However, the point regarding is who will maintain it is an important one.  I would like to think that a presence on a centralised website, as described by the Minister, would be pointed to for reputational enhancement as well as the actual effect of bringing equity of pay.  When prescribing the regulations, the Minister should ensure the reference to that centralised website is within ethical audits that are easily accessible and searchable and also something to which the WRC in the context of an inspection would go to ensure the publication of the details is in order, which I have no doubt it will be.  I know that the reference to the WRC is already there, hence my point.</p></speech>

That is the most appropriate way in which this information would be conveyed.  Whereas I fully understand the proposal in the context of the lack of reference to a website in the primary legislation, I have a concern in regard to what Senator Bacik is seeking to achieve here.  I am concerned that in putting in that provision, even if only permissive, it would take away from the importance of the centralised website as the go-to source for information on gender pay information.  If we emphasise what companies put up on their own websites, there will be companies that do and others that do not.  Those who do have websites and a good story to tell will make that story front and centre.  They will do that irrespective of this legislation, but those who do not have a good story to tell will obviously bury the detail behind frequently asked questions or something like that, where it will not be very accessible.  If we legislate that the centralised website is to be the go-to source for this particular piece of information, it will ensure that companies, whether their story is positive or negative, will be listed there and current and potential employees will go to that source.  As stated by Senator Seery Kearney, the information there will become a key element in how we understand a company's compliance under a range of areas.  We are doing work on that website.  As I said, my Department will lead out in terms of the design and construction of the website.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have some further work to do in coming to a final decision regarding the compilation of the information but I believe that centralised website will become a valuable resource.

If I understand correctly, the website will be under the remit of his Department, although there is still a lack of clarity on that.  I was struck by the fact that, as a colleague has pointed out, while it will be this Minister making the regulations, the Bill provides for whoever the Minister is to have the power make regulations.  There may be too much flexibility as to the shape and form of the regulations and different Ministers may interpret the provisions very differently in the future.  That is why it is so important to have more clarity in the primary legislation.  I will just make that general point.  I thank the Minister for setting out some more detail on the website although it is still not quite clear who is going to administer it and under whose remit it will be.  It was helpful to hear something more about it.</p></speech>

It seeks to establish a little more clarity as to the detail of the process by which employers will publish information.  Again, the current wording is rather vague.  It reads "which shall not be more frequent than once in each year".  We are saying that it should be "at least annually".  This would give employers and workers alike a little more clarity.</p></speech>

The section as drafted provides some assurances to employers that they will not be required to report more often than annually.  However, while it is my intention that such reporting will be done annually, the section as drafted provides that level of flexibility to which I referred earlier and allows for such information to be set out in the regulations rather than the Bill.  I reiterate that it is my intention to set out clearly the form, manner and frequency of reporting - that frequency being annually - but I would prefer that the final Act remain flexible to accommodate any issues that may arise during drafting or when reporting commences.  On that basis, I will seek to retain the existing wording of the legislation and recommend that the amendment be rejected.</p></speech>

I was initially somewhat critical of this.  Our original Bill had provided for more extensive enforcement and accountability powers through building on the legislative framework for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  While I welcome the fact that section 5 of the Government Bill will give a role in enforcement to IHREC, through this amendment we want to ensure that IHREC would retain the power to exercise its own powers of its own motion.  The commission does, in fact, have extensive powers with regard to ordering equality audits and equality reviews in individual organisations to be carried out.  It has this power in respect of all organisations with more than 50 employees.  We want to strengthen the mechanisms through which IHREC may intervene in the enforcement of this legislation and in making it effective.</p></speech>

As I was reading these 12 amendments, I was conscious that this may very well be the final Bill the Senator passes in the Seanad.  I fully endorse what she has said on the issues.  She has talked about the need for enforcement powers.  I take this opportunity to thank the Senator for her 12 amendments and for the work she has done in respect of this important legislation.  It is up to the electorate but it may very well be her last reforming legislation in this important House.</p></speech>

I confirm to Senators that this amendment is not necessary and that the new section 32(5) will not prejudice the entitlement of IHREC to exercise its powers under section 32 in any such case of its own motion.  I stated on Committee Stage that the amendment was not necessary.  Again, the changes we are making will not prejudice IHREC's existing powers.  I accept that it is a point worth clarifying.  I hope I have been able to provide that clarification.  I suggest that the amendment is not necessary.</p></speech>

This is to be his first day in the Chair.  Given that the Senator has served as Attorney General and as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he is slightly more qualified for the role than I am.  I am sure he will do an excellent job.  He will be responsible for reading out the final part of this Bill and taking what could be Senator Bacik's last speech.  We hope that will be the case but we are not too sure.  We will miss her if she leaves so we might also hope that she stays.</p></speech>

That is very important.  It may prove to be very important in ensuring the legislation's effectiveness in the future.  When drafting our own Bill on the gender pay gap four or five years ago, the Bill introduced in this House in May 2017, we were very conscious that we wanted to build on existing statutory equality frameworks.  That is why we drafted our Bill as amending legislation to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  I still believe that is an appropriate framework for introducing effective legislation to address this glaring inequity, the gender pay gap.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that, even though he has not adopted the framework we suggested and even though we are somewhat unclear as to who exactly will collate the data and be responsible for maintaining the website and central repository of information, we can at least be assured that IHREC will retain the power to intervene of its own motion and, therefore, will retain that overarching function in monitoring how effective the legislation is in addressing the gender pay gap.  That is very welcome.</p></speech>

We should have equality of reference here.  I thank Senators for their substantive engagement with me on this legislation over the last weeks.  This is a significant day.  The passing of this legislation is significant in our journey towards gender equality.</p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly said that many Senators have waited all their lives for legislation like this.  I think it was said in jest but we have to recognise that it is a factor of Irish life that, in many situations, women continue to be paid less than men.  It is unacceptable and this legislation is an important step to redress that.  It is by no means the only step and, as a society, we have much more to do to ensure full gender equality in the workplace and in many other parts of society.  I am proud, as Minister with responsibility for equality, working with colleagues in the context of the programme for Government, to advance issues of gender equality, whether it is this legislation, better pay for those highly-gendered sections of the economy such as childcare, ensuring that women who suffer domestic violence while taking leave to address the situation that they are facing, and many other issues where we are advancing the equality agenda.  I have initiated a review of the equality legislation which will take place over the next year.  Today is a significant day.  Much more work remains to be done but we can recognise that we will have solid infrastructure for reporting of the gender pay gap between male and female employees.  This is an important step.</p></speech>

It is a good day to take over, when we are passing this important Bill.  I thank the Minister for his efficient steering of the Bill through the legislative process and for his courteous and full responses.  It has been good to work with him and with all colleagues in the House on this important legislation.  It is four years since the Labour Party introduced the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017 in the Seanad.  It is an important issue for many women and men across the country because it is one way in which women's rights are not adequately recognised and in which we fall short of equal standards in the workplace.  That is bad for women and men alike.  We have waited for a long time to see this important measure come into effect.  I welcome its passage today.  I am glad to be here to move amendments which seek to strengthen the legislation and also to highlight the points that we have discussed this afternoon, to ensure that the Bill is treated with urgency and that we see it being brought into effect as swiftly as possible after its passage.  I thank my colleague, Senator Boyhan, for seconding the amendments and for his kind words.  It is nice to hear those before I return to the streets of Dublin Bay South.</p></speech>

I congratulate everyone for the initiatives on this issue and for all of the work over the last years.  On a day like today, with the background of the battle of the barristers of Dublin Bay South, we should also note that outside of employment legislation, there are areas where women work where they migrate to the more poorly remunerated roles.  My own profession, law, is one of them.  There are sections of society where women are still poorly paid.  Those who earn more tend to be where the men are.  There is still an inherent injustice.  While the legislation today plants a flag in the context of employment, there is more work still to do.</p></speech>

There is no better person to preside over Committee Stage.  Others have spoken on this.  The Minister has outlined everything that has been done apart from this Bill.  It is important to look at this Bill in that context.  A number of amendments were about firming up some of the decision-making about gender pay gap legislation.  I can understand it when looking at one Bill in isolation.  Much has been done in the short time that this Minister has been in office.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has a long record from before even coming into this position.  It shows the importance of a good, solid programme for Government to address gender issues and being in government to get those things across the line.  We can call for things for decades as women but being in government has made the difference for me in getting them over the line.</p></speech>

I echo what Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, that this is important and an achievement.  It is important to have priorities in government and it is satisfying to get things over the line.  Well done to all involved.  While the Minister could not accept all the amendments today, I understand that it is important that he makes his case, but I also like the fact that he gives people an opportunity.  I do not like the word "reject".  I have said that to a number of Ministers when they suggest to the House that they might reject amendments.  It is the Minister's proposal and he does not want to change it.  It is a word that I would like to caution any Minister about.  The House decides.  I do not suggest that the Minister does not respect that because of course he does.  I thank him because he is always courteous, always listens, and he sets out his rationale and reasoning behind why he might not be in a position to accept an amendment.  He made a good case today.  I acknowledge that and thank those involved in the passage of this important legislation.  This is what we are primarily about.  We are about legislation and policy.  It is political, not personal.</p> <p>I thank Senator Bacik for sticking with this for so many years.  As Senator Seery Kearney said, we have much more work to do.  Let us not sit on our laurels now that we have passed legislation.  We have a hell of a lot of work to do on pay and gender equality.  That must permeate through every part of our process, thinking and actions in these Houses.  I thank the Minister and all the Senators involved in this debate.</p></speech>

I am not the spokesperson for equality so I feel like I am gate-crashing Final Stage.  I have been invested in this over the years.  I left my job because of a lack of flexibility.  I recognise that there are more than 60 Bills relating to employment and equality that we will work on.  This is the benchmark.  It is up to us to then provide the solutions.  As Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, that is a core part of the programme for Government.  It is apt that I refer to my previous career because I worked in communications.  It is up to us as a Government to communicate what best practice is at all times.  That is particularly relevant coming out of Covid when there has been so much pressure on people.  It has resulted in pressure on women.  We will see changes related to flexibility and remote working.  There is a role for us in establishing what best practice is or is not.  While this is about benchmarking and identifying the problem, we have to be leaders in rolling out solutions and what can work for people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I recognise the work of the WorkEqual campaign of which I am a co-chair.

People can find it very difficult to get tickets when they go on sale and many ticket touts are profiteering on the back of people's interest in cultural and sporting events.  I call the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#HH00100"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce the Sale of Tickets (Cultural, Entertainment, Recreational and Sporting Events) Bill 2021 to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  The aim of this Bill is to ban the practice of ticket touting or the resale of tickets for large, popular events for more than their original value.  This positive development will facilitate fairer access for genuine fans to tickets for cultural, entertainment, recreational and sporting events.  Its introduction is timely as we look forward to a point, hopefully in the very near future, when we will be able to attend concerts, theatres and matches again.  There was a positive pilot event in Kilmainham over the weekend.  That event showed just how useful antigen testing can be as a weapon in our armoury to fight the virus.</p> <p>As we look forward to further opening of society and the economy, in line with what I hope will be the improved public health situation and a successful vaccine roll-out, it is important that we are prepared for the inevitable increase in demand for tickets for live events.  We want to prevent fans from being taken advantage of due to the limit on attendance in the interests of public health.  Of course, the benefits of this legislation will long outlive the public health measures in place to stem Covid-19.  We have heard all too often of the experiences of genuine fans waiting patiently to buy tickets only to miss out and to see those same tickets for sale on a secondary site for far more than they can afford or are willing to pay, and for far more than the original value of the tickets.</p> <p>The systematic purchasing of tickets by touts and secondary sellers looking to make a quick profit at the expense of sport and music fans, sporting bodies, artists and promoters needs to stop.  I believe this Bill is the best vehicle to do that.  The Bill has been in development for some time.  A consultation process that began in 2017 showed almost universal support for legislation in line with the provisions presented here today.  A statutory ban on the resale of tickets above their face value was supported by: two of the three main sporting bodies, the GAA and the FAI; Ireland's two main events promoters, Aiken Promotions and MCD Live Nation; the Consumers Association of Ireland; many public representatives; and, not least, by consumers.  Several artists and entertainers have also expressed their disapproval of the secondary ticket market, especially with the growth in online markets.</p> <p>Opposition to a price cap at the time came mainly from primary ticket service providers and secondary ticket platforms.  At the time, one of the largest primary sellers was also in the market of resale but, in 2018, Ticketmaster announced it was closing its secondary resale websites, Seatwave and Get Me In, and would launch a fan-to-fan ticket exchange in which tickets could be resold for no more than their original price.  This fan exchange was launched in 2017 and facilitates fans who cannot attend events to transfer their tickets without making a profit.  While commercial considerations no doubt played a part in Ticketmaster's decision, it may also have been as a response to the growing opposition of fans, sporting bodies, promoters and artists to an unfair secondary ticket market.  </p> <p>Members of the Oireachtas have been actively engaged on this matter over recent years.  In 2017, the then Deputy Rock and the now Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, introduced a cross-party Private Members' Bill seeking the prohibition of above-cost ticket touting.  Later the same year, the Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill was introduced by Deputy Quinlivan.  In 2018, the Government made the decision to support the Bill from Deputies Stephen Donnelly and Rock on Second Stage and approved the drafting of a number of amendments to the Bill.  Unfortunately, that Bill lapsed upon the dissolution of the Thirty-second D&aacute;il and although the current Bill differs from it in several respects, it has the same objective, that is, to see fans treated fairly and to prohibit profiteering.  I regret it has taken so long to bring the Government's Bill before the Oireachtas but I hope we can progress it quickly and enact it at the same time as opening up society and the economy.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Deputy Quinlivan, former Deputy Rock and the current Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for their work on this positive and important initiative.  </p> <p>The overarching purpose of the Bill is to prohibit the sale or advertising for resale of tickets for a price exceeding the original sale price for designated events or events taking place in designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 people or more.  The Bill's application will be limited to those events that give rise to significant demand or where it would otherwise be in the public interest to prohibit resale at a price above the original sale value.  Designation will also make the task of monitoring and enforcing the legislation more effective because it will apply either to a particular individual event or a list of venues contained in a register.  </p> <p>The Bill currently includes a provision banning the unauthorised sale of tickets for matches or official events during the rescheduled Euro 2020 championship.  Its inclusion stems from a Government commitment given to UEFA as part of the bid for hosting a number of matches during the tournament in Dublin.  As no matches were held in Dublin due to the pandemic, and because the tournament is set to conclude on 11 July, the Government is proposing to move an amendment in this House to remove the provisions relating to Euro 2020.</p> <p>It is clear to me that we all want this legislation in place as sporting and arts events reopen.  This Bill will act as a deterrent to the unfair practice of buying up tickets at the expense of genuine fans, sporting bodies, etc.  I look forward to working with the House through all Stages of the Bill.  It underwent pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, has been adapted in light of the committee's report and has past all Stages in the D&aacute;il.  I hope we can have similar, cross-party support in the Seanad to ensure we get the Bill enacted before the summer.  I look forward to an informed, positive and constructive debate with all Senators.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill and am delighted to see its progression like everyone else in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Everybody finds ticket touting massively frustrating, particularly when there are so many genuine supporters of a team or artist who are unable to attend an event, and that is especially the case as we begin to see crowds returning to live sport and concerts.  It is important to ensure fairness for people.  I have been fortunate enough to attend a number of all-Ireland finals and concerts.  It is always infuriating to see touts selling tickets outside Croke Park when I know genuine supporters have not been able to receive a ticket.  In recent years, Galway has been in a couple of finals.  It would test your patience.</p></speech>

On a serious note, it has been frustrating and galling to see the resale websites becoming more common and charging extraordinary prices for tickets over the past decade, as the Minister of State alluded to.  I will be delighted to see an end to the practice.  The numbers of tickets available on those resale sites has increased and is growing consistently.  These websites were owned by promotional companies which sold the tickets originally.  It was, effectively, legalised touting.  Undercover investigations such as the one conducted by "Dispatches" on Channel 4 in the UK showed that large numbers of tickets were going directly onto resale websites without ever being sold.  Thankfully, that is no longer the case.</p> <p>Of course, no legislation will remove criminal acts entirely and we continue to see an issue over tickets being resold online, given how difficult it is to police.  This legislation will at least ensure it is being done by individuals rather than by the companies responsible for selling the tickets.</p> <p>Euro 2020 is happening currently and despite it being illegal, tickets for matches are being sold for thousands of pounds.  It was reported that tickets for last week's game between England and Germany sold for up to 20 times their face value in some cases, which is outrageous.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Organisations such as UEFA and other sporting bodies and promoters, despite what they may claim, do not particularly care if tickets end up being touted for far higher prices than their face value.  We also need to examine whether greater responsibility should be placed on the primary sellers of tickets to take every possible measure to ensure that tickets cannot be resold. </p><p>Given the technology we have in this day and age, it does not seem unreasonable to me that each ticket would have a name on it and a person would have to show his or her ID when entering an event.  Names could be linked to barcodes.  I appreciate this would result in cases where people who can no longer attend an event for whatever reason are left with tickets they cannot use, but it is better than tickets being sold outside of stadiums for hundreds or thousands of euro.  Other measures which achieve the same outcome do not result in people who are no longer able to attend an event having to suffer a loss.  It would be possible and preferable.</p><p>In his closing contribution I would be grateful if the Minister of State could offer his views on this, in particular on whether we need to enhance the responsibility of primary sellers, which I believe we should, to ensure that tickets go to genuine fans insofar as is humanly possible.  I acknowledge the work done in the past number of years by the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the former Deputy, Noel Rock, and Deputy Maurice Quinlivan.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am fairly familiar with the Bill and I recommend it.</p></speech>

There has been a lot of talk about it for a long time, but it has been a long time coming.  I understand that in 1998, the year Galway beat Kildare - there were probably ticket touts around then - Young Fine Gael proposed it.  There have been many calls for and promises and proposals on this Bill.  To paraphrase "Bleak House", the young person who was promised a new rocking horse has grown up, possessed himself or herself of a real horse and trotted away into the next world in the time it has taken the Oireachtas to address his or her concerns.  The Bill is now being rammed through all Stages in one hour.  That I have to be serious about, as it is no way to mark Seanad 100.  This is the Government spitting in the face of the Seanad yet again and I object to it, as I am sure many others do.</p> <p>In the brief time available to me, I will come to the Bill itself.  It is welcome.  There was a time when ticket touts were at least people who bought and resold tickets on the street.  They may have invested a few quid and were selling tickets on.  It was still gouging people.  A friend of mine, a fellow called John Smith, used to enjoy at concerts going up to people who were thinking of selling their spare tickets and frustrating the touters and gougers by telling them he was a genuine supporter and would give them face value for a ticket.  On a few occasions he succeeded, in the presence of outraged ticket touts, in getting people to follow their conscience and sell a ticket at face value to a genuine fan.  It is the case these days that we are not dealing with people on the street but very often websites which are being operated using bots and algorithms.  There may be criminal elements involved in the running of all of this.  A Bill is urgently needed to stop this practice.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that we will not have the likes of Ticketmaster being able to gouge further, as it did through its Seatwave resale platform where people returned tickets to sell them for further profits, which was disgraceful.  As I conclude my portion of this time, I wish to state that there should be something in the Bill to prevent people buying too many tickets at once.

They are not my words.  Rather, they are the words of the Minister of State.  That is good enough for me.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for pursuing this matter as quickly as he has.  I fully support every aspect of the Bill.  I also thank the Minister of State for acknowledging the generous contributions the former Deputy, Mr. Noel Rock, the Minister for Health, Deputy Steven Donnelly, and Deputy Maurice Quinlivan have made to the Bill.  The Minister of State left one person out whom I want to put on the record, namely, Deputy Denis Naughten, who did an awful lot of work and lifting in regard to the Bill which might have escaped some of us.  It is positive legislation.</p> <p>I take on board what Senator Mullen has said.  We are at the end of a term and the Minister of State is a keen and diligent Minister and wants to get the Bill through the Houses.  We not cannot countenance this practice continuing in the next session.  I know we are under pressure and are committed, but I am supportive of every Stage of the Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to take my comments back to his colleagues.  Given all of the pressures and constraints, we must always afford all sides of the House and the other House time to engage with legislation.  I thank the Minister of State and wish him every success with this important Bill.</p></speech>

I am from a similar county to that of the Cathaoirleach and I spend quite a bit of time at all-Ireland finals and semi-finals.  This Bill is important for our constituents and people living in our counties.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill in general.  Most people have spoken about the challenges we have faced in terms of ticket touts over the past 20 or 30 years.  Everyone has memories of walking to Croke Park through Jones' Road and seeing people buying and selling tickets.  That was the way things were done for a long time.  It was very hurtful to genuine fans.  In the past five or ten years, ticket touting has turned into a much more professionally run business.  Big businesses have been set up on the back of exploiting genuine fans. </p> <p>It is not a moment too soon that the Bill is being debated.  The Minister of State said he hoped the Bill would have been passed earlier but the important point is that it is being passed now and it is welcome on all sides of the House.  When the D&aacute;il and Seanad work together we can get good legislation through that will benefit citizens of the country.  </p> <p>It is important that the Bill is enacted quickly because we are in a situation whereby there are test events and spectators at events without massive capacity in stadiums.  On Sunday, 3,000 people attended the Clare and Tipperary game.  Demand is high and the number of tickets is low.  The possibility of exploitation on the part of ticket touts exists.  The fact that we are enacting the Bill as quickly as possible is hugely welcome because there is high demand given that people have not been able to go to games for the past two years.  Most people who are into sport, including me, want to get back to supporting their county or club and want to get to games.  There is a necessity to pass the Bill as quickly as possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Having that provision in place is important for them to be able to get extra money when they do have tickets that have been donated to them from clubs or organisations.<br/><br/>It is worth noting, and I am keen to put it on the record, that Young Fine Gael brought this forward a long time ago and promoted this measure.  The fact that it is coming through now shows the impact that youth-based political organisations and groups like that can have.  I wish to acknowledge the good work by Deputy Quinlivan and by Deputy Stephen Donnelly when he was in opposition, as well as my Fine Gael colleague, Noel Rock, who has done immense work on this in recent years.<br/><br/>This goes back to 2017 when U2 were playing concerts in Croke Park and tickets being sold on Ticketmaster's secondary website, <i>seatwave.ie</i>.  The tickets were on sale on the Ticketmaster site for &euro;80 or &euro;90 while on the other site, they were being sold for &euro;1,300.  It is outrageous that this was allowed to happen for so long.  People were being exploited to such an extent for things they really wanted to go to.  They believed these were once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to get to see their favourites.  They were spending vast sums of money on such events.  It was not right or fair.  I am keen to put on the record the contribution on ticket touting made by Noel Rock as a Deputy.  That is recognised by all.</p></speech>

I too welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Bill is welcomed by the Labour Party, by all sport and music fans and by all those who purchase tickets to attend events in the country.</p> <p>We should take the opportunity to mention the workers in the events industry.  They have gone through such difficult times in the past 14 months. and hopefully they are beginning to see some light with the opening up of their industry.</p> <p>We are looking forward to getting back to attending live sport, music and arts events once again.  We welcome the pilot programmes proposed by the Government and cannot wait for the maximum number of persons to return to these events once again.  One club got two tickets for yesterday's Leinster Championship match.  They were raffled between 120 members.  This brings it back and shows how scarce tickets can be for so many events, albeit the pandemic was the cause for this particular scarcity.  Thankfully, the Lilywhites overcame Offaly yesterday and the scramble in club draws will continue until the next day.  I imagine the Minister of State will also be on the lookout for tickets, given the opposition we will face in the forthcoming match.</p> <p>Being able to attend local GAA matches and seeing my nieces and nephews play in the past week showed to me the human need of all Irish people for the enjoyment of live sport.  There can be no doubt about the joy that these matches brought to so many in the GAA fields.  We must never underestimate the value of live events to the human spirit.</p> <p>I wish to mention one important aside.  Colleagues of the Minister of State have brought this up and I am sure the Minister of State is aware of it.  There have been calls for an end to pay-per-view matches.  This only brings home the enjoyment of live matches when people are not in a position to look in or are unable to attend and support their counties.  We must ensure that all our championship matches are free to air.</p> <p>It is in the context of ensuring that as many genuine fans as possible get to see their heroes that this Bill is so important.  The Bill looks to address the blatant exploitation of so-called ticket touts.  These middlemen are living off our desire for live events and depriving athletes, artists and organisations of potential money that would ensure their lives and organisations are far better.  In many cases this activity threatens the livelihood and advancement of those entertaining us at these events.</p> <p>The need for this Bill comes back to the ordinary person that ticket touting directly affects.  The current unregulated market curtails the common good.  It is a drain on society and prevents many from enjoying their favourite artist, event or team.  We are all aware of the pre-Internet days when a fan lucky enough to get a ticket would turn up at an event.  The first person he would meet was the person buying or selling a ticket.  Immediately the fan's thoughts turned to family and friends who, despite hours of trying, could not get tickets.  The fan was left asking how that happens.  On the other hand, if a genuine fan had a spare ticket, he would wait on the roadside of the venue seeking someone he knew or someone who looked like a genuine fan in order that he could pass on the ticket at face value.  Often the reaction of the prospective buyer told its own story.  The buyer would ask the fan why he was selling it for face value and whether the ticket was actually real.  Such was the joy of the buyer actually getting a ticket but the experience of the touting system was that the buyer would be expected to pay well above the face value of the ticket for the event.</p> <p>Now, we seem to have created a new online industry where a ticket for a live event is sold to the highest bidder.  Sites have been created for such modern problems.  At the same time these sites create problems for fans who continue to find themselves without a ticket and, most important, without the financial resources to afford the inflated prices these sites charge.  This is why we welcome the Bill and its attempt to promote fair access to tickets to cultural, entertainment recreational and sporting events.  As has been mentioned, exemptions would apply for charitable organisations and amateur sports clubs, which rely on these tickets for their resources.</p> <p>The Bill will allow fans to plan for and afford the ticket prices that those behind the events originally costed the event for.  Several Bills have been proposed.  It is right - it has already been done in the House today - to thank all those who proposed them and who have contributed to getting us to this day.</p> <p>We welcome this Bill.  The pandemic has whetted our appetites to get back to live events.  The Bill will, we hope, ensure fair access to tickets for events and ensure genuine fans will once again be able to roar on their teams or sing along to their favourite artists.</p></speech>

It is meaningful and it matters.  It is because Irish people, including the Irish sporting and music-following public really care.  They are seeking a step towards fairness.  Like other speakers, I welcome all those who had anything to do with this, including the current Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the former Deputy, Noel Rock, who is probably at home watching this.  He should be proud of his contribution.</p> <p>Several speakers have mentioned the genuine supporter and the stereotypical day in Croke Park, when we see someone who has a ticket to spare at short notice selling it for face value from one genuine GAA supporter to another.  I often wondered not about questioning the bona fides of the seller but of the person who received the ticket.  I am sure the seller was a good judge of person, although he or she had only a split second to make up his mind.  It galls me to think that the person who received it could then sell it on seconds later for a multiple of the face value.</p> <p>The orderly legislative purpose of this Bill comes into sharp focus when we think of contact tracing, which will be around for some time to come.  Contact tracing will be far more difficult to do if the black market is alive and well.  Moreover, with maximum capacity in many stadiums not back yet, there is need for as much fairness as possible.  Some stadiums are by nature small.  I think of the stadium in Newbridge.  Newbridge or nowhere, it is a fantastic atmospheric cauldron but tickets are always in great demand and not everyone can go.</p> <p>I note that notification was made to the EU Commission and, seemingly, there was no issue in respect of compatibility.  The legal advice has come back that despite the question over property rights, which this would qualify under, the property rights of ticket sellers are not unlimited.  This right is not unfettered.  On foot of that advice, the Minister of State is proceeding to do something that will no doubt make an impact and help consumers.</p> <p>With the little time I have left I will mention one other matter.  It is something for another day when we are talking about sporting events.  It is the use of drone recording from immediately outside the stadium.  This has the advantage of a vital three or four seconds of advanced transmission over the live feed.  If there is betting as a live sporting event unfolds, at the moment this is not captured in Irish law.</p></speech>

It is something in respect of which I will liaise directly with the appropriate Department.  For today I am keen to say, like everyone else, that it is great to have unanimity in the House.  It is a good day for legislators and a good day for consumers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P.

In the case of Johnny Giles, it was playing football in the streets.  His talent was nurtured, championed and fostered by his local community.  It is so important that we do not forget the people who are there in infancy - the embryonic stage before an international star is born - when there is such demand for tickets.  Those people who fostered, encouraged and coached voluntarily should be treated with the respect and fairness and this legislation is a great step in the right direction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#LL00200"><p>It is good to see the Minister of State.  He know he is always welcome.  I would normally agree with Senator Mullen.  There is something very uncomfortable about rushing Bills through this House.  However, I can fully understand the Minister of State's logic.  Westmeath dispatched Laois with ease at the weekend, Kildare will be a mere formality and the Leinster final awaits so I fully understand why the Minister of State needs to get this legislation through as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the legislation and we are happy to see it before the Seanad.  It has been a long time coming.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister of State paid tribute to Deputy Quinlivan, who did an awful lot of work on the Bill in 2017.  I should also recognise the work of former Deputy Noel Rock, Deputy Stephen Donnelly and others over the past couple of years.  This is important legislation that cannot be enacted soon enough.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that we are able to move this Bill forward.  There was much delay in the previous D&aacute;il in respect of a similar Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  The basic intention behind the Bill is to prohibit the sale or advertisement of tickets above selling price.  This legislation will be good for consumers and bad for ticket touts.  I grew up in north London where ticket touts were a major problem.  It was a feature of life every Saturday when I would go to see Spurs play.  We have all come across it in connection with concerts, football and hurling matches and a host of cultural events so this legislation is very much overdue and it is very welcome that the Minister of State is taking this important as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The basic intention behind the Bill is to prohibit the sale or advertisement of tickets above selling price.  The Bill will be good for consumers and bad for tickets touts.  The main aim of the Bill - and of the incarnations that preceded it - is to protect consumers and fans from overpricing.  This will promote fair access to events by prohibiting the sale or advertising for sale of tickets for a price exceeding the original sale price for events taking place in designated venues with a capacity of 1,000 or more.  In the context of the reopening of venues, we are still in a period of restrictions.  I acknowledge how much of a challenge the past year has been not just for the venues but also for artists, sound technicians and other supporting staff involved in the staging of any production, concert or similarly ticketed events.</p> <p>When many of us think about tickets being sold for more than the original price, we think of those people outside GAA stadiums or other venues selling tickets to fans waiting outside.  While this was an issue in the past for consumers who paid over the odds for tickets outside venues, there are more sophisticated organisations that buy tickets on release and subsequently sell them to consumers at higher prices.  This is the type of activity that the Bill sets out to curb.</p> <p>It is important to note that there are welcome exemptions in place on the sale or advertising of tickets or ticket packages by charitable organisations and amateur sports.  We all understand how important it is for some of those groups to use tickets like that for their fund raising efforts.  This is on the condition that the sale has been approved by the event organisers and the proceeds are used for the funding of the charity or amateur sports organisation.</p> <p>When we discuss our sporting events and artists, we must remember that without investment in grassroots sports and cultural spaces and support for artists, we will not have any events to go to.  There is a good conversation to be had on another occasion in terms of how we deal with greater support at grassroots level for all of our sports.</p> <p>I echo what others said about free-to-air events.  What happened at the weekend was a source of huge frustration for Limerick supporters among others.  It is wrong at the best of times not to have a free-to-air option but when pubs are closed and there are no other options to see events, we are literally forcing people back in time 30 years.  I know it is not directly related to the Bill, and I appreciate the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach, but it is something that needs to be addressed.  I know Senator Crowe raised the matter again this morning on the Order of Business.  I thank the Minister of State for his time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#LL00300"><p>I thank all the Senators who contributed.  The debate was largely positive.  The Bill marks a positive step forward in the promotion and protection of consumers.  It is about ensuring that legitimate fans can get access to tickets at the original value for sporting, music and other cultural events and not be fleeced.  It is good, therefore, that we have cross-party support and unanimity in the Seanad.</p> <p>It is perhaps regrettable that despite the fact that Private Members' Bills were introduced three or four years ago by Opposition Deputies in the D&aacute;il, it has taken so long to have this legislation introduced.  There are two aspects to that.  There are always competing demands in any Department in terms of drafting legislation.  One then has to go through various processes like pre-legislative scrutiny, which, in itself, takes a number of months.  It is something we can note going forward.  On the charge that the Bill is being rushed through today, no Opposition amendments have been submitted.  There is only one amendment coming from the Government.  We will deal with this in a timely fashion.  I do not think anyone has been prevented from having the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Sometimes it makes sense to do something efficiently.  We are criticised by some for not doing what is proposed fast enough and then we are criticised for bringing the Bill forward before the summer recess.  We know that we need it now because tickets are at a premium as a result of Covid-19.  Obviously, the problem has worsened but the Bill will be of benefit long after Covid.  We really need it now, which is why we wanted to get it in before the summer recess.</p> <p>In response to Senator Crowe, if the primary ticket sellers put their names on the tickets, we would not need this legislation.  That is the reason we intervened.</p> <p>In response to Senator Mullen, I do not know whether to take what he said as a compliment but we will leave that for others to say.</p> <p>In response to Senator Boyhan, I failed to acknowledge Deputy Denis Naughten, who initiated something similar in 1997, long before my time in the Oireachtas .  I am sure the Senator will forgive me for that.  The reason we want to get the Bill through before the end of this session is to have it in place when we have restricted numbers in stadia.</p> <p>Senator Ahern is right.  It is about protecting consumers and ensuring genuine fans in getting access to tickets at the original value.  The designation in terms of venues with a capacity to hold 1,000 or more is based on the normal capacity of a stadium, not on Covid limits.  This is not based on the reduced limits being introduced now because of Covid but, obviously, it will help.  The Senator is right to mention the issue of charities because so many charities and local GAA clubs depend on the ability to raffle tickets as a fundraising exercise.  That was a very important point that came up in the Bill.</p> <p>I do not think Senator Wall will have to worry about the All-Ireland issue.  As Senator Gavan said, Kildare will have a big challenge on its hands on the next occasion.  If Senator Wall can get me a ticket for the match, I would very much appreciate it.  We look forward to a good game on the day.</p> <p>Senator Martin made a point about a matter that is outside my remit but I will endeavour to refer to the appropriate Minister on his behalf.</p> <p>Senator Gavan set out the real reason we are rushing the Bill.  As a man who, like me, has strong links to Westmeath,  the Senator will undoubtedly be cheering on the county when we meet the Lilywhites in the not-to-distant future.</p> <p>Everybody spoke very positively and favourably about the Bill.  It is timely and appropriate.  I thank the House for facilitating its swift passage today.</p></speech>

The Bill currently includes a provision in section 20 banning the unauthorised sale or advertisements for sale of UEFA Euro 2020 tickets or ticket packages for matches or official events during the rescheduled Euro 2020 football championship.  Its inclusion stems from a Government commitment given to UEFA as part of the bid for hosting a number of matches during the tournament in Dublin.  No matches were held in Dublin due to the pandemic and it now transpires that the legislation will not be enacted and commenced before the end of the Euro 2020 tournament on 11 July.  Therefore, there is no reason to retain provisions relating to Euro 2020 as part of the Bill.  The Government is proposing to move an amendment in this House to remove the provisions relating to UEFA Euro 2020 tickets or ticket packages in section 20.  References to UEFA Euro 2020 are also made in the Long Title of the Bill, in the definitions in section 2 and under contract terms in section 19.  The deletion of these references, along with the technical amendments in sections 23, 24 and 26, are a result of the deletion of section 20.</p></speech>

My own amendment No. 42 covers a similar area.  In the original version of the Bill, these were the various factors as to what the Minister and the Government shall or may have regard to in performing their respective functions.  Senators Moynihan and Bacik may come in with more detail in terms of their amendment but speaking to my own approach to this, amendment No. 42 is what was proposed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action.  These were the factors, after long and extensive deliberation, we proposed under three categories, namely, those matters which the Minister and the Government should act in a manner consistent with; those matters which the Minister and the Government must have regard to and those matters which the Minister and the Government may have regard to.<br /><br />Many of the aspects we proposed are not reflected in the final Bill.  I acknowledge that some of the factors we had proposed where the language, &quot;consistent with&quot; should be taken in, have been taken in by the Government in another section.  The Government has taken in the national climate objective and Articles 2 and 4 of the Paris Agreement.  However, the Government has only taken in Articles 2 and 4.1 of the Paris Agreement.  I will be pressing on Report Stage that all of Article 4 be included in terms of being &quot;consistent with&quot;.<br /><br />I can speak to these amendments as a group because I take out some of the individual points and try to address them in these subsequent amendments.  A key concern for me is that the UN sustainable development goals are not mentioned anywhere in the Bill.  Ireland played the key role in negotiating the sustainable development goals, SDGs.  Globally, they are part of legislation and initiatives, such as at EU level.  We even see them in its response to Covid-19 in which the sustainable development goals are constantly referenced and there are references to our SDG targets.<br /><br />I am concerned Ireland makes no reference to the sustainable development goals anywhere in its legislation or in this crucial legislation.  The 2030 agenda is widely considered to be a combination of the Paris Agreement and the sustainable development goals.  Ireland basically chaired the negotiations to achieve the sustainable development goals.  We see many Ministers wearing the badges.  I am worried we do not seem to see a genuine engagement with the SDGs, in terms of being part of how we do things.<br /><br />The sustainable development goals are not aspirational.  They are not a charitable initiative.  They are a blueprint for development which takes in issues of climate change and which issues of climate change should take in.  I am concerned they are not referenced in the Bill.<br /><br />I have two amendments which try to address that, in that where sustainable development is referenced - which could mean anything - I specify the definition of sustainable development should include the UN sustainable development goals.  I also have a stand-alone amendment to directly insert the sustainable development goals as a matter for consideration.<br /><br />I urge the Minister to reflect on the fact of Ireland's relationship with the SDGs and how we worked hard in Ireland to get the world to come up with a blueprint on sustainable development.  Saying the word sustainable development means nothing unless we are clear about what it means.  The period of time will be longer until 2030 but that does not mean one cannot incorporate the SDGs until 2030 into this.<br /><br />I have two suggestions of how it could be addressed.  There are other ways it could be addressed.  It could be addressed through a definition of sustainable development in the definitions section at the beginning of the Bill and I may introduce that on Report Stage.  I urge the Minister to reflect on how we can ensure the sustainable development goals are appropriately referenced in the Bill.<br /><br />Amendment No. 44 references scientific advice.  I specify that should be advice which is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC,  in terms of relevant scientific advice.  There is considerable scientific advice out there, of varying quality.  It is important any advice Ireland relies on in these decision-making processes should be consistent with the IPCC's scientific advice. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will remove the amendment in respect of "behavioural change" and will replace it.  I have two separate amendments - one to replace the amendment I will remove and another with an addition included.</p><p>Some of the behavioural change focus rings hollow to people throughout Ireland.  There is a significant focus on what a person should do and what his or her "little piece" should be, yet there is a remarkable reluctance to change business as usual in terms of manufacturing, businesses, corporations, and in terms of being willing to say "No" to established corporate lobby groups.  This is a crucial point which we will come back to at a later section of the Bill.  Being willing to say "No" to the renewal of licences for prospecting or oil and gas extraction and exploration is crucial.  There should be behavioural change from the top, from Government, and it should show that it is willing to let go of some of the trickle-down economics and the idea that there are investors which are too big to argue with.  It should be willing to challenge that.  I will bring specific amendments forward that will tease out the area of oil and gas exploration, and licences.</p><p>Behavioural change begins from the top.  We know that the political signal sends the message downwards.  Rather than focusing on behavioural change, it would be more useful to use that space to focus on a joined-up analysis of consumption emissions within the State.  We should make sure that we are tracking emissions.  The idea of life cycle costing is within the Minister of State's area.  It is a matter of tracking emissions from their point of origin to their point of consumption and making sure that they do not disappear from either end of the balance sheet.  I suggest behavioural change is replaced with "the emissions of greenhouse gases into the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere attributable to the consumption of products or utilisation of services in the State", which ensures that the end of the process is captured, reflected upon and thought about.  This amendment could be added without deleting the other one.  I offer it in a number of different forms.</p><p>I refer to the group of amendments Nos. 50, 51 and 53, including a few others.  In amendment No. 50, I seek to delete "in so far as is practicable" as a caveat to the Minister's performance of his functions with regard to just transition.  The reference to just transition in the Bill simply refers to employment but, in amendment No. 52, I seek to insert the phrase "environmentally and socially sustainable".  In amendment No. 51, I seek to insert "environmentally and socially sustainable, quality" employment because the nature and kind of employment that will be available will be key to whether this will be a just transition.</p><p>Amendment No. 53 seeks to add "engage with".  This comes back to the question of support.  The Bill at the moment refers to supporting persons and communities that may be negatively impacted by climate action.  I refer to supporting and engaging with people.  This comes back to a contribution I made during the earlier debate which we discussed at great length, so I will not rehash it.  Social dialogue and community engagement in how we approach a just transition is important so that it is not a charitable after effect whereby one looks to provide some support.  It is about listening to communities and helping them shape and reimagine their futures.</p><p>Amendment No. 55 takes that to a more explicit level.  I use language, as we discussed, that is from the Scottish climate law.  In this amendment, I recognise the need to "develop and maintain social consensus through engagement with workers, trade unions, communities, non-governmental organisations" and business and industry representatives.  This directly mirrors the language in the Scottish climate law.  Scotland has been recognised as one of the places that - while it is not easy - has grappled most successfully with just transition.  It constantly tightens and improves its response in this area, including through extensive engagement with unions.</p><p>Lastly in this section, amendment No. 56 inserts "environmental" in terms of the special role of agriculture.  This is contained in section 4(8)(n) of the Bill which refers to "the special economic and social role of agriculture".  I am suggesting that it should state "the special economic, environment, and social role of agriculture".  This builds on some of the points made by others.  However, I am cautious in relation to how we approach removals and will come back to that on Report Stage.  While we must reward, support and recognise the environmental role of agriculture, we must also ensure that we meet the hard targets of genuine emissions reduction which makes sure we are not feeding the furnace of climate change.</p></speech>

She has made a good case, particularly in relation to the social and environment role of agriculture in its broadest terms.  I will refer to that when I comment on the section later because there are a few things I wish to say.</p> <p>The development goals are very important.  Many Senators are seen wearing the sustainable development goal badge around the place with great pride.  We talk and argue about sustainable development and they say "but" and "because it is not possible".  That is disappointing because it is not authentic in that they are sending out a message that they fully embrace the sustainable development goals.  If I could have found my badge, I would have put it on.  Unfortunately, I have to put my hands up and say that Deputy Eamon Ryan gave me one, but someone liked it so much that I gave it to them.  Perhaps I will get another one in the future.  Senator Higgins made valid points about the sustainable development goals and the just transition.  I do not want to take up any more time.  I fully support what she is endeavouring to do.  I speak in favour of these amendments.</p></speech>

Senator Higgins proposes two amendments in this regard.  The sustainable development goals are not directly referenced, that is true, within the climate Bill.  However, they are addressed through the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, and the Paris Agreement, which place legally binding obligations on the State and are separately identified within the Bill.  They are referenced in that way, indirectly.</p> <p>The sustainable development goals are not legally binding.  However, Ireland is a signatory fully committed to their implementation.  The sustainable development goals are much broader than what is contained in the Bill which focuses on a cut of 51% in our emissions over a decade.  They go far beyond that and they need to be covered in other legislation.  There are other legal acts that address these matters in an appropriate and stronger way.  For example, our national equality legislation, and related policies for these matters, are primary vehicles and should deliver on these objectives.  That addresses the sustainable development goals section.  I believe they are indirectly referenced through the Paris Agreement and the UNFCCC.</p> <p>I move on to the other amendments of which there are many in this section.  I refer to amendments Nos. 41 and 42 which enumerate items where there is a desire to move them up the hierarchy of how necessary they are to be considered, included or taken into account, or must have or may have regard to, and so on.  Amendment No. 41 proposes that "in performing their respective functions under this section, the Minister and the Government shall ensure that the national long-term climate action strategy is consistent with" and lists items it should be consistent with rather than having regard to.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The first thing I would say is that there have been changes in this and the centre acknowledged that there have been changes since the 2015 Act.  Some of these were looked at during pre-legislative scrutiny and progress was made in that regard.  If one looks in sections 3(3) and in other sections of the Act, there are a list of items that are "consistent with" rather than "have regard to".  From a broad point of view, when one is looking at a to-do list of any kind it is important to prioritise.  There is the saying that when everything is a priority then nothing is a priority.  If we are not singling out which items are more important than others or which items we want to do first before others, then there is always a risk that something will be undone or not reached and a goal that is not reached is more important than other goals.  That is why prioritisation is important.  It is important that this Bill lists the things that must happen, should happen and may happen.  For that reason, the Bill as is should continue as is.</p><p>Amendment No. 46 proposes that we delete "climate neutral economy" and substitute "completely decarbonised economy".  In other words, this is a move towards absolute zero rather than net zero.  This would provide that we would reach a point of absolute zero CO2 emissions by 2050.  The ambition of this Bill as it stands is to reach climate neutrality no later than 2050.  This is in line with the EU approach and also consistent with the Paris Agreement.  It is not physically possible to reach absolute zero by 2050.  If we put that into legislation we would be attempting to reach an impossible goal which would be simply unconvincing.  When one gives people a goal which they all believe is not possible to achieve, it puts them off making an effort.  The 2030 goal of a 51% reduction is huge.  Although it is likely to be consistent with the EU goal of 55% by 2030, the EU has made huge progress in the last decade compared with Ireland.  We are starting at the back of the pack and for us to reach that 51% reduction will be so hard.  It will require real effort and it will be incredibly difficult.  We have a challenging and ambitious target to reach 51% as it is.  Reaching net zero is simply impossible so I will not accept that amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 45 proposes: "after &ldquo;maximise&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;quality&rdquo;."  If one looks at section 4(8)(g) it provides: "in so far as practicable, the need to maximise employment, the attractiveness of the State for investment and the long term competitiveness of the economy;".  If we include "quality" here, we would need to define what we mean by that.  Quality employment is subjective and not a matter to be determined at an individual level.  That is a vague or uncertain amendment to put in.</p><p>Amendment No. 44 suggests: "after "advice" to insert "including advice from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change".  The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change, IPCC, informs science at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, which the Bill refers to and provides for under section 4(8)(c).  That section refers to: "relevant scientific...advice".  We have not specifically named the IPCC.  If we are naming a particular body and saying we have to be consistent with its advice, that raises the question of whether we have to follow all of its advice and if that means we have to be consistent with anything it publishes.  There are different levels of scientific paper that are published and sometimes they can be in conflict.  I would have preferred something that was along the lines of "best international advice" or "international best practice" but that is not before me.  The fact that the UNFCCC is referred to in the Bill should be enough because the IPCC informs the UNFCCC.</p><p>Amendment No. 49 also wants to substitute "completely decarbonised economy" into the Bill.  The same points are to be made as before about moving towards net zero.</p><p>I will deal with amendments Nos. 53 and 55 together.  They are about engaging: "with workers, trade unions, communities, non-governmental organisations".  These amendments are about being more explicit in our definition of "consultation".  The wording in the Bill refers to engaging with "persons".  A person can be a legal person and an organisation and in any public consultation, organisations are allowed to make their submissions.  It is normal that when making a submission in a public consultation one says whether the submission is individual or on behalf of an organisation.  The Minister will have to and would want to take all submissions from all organisations and from social partners because to do so strengthens the buy-in of society into any proposals that are being made and makes it more likely that the proposals will be acceptable and viable to the public as a whole.  On that basis, this engagement is already provided for in the Bill and the amendment is not needed.</p><p>Amendment No. 56 seeks: "In page 11, line 28, after "economic" to insert ", environmental,"."  This is in reference to agriculture.  Agriculture is central to the environment and the environment is central to agriculture.  This language is provided for as part of the programme for Government commitment which refers to the financial and long-standing cultural framing that agriculture provides in Ireland.  The overall objective of this Bill is to deliver on our climate targets and improve and restore our environment.  The role of the agricultural sector in this process and of our farmers as custodians of the land is clear and of critical importance.  This aspect will be operationalised in actions taken forward in future iterations of the climate action plan.  The amendment is not necessary and I will not accept it.</p></speech>

I am surprised at the Minister of State's response to amendment No. 56, given how much focus we have had on agriculture.  A good quarter of the debate the last time was on agriculture and on the somewhat rushed decision in respect of how removals have been included.  A lot more clarity and nuance were needed before that was inserted.  When we talk about clarity and nuance, that is something that should have been done much more clearly and we should have had a lot more debate on it.  We should have debated whether we are taking, for example, the UK approach or the EU approach.  The UK and the EU have quite different approaches to how removals are addressed within climate accounting.</p> <p>The amendments were not on public consultation but just transition.  We have had lengthy debate on just transition so I will not go over that but those amendments contain explicit legal language that was taken from the Scottish climate law, which holds that part of justice is dialogue.  That is a key principle in that law.</p> <p>The wording "as far as is practicable" was not addressed but we have had debates on that before.  It is important that we examine what kind of employment matters and that is an important factor.  If there is no sense of what "quality employment" might be in the Government, that would need to be clarified.  Hopefully we will get a chance to engage with the Government on that in the committee but as Ireland prepares to send its just transition application to Europe, we would want to be clear about what we mean by "quality employment" at that point, which is not far away.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will move to the other amendments.  On the IPCC science, it was not saying the Government must be consistent, it was saying that when it is "[having] regard to [...] scientific or technical advice" that such advice should include advice from the IPCC.  If the Minister of State has a different or better wording for that I urge him to bring it back on Report Stage.  The Bill will be returning to the D&aacute;il anyway as amendment No. 1 was accepted, so why not fix it if the Minister of State has a good idea?  He should bring it forward.</p><p>On the UN sustainable development goals, SDGs, I must again strongly and clearly disagree.  It is not enough to reference the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement.  The Minister of State has just told us it is not legally binding.  That tells us it may or may not happen.  It is precisely because it is not legally binding that we must show we have a commitment to it and that we mean anything by it.  With due respect to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, his is the Department responsible for leading on the sustainable development goals and unfortunately he has given very little leadership in this area.  I acknowledge colleagues in the Minister of State's own party who are part of the cross-party group, which has representatives from all parties in the Oireachtas, on the sustainable development goals.  It is something that matters to us and we need to show it.</p><p>It is not a matter of saying one cannot put in everything.  Let us be clear about what the Government has put in.  It has included having regard to "the attractiveness of the State for investment", "in so far as practicable".  We will come to this in section 20 but is all investment equally welcome?  Do we want to attract every kind of investment or do we have discretion over what kinds of investment we want to invite?  In section 20 we may actually need to place limitations on the liability we have to investors.  Sustainable development is referenced in section 4(8)(b).  If the Government is going to reference sustainable development and a little bit later it is going to talk about the attractiveness of the State to investors and competitiveness, I ask what sustainable development does it mean if we cannot reference the SDGs?  Is there another parallel version of sustainable development that means sustaining business as usual?  That could be the case, that could be what is meant.  The Minister of State talked about not being clear, that there is no definition of some of the other phrases I have suggested.  There is no definition of "sustainable development" in this Bill and it could mean absolutely anything.  It could mean something quite different to Shell or Exxon than it does to a small business in Ireland or to the communities mentioned, for example, under Sustainable Development Goal 11: "sustainable cities and communities".</p><p>I urge the Minister of State to reflect on that matter.  I will be pressing amendments on the sustainable development goals on Report Stage.  I will be putting forward a number of approaches to it.  I urge the Government to bring its own approach to ensuring the sustainable development goals are referenced and are acknowledged in this legislation.  We must show we care about them.  I mentioned the definitions but one place the goals are particularly important is with respect to the development of the sectoral strategies.  The Government should want to have sectoral strategies in each of the areas that are addressing their climate goals such that they are addressing them in a way that is also fulfilling the SDGs because those are so closely aligned.  The section I was inserting this into had the wording "shall have regard to", as opposed to must be consistent with.  It is in one version of my amendment but I have amendments where I use the wording "may have regard to" and "shall have regard to".  It would be a very poor signal were this Government to say that as it develops these strategies over the next ten years, it should not have regard to the sustainable development goals.  I urge the Minister of State to rethink that between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

The SDGs are, as she said, not legally binding but the Paris Agreement is and it refers to them.  The Paris Agreement is directly referred to in this legislation.  We should also bear in mind the SDGs are time-bound to 2030 whereas this is legislation focused on 2050 and as such it goes beyond that date.  The SDGs will be referred to in the climate action plan and there will be an SDG implementation plan later this year.  The SDGs should be referred to throughout all our legislation, not just the climate Bill.  We must ensure we are consistent in those ways.  I do listen to the Senator's points.</p></speech>

It is yet another reminder of the importance of reflecting and incorporating those goals in this Bill.  We must show that we are serious when we talk about a different model of development and that we are not simply trying to tag a climate target in alongside a model of development that directly conflicts with the achievement of our climate goals.  This amendment would demonstrate that, instead, we want to put our faith in the United Nations SDGs, which have detailed targets and indicators.  They provide a meaningful blueprint for a joined-up approach to environmental and equality issues, and one which charts a path towards a form of development in the next ten years which has the potential to save our floundering and burning planet.  This may give us the chance for sustainability in the sense of existential survival.  Therefore, I am all for the UN SDGs going into the Bill.  The Government should be as well.  If this amendment is not accepted today, I will reintroduce it on Report Stage.</p><p>Amendment No. 28 refers to the Aarhus Convention.  This convention is law already, but we must have a reminder of it when we are having regard to policies on climate.  Let us be very clear that an erosion is under way regarding access to environmental decision-making and participation.  Ireland is going to face judgment by the Aarhus committee in the autumn.  I do not think we are on track to do well.  I have seen a number of points of erosion in this regard in the year since this Government came into office, from forestry appeals right through to the removal of the checks and balances between housing, planning and heritage which used to exist for Natura 2000 sites.  This is vitally important because of the constant sword-waving about judicial reviews.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is losing 98% of cases because it is making terrible decisions that have not been thought out.</p><p>It is in that context that I mention the Aarhus Convention.  I am conscious that it is already legislated for and we should not have to put it into this Bill.  It should not need to be mentioned in the Bill.  It is absolutely vital that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the entire Government are cognisant of the Aarhus Convention in the approach they take to the various functions, measures, plans, strategies and sectoral approaches set out in this Bill.  This again comes back to the SDGs and a joined-up approach being very important.  We cannot, for example, decide not to consider environmental factors on the basis that we are rushing a policy on energy.</p><p>Amendment No. 29 relates to the point I made on the life-cycle effect and ensuring we at least consider consumption as well as production emissions.  Consumption emissions may not be factored in as part of our 51% target, but we must be thinking about them because, ultimately, we are sharing one planet.  Emissions from what is produced in one place and consumed in another enter the same atmosphere.  For that reason, I urge that in our approach we try to find a way to at least think about a fuller picture of emissions.</p></speech>

I will speak on amendment No. 60 concerning emissions and companies.  I have spoken about this topic several times in this Chamber and I have also had some engagement with Departments on it.  I would love to see it progressing as part of this legislation.</p><p>Last Friday, I referred to an article in <i>The Guardian</i>which highlighted that 100 companies produce more than 70% of global emissions.  It is worth bearing that statistic in mind when considering this amendment.  When we talk about common but differentiated responsibilities to combat climate change, it is clear that we must invite these companies into the conversation if we want to have a real, long-term just transition.  We do not want to vilify these companies that employ our citizens and give them jobs and livelihoods, but to work with them.  We want to set up frameworks whereby these companies can work with the communities in which they and their employees are based, and empower them to contribute to Ireland&rsquo;s move to a cleaner and more environmentally-conscious future.  The amendment calls for companies to make their emissions public.  It is hoped that making those figures public, as well as the plans of such companies to reduce their emissions year on year, will give a clear indication that everyone in Ireland is driving towards the same goal.</p><p>Taking such an approach is an opportunity for multinational companies, which can sometimes feel faceless, to integrate into their local communities and become more transparent.  In doing so, they can also pay heed to the ideals of a just transition, whereby we drive towards a common goal of reducing our emissions by at least 51% while taking a differentiated approach based on the respective capabilities of individuals and companies.  This opportunity to become more transparent and, as a result, to be truly integrated into an Ireland that drives towards reducing our admissions, will require these companies to commit to working with us and to adopting reporting mechanisms that are public and accessible.  When I say accessible, I mean standardised reporting frameworks, written in plain English, that can be easily read by any member of the public.  Taking such an approach encourages transparency and acts as a starting point for a grassroots and community-led just transition.</p><p>Inviting these companies in will mean we can work as one to agree an accountability framework that will allow us to hold each other to account in the same manner as we do individuals.  However, if we fail to do this, then we will surely risk the failure of any good work done through this legislation.  Such failure may not occur today or this year, but in the future.  That is certainly not a risk that I believe any of us are in a position to take.  In all the conversations I have had in recent months regarding companies being transparent concerning their emissions and having a public register in that regard, there has always been a great deal of fear mentioned first regarding the burdens which may be placed on companies.  It is now to weigh the burden of such administration against the burden being placed on the climate.  We must decide which is the greater risk and the heaviest burden.</p><p>Many positive conversations can be had regarding what that framework may look like.  We cannot have a conversation which entails small SMEs leading out on this type of policy or people who do not have the required access to build what such a framework would look like.  However, some of the world&rsquo;s biggest companies are in Ireland.  If they led the way in creating this framework, other companies could follow and feed into it.  I ask the Minister of State to accept this amendment, which goes back to our conversations last week about how we share the burden equally.  We can only truly show that big companies are sharing this burden if they are willing to participate publicly in our endeavours by being transparent about their emissions and how they plan to reduce them.  Most companies like competition.</p><p>It may be slightly different, perhaps, but I remember facilitating conversations in Trinity College Dublin, TCD, on fossil fuels.  The big institutions enjoyed leading by example and being the first institution to do something.  If we include in the Bill a requirement for companies to be transparent on emissions and big companies then take the lead in this regard, it will be much easier for the rest to follow.  This is an important part of the wider conversation on this legislation.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

He is my local Green Party Deputy and I also served with him as a councillor for some years on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I wish him well in his work in government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Amendment No. 58 relates to the Aarhus Convention, which I have heard the Minister of State comment on many times.  I took the time to look at the Green Party's website the other night and I compliment him on his party's excellent website.  A lot of historical material has been left on it, which is clever and good.  I cannot say that about some parties.  References to the Aarhus Convention are peppered throughout the website, which mentions engagement and the importance of the convention.  I have had dealings with the Aarhus Convention, albeit more with the built environment and built heritage than with this aspect of the environment.  It is a very important convention.<br/><br/>I hope the Minister of State will accept this amendment.  I do not know what briefing notes he has and I cannot anticipate what he might say but I would make a strong case that he should accept it.  He stands for this, the Green Party stands for it and its members stand for it.  The Green Party has been a strong advocate, to be fair to it, for the principles and substantial issues around the Aarhus Convention and the right of engagement.  Only today in <i>The Irish Times</i>there was a piece, to which Senator Higgins alluded, about engagement, strategic development and all the issues around that.  One thing we have to stand up for and protect is the right of our citizens to engage.  It is not about closing people down.  It is about including people.  When people talk about objectors to developments or activities, it is not about closing them down.  They must be listened to.  They are citizens and we live in a democracy.  The Minister of State was given a strong mandate on green and environmental issues and he has a strong record on that, in fairness to him.  The people who voted green did so because they were committed to the party's ideals and principles.  The Green Party's commitment to the Aarhus Convention is strong.  Now it is about walking the walk.  It is about being here in the centre of power, in which the party sought to be, and making those decisions.  I ask the Government to seriously consider including this very simple and excellent amendment in the names of Senators Higgins, Ruane, Black and Flynn.  It makes sense.  Amendment No. 58 should be included in the Bill.</p></speech>

I will also speak in support of amendment No. 58, from Senators Higgins, Ruane, Black and Flynn, on the importance of the Aarhus Convention.  It is well known that in Ireland we are very poor at engaging with the public in consultation and having access to information.  I hope we can get to my amendment No. 112 on banning the importation of fracked gas.  An example of the application of the Aarhus Convention is the fact that the Attorney General says we cannot ban the importation of fracked gas because of EU rules, whereas I have received legal opinion from the European Parliament research services and NUIG stating that is not the case.  I believe the energy charter treaty is the reason we do not have a ban on the importation of fracked gas because it has an investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism attached to it.  We could ban the importation of fracked gas but we would face paying compensation of millions of euro.  We can talk in more detail about that when we get to amendment No. 112 but I have been trying to get to the bottom of this issue.  We cannot get the Attorney General's advice but, equally, when I put in a freedom of information request asking if there was any correspondence between Fortress Energy and the Department, I got a report back saying there was correspondence but that I would not get it because it had been redacted.  I now have to appeal that decision.  That is just an example of how poor we are at allowing people access to information on the environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#UU00300"><p>When we talk about these amendments and the things we can add in, we forget about all the things that are already in the Bill.  As the Minister of State noted, and the Minister referred to this on Friday as well, the actions of the Government and the Minister must be consistent with the UNFCCC and Articles 2 and 4.1 of the Paris Agreement.  Let us not forget the number of commitments in those agreements, which include a number of the matters mentioned in some of these amendments.</p><p>The Bill is peppered with references to public participation, although it may not mention the Aarhus Convention.  The Joint Committee on Climate Action discussed at length whether it was legally appropriate to include a specific reference to the Aarhus Convention in the Bill.  We must not forget that Ireland has signed up to that convention and it has been ratified so we have that obligation in any event.  I pushed for recommendation 57 of the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report, which provided that the Minister would determine whether the entire Bill had been checked for compliance with the Aarhus Convention.  It is not enough to put that in one place; the entire Bill has to be consistent with and comply with the convention.  The Minister of State may let us know if that is the case.  Including references to various measures that we have already signed up to is not always the best legal practice.  We went into government to have the strongest possible legislation, not legislation that mentions so many things that are all put into the pot as if they were equal.</p><p>Fundamentally, people came before the committee to talk about just transition and I noted in my questioning that not one of those people mentioned intergenerational justice.  We could be putting more and more things into this Bill that do not actually mention that.  Yes, we have to care about the jobs of the people currently living in our country and move them into other jobs that will also pay them but let us not put that ahead of future generations.  We are in a desperate condition globally as regards climate.  The Bill refers to a just transition.  Section 6 refers to:</p> <blockquote> 	the requirement for a just transition to a climate neutral economy which endeavours, in so far as is practicable, to&mdash;  	(i) maximise employment opportunities, and <br /><br />(ii) support persons and communities that may be negatively affected by the transition;  </blockquote> <p>All of this is in the Bill.  These provisions may not be exactly as everyone wants them to be but let us not forget that they are there.  Senator Boylan was not here all day on Friday when a number of her amendments were taken but there were many amendments with different definitions of just transition.  While we cannot put everything into the Bill, that does not mean we are not taking these actions.</p><p>I take the point about the sustainable development goals, which we discussed at length at the committee.  I would love to see sustainable development goals in all legislation, not just climate legislation, because they impact on everything.  In some ways it is more important to have sustainable development goals in legislation that is not directly related to climate, in order that it be taken into consideration.  The SDGs are referenced in the UNFCCC.  I get a little frustrated with people who want to put more and more into the Bill when we have been at this for a year.  We had months of pre-legislative scrutiny and we all did our best to get as much in as possible but, legally speaking, throwing everything into the pot does not bring us the ultimate outcome we want, which is to move to a 51% reduction by 2030 and to enhance the council giving the scientific advice on all these matters to the Government.  Every party, including Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party and the Labour Party, said it wanted just transition, because nobody wants his or her constituents to go without when it comes to a transition.  I have no fear that this Bill will not do what we need it to do but we need to move on and get it done. </p></speech>

Colm Keena wrote an interesting article in <i>The Irish Times</i>about access to judicial reviews and how the Government is looking at limiting access to judicial review through the courts, particularly in the area of environmental planning and legislation.  This is an important amendment.  I have questions about how the Government has moved to the strategic housing development, SHD, process and whether it fulfils Ireland's obligations under the Aarhus Convention.  There is certainly a strong case under the convention if the Government moves to limit both the right of people to have participation in environmental and planning decisions under the process and access to the courts.  That is a significant move the Government has been floating in recent months.  This is an important amendment because it will put specific reference to the Aarhus Convention into the legislation.  The Government is already slicing and dicing its obligations under the convention, which is a dangerous road to be going down.  While people might say we have signed up to convention, there is a strong case to be made for making this amendment.</p></speech>

Senator Moynihan touched on the article written by Colm Keena in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Its reference to engagement over access to environmental information was an awakening for all of us.  This is a simple amendment but it is perhaps one of the most important.  I do not like the idea that anyone should attempt to trivialise the Aarhus Convention.  It is a comprehensive convention and covers many areas.  It refers to access for environmental information and the importance of many aspects of what we are dealing with in this Bill.  This is an important amendment and I thank Senators Higgins, Ruane, Black and Flynn for tabling it.  While it is a short amendment, people might ask why we should put it in but why should we exclude it?  Why not include it?  It is important that the convention is included in the legislation.  It is important for the Minister of State's party, for his and its credentials and for its stated support for the Aarhus Convention.  I see no reason it cannot be included.</p></speech>

There are 142 amendments in total, we will be having discussions on various sections and the debate is due to conclude at 7.30 p.m.  We should move as speedily as we can in order that we can debate as many amendments as possible.</p></speech>

These amendments are grouped because they all seek to add to the list of concepts to which the Minister and the Government must have regard when they are making national, long-term climate action strategy, sector emissions ceilings, preparing climate plans and so on.  There are 18 concepts listed.  That list was the result of recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny report and a hierarchy was formed with the other concepts listed in section 4(8).  These four amendments seek to add more items to that list.</p> <p>The first amendment proposes to include the SDGs.  I will not speak at length on this issue because I covered it in a previous contribution.  The issue will be brought up again on Report Stage.  In short, although the SDGs are not binding, the Paris Agreement is binding and it is referenced in the Bill.</p> <p>As Senator Boyhan said, I have taken an interest in the Aarhus Convention and have used it successfully in the past.  It can do things that are not possible under, for example, freedom of information legislation.  It is not just about obtaining information, it is also about including people in public consultation and in public decision-making.  This Bill goes further than just relying on the Aarhus Convention for that public consultation because it provides a statutory basis for various forms of public consultation so that people have more of a sense that they have contributed and that the formation of carbon plans and strategies is done in a more democratic fashion.  Ireland is a full signatory to the Aarhus Convention.  I take Senator Higgins's points that there will be a report later this year about its implementation.  That report may show some deficiencies, although I do not know what they are going to be.  I do not think this Bill is the place to correct those deficiencies.  The Aarhus Convention is in operation in Ireland and I have used it in the past.  I am not sure how including reference to the convention in this section and adding it as a 19th concept for the Minister and the Government to have regard to will help.</p> <p>Amendment No. 59 is interesting because the idea is to look at the consumption of emissions rather than just their production.  One can imagine a country that produces no emissions at all but imports them from a country on the other side of the world which is burning things.  It is a form of outsourcing emissions and that is the area at which this amendment looks.  When one is trying to control emissions or attempts are being made internationally to control them, going back to the Kyoto Agreement, the first thing to do is to say that if one wants to manage emissions, they must first be measured through a common method and agreed metrics on what emissions are.  To do that, everybody sits down and asks how they should be measured.  Nobody wants to double count emissions, so the question arises as to whether emissions should be measured in the place where the emissions are consumed or produced.  A decision was made to measure emissions on the basis of production rather than consumption.  That metric was used not just in the Kyoto Protocol but also in the Paris Agreement.  Under the production-based approach, emissions are attributed to the country in which they are produced rather than consumed.  That must be examined at some point.  There are different ways to consider the issue.  Would it be better to measure emissions by consumption rather than production?  If you do both, you end up double counting.</p> <p>I have done a great deal of project management over the years.  One of the best ways to kill a project is to keep adding things to do it, pushing its scope and thinking of more things to include until the project is no longer viable and never happens.  I would put this amendment into that frame.  If we are going to measure production and consumption, we are probably going to do nothing.</p> <p>The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has produced research on consumption-based emissions.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, funded that.  The results of the research will be coming out and I am looking forward to them.  The project will estimate consumption-based emissions for Ireland, focusing on where the emissions are being emitted across the globe and in which products they are concentrated.  An additional project will use those estimates to examine the impacts of reducing emissions through reduced consumption of high-emission goods by applying a green VAT.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The outcome of the research and the recommendations based on it are expected later this year and will be examined by the Department, when available, separately.  We come back to concepts like carbon leakage or a carbon border tax.  Those are issues that will have to be looked at in the future.</p><p>Amendment No. 60, on which Senator Ruane spoke, proposes that "the amount of emissions produced by registered companies within the State and accountability mechanisms in respect of such emissions" should be taken into account.  My fundamental problem with this is that it imposes a requirement on the Government or the Minister to take into account the emissions of these companies, rather than imposing a requirement on the companies to report their emissions, which would be a better way of managing the matter.  Most emissions are from the private sector and the whole purpose of the Bill is to cut emissions wherever they are from, be it the public sector or the private sector, over a decade.  We have to cut private sector emissions.  All of these companies have to cut their emissions or we will not reach our goal.  They have to be a part of it but this is not the way to do it.  What is required is that emissions, whether they are produced privately or publicly, are cut, and that they are done through the climate action plan, regulation, taxation and public policy.  That is the way they will be cut.</p><p>Those are my answers in respect of the four amendments, none of which I am proposing to accept.</p></speech>

The argument the Department successfully made was that because section 15 only referred to a Minister of the Government but did not refer directly to the Government as a whole, according to Mr. Justice Garrett Simons, there was &quot;no statutory obligation on the Government&quot; to take account of the national climate plan or national carbon reduction objectives.  We have had this Government and this Department arguing that certain language in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 functions as a loophole, meaning that the Government cannot be held to account.  That language is still in the Bill.  One of the key points of disagreement I had with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in terms of numerous recommendations from the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action related to accountability and the importance of same.  The Government and the Department have successfully used a loophole recently.  Why on earth would that not be addressed or fixed in this Bill?</p><p>I will not talk about each of my amendments in each of their locations.  I want to signal that I probably will not press them for reasons of time.  Instead, I will support the amendment tabled by Senators Bacik and Moynihan, which does something similar and which seeks to ensure that at every point that this issue of the non-inclusion of a reference to the Government featured, it would be perceived that where a Minister of the Government is referenced, then the Government would be assumed to be referenced.  That amendment does this in quite a clean way.  It would be a single amendment vote and therefore, a bit easier.</p><p>One exception I will make is to amendment No. 108.  The ruling I mentioned earlier was delivered in the process of a series of legal challenges to the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, project, which Friends of the Irish Environment had taken.  That points to the importance of clarity and transparency.  We cannot argue that the issue of LNG is not relevant to this Bill when we look to the fact that the previous legislation was central in a case on the LNG project.  In a reversal, in the court the Department argued that because the Government is not listed as a relevant body under section 15, it is not bound by the provisions of the relevant body.  However, in the Chamber the argument has been that the Government cannot be listed as a body and therefore it cannot be listed as a relevant body and that is why the Government cannot get it inserted into the list of relevant bodies in section 15.  It is a circular argument whereby, on one hand, we are being told we cannot go into that section and, on the other, the Government is stating that it cannot be held accountable because it is not in that section.</p><p>I am seeking to add direct reference to the Government throughout the Bill.  In amendment No. 108, I explicitly do not seek to include the Government in the list of relevant bodies but I say that a relevant body or &quot;the Government of Ireland&quot; must abide by the various different provisions.  That addresses the concern that it cannot be said that the Government is a relevant body because the Government is not being put into that subcategory.  However, the amendment would insert reference to the Government of Ireland into section 15 and would thereby appropriately ensure that the kind of loophole which was used in the High Court case to which I refer would not be used again.</p><p>Amendment No. 108 satisfies both versions of the concern and the argument and addresses them both in a clear way.  Why would we not address a loophole if a legally sound way to address it is presented?  The amendment represents a legally sound way to address that loophole.</p></speech>

What the amendments are trying to achieve is to avoid the pitfall or difficulty to which the 2015 Act gave rise in the context of how it was interpreted court.  The Senator believes that the same language is used in this Bill and that it will be affected by the same problems as a result.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was listening to the Senator's argument but I am not sure how changing "Government" to "Government of Ireland" will fix anything or make anything materially different.

It is "Minister of Government" and "Government of Ireland".</p> <p>To address the fear that the Bill will have the same wording problem that arose in court with the 2015 legislation, it is worth saying that the new 2021 legislation is very different and has substantially different requirements and obligations that are much more onerous on the Minister and Government. </p> <p>Section 3(3), as substituted in the Bill, states that the Minister and Government are now bound to carry out their respective functions under a list of matters which have to be consistent with the climate objectives specified in the 1992 convention and the Paris Agreement.  These are very specific obligations which were not in the 2015 Act.  I do not believe this amendment is necessary to correct a perceived loophole in the 2015 legislation.</p> <p>On the Senator's point on the body and Government of Ireland, section 16 amends section 15 of the principal Act with the substitution of "A relevant body shall, in so far as practicable, perform its functions in a manner consistent with".  The Senator wants to change this to "A relevant body and the Government of Ireland".  Her feeling is that the Government is not a body.  It can not go into a schedule of bodies and, therefore, it needs to be included in the Bill.  She referred to the 2015 Act where the view of the judge was that the Government is not responsible because it is not included in that clause. </p> <p>However, I return to the fact that the Bill provides specific obligations on the Government which were not enumerated in the 2015 Act.  The 2021 Bill specifically lists things that the Government and Minister must do.  These are enumerated in section 3(3) and are very clear and unambiguous, and have been designed in that way.  The wording and amendments were discussed with the Office of the Attorney General to determine the best way to make sure the Bill is watertight.  To my satisfaction, this is the best way to word it and for that reason, I will not accept the amendments.</p></speech>

It does not state that the Government is required to do what was at issue in the High Court case.</p><p>Section 15 states that a relevant body shall have regard to the most recently approved adaptation mitigation plan and so on.  It does not speak to those specific plans.  It simply states that the Government has to be consistent in its functions.  It is not clear which functions are involved.  The Government may well be consistent in terms of its functions, but it may not be regarded in its functions as having to be relevant and consistent with other factors, specifically the sectoral adaptation plans, the national adaptation framework, the national mitigation plan and so forth. </p><p>This is not completely new legislation.  It is, ultimately, amending the 2015 legislation.  It is still in place.  This is not a <i>tabula rasa</i>.  There may be a concern about section 15.  The judge did not spontaneously come up with these issues.  They came up because those arguments were put forward.  </p><p>In order to give confidence to everybody, including the public, that there is no intention to have some future argument it would be advisable to consider these points.  If there is no legal reason not to refer to the Government of Ireland in section 15, as I propose in amendment No. 108, why not do so?  The great legal concept is &quot;for the avoidance of doubt&quot;.  It would be very useful for the avoidance of doubt and it should be considered.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 54 was ruled out of order.  It related to milled peat and the sustainability of the Irish mushroom food sector which now faces a total wipeout unless something is done.  I do not want to mix up the two issues in regard to this Bill, but we have talked about social, environmental, cultural and economic roles.  It fits in with this.  This issue was selected to be in section 6 and that is why I want to raise it.  I accept the ruling from the Cathaoirleach that the basis of the amendment was ruled out of order because there was a potential charge on the Exchequer.  That is grand with me.</p> <p>I am not particularly happy that we are not having a detailed debate, but it would be remiss of me not to mention this issue, on behalf of the mushroom growers of Monaghan, Louth, Kildare and Wexford, who have raised it with me and believe there is a case for some peat to be used.  When we talk about sustainability and carbon leakage, we cannot have a situation where shipments of peat imports are now arriving into this country via means that use heavy crude oil.  </p> <p>We know some sectors and quarters are being encouraged to go beyond the Baltic states where a lot of peat is available and there are different regulations and regimes by which peat can be brought into Ireland.  That is not acceptable.  It also involves carbon leakage.  That is not the way to go.  The alternatives being considered are Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Scotland, which are not viable.  </p> <p>I want to raise an issue.  I consider it to be hypocrisy, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, if we cannot, through this discussion, come up with some arrangement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a balancing act.

I took the time to go into several supermarkets at the weekend to see the Bord Bia-approved label stamped on mushrooms.  Bord Bia is an amazing organisation, which has amazing Government budgets given to it.  No budget has been ring-fenced for Bord Bia but that is another day's work and perhaps the Government might wish to look at that at some point.  Bord Bia has a mandate to promote the Irish horticultural food sector.  It is a successful sector and it sustains households, families, agriculture and communities, and it is vital.  These are the issues of concern I wish to raise and I am keen to flag them.  We are going to see this sector wiped out within months unless we do address this point.

It is on the back of the High Court finding that the Government was not a relevant body.  There was a bizarre situation whereby a Minister was responsible and then magically ceased to be responsible when he or she crossed the threshold of the Cabinet room.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State but he referred to the difficulty that arose in this regard in the High Court.  It was not a difficulty.  This was the argument used by the Department to defend itself in court.  The Department pointed out to the judge that the Government was not a relevant body because it was not listed as a relevant body in the legislation.  Reference was made to assurances that this will not be used again in future cases.  I do not understand the resistance to amendment No. 65, which is to ensure that the Government and the Minister are both responsible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#YY01100"><p>We have discussed this already but I will go back into it again.  I thank Senator Boylan for making her points.  The role of Government throughout the climate Bill is central to the operation of the Bill.  There are great changes between this Bill and the previous Bill.  The overall target is set in the legislation and this is something of which the Government will need to have clear consideration.  A statutory obligation is being created, one that is almost certainly justiciable.  That is by design.</p> <p>Even without any broad sweeping obligations, the Government remains the Executive power of the State and is therefore answerable to the courts.  If the legislation is not fulfilling the targets set in the Bill, the Government is likely to be in court.</p> <p>However, a scenario involving the Government ending up in court is not an efficient way to do business.  I understand that we want to have justiciable legislation and to have the measure as a final resort.  However, I wish to remind everyone that over the past decade, we had legally binding targets for emissions reductions that were simply ignored.  They were not met.  They were in theory legally binding.  There were fines and in theory a person could force a country to meet those obligations.  Ireland simply did not do it.  My fear is that in the coming decade or in the period between 2020 and 2030, this would happen again.  Simply having a mechanism that produces an option to bring the Government or a Minister to court and impose a fine on either party or force them by court order to do something will be ineffective, even though it is put forward as a solution.  It did not work before.  It does not work because the Governments in place during the past decade are gone now.  They have been dissolved and the Ministers who were in office are no longer in those Ministries.  Everyone has moved on.  Who will a complainant take to court?  Will it be the new person who has moved in or the new Government?  It is not an effective way to achieve climate change.  One way that is effective is when people have a change of mindset, when everyone commits and when there is a genuine public desire to change the economic, social, cultural and environmental norms that we have had for something new.  That is what we need to do rather than bring the Government to court.  Throughout the process there has been a great focus on bringing the Government or a Minister to court and having a judge order the Minister or Government to change their ways after the fact.</p> <p>One of the big changes in the 2021 Bill is that it now imposes specific obligations on the Government in a way that was not the case before.  This is distinct from the 2015 Act, which imposed obligations on a relevant body or Minister.  Now, the Government has those obligations.</p> <p>Section 5 of the 2021 Bill substitutes a new section 3 in the 2015 Act that imposes specific obligations on the State to reduce the extent of further global warming and to pursue and achieve, no later than the year 2050, the transition to a climate-resilient, biodiversity-rich and environmentally-suitable climate-neutral economy.  It imposes a specific obligation on the State to pursue and achieve the national climate objective and, in that context, obliges the Minister to make and submit to the Government for approval a carbon budget, a sectoral emissions ceiling, a climate action plan, a national long-term plan of action and a national adaptation framework.  It is by doing all these things, by involving the public, Deputies and Senators in both Houses, by involving every part of society in a process that is constantly monitored and updated, that has legal backing and that has buy-in from the public, that we achieve change.  It is not by appearing in the High Court and getting a judge to get a sanction against a Minister who has retired.</p> <p>Under section 3(3), as substituted, the Minister and the Government are now bound by an overarching obligation to carry out their respective functions under sections 4, 5, 6, 6B, 6C and 6D of the 2015 Act, as amended, in a manner consistent with the ultimate objective specified in the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Paris Agreement.</p> <p>I will not accept the amendment as it would create a potential inconsistency with the specific and unambiguous obligations imposed on the Government in the context of section 3 of the 2015 Act, as substituted.  It would impose a level of micromanagement on the Government that would be unprecedented in its scope and would lead to the possibility of endless legal challenge to Government actions on climate change.  The time should instead be spent carrying out climate actions rather than engaging in court battles.  This would potentially endanger the achievement of the fundamental objective of the Bill.</p></speech>

In fact, I believe the Minister of State has made the case for these changes to be necessary.  We are talking about Ministers retiring as if we are chasing.  I am reminded of when people are talking about mother and baby homes.  They say the nuns are all gone and ask who we are chasing after.  The point is not whether Ministers have come and gone and have retired or were in government.  Many of the colleagues of the Minister of State were in government during the past decade and are in government again now.  It is not a completely new slate.  We have the same Ministers in many cases.</p> <p>The fact is that these judicial cases have had an impact.  They have had an impact on inadequate strategies in Ireland.  Climate Case Ireland had a major impact.  These cases have had a strong impact in the Netherlands.  There is a reason why companies there are suddenly trying to move cheese manufacturing to Ireland.  It is because they have been pulled up and are required to meet higher targets in the courts.  Again, it comes back to the constant idea of needing to get the public with us and on board.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The public are ahead of the Government in many areas of this issue.  It is citizens who have demanded more from their governments in many cases around the world.  They have done it by saying they take seriously the words governments put down in law, they want governments to take those words seriously and they are demanding governments follow through on them.  That is why we are talking about this.  I want good legislation that delivers, Governments to deliver on that legislation and for us as parliamentarians to hold them to account.  This amendment is a safety net.  The Government will not want to be taken to court but this Bill has a limited liability clause.  It reduces some of the areas of accountability that already exist and at the same time, the Government proposes to introduce investor courts.  In respect of many of the companies listed in sections 20 and 21 that have prospecting, extraction or exploration licences, we are saying if they have an existing arrangement, they might get a new arrangement.  Many of them have a track record of taking cases against governments to slow down climate action.  There are clear records of obstructing climate action.  When we seek to strengthen litigation and the power of litigation, and nobody loves courts in that context, we do so to ensure citizens have a chance of some form of an equality of arms against the very well resourced legal pressures applied by corporations, which want to milk and squeeze a last five or ten years of profits out of the world.  That is what is happening and can be seen, for example, in the Gulf of Mexico.  In terms of accountability, the 2050 target is justiciable but, unfortunately, the 2030 target is not.  We will shortly come to discuss the way it has been worded.  It is there for the advisory council to propose but it is not there in the same robust way .  I hope we can make it robust and the Minister of State manages to deliver out to the 51% reduction target but we are moving that power out of the Bill where it belongs in proper law into an amorphous political negotiations base.  Again, that is why we are talking about the courts.  It is not a romanticised vision; it is because there is a reality whereby very strong actors are using legal and financial pressure to slow the actions we need.  We want to make sure there is a counter-pressure coming on Government that will then empower the Government to do what it needs to do to get us towards our targets.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has made the case as to why this amendment is essential.  Nobody would want to take the Government to court.  We would rather the Government do what it signed up to do in legislation but, unfortunately, the reality is that citizens have had to hold Governments to account.  The Minister of State would have supported the climate case and it had a very successful result.  It proves that taking the Government to court is necessary in some cases and is an effective mechanism.  It is becoming increasingly popular internationally to force governments' hands.  The Minister of State has said we just need to bring people along with us, people are already there, they were marching on the streets for climate action.  We cannot leave it simply with the Government saying "trust us, we will do this".  We need to have it legally binding in the Bill to hold the Government to account and that will future-proof it for future Governments.  I urge the Minister of State to reconsider the amendment.  He has made the case as to why it is very important.</p></speech>

Taking legal action against a Government to try to force it to do things is a reasonable thing to do but it is insufficient.  My fear is that in the past decade, having legal obligations and even fines was not enough to make change happen.  We also need a focus on  the actions, the monitoring and the yearly continuation and constant management of our climate budgets and targets.  I am reminded of how John Gormley brought in climate budgets a decade ago and after the financial budget he would read out his carbon budget.  When a new Government came into office, the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government, it simply dropped that right away because nobody really cared.  It matters when the establishment's view or the general mindset is that there is no value to climate action.  What is important is those actions are carried out and managed and monitored.</p></speech>

I will not rehash the points I made on foot of amendment No. 60.  I will deal with them when we reach amendment No. 70, which addresses the question of who should be properly doing things and what the targets should be.  Amendment No. 69 deals simply with the question of who is accountable.  Fundamentally, the programme for Government commitment to ensure we have a 7% reduction in emissions year on year is not delivered because we do not know that we will have that; we only know what will happen in 2030.  Leaving aside the 51% reduction in emissions target by that year, it is only a requirement the advisory council would propose budgets that might aim for a 51% reduction by that year. There are multiple routes it might propose.  It could propose increasing emissions and diving emissions at the end.  Ultimately, it is only the council which is required to propose it but there is not a requirement on the Minister to accept it or the Government to approve it.  That is a foolish move. The political battle has been won in getting this target into the programme for Government.  The right thing to do with the political point that has been won is to put it into law.  Instead we have it going out of it.  I urge the Minister of State to consider accepting this amendment, which provides the 51% reduction is proposed by the advisory council and approved by the Government.  Let us make sure there is no slip between cup and lip in what is proposed by the advisory council in that regard.</p><p>Amendment No. 70 deals with the question of the 51% target.  If a 51% reduction target is proposed by the advisory council, surely it should also be approved by Government.  That should not be matter that is up for negotiation, bargaining or persuasion.  It should be set in stone</p></speech>

The relevant subsection is (5).  The Senator thinks there is a loophole in it and it is possible for a 51% reduction not to be made in the first two carbon budgets, which will cover the period up to December 2030.  The subsection states "The first two carbon budgets proposed by the Advisory Council shall provide for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions such that the total amount of annual greenhouse gas emissions in the year ending on 31 December 2030 is 51 per cent less than the annual greenhouse gas emissions reported for the year" and so on.  That is crystal clear.  There is not wording such as "consider" or "have regard to".  The subsections states "the Advisory Council shall".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If it did not do it, it would be illegal.

There are two carbon budgets leading to 2030 and they shall be proposed by the advisory council in such a way that they meet a 51% target before being approved by the Government, subject to any amendments.  I cannot see any logical way to avoid meeting that level.  Could the Senator describe a scenario where we would not meet the 51% figure, or the carbon budget would see the figure of 41% or 31% that could be approved and somehow be consistent with the law?  I cannot see it.</p></speech>

It is why I have proposed and there should be clear interim targets in the Bill that stand alone.  The political commitment should be there and as an agreed point it should be in the law.  Instead, as part of the muddying of the waters, there is the process involving the advisory council.  It is meant to be an independent body and I hope the advisory council is free to propose more ambitious targets, as referred to in my amendment No. 70.  The 51% target might be politically achievable and negotiated but the advisory council is meant to be driven by science and other factors that could be considered.</p> <p>There should be an independent advisory council and a very specific target.  My amendment No. 70 deals with this specific target of 51% rather than "at least" 51%.  We are not even leaving it the scope to propose a more ambitious target.  That goes to the Minister, who may amend it, and then it goes to the Government, which might amend it.  I hope they do not amend it and it would be politically toxic for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael to try to amend, reduce or dilute the target.  I want to be clear on that.  Nevertheless, we would be bouncing something back to the Cabinet when we should be nailing it in law.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

As it stands, the Bill does not set any trajectory or guarantee a reduction of emissions all along.  It could be argued that this is required but it may allow emissions to rise as we go along.  What was so clear from all the witnesses before the climate committee was the need for a flight path.  I had an amendment ruled out of order that would ensure an average of 7%.  It takes in what is a principle akin to compound interest, with a 7% reduction and then another 7% on that reduced amount.  The idea of a 7% reduction was in the programme for Government.  It is slightly less than what is required, which is approximately 7.6%, according to international figures.  It was going in the right direction.</p><p>The concern now is the Bill just sets out what is happening in 2030.  It does not set out a trajectory or guarantee with regard to what happens in the meantime.  That concern was raised by Professor John Sweeney, Dr. Andrew Jackson and others.  They all raised the point clearly and I know they wrote to the Government about it.  This part of the Bill is poorly worded and a mistake.</p><p>There is a small element that is really important to me.  In the climate committee we asked that there would be a minimum interim target for 2030.  There should be a 51% target but this should be set as the floor because we must reach it, rather than setting it as a ceiling, which means we cannot do better than 51%.  Perhaps we could do better but the advisory council might not be able to aim higher than 51%.  That is why I want to include the words &quot;at least&quot;.  It would give the advisory council the scope to propose something more ambitious.  It may well be that the Government agrees with the 51% figure because it is what is politically achievable for it, but the advisory council is free in an independent way to propose something more ambitious in respect of that second budget, for example.</p></speech>

One is where there is new scientific advice demonstrating more is needed and the other is where a new international agreement is entered into with a higher level of ambition.  It is not foreseen that the climate change advisory council would take a policy role where it would set a higher level of ambition than is set by the 51% figure.</p> <p>The 51% figure is incredibly ambitious and it will be extremely hard to meet it.  We saw reductions in emissions, even during a year of lockdown, did not meet our expectations.  That was even when nobody was driving anywhere, commuting to work or flying.  We did not have the reduction in emissions we hoped for.  Lockdown is hard but we are now looking at ten years of consistently huge reductions in emissions in Ireland for us to make up for the fact we did not do anything in previous decades.  It will be so much harder to reach that target.</p> <p>Sometimes people might look at the figure and see it as similar to the European target but it will be incredibly difficult to get there.  If we can cut our emissions in half in a decade, it would be an incredible achievement.  There are two mechanisms for increasing the target but I am not proposing to empower the Climate Change Advisory Council to order society to go beyond what is already a very challenging and ambitious target.</p></speech>

I will make a start and keep the show on the road.  This amends section 9 on page 15, line 20.  It would delete &quot;may&quot; and substitute &quot;shall&quot;.  The amendment would be made to section 9 on carbon budgets and compels D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to refer a carbon budget proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council, finalised by the Minister and approved by the Government to a joint committee which shall consider the carbon budget and provide a report in writing containing its recommendations to both Houses of the Oireachtas within two months from the date on which it is presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Without this amendment, I argue this referral is at the discretion of the Lower House only.  We have discussed this in great detail in both Houses and there has been very valid engagement with the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Department on these matters.  I therefore think it appropriate and right that the matter should come back to both Houses of the Oireachtas, in other words, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I hope the Minister of State will support the amendment.  It makes reasonable sense and is fair.  It recognises the significance and importance of both Houses and also the significance of the Members of both Houses who served on the climate action committee.  I have commended the committee already but do so again.  Much work was done and committee members had a lot of input into this.  Many of these issues have been gone through and teased out by those who were present.  It would be right and appropriate to acknowledge that and to deal with those issues in relation to both Houses.</p></speech>

My problem with that is that I do not feel it is appropriate for our legislation to legislate requirements on to one of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is also a highly unusual thing to do.  How the Oireachtas conducts its business is a matter for Standing Orders.  For that reason, we drafted it as a suggestion.  Even then, that is unusual.  The Bill states that the D&aacute;il "may" refer to a committee rather than "shall".  For that reason, I do not think it would be appropriate to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

The part I am concerned about is on the subcommittees of the advisory council.  The subcommittees do not have to meet the same criteria in that members are not necessarily members of the advisory council.  The committee can maintain other members.  There may be only one member of the advisory council on a subcommittee.  Functions, including the setting of carbon budgets, can be designated to that subcommittee.</p> <p>The concern with that is that one may have interests, including some of those which have been discussed, such as other bodies.  One of the bodies which needs to have a careful relationship, in this regard, is the Electricity Supply Board.  I was hoping we would have time to discuss greater transparency in terms of the investment measures of the Electricity Supply Board.  I am concerned that there may be major investors in the Electricity Supply Board, under its new enhanced powers, who may end up on a subcommittee, according to the Bill.  I am not saying that would be the intent of the Government but the Bill, as drafted, and the 2015 legislation provide for that.  That may be slightly more to do with the next amendment.</p></speech>

Section 9 of the Act provides that the CCAC membership will have expertise in at least one of a number of areas of expertise relevant to the work of the CCAC.  That list now includes climate science, transport, energy and agriculture policy, behavioural and communication services, biodiversity, ecosystems, climate adaptation, economics, finance, political sociology or ethics with regard to climate and so on.  That is just to broaden that out from a committee which was very much focused on economics.</p> <p>While social justice, policy and inclusion are not specifically referenced, it does not prevent the Minister from nominating individuals who have knowledge in those areas.  Acknowledging the broad range of expertise and competences required on the CCAC membership, the Bill has been further amended to increase membership to a maximum of 13 members.  That is to increase the capacity of the council to include as broad as possible a range of expertises and backgrounds, which is absolutely necessary to any functioning committee that can take all perspectives into account and come up with conclusions in touch with all of society.</p> <p>Its key role is proposing carbon budgets.  The CCAC must ensure consistency with our international obligations, including the Paris Agreement, which will be implemented to reflect equity in the context of sustainable development and efforts to reduce poverty.  The CCAC must also have regard to climate justice and thus, the social opportunities, as well as potential impacts on society, will be ever present.</p> <p>If you look at sections 11(2) of the 2015 Act, it provides the CCAC is open to establish subcommittees and the composition of such a subcommittee is not limited to just CCAC members.  The CCAC may therefore appoint or seek external expertise in relevant matters, should it be required, and the CCAC may also produce expertise to assist it in preparing reports on specific matters.  As applies to all committees, it has to be aware of any conflicts of interest when appointing people.  That is standard practice.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-05a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021070500002#GGG00500"><p>Amendment No. 1 technically amends section 1 on the definitions of the Bill, to remove the definition of: "Minister".  My full title, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is now used in section 5 of the Bill, which is the only provision in the Bill that refers to me as Minister.  It is just a technical change.</p> <p>The next Government amendment is No. 6.  This amendment inserts a new section 4 into the Bill to provide for a technical amendment to section 12 of the 2004 Act, which relates to the obligations of landlords.  The amendment will require that a landlord is obliged to furnish a tenant with a statement in writing on how the rent set under the tenancy of the dwelling has been calculated, having regard to section 19, rather than having regard to just section 19(4).  The effect of this amendment is that a landlord's statement will also cover the calculation of rent in accordance with the new section 19(4A), which provides that any rent increase in a rent pressure zone, RPZ, cannot exceed any inflation recorded in the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP.</p> <p>Amendment No. 7 is the substantive change which I flagged to Senators on Second Stage.  I said I would be coming back with a specific change we were working on around the RPZs and the calculation of the rent increases.  Amendment No. 7  is significant.  It inserts a new section 5 into the Bill, which amends section 19 of the 2004 Act.  Section 19 of the 2004 Act provides for rent setting and from the passing of this Bill, the formula provided in section 19(4) shall no longer apply in capping the maximum allowable rent in RPZs, that is, the 4% per annum issue.  The formula will be replaced by a requirement that any rent increase in an RPZ will not and shall not exceed any rent increase determined by the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, rent pressure zone calculator, with specific reference to the HICP values, in accordance with the new section 19(4A).  In real terms, if one looked back over the last three years, the average increase in the HICP was about 0.7%.  Year-on-year, it is short of 1.9%.  It is a significant change from the 4% per annum that was previously the benchmark.  We are effectively freezing the rent value and just allowing that to increase by inflation, should there be an increase in same.</p> <p>The RPZ calculator will calculate any permissible rent increase that may apply.  That will be managed by the RTB itself.  The user of the calculator shall input the following variables into the RPZ calculator: the date the rent was last set; and the amount of the rent last set.  The calculator shall produce the amount of the maximum permissible rent increase, if any.  The calculator may also indicate that no rent increase can apply.  In this situation, a landlord may reduce the rent or keep it at the same level.  Ultimately, the rent is agreed between the tenant and the landlord.  The calculator will operate as follows.  It will compare the HICP value in the HICP table published by the RTB on or most recently before the date that this rent was last set, with the HICP value contained in the table published by the RTB on or most recently before the date that any new rent increase is being determined.  Any difference between the two aforementioned values shall be calculated as a percentage by the RPZ calculator.  If that percentage is a positive value, that is, where there has been an increase in the HICP values over the period in question, it is applied by the calculator to the amount of the rent last set to produce an amount of permissible rent increase.</p> <p>Senators fully understand what we are doing here.  Amendment No. 7 effectively brings this change in.  I wanted to do that on this Stage because if these changes pass the Seanad today then they will be brought to the D&aacute;il and we will ensure there is an earlier signature motion to affect these changes, which are the most significant rental changes for tenants in at least five years.  These changes deal with an issue of the cumulative potential rent increases.  I will not talk about amendment No. 7 any further.</p> <p>There are Opposition amendments in the grouping as well but they have not been moved yet so I will address them momentarily.  Amendment No. 14 is another of my amendments.  This amendment inserts a new section 7 into the Bill, to amend section 22 of the 2004 Act, which provides for notices of rent.  Section 7 of the Bill inserts a new paragraph (g) into subsection 2A of section 22 to require that where section 19(4A) applies to a dwelling in a RPZ, that is, the new rent increase restriction linked to inflation, a notice of new rent served on a tenant shall, "state how any increase in the rent last set under the tenancy of the dwelling was calculated or, where section 19(4A) does not apply, state why it does not apply".</p> <p>Amendment No. 16 is also a Government amendment.  It inserts a new section 11 into the Bill, to amend section 115 of the 2004 Act, which provides for the redress that may be granted by an RTB determination order.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 11 of the Bill amends section 115 to ensure that a RTB dispute adjudicator or tribunal may make: &quot;A declaration [under section 2B] as to whether or not an amount of rent set under a tenancy of a dwelling complies with section 19(1) (and if the declaration is that that amount does not so comply, the declaration shall be accompanied by an indication by the adjudicator or the Tribunal as to what amount, in his or her ... opinion, would comply with section 19(1)).&quot;  The technical change in section 11 of the Bill is to provide a general reference to section 19 in section 115(2)(<i>b</i>) of the 2004 Act, and by doing so to cover the new section 19(4A) being inserted into the Bill.  These are, therefore, further technical amendments that ensure the change we made with regard to the harmonised index of consumer prices is reflected right the way through the legislation.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 17 is also mine and inserts a new section 12 into the Bill to amend Schedule 2 to the 2004 Act by extending the list of improper conduct by a landlord that is subject to Part 7A - Complaints, Investigations and Sanctions.  The RTB will be given power to investigate, with or without a complaint, and sanction any landlord in contravention of the new 19(4A) HICP linked rent increase restriction.  The Bill already contains an amendment to Schedule 2 to provide that improper conduct shall include the seeking of unlawful payments in respect of any deposit or advance rent.  An RTB sanction can cost a landlord up to &euro;30,000 so there is a serious deterrent in place to combat improper conduct.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 20 empowers the Minister to commence the new section 5 of the Bill, which requires that any rent increase in a rent pressure zone shall not exceed any rent increase determined by the RTB's rent pressure zone calculator, with reference to HICP values, in accordance with section 19(4A).  I intend to commence section 5 as soon as possible following the passing of the Bill.  All other provisions will commence automatically upon the passing of the Bill.<br/><br/>There are two final amendments in this grouping from the Government.  Amendment No. 21 provides for a technical amendment to identify the provisions of the Bill that will take account of the recycles.  Amendment No. 22 proposes to consequently amend the Long Title of the Bill to reflect that a new section 5 is to be introduced into the Bill to require that any rent increase in a RPZ shall not exceed inflation, as calculated under the HICP.  My colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick, has tabled an amendment that effectively does the same thing.  As other amendments are moved, I am quite happy to address those specifically.  I have confined my remarks to my own amendments.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire for returning again to the House and bringing forward these amendments.  I thank him for taking on board the feedback he has received from my party and obviously from others as well.  This is the fourth or fifth time he has legislated to protect renters in the year he has been in office.  I think it has been a year so I congratulate him on his one-year anniversary.</p> <p>It is really important that provisions are being made to extend protections for renters and limit the amount that can be demanded from renters in terms of an upfront payment, and that the notice period for student accommodation is being limited to 28 days.  All these provisions build on the further funding the Minister has given to the RTB to help it regulate and control conditions for renters but also on his commitment to the roll-out of an affordable cost-rental model.  That is a long-term, sustainable model that we need to get to.  I accept that these amendments are a very strong movement in that direction.</p> <p>I will conclude by saying that I will withdraw my amendment on the basis that the Minister is legislating to cap rent increases to inflation.  That is very welcome for renters and I am happy to withdraw my amendment accordingly.</p></speech>

The Minister has moved significantly, however, in terms of bringing rent increases in line with inflation and the consumer price index.  He is making a very welcome move on behalf of renters.</p> <p>I am going to withdraw my amendments.  I ask the Minister to bear in mind trying to get a mechanism for a rent freeze for people who are in financial difficulty.  I am aware that we will be coming back to the House with this Bill.  In the interests of co-operation on where we are at this moment, I welcome the amendments the Minister is bringing forward.</p> <p>I had a number of amendments with regard to trying to recalculate the 8% to bring it back to 4%.  What the Government is doing is much more progressive than that.  I really welcome it.  I ask that we look at a rent freeze overall - a temporary short-term rent freeze of three years - and see if we can possibly constitutionally do that when we come back and examine wider rental legislation.  The Government has shown a willingness to move on this.  It is a really good move.  I will, therefore, withdraw the amendments I have tabled and welcome this.  We will be supporting the amendments that link the legislation to the consumer price index.</p></speech>

I want to withdraw Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 9 in this grouping, which is irrelevant now given the Minister's amendments.  I also welcome amendment No. 7, which as the Minister said, links rent reviews to inflation.</p> <p>In 2016, Sinn F&eacute;in introduced the Rent Certainty Bill, which sought to link rent increases to inflation.  On five separate occasions in the previous term, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il voted against rent certainty.  This linking of rent reviews to inflation was a long battle between the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and former Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan.  The key change here, however, is the Minister's amendment on the replacement of the 4% cap with the HICP.  I understand this will cover 74% of tenancies and then the remaining 26% of tenancies will continue to be subject to rent reviews every two years, in line with prevailing market rents.</p></speech>

This limits rent deposits to one month of rent and this should be part of a wider reform of tenancy and renters' legislation.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that he is looking at this for the autumn.  I have a number of reports of landlords effectively using rental deposits with a view to keeping them or almost never giving them back.  As I said with my first amendment, I ask that the Minister consider this aspect in terms of the wider reforms he will introduce.</p></speech>

In this Bill we are restricting the value of deposits to a maximum of two months' rent.  This relates to a deposit equal to a month's rent and then a month of advance rent.  Effectively, it has been capped absolutely at two months' rent.  The deposit should be returnable and it remains the property of the tenant.</p> <p>Work is ongoing on deposit protection, which is an area that is being looked at.  There are complexities in the matter but it is not impossible.  This is a significant change.  I know where Senator Moynihan wants to get to and I appreciate what she has said.  We are pretty much on the same page on this.  There is a month of rent in advance and an amount equal to a month's rent as a deposit.  It should be no more than this and this is the maximum amount.  This was commonly spoken about during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>This will also apply to student accommodation.  There will be an opt-out if the student wishes to do that, such as for budgeting reasons.  Some international students would pay for semesters in advance and this will allow that option.  I have said in the D&aacute;il that I will keep an eye on that in particular.  The request came through from the university sector and it is reasonable for us to see how that works.  I cannot accept the Senator's amendment but I understand that she will not be pressing it.</p> <p>Amendment No. 12 is also in the group.  I cannot accept this, which proposes to delete lines 18 to 22 on page 5.  Section 5 of the Bill proposes to insert a new section 19B into the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which provides in subsection (3) that notwithstanding the fact that tenants cannot now be required to pay more than a month's rent in advance, a tenant in student-specific accommodation may do this.  I have explained why we are doing this and it is only on the basis that the tenant - the student in this case - has decided to do so.  This provision aims to help any student who may wish to manage her or his finances by making a larger advance rent payment and providing certainty that his or her accommodation needs are secured for the desired period.  It is purely up to the student.  An operator of student-specific accommodation cannot seek a deposit of more than two months' rent.  We have also changed the notice period to 28 days.  That addresses both amendments.</p></speech>

It is a significant move to restrict deposits to the equivalent of two months' rent and the introduction of a deposit protection scheme is something I would like to see, if possible in the autumn.</p> <p>On Second Stage I suggested tying the element of the opt-out specifically to the third level sector and I appreciate that this is being done in the legislation before us.  It is important to keep a close eye on that so there is no creep effect or anything untoward.  I totally respect the bona fides of the Minister and I know if he says he will keep this under review, he will do so.</p></speech>

I watched the debate in the D&aacute;il.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about the need for a public awareness campaign around these matters with the Union of Students in Ireland and Threshold once the Bill is passed.  The amendment sought to address the opt-in for tenants, including students.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science had concerns regarding students coming from abroad specifically for full terms and who buy a package of educational materials and accommodation.

The Minister also indicated that his Department would look at this issue to ensure that the optional opt-out is not exploited because, ultimately, we are all on the same page.  Students and their parents must be fully aware of this situation and they should not be pressured to pay more than what is legally required.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 13 inserts a new section 6 into the Bill to amend section 20 of the 2004 Act which provides for frequency of rent reviews.  Currently, section 20 of the 2004 Act provides that, generally, rent reviews are allowed to occur no more frequently than annually in an RPZ or biannually outside an RPZ.  However, a rent review is allowed during the 12-month review period in an RPZ, or during the 24-month review period outside an RPZ, if a substantial change in the nature of the rented accommodation occurs which warrants an immediate change to the existing rent.</p> <p>Section 6 of the Bill provides a technical reference to ensure that any rent review which occurs on foot of a substantial change in the nature of the accommodation provided can only occur where "substantial change" falls within the meaning of the existing section 19(5A) of the 2004 Act referring to a substantial change in the nature of accommodation.  This was in the original Act so it is not a new change that I am introducing.  The aim is to ensure that a rent review is only allowed when a real and truly substantial change occurs that warrants such a review.</p> <p>Section 6 of the Bill also provides for biannual rent reviews to continue to operate outside the RPZ during the period to 31 September 2024.  That has been extended from 31 December 2021 and provides for a three-year extension.  The aim here is to provide rent certainty for tenants outside RPZs for a minimum two-year period at a time of rising rents and constrained supply in the private rental accommodation sector.</p> <p>Amendment No. 15 inserts a new section 8 into the Bill to amend section 24B of the 2004 Act, which provides for areas deemed to be RPZs.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for the extension of the deemed RPZs in Cork city and the Dublin local authorities to continue to operate until 31 December 2024.  Again, that has been extended from 31 December 2021.  These local authorities were deemed to be RPZs and that immediately came into effect on the passing of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which introduced rent controls from 24 December 2016.</p> <p>Amendment No. 15 is specifically required to extend the operation of those deemed RPZs up to the end of December 2024 to protect tenants during a sustained period of constrained supply in the private rental accommodation sector, as the sector has been negatively impacted by Covid-19.  Amendment No. 18 introduces a new section 12 to amend section 8(2) of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 to provide for RPZs designated under section 24A, concerning rent pressure zones, of the 2004 Act to continue in operation until 31 December 2024.  The aim is to continue rent controls in these RPZs for a further three years until 31 December 2024 to protect tenants during a sustained period of constrained supply in the private rental sector.</p> <p>Amendment No. 23 proposes to consequentially amend the Long Title of the Bill to reflect that, in respect of amendment No. 18, section 8(2) of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 will now provide for designated RPZs to continue in operation until 31 December 2024.  Again, this is an extension from 31 December 2021.</p></speech>

I urge the Minister to acknowledge the significant numbers of tenants not on pandemic support payments who have lost some of their income and are now struggling to meet high rental costs and to not fall into arrears.  We can do that by inserting into the Bill the following text: &quot;in the view of the Residential Tenancies Board, is at risk of losing their tenancy despite endeavouring to fully comply with the terms of their tenancy agreement and where the termination of that tenancy would put that person at risk of homelessness or at greater risk of contracting Covid-19&quot;.  We all know of tenants residing outside rent pressure zones who have been hit with rent increases.  They are on modest incomes and under financial pressure.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment to protect those not covered by the Covid-19 emergency protections.</p></speech>

We discussed this issue at some length on Second Stage, when I outlined the position in this regard.  Included in this important legislation is, as the Senator rightly said, the extension of protections for those worst affected by the impact of Covid-19.  Those protections include a ban on evictions and a ban on rent increases up to January 2022, by way of seeking protection via self-declaration through the RTB to stipulate that one's income has been affected.  For example, people may have been in receipt of social welfare during this time and at risk of eviction due to rent arrears.</p> <p>The measures introduced must be proportionate as well.  We must ensure that all aspects of legislation I introduce in this regard respect the tenant and the property owner and are legally robust.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Having looked at the tabled amendment and understood the reason it was put forward, I cannot accept it.  What I will say, and what I have said in the D&aacute;il and in this House previously, is that if things take a turn for the worst, which we earnestly hope will not happen, and further measures are needed, I will come back with further protections should we need them.  The measures in this Bill, coupled with everything else, will mean that tenants who have already sought protection will continue to be protected from eviction up to next January.  It is open to others to seek those additional protections should they wish to do so.</p><p>The fact that the current measures are in place has sent a signal to the market.  We discussed this at length before.  The measures are working, thankfully.  So far, we have seen - not to be complacent about it in any way, shape or form - a continued reduction in the number of people homeless, including last month.  That is to be welcomed.  I know everyone welcomes that, but we need to watch those rates very carefully.  People who are, or are at risk of being, in rent arrears, have the emergency rent supplement payment available to them.  It is a simplified process so people should not go into rent arrears if they have lost income.  If they are on social welfare, the State is there to help with that.  We are doing this through the emergency rent supplement payment.</p><p>I encourage tenants who are in difficulty to engage with the Residential Tenancies Board, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and Threshold.  The changes we agreed to and introduced last summer around rent arrears mean that when a tenant goes into arrears for the first time, the landlord's rent arrears letter must also be sent to the RTB, and following this the tenant will receive all the information required about the agencies that can help him or her.  For the first time, we now know how many people are falling into rent arrears.  We would not have known that if it were not for the passing of the Act.</p><p>I neglected to say to Senator Warfield when he mentioned the public information and rights campaign for tenants that we have done some of them.  I have been engaging with Threshold and the RTB.  On the passing of this legislation, there will be a further information campaign for the public.  I would like to see it more widespread than it currently is.  There are people who are still not aware of their rights and we must make sure that they are aware of them.  Hopefully that explains the rationale as to why I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

There are concerns, not just from Sinn F&eacute;in but from other political parties and Threshold, that we could possibly see a steady increase in presentations of homelessness.  This amendment is designed to ensure these people are protected.</p></speech>

I thank all Senators for their input and for their efforts in the debate we have had.  It has been useful and positive, and it was an urgent debate that needed to take place.  These are real measures that are going to help tenants.  I have no doubt about that.  It brings a significant change by linking rent and future increases to inflation.  I am pleased that this has been done.</p> <p>I thank the team in my Department, who have done a superb job, the staff here in the Seanad and those in the Bills Office.  This is one of four pieces of legislation that are moving through both Houses.  The Seanad has been, as always, incredibly co-operative and constructive.  That is why I was correct in initiating the Bills in this House because we get to have a good debate and go through the amendments.  I thank all the Members for their input.  I am pleased the Bill has come this far and it will now move into the Lower House to get the legislation passed and enacted as quickly as we can, hopefully by the end of the weekend.</p></speech>

It feels more like a wedding than the passing of a Bill.  I am just getting used to it.  The move by the Government to link rents to the consumer price index is progressive, long overdue and welcome.  I also see that institutional property investors kicked up about the issue.  Taking this action in the face of lobbying from people on the outside, particularly landlords, is important.</p> <p>We have a major issue with security of tenure for renters.  I was glad last week to be able to text somebody who was worried about losing their house over the 8% rent increase to say the law was going to change, they would not be facing 8% and the increase would possibly be less than 1%, depending on what the calculator came up with.  It is a relief to a considerable number of people.  However, we need to address security of tenure for people in rental accommodation.  That is a key issue.  We are an outlier in Europe in terms of doing that and I look forward to seeing comprehensive renters' legislation in the autumn.</p></speech>

Special thanks are due to Martin Groves and his team in the Seanad Office for the enormous amount of work they do and the manner in which they keep us on track.  That is important.</p> <p>My biggest thanks are due to the people who have proposed and worked on the amendments.  There were 23 amendments to this legislation and we found consensus and agreement, respected each other and had good dialogue.  That is the hallmark of a good parliament.  I thank all involved, particularly those who prepared, researched and worked on the amendments.  We sometimes forget them.</p> <p>We do not always leave this House feeling pleased.
