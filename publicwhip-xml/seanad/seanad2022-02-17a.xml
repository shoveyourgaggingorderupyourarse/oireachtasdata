As the Minister of State knows, the cornerstone of decent society is access to justice.  Civil legal aid plays a crucial role in this access to justice.  A review of the civil legal aid system in Ireland is long overdue.  Demand for a root-and-branch review grew over the years, because it became apparent that there was an unmet legal need.</p> <p>Last summer, it was announced that a review would take place in the third quarter of 2021.  I believe it was the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, who announced the review of the legal aid system, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who was on maternity leave at the time.  The Minister of State, therefore, would be very familiar with this issue.  That review was very much welcomed, because there was a wide awareness of the unmet legal need.  Unfortunately, that review has not yet commenced, and it is now mid-February 2022.  When will that review commence?</p> <p>Last July, Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, wrote to the Minister for Justice on behalf of more than 40 NGOs.  I have that letter here with me.  I would like to add that I was a FLAC volunteer for a number of years.  It is an excellent organisation and it provides an excellent service.  It wrote this letter to welcome this announcement of the review on behalf of more than 40 NGOs, charities and other non-profits working with marginalised and vulnerable communities throughout Ireland.  These organisations include Women&rsquo;s Aid, Inclusion Ireland, Down Syndrome Ireland, Barnardos Ireland, Pavee Point, AsIAm and the Mercy Law Resource Centre.  These organisations, as I said, work with a broad range of communities throughout Ireland, such as migrants, Travellers, members of the Roma community, deaf people, lone parents, disabled people, victims and survivors of domestic violence, unemployed people, the working poor and more.  They have identified, through their long years of work with people and their advocacy on behalf of these people, an unmet legal need in the current civil legal aid system.</p> <p>In their letter, they have suggested a number of elements that are essential to the review.  I am calling on the Minister of State to confirm that these elements will be contained in the review by the Department of Justice.  First, it must be a root-and-branch review that is comprehensive in scope and that will map the unmet legal need.  It should explore the functions of the Legal Aid Board.  The eligibility criteria should be seriously looked at, including the means test and the financial contribution.  The areas of law covered by the scheme need to be updated.  The methods of service delivery, such as community law centres and specialised legal services for disadvantaged groups and individuals, should be looked at.  An important point is that it must be chaired by an independent person of status, such as a judge with an interest in access to justice and public law.  At its centre, the review must have the voices of those currently experiencing the unmet legal need and involve all key stakeholders.  It must measure the civil legal aid system against international standards and compliance with the State&rsquo;s obligation under the Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, the UN Convention of the Rights of the Persons with Disabilities and the public sector equality and human rights duty contained in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality and Commission Act 2014.</p> <p>This review needs to start immediately.  We are failing people every single day.  As a modern, progressive and wealthy society, we cannot stand over it any longer.</p></speech>

It is recognised, however, that demands on the civil legal aid scheme have grown and that to provide maximum benefit to those for whom it was established to serve, a review of the scheme is appropriate, not least in light of societal change in Ireland over recent years.  We must also acknowledge the reality that the resources available to fund the civil legal aid scheme are not infinite.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must aim to ensure that those in most need and whose means are insufficient can continue to avail of the civil legal aid scheme to the maximum extent possible, consistent with their legal needs.</p><p>The Minister is committed to undertaking a review of the civil legal aid scheme and her Department is currently working to finalise the mode and terms of reference of the review.  As part of the review process, it is intended that there will be significant consultation to ensure that the insights of a range of stakeholders regarding the operation of the scheme, and how best to support those of insufficient means with legal needs, within resources that must of necessity be constrained, will inform the work of the review group.  One of the areas which may be considered in the review is eligibility for civil legal aid.  The review may also contain a research element which could, among other things, identify international approaches to supporting people with legal assistance needs.</p><p>Since the civil legal aid scheme was established more than 40 years ago, Irish society has changed and the demands on the scheme have grown.  In order to provide maximum benefit to those it was established to serve, within the finite resources available to fund legal aid, a robust, comprehensive review of the scheme is now timely.  Dependent on finalisation of the approach and confirmation of membership, it is envisaged that the review group will commence its work in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Could the Minister of State confirm that the review group will be chaired by a judge or somebody of similar standing with an interest in public law and access to justice?</p> <p>I am a little concerned because the Minister of State referred a couple of times to "the finite resources available".  For a civil legal aid system to work, it must be properly resourced.  I accept every Department works within finite resources, but in the current climate where we are talking about women in particular having access to justice, we know that lone parents and people in situations of domestic violence are especially vulnerable on a number of fronts but, in particular, in their access to justice.  I ask that the legal aid scheme be properly resourced.</p></speech>

Significant consultation will be required to ensure that those in most need and whose needs are insufficient can continue to avail of the scheme within resources that of necessity must be constrained.  Ultimately, the review should map out a future for the civil legal aid scheme, which in the Minister's view is one that should provide for a flexible service that has, as far as possible, the capacity and resources to respond to the priority legal assistance needs of those with insufficient means.  I will pass on the Senator's comments.</p></speech>

She is very welcome.  I raise the very serious issue of the lack of progress in regard to both public and road transport infrastructure for Limerick.  It is causing major concern to people across the city and county.</p> <p>I will cite a few of the key areas on which I would like to get a response from the Minister of State.  The first is the northern distributor road.  This is a key element of infrastructure for Limerick city.  Right now we have serious traffic congestion at the Mackey roundabout.  We have serious problems across the University of Limerick campus.  At its peak level of busyness, it can take up to 45 minutes to get from the back of the campus to the front gates.  We have massive traffic issues across Corbally, all of which would be relieved by the northern distributor road.  Unfortunately, the senior Minister has set his face against this road being developed.  It is not mentioned in the national development plan.</p> <p>Then we get on to the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy plan, except we do not get on to that because even though it was supposed to be produced last year, we are still waiting for it.  In fact, we do not know what is going to be in that plan at this point in time.</p> <p>We then have the M20 motorway, something the Minister of State's party colleagues have spoken about for years.  The linkage between Cork and Limerick is something I very much support.  The vision that most of in the west have is for an Atlantic corridor linking Cork, Limerick and Galway, acting as a counterweight to Dublin and being able to use those synergies to produce a real development alternative for business, people and commuters.  Unfortunately, again we seem to be on hold.  The senior Minister has set his face against the M20 motorway.  He is on record as saying that at a committee meeting on transport just two weeks ago.  This is a road that people lose their lives on every year.  It is a horrific road.  My brother-in-law almost passed away in an horrendous accident on it just two years ago.  The project is on hold.  The argument being made by the Minister of State's senior colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is that we need to focus on public transport instead.  I do not agree with him.  I do not think it should be either-or; we need to do both.</p> <p>Let us look at public transport.  The Government has been in place for nearly two years and the Minister has spoken about developing trains across Limerick city.  I support that call.  Sinn F&eacute;in is on record as far back as 2014 calling for a light rail network across Limerick city.  Again, all we have had is talk.  We need to see simple wins across Limerick city.  For example, the Ballybrophy line, which runs into Limerick city, could be upgraded, but instead of doing it rapidly the Department is doing it literally on a piecemeal basis.  Just two miles were upgraded last week.  We still have six miles to do.  We cannot increase the speeds or look at additional services until we do that.  Currently, the journey time between Limerick and Galway is just under three hours.  We could have stations at Moyross, Corbally and Dooradoyle.  We have heard the Minister talk about it, but the problem is we are two years into the Government's term and nothing, as such, is planned.  We are talking about a rail review that will not be completed until the end of the year, at which point I predict there will be a further feasibility study and then the lifetime of the Government will effectively be at an end.</p> <p>What we have had on the one hand is that the Government has put on hold key infrastructural projects that Limerick city badly needs while, at the same time, we have had lots of talk about public transport investments but no deliverables that make a difference.  I will give a simple example.  Right now, anyone who wants to go from Castletroy to the university, a very common trip, has to take a bus into town and get a bus back out because the service works on a loop basis.  There are simple wins that could be implemented to make public transport much more effective.  If I want my kids to use the bus service in my village of Castleconnell, there is a wait of three hours for a bus to get into Limerick city on a Saturday.  These are simple wins, but we have seen no concrete measures to support people in Limerick.  There is great frustration.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I am responding to it on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has responsibility for public transport and roads.</p> <p>Transport investment in Limerick in the coming years will be guided by the forthcoming Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy.  I am sure the Senator is aware that the strategy is being developed by the National Transport Authority, NTA, in collaboration with Limerick City and County Council, Clare County Council and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII.  A draft strategy was published in September 2020 and was open for public consultation for eight weeks.  The draft strategy was based on a comprehensive analysis of population projections, development density and future travel demand patterns.  This allowed for careful consideration of transport needs across Limerick and the potential role all modes of transport might play in meeting those needs.</p> <p>The draft strategy that was published for public consultation placed a strong focus on compact growth in line with the national planning framework, NPF.  It supported the development of sustainable transport patterns to enable the planned expansion of the metropolitan area and help meet the projected travel demand set out in the NPF.  Since the conclusion of the public consultation exercise, the NTA has conducted further analytical work to inform the next iteration of the strategy.  I understand that the key issues raised in the submissions received as part of the public consultation process related to the need for a stronger vision within the strategy; the need for clearer modal shift targets and; and the need for greater consideration of Limerick regeneration areas.</p> <p>I understand that the role of rail in the region was also raised during the public consultation and that role was further examined by the NTA for inclusion in a revised draft strategy.  Planned sustainable transport investment in the Limerick metropolitan area in the coming years includes upgrades to pedestrian facilities, a radical improvement in the cycle network and delivery of a BusConnects programme.  BusConnects Limerick is an ambitious programme which will provide a step change in the quality of the bus services in the city by providing for extensive bus priority, new vehicles and increased service frequencies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will be implemented alongside a range of behavioural change measures to encourage more people to make sustainable options their preferred modes of transport.  The delivery of BusConnects Limerick alongside improved and expanded active travel options in the city can facilitate a modal shift and have a positive impact on transport emissions.</p><p>There are also a number of proposed national road projects in the Limerick area, as the Senator alluded: the N21-N69 Limerick to Foynes road, including the Adare bypass; the N21 Abbeyfeale bypass; the N21 Newcastle West bypass; the N24 Cahir to Limerick Junction road; and the N20-M20 Cork to Limerick road.  These national road projects are at varying stages in the development process and the national development plan, NDP, funding envelope up to 2030 will enable their progression through the public spending code and the statutory approvals process.</p><p>I understand that the NTA will soon undertake a second round of public consultation on a revised draft Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy.  Once the public have had their say, it is intended to finalise the strategy and publish it as the completed transport framework for the city.  When finalised, it will set out the framework for investment in transport for the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area for the next 20 years.  Importantly, the strategy will be integrated within relevant land use plans.  This integration is crucial if we are to enable the emergence of more sustainable modes of transport in a Limerick that provides citizens with better access to work, education and leisure opportunities through improved transport infrastructure.  I look forward to the delivery of the much improved transport network in the Limerick area in the years ahead.</p></speech>

I am disappointed, though.  The elephant in the room is the fact that we do not have a republished Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy.  The first draft was so poor that councillors from all parties said it was not fit for purpose.  It was due to be published last October.  We are now heading towards the end of February and it is still not published.  We do not know what is in it.</p> <p>There is a lack of commitment to targeted deliverables that will make a difference for people in Limerick.  I have cited examples of simple changes to bus services that could make a difference.  I have cited the example of the Ballybrophy line, the upgrade of which needs to be finished so as to allow for increased speeds and additional services.  These would be simple wins for the Government but they are not being delivered.  Of most concern is that there is no mention of the northern distributor road, which is further confirmation that the Government has abandoned a key project in Limerick's infrastructure.</p></speech>

This is evidence-based transport planning, is in line with international best practice and will allow our cities to grow in a sustainable and compact manner.</p> <p>The implementation of the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy will facilitate the sustainable development of the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area and the delivery of associated transport investment.  The NTA will soon undertake a second round of public consultation on a revised draft strategy.  Once the public have had their say, it is intended to finalise the strategy.  I encourage everyone to take part in that consultation process, given that this strategy will outline the vision for the Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area for the next 20 years.</p></speech>

I understand that the T&aacute;naiste is abroad.  I thank him, his staff and the Minister of State, Deputy English.  While I wish to discuss the frustration among employers and people who are coming to the country with the work permit system, it is first important to acknowledge that the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are committed to solving this problem.  They have a plan in place as well as people who are working to accelerate the process.</p> <p>There is significant frustration.  In Tipperary, I am inundated with calls from people who are trying to get work permits for construction workers, agricultural workers, engineers and hotel chefs.  The process from when they start looking for someone to the very end is frustrating.  Often, it is not a good end and they do not get anyone.</p> <p>At this time of year, it is important that the agricultural sector get staff.  For example, farms need to be able to get extra support during calving season.  If people have to wait 12 weeks, as is currently the case, or even longer to get work permits, the calving season will be over.  If someone applies in December, the season will be well and truly over by the time a worker arrives.  Even if the process goes well and a work permit is obtained, a visa must then be acquired, which takes a further eight weeks.  The whole process takes almost six months.</p> <p>There is a large backlog and considerable demand worldwide for workers.  That is understandable and we are not the only country with this problem, but there are other European countries that are fast-tracking the process and operating much faster than us.  Germany is delivering work permits and visas within six to eight weeks.  Ireland's reputation abroad is decreasing.  We get many people coming over from India on work permits.  If people from India have a choice between Germany or Ireland, they will choose to go to Germany because they know that the process there is quicker and they will be able to work, get paid and provide for their families.  Our delay has a knock-on effect in terms of the people we are trying to bring to Ireland.  People who are in the application process are pulling their names out and going to other countries, such as Germany, because it is taking so long here.  This means that the employer who has, on average, paid more than &euro;1,000 is left with the bill but no one to show for it.</p> <p>People in Tipperary are telling me of their frustrations with the system on a weekly basis.  I understand that the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy English, are committed to solving it but demand is significant and the level of frustration is high.  Even though we have increased the workforce that is assessing applications, there needs to be urgency in getting applications processed as quickly as possible, especially for the agricultural sector.  Special cases can be made where people need workers extremely quickly.  A special case needs to be made for agriculture, particularly at this time of year.</p> <p>I will be interested in the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I am taking it on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p> <p>The employment permit system is managed through the use of lists that designate highly skilled and ineligible occupations.  These lists are subject to regular review in order to ensure they remain relevant to the needs of the economy.  On 27 October, the Minister of State, Deputy English, announced the most recent changes to the system.  This was the third biannual review undertaken since the onset of Covid-19 and the impact of the pandemic on the labour market was a significant consideration in the review's outcomes.  As the economy emerged from the pandemic, an increased demand for employment permits became apparent.  The changes announced targeted the more immediate skills and labour shortages across a number of key economic sectors, which the Senator mentioned.  In order to address demand, the main changes included a substantial opening up of eligibility for the construction and agricultural sectors.  Additional permits allocated to the agricultural sector alone totalled over 3,000, with a consequential impact on processing times.</p> <p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment saw unprecedented increases in the volume of applications for employment permits over the course of 2021.  From the start of January to the end of December 2021, 27,666 applications were received, representing a 69% increase over the same period in 2020 and a 47% increase on 2019, which itself represented an 11-year high in applications.  The Department issued 16,275 employment permits last year and processed a total of 17,968 applications, which represents a significant volume of activity.  This has had a significant impact on processing times, with applications waiting up to three times as long to be processed as was previously the case.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Department recognises the impact delays in the processing times for employment permits has on businesses and their workers and it has developed an action plan to meet the challenges and reduce the backlog that was built up over recent months.  This action plan includes additional staff and systemic changes.  By late March this year, the processing team will have more than tripled in size compared to early November 2021, with additional temporary reassignment of staff and increased overtime.</p></speech>

Her final comments are significant.  A tripling of the staff numbers will obviously have an impact.  It will make a big difference in March.  That is to be welcomed.</p> <p>One of the frustrations very often expressed to us by employers is the reason they are refused.  For example, in one case the owner of a steel company in Tipperary put forward three candidates for work permits, one of whom was approved and the other two were refused.  The reason for the refusal was they had not provided police clearance from another country there were in previously.  It is impossible for them to get police clearance without being in that country and to go there they would need a visa.  In other words, they are seeking a work permit but in order to get it they need to get a visa to go to another country to get police clearance and it is not possible for them to do that.  </p> <p>I am happy that Senator Lombard is here because he speaks quite regularly on this issue.  There is another issue where employers place advertisements in the newspapers, which Senator Lombard has spoken about previously.  In this case, three advertisements were placed in a newspaper in respect of which one person got a work permit, but the other two did not.  The reason for the refusal was the advertisements were not as they should have been.  This may be related to demand and the numbers of applications being made but there is a frustration from an employer's point of view.  There are flaws in the system.</p></speech>

On the action plan, it will speed up processing times.  The Department expects to see improvements in the backlog by the end of quarter 1 and that it will be substantially reduced by the end of quarter 2 of this year.  It is monitoring new permit demand on a daily basis and will react quickly by further increasing capacity if predicted demand levels are exceeded.</p> <p>The Department updates the employment permit processing timelines on its website on a weekly basis and regularly issues updates on relevant employment permit matters to trusted partners.  It engages on an ongoing basis with enterprise agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, businesses, sectoral representative groups and individual companies to keep them updated on the employment permits system, including processing times and the Department's action plan.  </p> <p>As I said, I will relay the Senator's suggestions to the T&aacute;naiste.</p></speech>

Although her portfolio does not fall under the Minister for Education, it is great to have her here.</p> <p>I am seeking clarification with regard to an issue that has emerged in my part of the world in the past four or five days.  I would like the Minister for Education to make a statement on the plans in place to accommodate students who are due to sit the State examinations in June and are deemed to be close contacts of a person who has Covid-19.  We have put in place a platform of work for the leaving certificate such that a student who is due to sit the leaving certificate examinations may resit the examinations if affected by a family tragedy, Covid-19 or other circumstances.  However, the junior certificate student does not have the ability to do that.  Many of those due to take the junior certificate examinations this year are 16 years of age.  They are not eligible for the booster vaccine so if they are deemed to be a close contact they must restrict their movements for seven days.  Today, there are three young people in west Cork who should be sitting their mock examinations but because they have been deemed a close contact they have had to remain at home.  I was contacted by their parents at the weekend.  While they are willing to put up with this for the mock examinations, they want to know that if this happens again in June their children will have an opportunity to resit their examinations.  That is an exceptionally stressful issue not alone for the students but also for the parents and teachers.</p> <p>We need to find a solution for those under 16 years of age who under regulation are not eligible for the booster vaccine but when deemed to be a close contact must restrict their movement for seven days because on that basis they will not be allowed to sit their State examinations.  It is an appalling situation.  The Department website provides clear guidance in respect of leaving certificate students who, ironically, are eligible for the booster vaccine.  Junior certificate students who are under 16 do not have that opportunity.  This is a really significant issue that has the potential to affect thousands of students over the next few weeks.  This is happening at the moment in my constituency.  I am sure that Deputies and Senators throughout the country have similarly received telephone calls about it.  We need to find a solution that accommodates teenagers who are under 16 years of age and therefore not eligible for the booster vaccine, but if deemed a close contact must restrict their movements for seven days and on that basis will not be able to sit their State examinations.</p> <p>I realise that the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, is meeting today.  If one reads the papers, which are rarely wrong, NPHET is to recommend the lifting of the requirement to wear a face mask within the education sector but there is nothing about amending the State examinations process in regard to the junior certificate cycle.  We need to find a solution.  We need NPHET, the Department of Health and the Department of Education to come together in the next few hours to find that solution; otherwise this dilemma which thousands of students, parents and teachers are in will continue.  It is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.</p> <p>Following a Government decision on 1 February, the Minister for Education announced details regarding arrangements for the 2022 State junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations.  These details were finalised following extensive engagement with the advisory group on planning for the State examinations.  The advisory group includes representatives of students, parents, teacher unions, school management bodies, the State Examinations Commission, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education.</p> <p>In her announcement, the Minister confirmed that the junior cycle examinations will run in June 2022 as normal for the first time since 2019.  This year is also the first year that all of the new subject specifications for the junior cycle will be examined by the State Examinations Commission.  To take account of the disruption to learning experienced by junior cycle students, adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the junior cycle were announced in August 2021.  These included a reduction in the number of classroom-based assessments to be completed, the removal of the requirement to complete assessment tasks and adjustments to the requirements in coursework and practical performance tests. Junior cycle students normally complete two classroom-based assessments in each subject.  In the current school year, however, each student must complete a minimum of only one such assessment in each subject, with discretion in the case of most subjects as to which of the two assessment will be completed.  These adjustments will provide for more teaching time in schools.</p> <p>The junior cycle summer written examinations will begin on 8 June and finish on 20 June.  All aspects of staging these examinations will be guided by the prevailing public health advice.  The Department of Education and the State Examinations Commission have met with public health to discuss matters around the State examinations and this engagement is continuing in the lead-up to the examinations.  The Minister would like to express her thanks to our public health colleagues for their ongoing assistance to the Department of Education throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>A junior cycle student who is unable to sit his or her examinations for Covid-related reasons, which is the issued alluded to by the Senator, will still receive a junior cycle profile of achievement, which certifies the completion of a course of junior cycle studies for students.  It is provided to them by their schools and draws upon and reports on achievement across all elements of assessment and not only performance in the State written examinations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This includes, as appropriate, ongoing formative assessment in the classroom; classroom-based assessments across subjects and short courses; level 1 and level 2 learning programmes; the area of well-being; and other areas of learning, such as performance in the school choir or debating society.  There have been occasions when students could not sit the junior cycle written examinations due to illness.  In these cases, students have still proceeded to the senior cycle.  Schools and teachers facilitate the transition of students from junior to senior cycle by reflecting on the learning, interests and achievements of students in the junior cycle.</p></speech>

I do not understand why, when it comes to the leaving certificate cycle, we have a completely different approach.  The leaving certificate gives an opportunity for the resitting of the examination process in certain circumstances.  It gives people the opportunity to sit the examination and go through a process.  I know students who cannot do the mock examinations because they are self-isolating.  A leaving certificate student would have the opportunity to retake those examinations.  I do not understand why there is a different approach in the case of the junior cycle.  That information is not out there.  There is no clarity among the general public, teachers, parents and students about how the junior certificate cycle will work for a 16-year-old who has not had a booster jab and must restrict his or her movements.  Such people fear they will sit at home for seven days and move into fourth year without having to do that State examination.  Surely after three years they would have the opportunity to do that State examination.  Surely after three years the Department of Education can accommodate them in the same way it can accommodate leaving certificate students.</p> <p>I realise the pandemic changed things beyond all control but I do not think we have thought through how we are going to deal with the junior certificate State examination for a student who is under 16 and cannot get a booster jab.  More thought must be put into the issue because I do not think enough thought has been put into it.</p></speech>

They have travelled a difficult journey in recent years.  The Senator alluded to this but I know representatives of the Department of Education and the State Examinations Commission have met with members of the public health team to discuss matters around the State examinations.  That engagement is continuing.  NPHET is meeting today and should any changes be made to public health guidance, they will be included in the decision around State examinations.</p> <p>The note I have here makes reference to why junior cycle students who cannot sit the main junior cycle examinations cannot avail of the same alternative set of examinations in the same way as leaving certificate students.  The opportunity for certain categories of leaving certificate students to sit an alternative set of examinations recognises the high-stakes nature of those examinations as, effectively, the gateway for many to further or higher education, training, apprenticeships or the world of work.  That is why resources have been prioritised towards making available an alternative sitting of examinations for leaving certificate students.  The junior cycle examinations are not in the same category.  I will relay the Senator's concerns to the Minister for Education.</p></speech>

This is my first opportunity to address the issue.  This funding will make a significant difference within my county.</p> <p>The main topic I would like to discuss is the welcome decision of the Supreme Court yesterday to uphold the decision of the High Court to grant permission to Glanbia for a &euro;140 million cheese processing plant in Waterford Port at Belview.  This is a very welcome decision as 85 jobs will be created on completion. The project will also provide approximately 400 construction jobs over the next few years but most critically, the plant will support the incomes of 4,500 farm families in the south east and further afield.  This represents significant support for rural Ireland.  The project, as the Acting Leader knows, is a key diversification tool in the context of Brexit.  The aim is to move to the production of more continental-type cheeses rather than relying so heavily on the British cheddar market.  </p> <p>It is regrettable that this project was delayed by two years as a result of appeals by An Taisce of the decision of Kilkenny County Council to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and subsequent appeals to the High Court, applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, and ultimately the final decision of the latter court yesterday.  An Taisce issued a statement yesterday saying that it noted and respected the decision of the Supreme Court.  It is unfortunate that it did not respect the decisions of various other entities, all the way up through the planning process, including An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the High Court.  The two-year delay has led to significant cost inflation for the project but the decision of the Supreme Court is a really positive one.  I hope now that Glanbia and Royal A-ware can progress this plant as soon as possible to support the 4,500 farm families across the region.</p></speech>

There are a number of aspects of that plan that need to be teased out.  It is all very well to announce that &euro;X billion is available for this plan and that X number of houses are due to be retrofitted, but I am concerned to ensure that the resources involved in this particular area of construction are not diverted away from home building.  I would like to see a clear evaluation done on how this new programme, if it is unleashed, is going to affect building costs, labour shortages and skills shortages right across the construction industry.  Perhaps we should not be subsidising the retrofitting area massively at a time when we are trying to attract building firms and building contractors to deal with the housing crisis.  There is a very substantial question as to whether we should attempt to do both at the one time, especially since subsidies combined with shortages will inevitably lead to price rises.</p> <p>I would also like the Acting Leader to make time available for a discussion as to precisely how the programme of retrofitting is to be carried out.  A sum of &euro;50,000 is a lot to spend on one single home and an awful lot of work is involved in the spending of such a sum, or at least one would hope so.  If that is the case, the question as to who is likely to take up the Government's offer and whether they will get an economic return on their expenditure of &euro;25,000, which would justify most people making an investment of that sort, has to be thought through carefully.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What I am really saying is that it is all very well to go public and say that this is a dazzling new programme, but there are consequences.  There are consequences for the construction industry.   There are consequences for shortages of labour and for skilled craftsmen and the like.  There are consequence for prices of materials.  There are consequences for home-building prices.  There is potentially a significant diversion of resources from home-building construction, which, as I understand it, is the Government&rsquo;s key priority politically, economically and socially at this stage.  We should reflect on how it measures in with the whole question of retrofitting homes.  We should have a debate in this House on that subject.</p></speech>

I agree with him, as did former Senator and President of Ireland, Mary Robinson, at the launch of the 100th anniversary celebration of the Seanad.  We should have much more discussion.  If the initiatives are good, which I believe they are, they should be able to withstand scrutiny.  We should not be afraid of scrutiny because it will instil more confidence in them.  Maybe we can improve them here by playing an advisory role to the Government, as well as scrutinising and reviewing legislation.  Perhaps we should have one day every week to discuss this whole new era.  It is akin to the Industrial Revolution.  It is now a green revolution.  It has to be done in a fair and proportionate way which makes sense, is accessible to everyone and is most effective.</p> <p>In recent weeks, there has been much commentary denouncing people who use the courts for issues of planning.  This is not for personal financial gain through seeking damages.  One aspect of that debate that has not been given the attention it deserves is the fact that the vast majority of such planning applications take the form of a judicial review in the High Court.  The first step in a judicial review is to seek leave.  It is a member of the Judiciary who decides whether to grant leave.  If the application is vexatious, lacks any merit or is frivolous, the High Court judge will in the first instance eliminate any frivolity or any vexatious, groundless application.  I hope people understand that there is already a safeguard there.  While it is not the highest threshold, there is a system in place in the High Court.  The other party might not even be present.  The High Court judge might decide to bring in the other party even at a leave stage in order to hear both sides.  Absent from the debate to date has been any reference to the fact that a safeguard is already there to serve justice and, at the same time, to ensure people have access to justice.  I would not like to deny that to any citizen of Ireland.</p></speech>

What I will share with you this morning is truly shocking.  The Acting Leader may be aware that the Minister for Health is on a visit to University Hospital Limerick today.  I had people reach out to me from the hospital yesterday to tell me what was happening ahead of his visit.  Trolleys have been moved out to other wards in the hospital, as well as to step-down hospitals.  One person told me that there were more private ambulances there yesterday than they had seen in a long time.  They were to get patients out, ahead of the visit.  Unfortunately for hospital management, and in fairness to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, he called in unexpectedly yesterday evening.  The response to that was to hide patients in the outpatients department.  I got this information from a source who I trust 100%.</p> <p>I would like to ask a question as someone who has been raising this issue for six years.  When will the Government address the crisis in University Hospital Limerick?  Its figures are shocking beyond any other hospital in the State.  For years I have been pointing out the fundamental failures of management, not to mention a culture of bullying.  To show the Acting Leader how much worse things have gotten, to date in February, 964 people have been on trolleys.  That compares to last year&rsquo;s figure of 494.  This is twice as bad.  Each of those persons has a story, each of those persons has gone through an ordeal and each of those persons have been failed by this Government, which has failed to tackle the crisis in University Hospital Limerick.  The people of Limerick are absolutely sick of it.</p> <p>I have to ask another question.  What kind of culture tells management to hide patients when a Minister is visiting?  Are we really going to accept that?  Is anyone in this Chamber going to accept that?  This has gone on for far too long already.  There are massive issues with University Hospital Limerick, such as issues of investment.  The management conceded to me that even when the new ward comes online in two years, they will still be 200 beds short.  There are fundamental planning failures that have to be addressed, but I have to say I have never seen such a cynical attempt to cover up the crisis.  Surely to God the first thing that management should do is acknowledge there is a crisis and try to work with the Minister to solve matters.  Unfortunately, what we have seen over the last 24 hours is the exact opposite.  I am calling for an urgent debate and for urgent action.  I am calling for people on the Government benches to finally acknowledge that fundamental change alone will address the issues at University Hospital Limerick.  There must be no more hiding of patients, no more covering up of problems, no more fleets of private ambulances outside our hospital to try to hide what is happening.  We need action and we need delivery from this Government.  After 11 years of Fine Gael in government, it is not too much to ask.</p></speech>

I ask the Acting Leader to schedule a debate again with an emphasis on rural transport and commuting costs.  There can be no doubt that the 20% reduction in transport fares, as recently announced, is welcome, but I have received a number of worrying emails and messages informing me that prices have gone up recently.  This means that the 20% reduction will only cover the cost of the rise in student travel charges.  The increase means that a young student from Newbridge is paying 74% of their SUSI grant on transport.  As the Acting Leader can imagine, this is unsustainable.  This young student is receiving a monthly SUSI grant of &euro;336.  They are now paying over &euro;250 on rail and bus transport to further their education.  The rail fare from Newbridge has increased from &euro;180 per month to &euro;218 per month.  The 20% reduction that has been promised will result in this student paying what they had always paid.  </p> <p>I was also contacted by a student from my home town of Athy who is paying &euro;15 per day on the train each day, as well as &euro;25 on a Leap card each week to get from the train station in Dublin to their college.  This adds up to &euro;100 per week.  In this case, the student could not get accommodation in Dublin, due to the lack of supply and the cost.  However, they are paying &euro;400 per month in transport costs to get to college.  Their sibling is using a bus service from the town to Maynooth University and is paying &euro;80 per week in bus fares to attend.  Both of them have informed me that these costs remain even when existing student discounts for train fares and Leap cards are taken into account.  I have previously raised in this House the case of a Monasterevin student who is also paying &euro;100 per week to attend college.  I know of similar cases right throughout south Kildare.</p> <p>We heard during the week that the much needed and welcome youth travel card will not be available until later this year.  However, even more worrying is the NTA response to my colleague Deputy Nash that commercial buses will not form part of this scheme.  The reply states that under the circumstances it is not possible to provide a timeline for that element at present.  The Acting Leader will know that in many rural areas there is no travel option other than a commercial bus.  We need to hear from the Minister for Transport on this topic in this House. </p> <p>I recently sent a submission to the greater Dublin transport strategy calling for a review of prices from commuting counties.  I have outlined before the unacceptable difference between train fares in south Kildare, compared with north Kildare.  The examples of these students paying such a high price for travel is a further cause of alarm for us all in tackling our climate crisis.  These young people are our future commuters.  We should be encouraging them to avail of public transport rather than giving them a fare reduction in one hand and taking it away with the other.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Acting Leader to schedule that debate.</p></speech>

In recent years there have been many reports of teenage violence in the media and they include teenagers being violent to other teenagers in every place from Dalkey to Malahide, Rochestown and Carrigaline.  Most recently, this week my home community of Cabra featured in the media.  This violence is characterised by gangs of young people making random attacks on other young people.  These are violent assaults and in Cabra there were a number of assaults before Christmas and again in the new year.  In one incident a young man ended up in a coma and in another incident a screwdriver was used to inflict injury on another young teenager.  Crowbars, hammers and bicycle parts are also being used as weapons.  As if the physical injuries and violence were not enough, these violent acts are being recorded on phones and being uploaded, posted and shared on social media.</p> <p>I am a founding director of the Cabra Community Policing Forum and I am a director of Cabra for Youth CLG and the Loft, Local Outreach Family Therapies.  I have been working with other stakeholders locally, as I am sure others are working in other communities around the country, to support our young people and address these issues.  We work with the policing forum; Dublin City Council; the Garda; the schools; the school completion programmes; the youth services; the justice youth diversion programmes; families; parents; and young people.  It is important that we support our young people and it is completely unacceptable that any young person in our communities feels unsafe or has to think twice about going down to the shops, going for a walk or meeting their friends.  As a community and a society we have to support our young people and address this issue.  As adults and as a broader community we can do that but we also need the social media giants on board,  In this instance I call on TikTok to support our society, communities and young people.  I would appreciate it if the Leader would address that issue through her good offices.</p></speech>

We had a super presentation on this by the Irish Cancer Society and there is an anomaly in the legislation that those who receive or have to undergo cancer treatment during their maternity leave cannot defer their leave and go on sick pay at that time.  Rather, they have to use their maternity leave for their treatment.  This affects approximately 60 women in Ireland annually.  This is something we should address and, therefore, I ask the Acting Leader to bring this back to the Minister.  A small amendment should be made to the legislation in order that this cohort of women can defer their maternity leave while they are undergoing treatment.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Chambers, for all the sports capital grants that were allocated last week.  I also want to extend a special word of thanks to the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, who yesterday opened a special school for children with autism in Crumlin, Our Lady of Hope School.  It was a long-fought campaign by the Dublin 12 campaign 4 Autism Inclusion and it was great to see the school finally open yesterday with the huge support of the Minister and I thank her for that.</p> <p>On the sports capital programme, many clubs in the inner city in my area and in Senator Fitzpatrick's area do not own their playing fields and pitches and cannot avail of the funding.  They are competing in the same leagues as other clubs and they are seeing other clubs announce on Facebook and Twitter that they are getting &euro;150,000 in funding, yet they barely get &euro;500 to rent pitches.  That is unfair and something should be done for clubs in the inner city or in areas where they do not own their land.  We know sports capital is just that by its nature but something has to be done to help these clubs to access pitches and resources for the youth.  It is unfair because the kids then go to other clubs that have resources.</p></speech>

I have no reason to disbelieve the comments he made.  From all the reports I have ever heard from management in that hospital, it is believable that this happened.  In fairness to the Minister for Health, the Senator would not have found out that information-----</p></speech>

We had a meeting with him yesterday in which he said he was arriving this morning to meet them so he obviously kept what he was doing quiet and that has triggered them trying to hide patients, which is an utter disgrace.</p> <p>I want to ask the Acting Leader two questions.  It was reported last night by Daniel McConnell that at the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party meeting, the Minister for Health spoke about a drug for women who suffer from hyperemesis called Cariban.  I have spoken about it a number of times, including this week and last year.  Could the Minister make a statement on that?  If it is true then women who suffer from severe illness and sickness during their pregnancies would be supported financially.  It costs them approximately &euro;3,000 during their pregnancies and they have never been supported financially by the State for it.  From the comments I read from Daniel McConnell it seems that will change.</p> <p>The announcements on the sports capital grants have been hugely welcomed in Tipperary but from the day the applications were made to when the announcement has been made, the costs incurred by clubs to build AstroTurf pitches, floodlights and everything else have dramatically increased.  Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to come into the Chamber and outline whether funding will be set aside for the increased costs that sports clubs will incur since they initially applied for these sports capital grants back in 2019?</p></speech>

I want to pay some respect to my colleagues: Senator Kyne, who is here; Senator Crowe; and Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Grealish.  Their attendance at that parade was greatly appreciated by all.  Soldiers in Galway know they have support in this House and in the Lower House and that is important.</p> <p>Some time ago I spoke about how politics in this country, and particularly the massive portfolios our Ministers have, is failing the system.  What we heard about University Hospital Limerick today is indicative of the failure I am talking about.  No Minister over the past 11 years can be held responsible for bad management at local level.  Ministers cannot micromanage systems.  I am delighted that the Minister for Health decided yesterday that he would pull a snap inspection and that shows great leadership on his behalf.  I am quick enough to criticise people when the opportunity arises but we have to move away from constantly looking at the Government or the Minister because some local organisation is not living up to the job and task it is supposed to be carrying out.  Senator Gavan is correct that he has been raising this matter for years, as have other Limerick-based Senators on the Government side.  The bottom line is that if there is a problem there it should not fall to a Minister for Health to have to drive to Limerick to see what is going on.  There should be a proper management accounting system and the lacuna that exists between ministerial responsibility and local management needs to be addressed.  We cannot continually blame politicians for the failures of people who are paid massive salaries to do a managerial task.  That is something we should have a debate on in this House in the public interest.</p></speech>

One club and its chairman have been so motivated by the abuse of drugs they have witnessed within our society and in particular, within our GAA clubs, that they have been moved to table a motion at congress.  That man is Tim Barry from Rathdowney-Errill GAA in County Laois and he has called for a ban on players who do not complete courses on substance abuse and gambling because of the cocaine abuse he has seen in his club.  He has been backed this week to get the debate going by Ciar&aacute;n Carey, the former Limerick great, who is an addiction counsellor.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It might not win next week at congress, but it is the largest sporting organisation in this country standing up and admitting that there is a problem within society and at least trying to tackle it in a very meaningful way because what he is calling for is a ban to be imposed on players if testing and addiction courses are not completed.  It would start at a ban for one match, and it would gradually increase.  It would take players out of the system, as they would not be able to play, so there would be a real tangible negative for those who do not complete the courses.</p><p>Here we have local leaders in society trying to tackle what needs to be done in our country.  They can probably do more than any of the strategies devised in these Houses because it will have a tangible impact on the lives of young players if they do not face up to what is being sought in this particular debate.</p><p>I also pay tribute to Ois&iacute;n McConville, who again this week was in the media talking about his addiction problems in terms of gambling, and the fact that he went as low as to take money from his mother's purse to fund his addiction.  Again, he is going around the country speaking to young people in clubs.  He came to our own club Navan O'Mahonys to speak to young people about that addiction as well.</p><p>I urge those delegates going to the GAA congress to give serious consideration to what is being asked of them, and to at least have the debate.  We often talk about sport, and I always talk about sport in these Chambers.  There has been a great week for sport in terms of the money that is being given to improve capital investment, but it will mean little if those going out on the field of play are suffering in silence with the addictions they have.  It is a debate worth having in these Houses in conjunction with the GAA.</p></speech>

It will be launched in April by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  As part of the strategy, a survey has been launched which will be open for three weeks.  It is a very straightforward survey to get the feedback of people and their suggestions on what they believe should be in the strategy.  The strategy will have four pillars: protection; prevention; prosecution; and policy co-ordination.</p> <p>We need to eliminate the scourge of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in this country.  We must adopt a zero-tolerance approach to any sexual violence.  The survey is straightforward.  Staff in my office filled it out this morning.  I encourage all Members of the House, both female and male, to promote this, and to encourage citizens in this country to make their views known.  It is a straightforward, easy survey.  It can be found on the Department's website, and it will feed in to what is going to be the most important strategy in this area of sexual violence that we have had in the history of this country.</p> <p>It is critically important that the survey has the type of response that it needs in order to get as many views as possible from as large a section of the population as possible.  I encourage everyone to please take some time to fill out the survey and make their views known because they will influence the final strategy which will be published in April.</p></speech>

It is three years since the Seanad reform implementation group gave its report to the Department of the Taoiseach.  The committee was set up by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar.  Many Senators here served on it and Deputies as well.</p> <p>Some of the points proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in that were in the final report related to the following: a greater gender balance across the Chamber, something that is being discussed by the gender-equality committee; universal franchise for citizens in the North, overseas and all college graduates; and that the Taoiseach would have regard to marginalised groups when choosing nominees to the Seanad.  I wonder why I am hearing nothing at all from Government parties.  Why do Senators not care about Seanad reform?  I have raised it multiple times.  I am aware that Senator McDowell has also raised it.  However, we just do not talk about Seanad reform.  I cannot let this week when we mark Seanad 100 go by without raising Seanad reform.  We talk about everything, including Michelin stars.</p> <p>Government Senators are in luck.  The work has been done.  It is on the Order Paper.  Sinn F&eacute;in would co-sign the Bill if we were given the option.  We support the Bill, and we want to see progress on the realisation of the Manning report.  I sometimes wonder how people out there do not know about the Seanad or sometimes do not have confidence in it.  We need to hear Government Senators talk about Seanad reform.  It is beyond time that people had a say in who they elect here.  We need to get on with these electoral reforms so that we can get on with our dream about the constitutional change that is needed to make this place more effective.</p></speech>

An Chistin, which is a food hub in the town of Castlerea, was granted almost &euro;700,000 extra by the Government, through the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, to start food business incubation units.  This is driven by the community and the people on the ground.  It is a bottom-up approach, which is very welcome.</p> <p>That comes on top of an extraordinary allocation of almost &euro;2.2 million in sports capital grants for 51 sporting interests in the county.  I am sure the Acting Leader will agree that there is good delivery to rural Ireland at the moment.  That is the type of delivery we want.  If the money is delivered for the projects there, the people in rural Ireland are well organised to do it. </p> <p>I am not looking to have a row with anybody, but I urge the National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, to invite the women from Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party &ndash; the Government parties - to its upcoming rally in a few weeks.  What is going on is wrong.  Many of those women have made significant contributions.  For the sake of doing the right thing and getting the right message across, I urge the NWCI to please invite those women to the rally.  Let us not have any debate about it.</p> <p>It may have been covered yesterday, but I ask the Acting Leader to send a letter of sympathy to the former Cathaoirleach of this House, Brian Mullooly, whose wife was laid to rest yesterday.

I am aware of the increasing levels of garda&iacute; and the money that is being put into the justice area and observance, but at the same time there does appear to be some sort of epidemic of a pursuit of cash, whether that is from pensioners in rural communities or a woman as recently as yesterday being mugged and very seriously injured in a car park in Knocklyon.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am looking for us to have a debate to hear from the Minister on how that strategy will work its way out.  We are putting an awful lot of money into policing.  We have the new organisation of the districts and the recent legislation that has come through, but we still have pockets, certainly within Dublin South-Central, that are no-go areas at a particular time of day.  I would, therefore, like us to have a debate in which we might explore that and hear from the Minister on local policing and security on our streets.</p></speech>

He met with the Saudi food authorities in Riyadh on Wednesday, which I believe was a very successful endeavour.  He got agreement in principle regarding the lifting of current restrictions whereby Irish beef exports to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia must come from cattle that have been slaughtered aged under 30 months.  That has now been lifted.  That has been welcomed this morning by meat traders and the cattle industry.  That is very important.</p> <p>The Minister has also initiated and set up a series of talks, which he plans to conduct in the next few weeks, with regard to sheepmeat access and poultry meat for the future.  That is really productive.  It is, of course, the first time in recent times with Covid-19 that we had a Minister go out with a trade delegation and agricultural attach&eacute;s from his Department to negotiate and seek new markets for Irish agriculture.  One of the biggest things I learned from a briefing I received is that we export more than &euro;100 million in food to Saudi Arabia, which is enormous, and the biggest demand, of course, is for dairy products.  That is very important.  At a time when we are having a major debate about culling the national herd, we have international markets looking for dairy products and milk formulas for a range of things, not necessarily all for human consumption.  That is very important.  Well done to the Minister.  As we all know, Irish beef is high-quality, sustainable and safe.  That is why the Saudi market wants it and that is why the Minister went out to develop these links.  Fair play to him.  I congratulate him and his team in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this very important initiative.</p></speech>

As Senator McDowell said, there is a lack of specialist trades and construction workers in the country.  When we couple those aspects together, we could have a very good debate, whether we deal with one issue one day and a different one another day.</p> <p>It has been brought to my attention that getting a licence to construct more than four stories for modular housing is a nightmare in this country.  In fact, I do not think a person can get a licence at all to construct more than four stories for modular housing.  Houses, hotels, apartments and all sorts of buildings are being constructed by modular methods throughout the world these days.  They go up so fast; it is unbelievable.  In this country, however, a person cannot get a licence to go above four stories.  You would wonder what the blockage is or why there is a blockage.</p> <p>I ask that, in the debate that has been requested by Senator McDowell, we would include and perhaps bring some people into the House, if necessary.  This was alluded to by former President Mary Robinson at Seanad 100.  We could have a rolling debate and do some great work in that regard.  By hearing the views from a cross-section of the areas involved in this type of construction and building, we would have a very good debate in the House on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-17a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021700002#O00400"><p>In the first instance, I want to be associated with remarks by other Senators in relation to the rumours about Cariban, the drug that treats hyperemesis.  I hope they are more than rumours.  It is about time we dealt with this issue.  I raised it in the House before and welcome any move the Department might make on this to make life easier for women who suffer from a debilitating condition that often requires hospitalisation.</p> <p>We also read reports today that certain types of payments are soaring, particularly contactless and online payments in banking.  Contactless payments have increased by almost 50% and online payments by more than 10%.  It is part of a trend we have seen over a number of years that has taken people out of their bank branches.  That must make life easier for banks.  We are lucky we have a system that is quite developed in terms of its technological aspects.  I myself do almost all my banking online.  Despite the fact that people have been moved online and use systems that reduce the burden on banks, we still have banks in this country that treat their customers with absolute contempt.  It is no longer encouraged to go into a branch.  Even when a person goes into a branch, the first thing he or she does is meet somebody who is trying to divert him or her away from actually speaking to a human being.  A person cannot even ring his or her branch.  Yesterday, I tried to ring my branch in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  I spent 29 minutes on hold to speak to somebody in a call centre who finally agreed to connect me to somebody in the bank.</p> <p>I know we have lost banks in the last couple of years and that they have exited the market.  We still have a retail banking system that occupies an especially privileged position within our economy, however.  It is not good enough for banks to have no respect and no regard for their customers.  It is not the case in other European countries.  I have lived abroad and seen the way banks behave there.  Here, we have a situation where banks seem to view customers as an obstacle rather than the asset to the bank.  I would like to have a debate in this House with the Minister for Finance or the appropriate Minister about what we can do about that.  We must send out a very clear message to banks that this cannot continue.</p></speech>

I wish her well during her time in Ireland.</p> <p>I ask the Deputy Leader to facilitate a rolling debate on the importance of our aviation and hospitality and tourism sectors.</p> <p>I do so today conscious that Ryanair has announced seven new routes out of Cork Airport and the location of its third aircraft in Cork.  It is a welcome development.  It is a vote of confidence in our aviation sector and in Cork Airport, but in particular, it is a signal to Government that it must continue to keep the supports in place for our aviation and hospitality and tourism sectors as they return to growth.</p> <p>This is about job creation and retention, but it is also about Government continuing to support inbound tourism and connectivity.  As we all now know and have seen, there is a pent-up demand for travel.  It is also crucial we support balanced regional development in the case of our airports.  That is why, in the context of the south of our country, Cork Airport is critical to the economic development of the region in a post-Covid-19 world.  That is why the debate is of absolute importance.  It is not about seven new routes.  It is not just about a third aircraft.  It is about jobs, connectivity and inbound tourism.  That is why today it is important we congratulate Cork Airport but also that we, as a House, have a rolling debate on the matters I raised.</p></speech>

Tomorrow, 18 February, is Care Day, which is a global celebration of the successes and achievements of children and young people in care.  It is important we celebrate the young people who overcome adversities - sometimes mental, physical and sexual abuse - let them know we are proud of them and their achievements to date, and hope a future of opportunity, equality and equity is there for them.  The resilience of these children and youths must be commended.  As leaders and entrepreneurs, however, we must open opportunities for these young people to fulfil their dreams.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of my foster children, Shauna, is now doing her masters.  She will need a law firm to believe in her as I do.  Today, my call is for employers to support these young people in their journeys through life.  Their starts might not have been as great as those of other youths, but they have persevered through adversity and they just need opportunities to be opened for them.  It takes a village to raise a child, and that does not stop at 18 years of age.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-17a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021700002#P00200"><p>I thank the Senators for their contributions.  Senator Cummins welcomed the investment in the roads programme.  He commented on yesterday's news about the Supreme Court upholding the granting of permission to Glanbia for a new multimillion euro cheese plant, which will support 4,500 dairy families in Waterford and the wider south east.  He also spoke about the move towards continental markets for cheese.</p> <p>That Senator Martin raised the issue of judicial reviews shows how there are divergent views on the matter just as there are in court cases.  I have gone on record as expressing concern regarding the large number of judicial reviews being granted.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Burke, is considering reviewing the matter.  The Attorney General, on the instruction of the Taoiseach, is also considering a review of planning.  We will have this debate at other times in the House.</p> <p>Senators McDowell and Burke spoke about the home retrofitting plans and clear evaluations.  I agree that a large amount of work needs to be done, not only on retrofitting but also on the house building programme.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, was in Galway last Friday.  We visited GMIT, soon to be part of the Atlantic technological university, where we met students who were studying retrofitting and the wider area.  Under budget 2022, the Minister's Department has provided &euro;22 million for the green skills action programme, &euro;17 million of which relates to retrofit and near-zero energy building skills.  The Department has been engaging with industry in this regard.  It is a matter that is worthy of debate and a request has been made.  Perhaps we could examine it in terms of the wider issues relating to construction.  I will follow up on the request.  I understand we are awaiting a date with the Ministers involved.</p> <p>Senator Burke also raised the issue of modular construction.  I do not have details on that but it might be worth tabling a Commencement matter, speaking to the Minister or raising it during our debate on housing.</p> <p>Senators Gavan and Ahearn spoke about University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  I concur that no one should be hiding patients.  If a hospital is trying to get additional investment, it should be open and transparent about what it is dealing with.  For years, I have heard about people being moved around when a Minister visits, the place being polished, flowers being placed in reception and so on.  That is all rubbish.  A Minister should be able to see what is there to be seen and no one should be hiding anyone.  The Taoiseach has requested that the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, visit.  Senator Gavan mentioned that the Minister had made an unannounced inspection yesterday.  That is to be welcomed.  There has been investment in University Hospital Limerick.  I understand work on a new 96-bed inpatient unit is to start this year.  Yesterday, this matter was raised at the Joint Committee on Health by Senator Conway and Deputy Crowe with Mr. Paul Reid and Mr. Robert Watt.  I was in and out of that meeting, but Senators will be able to find the details.</p> <p>Senator Wall called for a debate on rural transport and student fares.  I will make that request.  He also spoke about the cost of living for students.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is considering the question of student registration fees.  Without making a commitment, it will be part of his budget demands in the meantime.</p> <p>Senators Fitzpatrick and Seery Kearney called for a debate on crime, including teenage violence, and the regulation of social media.  The media Bill will be before us next week.  Putting assaults on TikTok and other social media platforms needs to be clamped down on and regulated.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh raised an issue concerning the Irish Cancer Society.  It would make perfect sense for the anomaly to be rectified.  I am sure she will take it up with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, or raise it as a Commencement debate.  The Senator spoke about sports capital funding and the Our Lady of Hope Special School, which the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan, have had a significant hand in delivering.  The Senator also discussed inner-city clubs.  Building sporting infrastructure is vital for all parts of society, but access to that infrastructure is equally important.  Yesterday, my parliamentary party debated how the issue of all of these wonderful new school buildings and general purpose, GP, halls not being accessible to communities in the evenings needed to be examined.  There was a large level of State investment but doors are often being shut to the communities thereafter.  Those were valid points.</p> <p>Senators Ahearn and Ward discussed the drug Cariban.  I have read reports on it.  I hope the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, follows up on his plans for the drug.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn also raised the important issue of sports capital grants.  I welcome all of the funding Senators have mentioned.  Inflation in the cost of living is an issue across all aspects of society, including construction, which will have a knock-on effect on sports capital grants.  A tender might have been sought for a project a number of years ago and now the cost of delivering it has increased by 10%, 20% or 30%.  I will raise this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell mentioned a wonderful event at D&uacute;n U&iacute; Mhaoil&iacute;osa in Renmore last Sunday commemorating the centenary of the barracks' handover to the Irish Army.  He also spoke about UHL and the fact Ministers should not have to micromanage because that was a requirement of management.  That is true.  The heads of the HSE and the Department of Health were before the committee yesterday to be accountable for issues like this.  The management of the mid-west group should also be held accountable for things that are not happening.  If there are failings in government, investment or so on, they must be called out, but if there is a failure in management, it also must be called out.</p> <p>Senator Cassells, who is a great sportsman and GAA supporter, spoke about the wonderful initiative being taken by Mr. Tim Barry from Rathdowney in tabling a motion at GAA congress on requiring members to attend drug, alcohol and gambling courses.  It is a novel approach to something that is prevalent across our society.  There is no point in people putting their heads in the sand and believing this only happens in urban and larger rural centres.  It is an issue I hope gets a good airing at the GAA.  Ultimately, deciding on the motion is a matter for the GAA's members and delegates.  If it is not agreed, though, then it will continue to be raised.</p> <p>Senator Conway spoke about the report on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, and the third national strategy's launch by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, yesterday.  The strategy takes a zero-tolerance approach and cites four key pillars of protection, prevention, prosecution and policy co-ordination.  People are invited to make submissions on the strategy.  DSGBV is an issue of importance to all Senators.</p> <p>Senator Warfield raised the subject of Seanad reform.  The Cathaoirleach has given a better response than I could as to what we have and have not done.  A Trinity by-election is under way, which highlights one way of being elected to the House.  While some would say that panel is the most democratic part of the House, it is not as democratic as it could be.  There are still many issues floating around.  I am unsure as to where stands the electoral Bill Senators McDowell and Malcolm Byrne mentioned.  We can follow up on it.</p> <p>Senator Murphy referred to the welcome additional funding of &euro;700,000 for An Chistin in Castlerea provided by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, from the community and rural development fund and the &euro;2.2 million sports capital funding announced for Roscommon.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is very welcome.  He also raised the issue of the National Women's Council having only invited members of the Opposition to speak at its rally, which is unusual.  A lot of important work on women's rights is done across parties and in a non-partisan way across these Houses.  The issues of repeal were championed across different parties and none.  It is regrettable that there would be this partisan approach taken to not invite Government representatives to speak.</p></speech>

Trade missions are very important.  As in the case of the St. Patrick's Day visits and itineraries, Ministers and delegates work very hard on behalf of this country in such trade missions.  They have a real impact.  Engagements with Ministers and their attendance at events is hugely important.  These missions are a huge boost to the dairy and food industries in this country.  It is important they take place and that we recognise the important role they play.</p> <p>Senator Ward asked for a debate on banking.  I understand from reports that the value of contactless payments rocketed by 48.3% in 2021, the use of cheques has hit a new low and cash withdrawals from ATMs has fallen to &euro;12.7 billion, down from a peak of &euro;19.9 billion in 2018.  This is evident everywhere in terms of the number of people who are card tapping.  While it is welcome, I know of a person from Limerick who sought to pay a toll by way of card only to discover that payment was by coins only and he had none.  There were a number of cars behind him and a row ensued.  That system might need to be updated in recognition of the move towards a cashless society.  </p> <p>Senator Buttimer spoke about the issues of aviation and hospitality.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has been in this House discussing various aspects of aviation.  It is an area outside the current Bill that needs to be looked at.  Air aviation has experienced a huge downturn over the past number of years because of Covid.  As an island nation, it is an integral part of our access to investment in tourism, which has a knock impact for hospitality.  I will issue a request to the Minister for Transport to come to the House to debate the issue.  I will also request the attendance of other Ministers in that area as well.  </p> <p>Senator Keogan mentioned Care Day, which I had not heard of.  She put forward some welcome suggestions in regard to providing opportunities across all areas of our country for people from different parts of our society.  It is a source of regret to me that one's address can mean so much in terms of getting on in life.  That should not be the case.  Having it easy is not always the best preparation for life.  Sometimes, having it hard and having to fight to make progress and get on is the better preparation for life.  I wholeheartedly agree with the Senator's comments and suggestions.</p></speech>

I also welcome our guests, John, Celine and Jason, who have been promoting this legislation for a long time.  They come from Senator Casey's neck of the woods.  They are very welcome and I thank them for their work.</p> <p>Given the passage of time, I would like to briefly outline the story behind this legislation.  I pay tribute to my former colleague in the Seanad, Dr. Keith Swanick, who, as the Cathaoirleach will know, along with Senators Wilson, Paul Daly and Casey and Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, did a lot of work behind the scenes in bringing this legislation forward in 2017.  I acknowledge the great work they have done.  Our guests from Community First Responders Ireland have been promoting this particular cause for a long number years and continue to do so.  As a society, we are deeply indebted to those individuals.  I thank all of the first responders who give of their time to protect our communities.  That is a great credit to them.  </p> <p>As we all know, there are approximately 2,000 defibrillators located in different areas across the length and breadth of this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For many of them, the local community's hard work and fundraising are what has them there in the first instance.  I acknowledge the work done by everyone from GAA clubs to other sporting organisations, all of which have contributed to putting those defibrillators in place.  I acknowledge also first responders, without whom there would no point in having the equipment, given we would not be able to use it.  They have taken out time to train themselves and keep themselves skilled in case they are called on in an emergency.  They are there to come to the aid of their fellow citizens and I thank them for that most sincerely on behalf of the House, its Members and indeed every community in the country.</p><p>This legislation was introduced in 2017.  The then Senator, Dr. Swanick, was of the opinion, as were all of us at that time, including the Cathaoirleach, that a new offence had to be created to deal with anyone who interferes with, steals or damages life-saving equipment.  One example of such equipment is a defibrillator, while others include lifebuoys or life rings.  Unfortunately, there have been many incidents, which appear to be on the increase, where these pieces of equipment are damaged.  So far this year - we are only in the second month - I have come across approximately nine incidents in the country where defibrillators were interfered with, removed or damaged.  The Cathaoirleach will know, coming from a coastal county, about the many lifebuoys and life rings that are constantly removed and damaged.  I understand Dublin City Council spends something in the region of &euro;20,000 per annum just to replace those rings.</p><p>As was mentioned by the then Minister of State on Second Stage in 2018, there is already legislation in place.  Nevertheless, we believe, as do first responders, that there needs to be a definitive offence for anybody who interferes with, damages or removes life-saving equipment.  I welcome the fact the Minister of State is appearing before the House to debate Committee Stage with a view to moving the legislation forward.  Some of my colleagues were not here for the Second Stage debate but, if I recall correctly, all the Senators who were here, including Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, were in favour of the legislation and we tried to push the Department to move it forward.  We have had negotiations with the Department about this matter and we hope to finalise those negotiations within the coming weeks in order that we can progress the legislation through the House within the coming months at the latest.  From there, it will go to the D&aacute;il, where Deputies will pick up the baton.</p><p>In conclusion, I thank the first responders, to whom we are deeply indebted, for taking time out of their day to attend the debate.  I thank them also for the work they have done on behalf of the communities of this country.  I look forward to the contributions of other Senators.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-17a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1687" speakername="Diarmuid Wilson" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021700002#S00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and, like my colleague Senator Gallagher, I welcome also the representatives of Community First Responders Ireland, who are attending the debate from the Gallery.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to bear with me for a moment because we have not debated this important legislation for some time and this is the first time it has been discussed in this Seanad.  As some Senators will be aware, it was written and published by our former colleague and Senator, Dr. Keith Swanick, in 2017.  He saw it through its early Stages in the Seanad and was eager to see it progressed and eventually passed into law, which is our objective today.  As Senator Gallagher said, he and I supported it then, along with Senator Paul Daly and Senator Casey, who was a Member of the Lower House at that time but encouraged us very much in respect of the legislation, as did Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, our party's justice spokesperson in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>At its heart, the Bill aims to deter anyone who seeks to damage vital, life-saving equipment.  It is a simple Bill that seeks to introduce a specific offence of interfering with life-saving equipment.  I understand and can appreciate the position of the Department of Justice, which maintains that such a crime is provided for under section 2 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991.  I respectfully suggest, however, that the act of damaging life-saving equipment is so reprehensible that it deserves to be explicitly legislated for.  Damaging or stealing life-saving equipment is not ordinary vandalism, such as graffiti or the theft of a street sign.  These acts directly impact on whether a person survives an incident in his or her most critical hour of need.</p> <p>The idea for this legislation came from CFR Ireland.  I, like many others, attended a briefing in the audiovisual room in Leinster House a number of years ago in which that organisation explained clearly why this legislation was necessary.  Community First Responders Ireland comprises volunteer, civilian responders who have been trained in resuscitation and defibrillation and are linked to the National Ambulance Service.  When the emergency services are alerted to a cardiac arrest, chest pain, choking or stroke, a civilian responder from the local CFR scheme is automatically dispatched along with the ambulance services.  I understand there are currently 270 CFR schemes in the country, all linked to the National Ambulance Service.  CFR, like many of us, were sick and tired of hearing about yet another defibrillator having been torn from a wall or damaged, or another lifebuoy having been stolen.</p> <p>I am sorry to say that, in the almost five years since this legislation was introduced, very little has changed.  Just a number of weeks ago, CFR reissued its call for stricter penalties for anybody involved in vandalism against public defibrillators after two had been damaged in one week.  Communities in Wicklow town and Tralee were left feeling frustrated and angry that they were without defibrillators after they had been destroyed.  Over the Christmas period, four further defibrillators were damaged, in Ballina, County Mayo, Blarney, County Cork, Sallynoggin, County Dublin, and Carlow town.  I have no idea what goes through the head of somebody who decides to wantonly destroy a defibrillator - not a lot, I would suspect.  A defibrillator or a lifebuoy can be the difference in whether somebody survives a cardiac arrest or in whether somebody drowns.</p> <p>The majority of these devices are put in place through fundraising by voluntary, community and sporting organisations.  Other organisations such as the GAA have been very proactive in this area, including through the establishment of the Cormac Trust, which was set up after the sudden death many years ago of Tyrone GAA star Cormac McAnallen.  It is one thing to know the value of a defibrillator; it is another to actually see the value of one.</p> <p>On the day representatives from CFR came to speak to us in the audiovisual room, they were joined by Cathal Joyce, a young man from Athlone whose life had been saved by a defibrillator.  In 2015, at the age of just 25, Cathal suffered a cardiac arrest while playing for Athlone.  He simply would not be alive today had it not been for that defibrillator, which was close to hand.</p> <p>It is important to point out that while much of our focus in this debate is on defibrillators, the legislation also covers items such as lifebuoys.</p> <p>Like all colleagues in the House, I will fully support the legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I fully support this legislation.  I ask the Minister of State to take back to the Minister for Justice the views of this House, which I know will be 100% supportive of this legislation.  This is so important that it deserves its own place on our Statute Book.  Hopefully it will deter people from damaging any type of life-saving equipment that is placed in our communities throughout the country.  Once again I pay tribute to the community first responders and to our former colleague, Senator Swanick, for initiating this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-17a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021700002#T00200"><p>I welcome to the Chamber our guest, John Fitzgerald, who I know for a long time and who has been at the heart of the community first responder scheme since 2004.  I was first introduced to it at a public meeting in Bray in 2003 and my own community in Laragh and Glendalough was one of the first within Wicklow to get up and running in 2004.  I also welcome Celine and Jason who are not from my neck of the woods, one is from Cork and the other is from Dublin so we have a broad range.  To come all the way from Cork to this debate today shows what value they put on this legislation.  They are the people who are volunteering, who are out there doing the work for us and saving lives.  That is what an AED does.  It saves a life.  It is not a piece of equipment, not a television or a microwave oven.  There are several people alive today because of that piece of equipment.  To say that it is covered under current legislation is not doing it justice.</p> <p>This Bill originated from my colleagues, Dr. Keith Swanick, and Senators Gallagher, Wilson and Daly on foot of a defibrillator being smashed on Arklow Main Street in Christmas week 2016 which was captured on CCTV.  The culprits were apprehended but nothing could happen because it was a piece of equipment.  It was not worth going after.  This is why we have to differentiate life-saving equipment from other pieces of equipment.  It does what it says on the tin.  It saves a life and we must value that life.  Damage to life-saving equipment must have consequences.  To say it is the same as another piece of equipment is no longer acceptable.</p> <p>We have asked community first responders to go out and save lives, especially in our rural communities where it will probably be 30 to 45 minutes before ambulance services arrive.  We know the importance of early intervention.  We talk about the chain of survival, early access, early intervention, but the third one is defibrillation.  What if in the morning in my community somebody was to have cardiac arrest, we intervene and get to stages 1 and 2, and somebody goes to Willie McCoy's shop to get the defibrillator off the wall to bring it back to save that life, only to find that somebody has robbed or smashed it?  The person who has had the cardiac arrest is probably not going to survive and will not get to the hospital in time.  We know there is a ten-minute window.  For every minute that is wasted without intervention there is a further 10% chance of not surviving.  So we have a ten-minute window.  </p> <p>Because of community involvement we are seeing AEDs everywhere today.  This is happening because of the education of us as a public.  Even in this House when we came back after Christmas, every floor and every corner now has an AED.  It is not just that community first responders can use them anymore.  People in society, because of their work over the years, can intervene in an instant, but they must know where the AED equipment is, and when they go there they have to know it is going to be intact so that they can use it to save a life.  I more than hope, I insist that the Government treats this Bill seriously in the spirit in which it was drafted and takes on board what we are saying.  If there are issues regarding the drafting of the legislation let us address them, but let us not lose this Bill because of what I would call bureaucracy.  This is required.  Community first responders in Ireland are asking for it.  We ask them to go out on a voluntary basis to save lives for us, and the least we can do is acknowledge them, recognise what they are doing and implement what they are asking us to do.</p></speech>

There is a quote from the Bible that if you save one life you save the world entire, so I am quite sure they have saved the world many times over.</p> <p>I am conscious of time.  We have scheduled only 30 minutes for the debate and I know people want to hear from the Minister of State.  Everybody can speak but we are going to adjourn consideration of the Bill.  If all Members speak we may not hear from the Minister of State.  I have Senators Wall, Ward, Daly, Keogan and &Oacute; Donnghaile yet to speak and then the Minister of State, and we have nine minutes remaining.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-17a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1684" speakername="Mark Wall" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021700002#T00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  It is important that I say a few words on this Bill.  I also welcome Community First Responders Ireland to the House.  As the Cathaoirleach will be aware I have continuously raised the importance of AEDs in all our communities since I was first elected to this House.  I am glad that today we are also including lifebuoys as part of this Bill.</p> <p>I congratulate my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues for bringing this important legislation before us because coming from a town with a canal and a river, the importance of lifebuoys cannot be overemphasised.  Unfortunately we have had incidents in the past where, when a person went to look for those lifebuoys, they were not there.</p> <p>The importance of AEDs has been mentioned by every previous speaker and I want to thank the defibrillator operators throughout Ireland, the community first responders and the GAA clubs that have been mentioned.  My own GAA club has one and I have been trained in its use.  That is important, and something we all should do in this House, to get up to speed and be trained in the use of an AED.</p> <p>I will quickly mention two other items.  We need to remove VAT from the cost of AEDs.  As has been said this is community funded.  People are going out collecting money to buy AEDs.  That is important.  Also most importantly we need a national register of AEDs.  I have called for this through a Commencement matter in this House on numerous occasions.  I believe the National Ambulance Service is carrying out that register and that is important.</p> <p>Today is a very important day.  We need to ensure that when a person looks for that AED to save a life, it is there, and I congratulate the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators on bringing this Bill forward.  I again thank the community first responders throughout all our communities for the great work they do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-17a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021700002#T00500"><p>I also welcome the Bill.  It is an important recognition of the distinct and singular purpose of life-saving equipment.  I join with the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators in acknowledging that is an important aspect that merits a different offence apart from an offence of criminal damage or theft.  It is right and proper that section 2 acknowledges the two different types of life-saving equipment, that is, the AED and other life-saving equipment like lifebuoys.  Coming from a coastal area, D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Dalkey and Sandycove have had issues with lifebuoys being stolen, damaged or burned in one instance in Blackrock.  It is entirely appropriate that this would be recognised specifically by its own piece of legislation.</p> <p>Senator Casey raised the issue of the possible requirement by the Government to amend the legislation.  I presume that does not arise given that no amendments have been tabled.  I do not have a difficulty with that.  One of the nice things about this Bill is that it is quite proportionate.  It is not seeking to do anything beyond the norm.  The penalty provisions provided for in it still give discretion for summary or disposal, or disposal or indictment.  That is welcome.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wonder about the drafting on section 2 regarding the fact that a medical emergency must have been notified to the emergency services.  If somebody does not make that call at the time it is used, is it an issue?  Still, these matters are within the discretion of the prosecutorial authorities and I would have every faith that they would do the right job.  </p><p>I also welcome the first responders who are here.  Their colleagues in my area of Dalkey and D&uacute;n Laoghaire in particular do amazing work keeping us all safe.  They deserve credit but they also deserve the protection of the law, which is why this Bill is particularly welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-17a.87" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021700002#U00200"><p>I also welcome the community first responders.  I compliment my colleagues who have worked to keep this Bill alive and see it through to its fruition.  It would have been detrimental if the Bill ended when our former colleague, Dr. Keith Swanick, decided not to run for election the last time.  Senator Wilson mentioned the contribution of Cathal Joyce in the AV room.  I was at that game in Cusack Park on the day his life was saved.  I am actively involved in Westmeath GAA.  We have a lot of issues with vandalism in Cusack Park, be it windows, nets or flower pots, but luckily the AED was not damaged.  If property is vandalised, it can be repaired monetarily but if that defibrillator had been vandalised, it would have a cost a life and Mr. Joyce would tell you that himself so that is the distinction between vandalism<i>per se</i>and damage to life-saving equipment.  I compliment my colleagues for keeping this Bill to the fore.  Hopefully, it will get over the line sooner rather than later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-02-17a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022021700002#U00300"><p>I also support my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues.  On Second Stage, the then Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, pointed out that the Bill allows for the removal of the AED during an identifiable medical emergency that has been notified to the emergency services.  This would mean that if somebody throws a lifebuoy to a person without notifying the incident or some other person notifying the incident to the emergency services, he or she would be guilty of a crime.  The people who are going out to save lives are going out to save lives and obviously they want use of those AEDs.  The last thing they are probably thinking is, "Oh gosh, I have to ring the emergency services".  We want to protect those people as well.</p> <p>The Bill just protects the AEDs we have.  There is no doubt that we need more of them.  Community-funded initiatives are great but we should look at making it mandatory for large supermarkets and shopping centres to have or more of these installed.  I also commend the work of cardiac first responders throughout this country.  They do great work and are on duty 24-7 so I commend them for the great work they do in saving lives.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the role played by our former colleague, Dr. Keith Swanick.  I spoke on Second Stage and indicated my support and that of Sinn F&eacute;in for the legislation.  I reiterate this support today.  I acknowledge the vital work community first responders do throughout Ireland.  I was listening to the debate as people were reflecting on that and thought about a colleague of mine who people will know, Michelle Gildernew,  MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone.  I have been on Zoom meetings in more recent times where she has had to get up and run out the door because there has been a car crash or a neighbour in her rural constituency has had a heart attack so I know how crucial the work done by community first responders is.</p> <p>After the very public incident involving Christian Eriksen, I contacted the Cathaoirleach and asked on the Order of the Business that we would install additional defibrillators around this institution not only for our own protection but to lead by example as an institution.  Like Senator Casey, I welcome the very visual number of defibrillators around the building.  I received training in defibrillator use many years ago when I worked in a primary school.  I do not know if I could manage one right now so part of my request at the time was that the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission would consider making training available to Oireachtas Members.  I reiterate that call if it is not already in train.  I support the legislation and look forward to it coming back and getting through the House.</p></speech>

Few of the Members who have spoken here this afternoon know what it is like to wake up at 5 a.m. with a pain in your chest as if you had just been hit by a bus.  I have had that experience.  I spent two years from 1999 to 2001 carefully assessing everywhere I went outside Dublin to see if there was a hospital close by.  I cannot begin to tell Members the fear you feel when you get a pain in your chest.  In December 1999, several months after having stents fitted, I remember getting a pain in my chest in Terenure and the fear I felt.  It was late at night and I was on my own.  There were people all around me but nobody close to me and I thought this was it and that I would not see tomorrow - the thoughts that run through your mind when you try to put yourself in order to meet your maker.  I was fortunate; I got to Tallaght Hospital and stayed there for four months.</p> <p>Fair play to Dr. Keith Swanick; he always put community issues first.  I am delighted to see that his colleagues brought this Bill before the House again.  I see no reason it should fail to pass in its entirety.  It is, as Senator Ward said, very measured.  Please let it pass as quickly as possible without any impediment or amendments.  I do not see the need for them.  </p></speech>

Meetings with the Department in the coming weeks are planned where we hope to progress a couple of issues outlined by the Department.  Hopefully, we can overcome those difficulties.  It makes sense.  The quicker we get it done, the better so I look forward to coming back to the House when those issues have been ironed out so that this issue can be progressed and we can pass the Bill on to our colleagues in the Lower House.</p></speech>
