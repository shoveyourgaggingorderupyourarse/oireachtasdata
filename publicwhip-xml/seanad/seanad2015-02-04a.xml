    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400002#A00600"><p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State.</p>  <p>This matter deals with the tragic case of a brilliant, attractive, talented young man who met his death some years ago, to the immense and continuing distress of his entire family.  He took his bicycle out for a run and was knocked down by a Lithuanian heroin addict who had between 40 and 50 convictions for drugs offences and larceny on both sides of the Border.  The addict was on the Interpol register as a criminal and on the PULSE system.  One hour before the brilliant young man was killed, the car driven by the Lithuanian drug addict was stopped at a Garda checkpoint.  Since there was no insurance on the car and a series of other complicating factors, including the fact that the driver was on PULSE and the Interpol register, he should have been stopped and arrested.  He simply should not have been allowed to continue to drive the car.  Had appropriate Garda action been taken, the young man, who had so much to give to his family and this country, would be alive today.</p>  <p>There was a series of other complicating factors.  We are addressing the repercussions of the incident today.  There was a catalogue of Garda malpractice.  I wrote to the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, about it and received an emollient reply.  He expressed sympathy for the family and his letter was understanding, but he distanced himself from the matter and said that, because of the separation of powers, there was no way in which he, as Minister, could interfere.  Thus, he denied responsibility.  That negated any opportunity I had of doing what I had intended to do - that is, to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  If the Minister has no responsibility in this matter, it cannot be raised in the House.  The current Minister has acceded to the establishment an independent review panel to consider the activity of the Garda in Cavan-Monaghan, which I very much welcome, but the chairman of this panel is the senior counsel who represented the Lithuanian drug addict, Mr. Gridziuska.  Both senior and junior counsel were supplied free of charge by the State to the drug addict, whereas no such provision was made for the family of the bereaved.  There is an extraordinary lack of co-ordination.</p>  <p>I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of State to a parallel case that we all know about - namely, that of Ms Savita Halappanavar, who died tragically in hospital.  An inquiry was established that involved one of the hospital consultants who had treated Ms Halappanavar.  Ms Halappanavar's husband, Praveen, objected to this and, as a result, the consultant, without any impugnment of his reputation, was removed from the inquiry because of a perception of a conflict of interest.  This is exactly what we are dealing with in the case I am raising.  The family of the deceased is outraged that the man who, as senior counsel, represented the Lithuanian drug addict is now the chairman of what is supposed to be an independent review panel.  I do not in any sense impugn the reputation or conduct of the barrister.  In law, people represent those they are appointed to represent, and do so to the best of their ability.  The barrister in question did a very good job - a tragically good job - for the Lithuanian, the man he was representing, but that is what his function was.  However, there is a clear perception of a conflict of interest.  How can somebody who professionally represented a criminal responsible for the death of a young man be seen as a proper person to conduct the inquiry?  He should be removed and distanced from this section of the inquiry.  At least, the Minister should undertake that the barrister will have no role to play in the conduct of the inquiry.</p> <p>Transparency International, two D&aacute;il Deputies and solicitors representing the family have written to the Minister objecting to this gentleman's appointment to this position.</p> <p>I had a useful reply from the Minister in the past few days but she draws attention to a European Union directive that she is transposing and hopes to have in by November.  She states that it requires every member state to give all victims of crime information, support and protection and that the directive provides that the victim should receive appropriate information about their case, have access to victim support services and so on.  A further provision states that the victim may be accompanied by a person of their choice for interviews with police.  That is not a satisfactory reply.  It is the mildest possible provision that one can be accompanied to a police station and get information.  We have that already.  I ask that this gentleman, with no slur cast on his reputation, should be distanced or removed from this inquiry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400003#B00200"><p>Regardless of the action taken, it will bring no comfort to anyone who has lost someone in these tragic circumstances.  It will not bring the person back, and I can understand their distress.</p>  <p>The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, wishes to thank the Senator for raising the matter and regrets that she is unable to be present to take it herself.  Senator Norris is referring to the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to the Minister for Justice and Equality, or the Taoiseach, with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.  In order to carry out this review, a panel consisting of two senior and five junior counsel, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system, was established.  The independent review is well under way at this stage, and is in the process of considering 313 cases.  This is a significant number of cases, and somewhat higher than originally estimated, but the Minister thought it was important to refer to the panel all of the allegations on hand, with only a minimal filtering process, so as to ensure that every appropriate case got the benefit of an independent review.  Its role is effectively to triage those cases with a view to determining to what extent and in what manner further action may be required in each case.  </p>  <p>The review of each allegation consists of an examination of the papers by a counsel from the panel, and does not involve interviews or interaction with complainants or any other form of investigation.  I should point out though that counsel may recommend that the Minister seek further information to assist in coming to an appropriate recommendation in any particular case.  The Minister has asked counsel to recommend to her what action, if any, might be appropriate in each case.  Each recommendation made by the panel will be very carefully considered.  Clearly, having engaged counsel for this review, it would be entirely appropriate for the Minister to be guided by their advice.  Obviously, it would not be appropriate to comment upon the potential outcome of any individual complaint being reviewed by this mechanism before the Minister has received and considered counsel's recommendation.  </p>  <p>As I have already explained, the panel were all selected on the basis of their experience.  In this regard, and having regard to the scope of the review, and the number of complaints involved, there is always the possibility that a conflict of interest could potentially arise.  The Minister has asked me to assure the House, however, that appropriate steps have been taken to ensure the integrity of the review mechanism, including the avoidance of issues of conflict of interest.  Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that if there is any conflict, or potential conflict, the particular counsel not only will not be involved in the particular case, but also will not be aware of which counsel is reviewing it.  This is normal professional conduct, and there are sufficient counsel on the panel to ensure the practicality of that.</p>  <p>The Minister is aware that concerns have been raised regarding the particular case referred to by the Senator.  The Minister is deeply conscious of the profound distress experienced by the family.  However, they have been advised of the arrangements that apply, as has their legal representative and the various public representatives who have raised the concern on the family's behalf by way of parliamentary questions and representations.  Whatever steps are necessary will be taken to ensure there is no conflict of interest. </p>  <p>I would like to assure the House that every case, including the case referred to by the Senator, will be reviewed by independent and impartial counsel who will make an objective recommendation.  I hope that goes some way to allay the Senator's concerns.</p></speech>

I have just seen this and there is some movement.  I would make three points.  I recognise that the Minister of State cannot answer because she is not directly concerned with them but I ask her to convey these points to the Minister directly and ask her to contact me.</p>  <p>The first point is the statement that the panel were selected on the basis of their experience.  The experience of this gentleman is of defending the criminal, and that surely is a conflict of interest.  </p>  <p>The Minister of State then said that if there is any conflict or potential conflict the particular counsel will not only not be involved in the particular case, but will also not be aware of which counsel is reviewing it.  She failed to say that this particular case meets those considerations.  She does not actually say that in this case there is a conflict of interest that will be addressed.</p>  <p>The final point concerns the Minister of State's statement that whatever steps are necessary will be taken to ensure there is no conflict of interest.  I welcome that but again there is no statement that in this case these steps will be taken.  I ask the Minister of State to get the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to contact me to assure me that such steps will be taken in this case.</p></speech>

However, I will convey the Senator's further concerns to the Minister.</p></speech>

I welcome the decision by the Minister and the Minister of State in dealing with the emergency that has arisen in recent weeks with regard to the overcrowding in accident and emergency departments, with the large numbers increasing.  As I said to someone recently, if we take the figures for last year we see that, on average, 20,000 people attend accident and emergency departments every week.  If there is a 20% increase, that is an extra 4,000 people and, therefore, a huge change can occur at very short notice.</p>  <p>An emergency task force was set up to deal with this problem.  Nursing Homes Ireland, which represents the private nursing homes, accommodates over 22,000 people in private nursing homes.  I understand that in setting up the emergency task force to deal with the accident and emergency problem in the sense of trying to get people out of hospital and make beds available for people who need to be admitted, there was no representative from the private nursing homes.  The private nursing homes are a key ingredient in dealing with this issue as well as the doctors, nurses, hospital administration staff and all the back-up support needed, whether it is home care packages for people being discharged from hospital or whatever.  My understanding is that the nursing homes are not represented on the emergency task force and it would be appropriate that they would have a representative to ensure that all the issues can be dealt with, that a service that is made available continues to improve, and that we have a response as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400003#B00700"><p>I thank Senator Burke for raising this issue.  Emergency department, ED, overcrowding is a priority issue for me and for the Government and I acknowledge the difficulties the current surge in ED activity is causing for patients, their families and the staff who are doing their utmost to provide safe, quality care in very challenging circumstances.  The Minister for Health convened the emergency department task force in December 2014 to develop long-term solutions to overcrowding by providing additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges presented by the current trolley waits.  The task force comprises senior doctors, lead hospital consultants, Health Service Executive national directors, union representatives and senior officials from the HSE acute hospitals directorate and the Department of Health.  The task force will provide additional focus and momentum in dealing with the challenges, complementing the ongoing work of the special delivery unit and taking a service-wide approach including social care, primary care and acute care. The aim is to develop effective measures that will achieve sustainable, integrated and effective improvements across all services related to the ED trolley waits.</p> <p>At their meeting last Monday, the task force discussed a draft action to specifically address ED issues with a view to a significant reduction in trolley waits over the course of 2015.</p> <p>The Minister for Health and I are determined that the action plan be completed as soon as possible, taking the views of the task force into account, and then operationalised without delay.  The task force is due to meet again on 9 March.  In the interim, all hospitals have escalation plans to manage not only patient flow but also patient safety in a responsive, controlled and planned way that supports and ensures the delivery of optimum patient care.  These plans include opening the establishment of additional overflow areas, the reopening of closed beds, the provision of additional diagnostic scans and additional ward rounds by consultants to improve the appropriate flow of patients through the hospital system.  The Government has provided additional funding of &euro;3 million in 2014 and &euro;25 million in 2015 to address delayed discharges.  The actions being taken include the provision of additional home care packages, additional transition beds in nursing homes, 300 additional fair deal places and an extension of community intervention teams.</p> <p>With regard to the issue of appointing representatives from the private nursing home sector, both the HSE and the Department of Health have given the matter serious consideration.  It is acknowledged that private nursing homes have a valuable contribution to make in respect of specific issues such as delayed discharges and patient flow from acute or transitional care into long-term care.  The position of private nursing homes does mean that, given their business interests, they have a very specific interest in how services are provided.  It is considered that the existing membership of the task force is well placed to best cover the broad nursing home requirements.  That said, the HSE will engage positively with private nursing homes and invite input and submissions from them on the work of the ED task force and other relevant issues under HSE's remit.</p> <p>On a personal basis - this is something I will discuss with the officials - I do not have a difficulty with representatives of the private nursing home sector being on the group.  They are key to how it is managed.  Also, it would be remiss of us if we did not ensure GPs were part of this as well.  The only way to stop the type of crisis we have seen this year and in the past from happening in the future is by ensuring that people are well maintained within their own community, and GPs are key to all of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400004#C00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response.  The nursing homes represent the private sector.  As the Minister of State has said, unions are represented on the task force, which is extremely important.  Around 22,000 beds are provided by the private sector and, therefore, it plays a major part in dealing with the issues involved.</p>  <p>It would be interesting to discuss the transfer of people from nursing homes to accident and emergency departments.  Would they have been better off staying in the nursing homes?  If they had, they would probably have got equally good care and treatment.  This issue arose at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children held last Thursday week, when Senator Jillian van Turnhout mentioned what happened when her father fell ill.  His regular GP was unavailable so the family called the doctor-on-call service.  That doctor immediately responded by suggesting that the Senator's father should be transferred to an accident and emergency unit.  Such admissions, particularly when they happen at weekends, create problems in EDs.  If nursing homes were represented on the task force they could play a key part in working to reduce the number of people who are transferred from nursing homes to accident and emergency units.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400004#C00300"><p>I will be very brief.  The pilot study of two nursing homes in Cork was on long-stay care and not transitional or short-term care.  Following training at the nursing homes, admissions to accident and emergency departments were reduced.  In saying that, the nursing homes where the training was carried out did not have a high incidence of admissions because they were very good at what they did.  Clearly, there are GPs who would not be familiar with the person concerned on an ongoing basis.  There are also some nurses who are worried about how to deal with people in later life who have become acutely unwell.  We have to understand those factors too.  It is about the type of training we can introduce to ensure that people do not end up in accident and emergency departments unnecessarily.  Nursing homes must be part of the argument, but centrally, GPs have to be part of it as well.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; me ceithre n&oacute;imead d&eacute;anach an l&aacute; sin.<br/><br/>I rise this morning to raise an important issue that has caused considerable concern in the area of Duleek, County Meath, particularly in a small part of the village, and, according to media reports, in Mornington, which is about seven miles away.  I refer to a number of cases of a disease called Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, which I will call GBS for short.  The best description I can give of GBS is from a victim of the condition who wrote a little booklet on his experiences before he knew other people suffered from it in his area.  He said:<blockquote>That immune system of the body attacks the nerves going to and controlling the muscles.  Instead of the signal from the brain telling the muscle to move, it goes to the outer skin where it feels like pins and needles, or severe nettle stings, all the while happening.  The illness starts at the toes and feet, moves up the lower legs and sometimes reaches the neck area.  Even the face and eyelids can be affected.  All bodily functions are knocked out as it comes up the body.  Bowel, bladder and lungs can also be affected.  </blockquote>Clearly, it is a serious disease, but fortunately it is a rare one.  I understand that one can expect one or two cases per 100,000 people, not per annum but in total.  There have been four confirmed cases of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in the village of Duleek.  I have met two of the people confirmed to have it, who are recovering.  They are neighbours, and the other two confirmed cases live close by.  There are two other cases in which GBS may be implicated, and the people affected live very close to the people who have been confirmed as sufferers.  I am unfamiliar with the case in Mornington which was cited in media reports.  Mornington is seven miles from Duleek.<br/><br/>The literature available on Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome states that it is very rare, but there is also literature available that suggests that it can appear in clusters.  There have been references in the literature to clusters occurring in China and Arizona.  Environmental causes have sometimes been linked to outbreaks or clusters, but other issues are also involved.  There is a medical trigger for GBS, which is usually an infection.  I want to know why so many cases have occurred in one small area.<br/><br/>The clusters that have become apparent in other areas were over a period of many years and number only slightly more than the number of cases discovered in the small village of Duleek.  This apparent cluster in Duleek, County Meath, and the general east Meath area appears to be quite significant.  These people have been badly affected by GBS in the past year or two.<br/><br/>There are environmental concerns in the region.  I will not outline them today, because it is not my role to blame anyone, if blame can be apportioned.  Having talked to people who suffer from the disease, and in one case a person two years after he or she first acquired the disease, I know they are keen to discover the reason for the number of cases in the area.  They are also keen that nobody else should suffer, because they have suffered hugely.<br/><br/>It is a deeply worrying time for everyone.  I live within three miles of the two victims confirmed to have the illness - the two people I have met.  The matter is deeply worrying for people in the area.  We would like the HSE to conduct an investigation, which I understand has been agreed to.  An investigation should include the EPA and Irish Water, because water has been blamed in some cases.  I am not saying any one thing has caused it or has anything to do with the incidence of GBS.  I am saying we should investigate all possible causes and do as much as possible.  Another case of GBS has been discovered in the general Cavan-Meath vicinity.  The case has been mentioned to me but I will not say where it is because I do not have the information first hand.<br/><br/>The incidence of GBS is of concern.  Some of the clusters that have been reported in the literature over the years encompassed large areas, perhaps the same size as County Meath.</p> <p>However, this is a very small area and if there are other cases in County Meath, it paints an even more worrying picture.  I seek answers and for this investigation to proceed as quickly as possible within a short timeframe.  It should bring in all the statutory agencies that may be relevant to it and try to get answers for these people.</p> <p>Those who have been in the acute hospital services as a result of this have nothing but praise for the staff.  It is important to mention this because this is an extremely rare disorder and the staff in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, have received high compliments from the two men I have met who are victims of this syndrome.  I wished to put that on the record because the staff often get forgotten.  However, the big issue in this regard is to ascertain whether there is a reason for this and, if so, to put an end to it.</p></speech>

Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system.  It usually occurs a few days or weeks after a person has had symptoms of a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection.  The syndrome is slightly more common in men than women and can affect people of any age, including children.  The syndrome is rare, afflicting only approximately one person in 100,000.  It is estimated that 50 to 100 people are affected in Ireland annually.  However, as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is not a notifiable disease, there is no requirement for doctors to report cases.  Guillain-Barr&eacute; is called a syndrome rather than a disease because, as the Senator pointed out, there could be a lot of reasons and it is not clear that a specific disease-causing agent is involved.  A syndrome is a medical condition characterised by a collection of symptoms, that is, what the patient feels, as well as signs, that is, what a doctor can observe or measure.  As the signs and symptoms of the syndrome can be quite varied, doctors may, on rare occasions, find it difficult to diagnose it.  Two thirds of people with Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome are known to have experienced an infection before the onset of the condition.  Most commonly, these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection.  Approximately 30% of cases are provoked by <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>, with a further 10% of cases attributable to cytomegalovirus.  Despite this, only very few people with Campylobacter or cytomegalovirus infections develop the syndrome.  Links to other infections are less certain.  Most people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months and do not have any further problems.  However, some people may take longer to recover and there is a possibility of permanent nerve damage.  There are therapies that lessen the severity of the illness and accelerate the recovery in most patients.<br/><br/>I have been informed that officials from the Health Service Executive met members of local environmental groups from the Louth-Meath area on 28 January in Navan.  These groups voiced concerns that a number of the cases were related to environmental issues in the Duleek area.  However, it was clarified that the majority of confirmed cases of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome are linked to a previous episode of infection, a vaccination or a surgical intervention, rather than to environmental factors. The department of public health in the north east has agreed to follow up on these cases to try to identify possible causes for this apparent cluster of cases.  This will include meeting with the individual patients in the near future to further that investigation.  I hope that when these meetings take place, the concerns regarding whether this is water borne or whether there are other environmental issues will come up and, if there is need for further investigation, that this will be taken on board.</p></speech>

They need not approach me, another politician or any local group.  Such people can go directly to the HSE and ask that they be interviewed in this regard.  The Minister of State has mentioned gastroenteritis, which I believe is associated with <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i>, as well as respiratory tract infections, and I suppose that some of the environmental concerns come from that.  While nobody knows what is causing it at present, it is important that nothing is ruled out.  We all are beginning to find out information on this subject about which none of us really had any knowledge until this matter came to light a few weeks ago.  However, to be of help to the Minister of State, my understanding, based on some of the literature I have read, is that the vaccination issue arose back in the 1970s and it may no longer be relevant today.  However, much research remains to be done.  Certainly, however, I wish to ascertain what, if anything, can be done about this.  I am not putting pressure on the HSE as such.  It already has agreed to carry out an investigation, which is important, but it should be done as quickly and as comprehensively as possible.</p></speech>

I assume that people who developed this syndrome in the past would have felt quite isolated and would not have known there were other people with the same difficulty.</p></speech>

She probably will understand the difficulties in managing west Cork as well as anyone.  In the motion I tabled, I have set out how I have been contacted by a number of people expressing concern at the reduction in paediatric outpatient clinics in Bantry General Hospital.  I believe that up to three years ago, there was a monthly paediatric clinic that rotated from being a general clinic to being a diabetes clinic.  I also am informed that, currently, no diabetes clinic at all is held and that the general clinic only takes place three times per annum.  At present, children with type 1 diabetes are only seen twice a year in Cork University Hospital.  At a time when Members are particularly concerned about type 2 diabetes and obesity in young people, I fail to understand why the diabetes clinic has been discontinued.  I perceive these changes to be a further diminution of service in Bantry General Hospital and a serious blow to remote rural communities.  I will repeat a point I have made previously in respect of the children's hospital in Dublin, which is that for people in Dingle, Castletownbere or remote parts of County Donegal who will be obliged to travel for five or six hours, it does not matter a damn whether it is located on the north side, the south side or in Tallaght.</p>  <p>It is important to note that people in west Cork and south Kerry use the service in Bantry and to note that in the United Kingdom, children with diabetes are seen every three months.  I have a general concern that when Bantry General Hospital lost its accident and emergency unit, there was a promise in the reconfiguration plan for the hospital that many clinics, be they orthopaedic, paediatric, for children or whatever, would take place and that consultants under contract in Tralee hospital, the Mercy University Hospital or Cork University Hospital would visit Bantry on a regular and ongoing basis.  This was to prevent people from remote areas from being obliged to travel long distances to Cork, thereby creating long delays, overcrowding and so on.  This is a specific item of deep concern and being a grandparent myself with a number of grandchildren, I can understand the problem and plight of young parents who have sick children.  They believe the service with which they should be provided locally - this may mean an hour's drive for some of them - has now been reduced substantially and, in respect of diabetes, appears to have ceased.  I acknowledge that the dedicated diabetes nurse who was based in Bantry has retired, but if that information is correct, she should have been replaced.  Unfortunately, diabetes is a developing disease for all people.  It is linked to obesity, and current thinking is to deal with children at a young age when they are two, three, four or five years old.  That is the time to nip it in the bud, as when one gets older and becomes an adult, if one suffers from diabetes, it probably will entail the taking of medication for the rest of one's life.  Consequently, this is an important issue.  While one might argue it probably is parochial, it is of huge importance to the region I represent, and hopefully the Minister of State will have some positive news in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400005#D00900"><p>Before I start to read the official reply, as someone who was involved in the campaign to have paediatric diabetes services brought to the south, I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  A number of years ago, they were very poor and most families preferred to deal with Crumlin or Temple Street hospitals in Dublin in respect of their children.</p> <p>They said that the best thing about the services there was the ready access to expertise through a specialist nurse who was at the end of a telephone line.  That was the target we set for ourselves in the context of the service to be delivered in the south.  </p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to inform the House of the significantly improved services which are now provided to paediatric diabetic patients in Cork.  The unprecedented evolution of best practice and new models and standards of care for children with diabetes together with the reconfiguration of services in Cork and Kerry have led to significant enhancement in the delivery of services in recent years.  </p> <p>In line with the national paediatric and national diabetes clinical programmes, a subgroup was established in 2011 to examine the delivery of diabetes care in Ireland to all children under 16 years of age.  In early 2012 a national clinical lead in paediatric diabetes, Dr. Stephen O'Riordan, based in Cork University Hospital, CUH, was appointed to implement improved access to diabetic care and to implement new models of care for diabetic services.  The paediatric diabetes service resource is now concentrated in CUH and has been reconfigured to allow for the introduction of the insulin pump service in the region.  While my welcome for this and that of Senator O'Donovan may be somewhat parochial, this development is, nevertheless, very important.  The hospital provides all forms of diabetes care and insulin pump starts for children under five years which is a huge advance.  This model of care offers greater access to a dedicated paediatric diabetes service delivered by a paediatric diabetes team.  The service is led by two consultant paediatric endocrinologists and is supported by a dedicated diabetes specialist nurse and by a paediatric diabetes dietician.  Having listened to the mothers of diabetic children, I know that all of these things are essential.  I am very proud to say that Cork is spear-heading developments in paediatric diabetes and the development of the pump school service in the community has achieved national recognition by winning a health literacy award in 2014 and a health innovation award in 2013.  The services in Cork are currently being assessed by Sweet.EU, a major EU initiative in the field of diabetes prevention, and are working towards being accredited as a recognised centre of excellence in Europe.  </p> <p>The concentration of diabetes services in CUH is in line with the Government's policy on the reorganisation of hospital services.  The framework for smaller hospitals articulates the Government's commitment to securing and further developing the role of smaller hospitals in the delivery of significant volumes of less complex care.  The framework outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate together as a single hospital group.  In this instance, the South/South West Hospitals Group has ensured that the care of complex paediatric diabetic patients is centralised in CUH.  Children who need this specialist treatment are provided with a safe and high-quality service in the most appropriate setting.  While the diabetes clinics have transferred from Bantry General Hospital to CUH, I have been assured that the more straightforward paediatric clinics will continue to operate in Bantry as before.  Indeed, I understand that hospital management is actively engaged in developing this service.  </p> <p>To conclude, I would like to assure the House that the movement of paediatric diabetes services to CUH should not be seen as a threat to Bantry General Hospital but as an opportunity to provide the children of Cork with the best service possible in the right setting.  The role of Bantry General Hospital will not diminish but will be developed as appropriate in the context of the wider needs of the South/South West Hospitals Group.  I hope this is of some comfort to Senator O'Donovan.  The paediatric clinics will continue in Bantry General Hospital and are the ideal vehicle for picking up children who have or who develop type 1 diabetes.  The service such children are receiving at CUH is second to none.  It is better than the service that was being delivered by the Dublin-based hospitals.  </p></speech>

While I am somewhat reassured by what she has said, a commitment was given by the HSE to provide certain services at Bantry General Hospital in the reconfiguration programme.  Those services were withdrawn, unilaterally, without consultation with the general practitioners and parents concerned.</p>  <p>Thankfully, the number of children with diabetes who have been affected by this is limited but that said, for those children who are living in remote areas on the peninsulas or near Bantry, CUH  is a one and a half or two-hour drive away.  It would not have been too much of a burden on the HSE to advertise through the GPs in the area that this service is no longer available at Bantry General Hospital and the reasons for that.  That was the problem.</p>  <p>Parents of children with diabetes were attending Bantry General Hospital for three years or more but suddenly they were told they had to travel to CUH.  It is difficult for parents to deal with that.  While the service in CUH may be more efficient or centralised, the way this change has been implemented in the context of services at Bantry General Hospital is a source of worry to me.  This is not the only clinic to have been moved.  Clinics are introduced with great fanfare and lauded as being great for the area.  Then, all of a sudden, they disappear.  The services are revamped and re-emerge in the central set up at CUH.  That might be the ideal location from a health point of view but for those living in remote parts of rural Ireland, there are concerns.  I understand what the Minister is saying but my fears are not totally allayed.  I may have to revisit this issue at another time but I appreciate the information the Minister of State has provided today.</p></speech>

Children with diabetes can have a poor episode very quickly and parents need to be reassured.  The main point made to me by parents was that having a specialist nurse at the end of a phone line to give reassurance is crucial.  The introduction of the insulin pump is also vitally important, particularly for very young children because it allows for greater control of insulin levels.  Parents become expert at adjusting insulin levels as required.  When children with diabetes are out playing soccer, hurling or football, for example, parents quickly learn how much food and insulin they need in those circumstances.  All of that has improved significantly.  That said, I do not dismiss the worries of people who are living in more remote areas in terms of quick access to services but having a specialist nurse at the end of a phone line is enormously helpful.</p></speech>

Over the past number of weeks we have seen people in hospitals and particularly accident and emergency departments who are waiting on trolleys and various services.  All of us are aware of the multiplicity of issues, and I know there has been focus by the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, in trying to reduce those numbers.  It is welcome that this has happened.  We are just waiting for another spike nonetheless.</p>  <p>The fair deal scheme must be examined in great detail.  This successful scheme was initiated by a previous Government and it allows people who need nursing home care to access it with the costs to be defrayed.  It works well but it is underfunded by this Government.  Figures were published yesterday by the Department of Health on waiting times.  In January 2014, there were 512 people awaiting funding, with four weeks for approval.  At the end of January 2015, there were 1,332 people waiting on the national placement list for funding, with the waiting time averaging 11 weeks.  There is something broken in the system and it is not working.  I have heard colleagues opposite mention phrases that I do not like, such as "bed blockers"; these are people in hospital who do not want to be there.  They could either be stepped down to return home or they should be able to access the fair deal scheme.  This problem must be addressed.</p>  <p>There was a focus from the Government over a week or two in trying to reduce the number of people waiting on trolleys in hospitals - as was correct - but the issue has moved on.  We need the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, to tell us what is happening with the fair deal scheme and how we will properly fund home help.  The issue of looking after people at home or in nursing homes must be examined very carefully, as these figures are unacceptable.  There are nearly 1,400 families waiting over 11 weeks to get applications for their relatives to access nursing home care.  Waiting times and the number of people waiting have trebled.  The figures do not lie and something is wrong, so the matter must be addressed.  I ask for a specific debate on this and perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, can tell us what she proposes to do in this instance.  The Government needs a plan to address the matter as it is worsening month on month.</p></speech>

I am concerned that this may be code for the possible closure of some court offices in the county.  In my town of Carrick-on-Suir, &euro;270,000 was spent in 2007 on renovating the courthouse, and it is now one of the finest in the country.  It is extremely busy and it sits twice a week.  In Tipperary and Nenagh, there are also very busy courthouses.  If efficiencies must be found, I hope they will not equate to the word "closure".  The services are very badly needed and we want them to be retained.  Will the Leader bring this to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald?</p>  <p>I welcome the proposed legislation to restrict cheap alcohol.  There are to be warning labels and details of calorie content on all alcohol to be sold, and there will be new and strong powers for environmental health officers to patrol this area.  There will also be new restrictions on advertising, marketing and sponsorship.</p> <p>This issue has been bandied around for a number of years and it has hopped and bopped from one Minister to another but I am pleased that the current Minister for Health has taken it by the scruff of the neck and proposes to publish legislation in this regard.  It has been approved by the Cabinet and we will see the colour of the legislation soon.</p> <p>There is also good news about planning.  Yesterday, I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government at which there was a briefing on the planning (no. 2) Bill, which will provide for a planning regulator who will help to implement the Mahon tribunal recommendations.  We were all abhorred by the tribunal.  For too long there have been "make it up as you go along" breaches of development plans, ignoring national spatial strategies and so on, which helped to cause the havoc that was wreaked on the country in respect of housing.  In addition, the fee for making a submission on a planning application will be removed for public representatives.  The fee is &euro;20 per submission and we all disagreed with it when it was introduced.  That will be removed by the legislation and I welcome that along with the other proposals in the legislation.</p></speech>

These events continue to spark off Islamophobia on the one hand and anti-Semitism on the other.  They are an inevitable by-product of British and American meddling in the Middle East.  If one kicks a wasp's nest, one can only expect to get stung.  There is something morally repulsive about the way these people set about their crimes.  There is no political or religious justification whatever for them.  I wonder whether the Jordanians were wise to respond immediately by executing two unrelated prisoners. I  am not sure such a knee-jerk reaction is a good idea.  This activity thrives on publicity and the media in the West need to be sensitive and careful about the way in which it treats these incidents.  By giving them headline publicity and including photographs in reports and so on, it simply justifies ISIS.  This is what the organisation is after.  It can get around apparent censorship by the use of Twitter and so on but that suggests there should be in the West a co-ordinated campaign on Twitter and other social media to counteract this material in the international media.</p>  <p>With regard to the Bill on alcohol to which a previous contributor referred, it is welcome but it is late.  Ministers have been sitting on this for the past six years at least and the legislation has been very much watered down.  There will not be a ban on alcohol sponsorship of sport and the drinks industry knows precisely what it is doing when it uses sport to advertise its products.  It is not just about a healthy sip of a drink; it is about a boozy boy's club and getting absolutely plastered.  That is what is endorsed in these advertisements.  I very much welcome the ban on below cost selling, which is an absolute curse.  I witness this in my area where women with prams load up with trays of tins and so on, which is dreadful.  We must have a debate on this matter to address alcohol abuse.  I am all in favour of people enjoying a drink, a good wine, a good glass of Irish whiskey or a Guinness, in so far as it is still Irish, but we have to address the social reasons for alcohol abuse and the endorsement of drunkenness that is so prevalent in this society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1152" speakername="Imelda Henry" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400008#L00300"><p>I refer to the issue mentioned by Senator Norris.  The problem we have with alcohol abuse in this country is due to availability and price.  I welcome the proposals signed off by the Government yesterday.  I particularly welcome the proposal to make it illegal to sell alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  The minimum unit price will be set a level which evidence shows will reduce the burden of harm from alcohol abuse.  I have campaigned heavily for this over the past number of years.  The is far reaching legislation and while it has taken a number of years, it is a complex issue.  I am delighted that the Government has done something about it and plans to pass the legislation before the summer.  It addresses alcohol as a public health measure, which is important, and it deals with all the crucial aspects that must be addressed, including price, availability, information and marketing.  It is being addressed as a public health measure for the first time, which makes this a legislative milestone.  Many people have a problem with alcohol and it kills three people every week, which is far too many.  The facts about our alcohol consumption do not tally with the relationship we think we have with it.  I do not say this as a killjoy but as a mother, a concerned member of a community and a public representative.  Almost 2.5 million people in Ireland drink, of whom more than half drink harmfully and excessively, that is, 1.24 million.  Senator O'Brien raised problems in our hospitals earlier but every night 2,000 hospital beds are occupied for alcohol-related reasons.  I look forward to us debating the legislation soon.</p></speech>

While minimum pricing is welcome, it is an awful shame that the House could not support the Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Fund Bill 2014.  It sought to take advantage of the low prices on alcohol by setting up a fund to ring-fence the money generated from these alcohol sales rather than providing additional profitability to the drinks companies.  We estimated approximately &euro;150 million could be raised through such a measure specifically for suicide prevention, which remains a silent crisis in our society with up to 600 people a year needlessly losing their lives.  In addition, A Vision for Change, which is in its ninth year, is starved of resources annually and despite the best efforts of the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, it is difficult for service providers to provide adequate resources.  The strategy is lagging well behind where it needs to be in terms of its implementation.</p>  <p>It is all well and good for all of us to come into the House in accelerated and personified indignation and call for action on specific issues.  The reality is we are not interested in dealing with this issue as a nation, although that might not apply to individual Members.  We have again pandered to the drinks companies regarding this legislation.  Alcohol prices must be raised and through the measures we suggested in the Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Fund Bill 2014, the money generated should be ring-fenced for suicide prevention and mental health services, where it is deserved.  I am not a killjoy and I do not oppose drinking but alcohol abuse has gotten out of control in recent years.  If the Government does not ring-fence this money for the services I have mentioned, which have been outlined by many Members previously, we will miss a great opportunity to deal with this issue once and for all.</p></speech>

That is one issue but collection of attendance fees is another.  My understanding is more than &euro;2 million still has not been collected for 2013.  This matter should be dealt with and it is important to get a response from the Minister regarding what action is being taken to make sure people who use accident and emergency departments pay the fees for which they are liable.</p>  <p>Senator O'Brien mentioned elderly care, which is becoming a bigger issue.  Significant long-term planning is needed.  We have been going on the basis of year to year management but 20,000 more people will reach the aged of 65 annually from now on and, therefore, our elderly population will continue to increase.  More than 22,000 are in the fair deal scheme and even if the Government wanted to retain the same ratio, an additional 4,000 beds would be needed by 2021.  While we need a debate on this, we also need a five year and a ten year plan to deal with this issue, including increasing the number of home care package that can be provided.  That needs to be prioritised.</p> <p> I welcome the comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, this morning in the House.  She confirmed she would do everything possible to have a representative of both the nursing homes and GPs on the emergency task force which was set up to deal with the overcrowding in accident and emergency departments.  They are two key components and they are currently not represented on the task force.  It goes to prove that tabling Commencement matters and having Ministers come to the House brings results.  I welcome the Minister of State's decision and I hope it is implemented at an early date.  We need to have a debate on the issue of care of the elderly.</p></speech>

This is very welcome.  However, there is a rule in business that one should look after one's customers.  A number of these banks have stated that this reduction will only apply to new customers and to what they term switchers.  In other words, they are encouraging people who are not their customers to join them but a loyal customer who has been a customer of a bank for some years will not get that benefit.  I do not understand this policy and I do not think it makes sense.  There should be an outcry against it.  I am not suggesting that there should be legislation but it does not seem to make sense that any business would decide to do something for new customers but not for existing customers.  It happens all the time with telephone companies and with subscriptions to magazines.  We should cry out against this practice.</p>  <p>It is time we did something about legislation to do with crowd funding.  I have an involvement with Linked Finance and I think it is a very worthy concept of crowd funding.  A person expanding his or her business and in need of financing can offer others to participate and interest will be paid.  This has worked very well.  In Britain they are talking about introducing legislation because crowd funding has been linked to equity finance.  There is a danger that the public will be misled.  The British financial regulatory authority plans to introduce legislation.  In my view, crowd funding needs to be regulated by legislation, not only to protect the investor but also to ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of crowd funding.</p></speech>

This has gained currency in Europe following the Greek election result.  Time and again the Government and the Taoiseach have ruled out the notion of a debt conference which at the very least would be an opportunity for European leaders to put the issue of debt on the agenda and to discuss the range of options for European leaders.  However, the Taoiseach has gone further and he has ruled out any possibility of Ireland getting any write-down on our debt or any renegotiation or retrospective recapitalisation of our banks.</p></speech>

Senator Gilroy needs to pipe down and listen for a second.  This is my opportunity on the Order of Business to put a question to the Leader.  Senator Gilroy should show some respect to Members of the House.</p>  <p>Will the Leader arrange a debate on this issue?  I am quoting what the Minister for Finance said today and yesterday.  He said he does not believe that we will get any retrospective funding from the ESM.  This is despite what was apparently agreed two years ago when the former leader of the Labour Party - Senator Gilroy's party - as well as Fine Gael and the Taoiseach said at the time that it was a game changer.  We had the ability the apply retrospectively to the ESM to take the burden of private banking debt off the shoulders of taxpayers.  All I am looking for is a debate on the issue.  Several calls have been made by Members from across the House.  I think it would be a good debate.  We should examine all the options.  Nobody is saying that these are easy solutions nor is anyone saying that we can force either Europe or the ECB to do things.  However, we need to have a starting point and a strong negotiating position, and we have not had that from the Government from the get-go.  It is certainly worthwhile for this House to have a debate on the issue.  It seems everyone else in Europe is discussing and debating this issue, with the exception of the Irish who are one of the most indebted countries in Europe.  It beggars belief.  I am calling for that debate to be arranged as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Even though ISIS and the Middle East seem very far away from us, geographically, I ask the Leader to arrange a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Minister for Defence on the reported number of Irish people, or people who have lived at one time or another in Ireland, who may have joined ISIS in the Middle East.  This is an important issue for debate because it should be fully discussed.</p>  <p>On a separate point which I did not intend to raise but in reference to Senator Cullinane's few comments, the notion of a debt conference in Europe is certainly something that is worth considering.  However, the Government's position is that Ireland is in a very different place from Greece.  The Irish economy is doing much better than the Greek economy.  It is all a matter of economic and political stability which is absent in Greece.  To link Ireland's fortunes with those of Greece may not be in Ireland's best interest in that we might be giving the impression that Ireland's economic recovery is as fragile and as unstable as that of Greece.  That is the Government position and it is not right for Senator Cullinane to misrepresent that situation.</p></speech>

Last week the House acquiesced in and agreed to the setting up of a commission of inquiry into the Guerin report.  We did this in good faith, but subsequently some startling revelations have come to light, mainly from the other House, that are troubling.  If there is truth in these revelations, then we were led up a blind alley and we were misled.  This issue is central to democracy.  If this commission of inquiry is to be transparent, fair and objective, correspondence from the former Minister to the Ceann Comhairle and correspondence from his firm of solicitors to the Ceann Comhairle, must be made available.  It has come to light today that the terms of reference of the inquiry were sent to a key player, namely, a former Minister, now Deputy Shatter, to review, add to, amend or delete those terms of reference.  This is to protect the back of a particular Deputy.</p></speech>

The key issue is that if we were misled by agreeing to terms of reference that are tainted, then the matter will not end here.  I warn this Chamber that we are going down a road that will end up in the courts, and I certainly want a debate.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, should be invited to the House.  This is a very serious issue which goes to the heart of our justice system and our democracy and the make-up of the Oireachtas.  Both Houses are working in tandem.  I ask that the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, come to the House today to answer these queries.  Perhaps she can allay my fears, but if there is any element of truth in them we have been misled in this House and the commission of inquiry that is being set up will end up going nowhere.

The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 is one of the most important Bills we have seen.  I am aware that there has been criticism that it has not gone far enough, but one has to start somewhere.  As well as providing for low-cost selling, the ban on advertising, the warning on the labels and the calorie counts will have the effect of making people think.  We are all aware of what the Road Safety Authority achieved with its advertising campaigns and what it did for road deaths.  I hope this Bill, which provides for a ban on advertising will be similarly successful.  I sit on the Tallaght drugs task force.  Last year, the Minister with responsibility for drugs task forces ensured that alcohol was included in their remit, as it is a drug.  I welcome that.</p>  <p>Today is world cancer day.  I know we have much criticism of the health services.  The purpose of world cancer day is to make people aware of cancer and the benefits of early detection.  In Ireland, the survival rate for all cancers has increased from 45% in 1999 to 60% in 2011.  All the cancer specialists, the hospitals and all involved in the cancer area from 1999 to date must be congratulated on the advances made by this country in ensuring that people are living longer.  Breast cancer treatment has an 85% success rate, while prostrate cancer treatment has a 92% success rate and so on.  I remind the House that BreastCheck is available free of charge to everybody over the age of 50; cervical smear tests and bowel screening are also available free of charge.  I want to use the day to bring these issues to everybody's attention.  While I am aware of criticism of the health services - and rightly so, in some areas - there are many people in the health service who do very good work.  One will hear people say that when they get into hospital they are well looked after by the staff.  </p>  <p>I was going to say something on the DEIS issue but I will leave it for tomorrow.</p></speech>

After a recent executive appointment, it was stated that the salary of the executive would be disclosed after three years, but not until then.  If this Government were to appoint somebody and say it would let the country know the salary for the job in three years' time, can one imagine the outcry there would be from the media, the Opposition and so on?

The banks are offering all sorts of incentives to new customers, yet they continue to screw their long-standing customers because they made the mistake of offering mortgage systems that were beyond their capability to sustain.

It is one thing to suggest that we should express solidarity with our European colleagues, but they did not show much solidarity with this country when we were in need.  In fact, they showed absolute contempt for the Irish people, given the manner in which they handled things.  They then changed the rules so that if the situation that developed here occurred in another country, that country would get a bailout without any of the penury that has been visited on the Irish people in recent years as a result of the unsustainable debt.  The term "unsustainable debt" was used by Moody's in its latest report on Ireland, which is carried in today's media.  Why should we not get involved in a debt conference if it will mean that we can at least discuss Ireland's unsustainable debt?</p></speech>

As the old saying goes: "Live horse, get grass."  That may or may not happen, but I feel it is unusual.  I have still not received clarity from anybody on the Government side as to why they are against the notion of engaging in a debt conference, particularly as we have unsustainable debt.</p>  <p>I wish to formally second the amendment by my colleague, Senator O'Donovan.</p>  <p>I rose primarily to express my astonishment at the decision by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to withhold a measly &euro;1 million of lottery funding which traditionally goes to youth organisations and others across the country.  For example, the Father Peter McVerry Trust announced that it would lose &euro;12,000 of State funding from the lottery, which it would have used for the homeless.  I find it extraordinary that on the one hand the Government is expressing sincere sympathy with the homeless and taking action in that respect, while on the other hand allowing an organisation that helps the homeless to lose &euro;12,000.  The Government is withholding a measly &euro;1 million out of a total budget of approximately &euro;240 million.  The Leader should ask a Minister from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to attend this House to explain exactly what that budget is being spent on.  This unacceptable decision will affect a wide variety of youth organisations across the State.</p></speech>

He said he would not comment on the state of accident and emergency units in individual hospitals.  However, the Minister has to deal with hospitals individually because there is a difference between them and a crisis in some.<br/><br/>The information I have is absolutely shocking.  One man spent 96 hours on a trolley and then got a bill of &euro;300 for a bed.  I have also heard an account of a mother with a baby whose ankle was fractured in three places but had to sit for ten hours without pain relief.  She said: &quot;I don't want to talk about the three psychiatric patients who played with my baby, or the girl having a miscarriage sitting beside the man with a bleeding head, or the man beside me vomiting every 15 minutes into a plastic bag.&quot;  Neither did she want to talk about the elderly patient who could not walk, who came in at 2.30 p.m. and was still there unassessed when she was leaving at 3.30 a.m.  There were no pillows, and no water was given to patients on trolleys.  She gave her spare bottle of water to an elderly woman.  The woman said: <blockquote>I don't want to talk about the lack of dignity to me or to all the other patients.  With no consulting rooms everybody heard my baby's history.  I unwillingly heard everybody else's history.</blockquote>That woman's question to the Minister, which has gone straight to his office yet remains unanswered, was about his emergency plan.  Galway University Hospital needs an emergency plan for its accident and emergency unit.  This appalling personal suffering is occurring daily, with an average waiting time of ten hours.  I await the Leader's response.  I have contacted the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, personally about this matter, but have not yet received a response.  While he makes a virtue of the fact that he will not comment on individual hospital cases, these appalling cases of human suffering will continue.</p></speech>

It seems to me that the media are the great unaccountable, and largely unexamined, force in modern Ireland.  It has long been of concern that many such people - whose salaries, which are sometimes large,  are funded by the taxpayer - are off on a frolic of their own, engaged in seeking to manipulate public opinion on occasions and shaping the direction of the country, but without being accountable in any way.

A contract is made with a particular company for the services of a certain celebrity who is being paid hundreds of thousands of euro - money that is paid by the taxpayer.  They are being funded to lead a celebrity lifestyle while, at the same time, often enjoying a completely unaccountable role in seeking to shape public opinion, which is far beyond their proper role.  We need to have a searching discussion on that from the perspective of accountability.  Whether the issue is rural or urban Ireland, liberal or conservative, we need to examine the media's role and how taxpayers' money is being used.</p>  <p>I wish to thank the Leader for getting a response for me from the Minister for Health on two issues I have raised: the question of procurement processes at the Saolta University Health Care Group, and issues concerning baby cooling.  I note that the only answer we have got from the Minister is that the Department has been advised by the HSE's national director of internal audit that the internal audit process is ongoing.  This is the examination of the procurement of particular services by the Saolta University Health Care Group.</p> <p>We were promised that this audit would be completed by last Christmas.  The former CEO, Mr. Maher, has presumably moved on to another role on the east coast of the country.  The question I asked as to whether the results of the audit would have any implication for his role or tenure remain unanswered because we do not know what the audit shows.  I am afraid this letter does not tell us why the delay occurred.  I thank the Leader for his unstinting efforts to get answers for me and the House, but I would be grateful if he asked the HSE and the Minister on my behalf why we have not had a response or a result from the audit at this stage.</p></speech>

I understand the heads of the Bill will be published today or tomorrow.  If this is to be successful, it must be approached on an all-Ireland basis.  There is no point in implementing legislation governing the Twenty-six Counties which does not involve some type of co-operation or similar legislation in the Six Counties.  Those in the part of the country from where I come live less than seven miles from the Border.  As it stands, regularly, particularly coming up to Christmas and other occasions such as Easter, huge convoys of people travel from as far away as Cork and Kerry to the North of Ireland to purchase alcohol.  Even with below-cost sales of alcohol in our supermarkets, people still travel to the North of Ireland because they can get it cheaper.  This may have changed with the difference in the currencies.  Any measures to deal with below-cost selling of alcohol will not work without a Thirty-two-County approach.</p>  <p>A major education programme should be launched in secondary schools.  During the late 1970s and 1980s a huge emphasis was placed on an anti-smoking campaign, which was, in my opinion, hugely successful.  I was part of a class of 28 in secondary school only one of whom smoked because from first year to fifth year we had periodic classes showing us the dangers of smoking.  If the same approach were taken to teaching our young people, starting in first year of secondary school, the harm that abuse of alcohol can cause, it would be money well worth spending.  Like Senator MacSharry, I believe some of the money should be ring-fenced for educational purposes as well as for suicide prevention.</p></speech>

The Leader is aware that Seachtain na Gaeilge is hurtling towards us at a considerable pace.  I appreciate the efforts made in previous years to ensure we have a level of debate as Gaeilge in the House, and I ask that this year we broaden it so that it is not merely Irish language and Gaeltacht issues that are discussed.  A number of Ministers are very proficient in the language, and perhaps we could have another debate as Gaeilge also.  It would be very good for the promotion of the language, and Members of the House would be well able for such debates.</p>  <p>I was lucky enough to be in Brussels yesterday with a delegation of small fishermen from throughout the island of Ireland, at the behest of the Liadh N&iacute; Riada, MEP, and Matt Carthy, MEP.  It was a very interesting engagement on fisheries issues with officials from the Commission.  Very harrowing personal stories were told about the difficulties of fishermen at present and the pressures they are under financially, socially and emotionally in trying to make ends meet.  A very specific issue that it is important for us to discuss is the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  At present it is up to member states to debate what types of measure they will bring forward under the fund.  Many of the measures would be able to alleviate difficulties in bringing younger people into the industry as well as dealing with safety issues, upgrading the fleet and other issues with regard to maintaining the rural communities in which the fishermen live.  I call for a specific debate, not on broader fishing interests, but on the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the Minister's proposals in this regard, which must be tabled in the coming months to the Commission.  It would be a very useful debate.</p></speech>

We will come under pressure in the coming weeks from lobbyists on this issue.  I hope the backbenchers and Senators who come under pressure will hold tight.  I am proud of the commitment we have made with regard to minimum pricing of alcohol.  One aspect which was quite validly raised by Senator Wilson is co-operation with Northern Ireland.  Most discussions I have heard in recent hours have missed one important point.  The Minister stated that there was an agreement with Northern Ireland that similar measures would be introduced at the same time, so that a cross-Border trade in cheap alcohol would not further develop.  This vital point, which has been overlooked in much of the commentary I have heard, is an important element of what is very well thought-out legislation.</p>  <p>Elements of the Bill include provisions to prevent the sale of cheap alcohol, which is the headline issue, health labelling and warnings, which are also very important, including calorie counts, powers for environmental health officers to enforce the separation of alcohol within stores and to police minimum unit pricing, the legal regulation of sports sponsorship, which will be difficult, and restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol, including a broadcast watershed.  The Bill would also make it illegal to market alcohol in a manner that is appealing to children.  I have called in the Chamber for all of these measures, on which the Government seems to be taking action, and I am delighted.  The tabloids will report this as the end of cheap drink, but it is simply a package of mechanisms, including calorie counts and restrictions on advertising, to ensure that people treat alcohol responsibly and prevent it from becoming just another commodity that they casually pick up in the supermarket.  As with the legislation on plain packaging of cigarettes, lobbyists will pile pressure on our backbenchers in the coming weeks, particularly ahead of an election, but I encourage everyone to hold the line and support these actions, which are badly needed.</p></speech>

It is with regard to publishing a Bill.  I have no problem with this, and I agree to the amendment.</p>  <p>I agree with him that there have been difficulties with the Fair Deal scheme.  I understand that on 20 January there were 763 delayed discharges nationally, of which 368 were in the Dublin teaching hospitals.  A focus on these delayed discharges is key to efficient patient flow, and significant resources are being applied to provide the best possible mix of support and services.  The Government committed an additional &euro;25 million in the budget for 2015 to address delayed discharges.  This has resulted in 300 extra approvals under the nursing home support scheme.  The waiting time for approved funding has dropped from 17 weeks, which it was before Christmas, to 11 weeks, as the Senator mentioned.  A total of 50 additional short-stay beds have been sourced from the private sector.  A total of 400 home care packages were approved in the greater Dublin area for 2015.  All requirements for home care are being met across the target hospitals, with 80 home care packages currently deployed, and the number is increasing daily.  A further 386 transitional beds were approved across all acute hospitals by the week ending 23 January.  These are the transitional care beds put in place to address the surge in delayed discharges which the Senator mentioned.  There are no significant delays associated with the provision of home care.</p> <p>This is monitored daily.  As of October 2014, some 8.5 million home care hours had been provided to 46,608 people and 13,000 home care packages had been approved to enable older people to remain living in their communities.  In addition to these measures, the HSE has allocated 165 transitional care beds to support Dublin's academic teaching hospitals, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Naas General Hospital.  As of 26 January 2015, all of these beds had been assessed.</p> <p>In light of the recent surge in activity in emergency departments, the HSE is considering the potential of spare capacity for short-stay beds in the private nursing home sector.  The HSE is profiling where the extra potential capacity is and matching the locations to the patients.  It is on target to bring about additional bed streams at Mount Carmel Hospital on a phased basis from the end of March.</p> <p>There has been significant progress.  We have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, to attend the Seanad to discuss the matter further.  She has agreed, but it will be March before she is in a position to do so.  I hope that the situation will have improved significantly by then.</p></speech>

I assure him that there is no intention to close the courthouse in Carrick-on-Suir, which was refurbished recently.</p>  <p>A number of Senators discussed the measures to tackle the sale of cheap alcohol.  The Minister has promised that the legislation will be before us by the summer.  Senators made many points about the abuse of alcohol.  Senator Wilson referred to the great level of co-operation between the Ministers on both sides of the Border.  The measures will be co-ordinated, so that what happens in Ireland as regards the below-cost sale of alcohol will happen across the Border simultaneously.  This is significant.  Many Senators stated validly that the money saved from this initiative needed to be ring-fenced for public health measures.</p>  <p>Senators Norris and Gilroy condemned the murder of the Japanese journalist and Jordanian pilot.  We would all like to be associated with the Senators' remarks.  What happened was appalling.  A new barbarity exists, which is most regrettable.</p>  <p>Senators MacSharry and Henry referred to the issue of alcohol and I have addressed that.</p>  <p>Senator Burke discussed attendance levels at accident and emergency departments and the outstanding fees.  Responsibility for collecting those fees lies with each hospital.  I am sure that hospitals will be following up on the matter.  The Senator alluded to the Minister's willingness to include general practitioners, GPs, and representatives of nursing homes on the emergency committee to deal with accident and emergency units and so on.  This is important.</p>  <p>Senators Quinn and Craughwell raised the need for banks to treat all customers equally.  I agree, but giving benefits to new customers while not extending the same benefits to existing ones seems to be the order of the day.  I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</p>  <p>It was mentioned that there may be a need to protect investors in cloud funding.  Senator Quinn has raised this matter several times.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, attended the House to discuss it some time ago, but I will impress upon him the possible need for such legislation.</p>  <p>Senator Sheahan asked about the Coroners Bill.  I will try to find a date for when the Bill will be on Committee Stage.  He also raised the need for a debate on road safety.  I will invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, to the House to address the matter.</p>  <p>Senators Cullinane, Paul Coghlan and others discussed a debt conference.  The Greek Government has stated that it does not intend to default on its loans, which is a major change from what we were led to believe was the situation.  Some commentators have got it wrong by stating that we should try to emulate Greece.  Our economies are fundamentally different.  We have an open and dynamic economy with a highly flexible and educated workforce and a high-tech export base.  Ireland has successfully exited the bailout and is firmly on the road to recovery without external conditional funding assistance.  I do not understand any argument that proposes to derail our recovery and plunge our country back into economic chaos.</p>  <p>As to the matter of a debt conference, there are already forums for discussing debt issues, namely, the Eurogroup and ECOFIN.  It was there that Ireland negotiated concessions to reduce our borrowing in the next decade by &euro;50 billion.  Without those concessions, we would have been unlikely to exit the bailout and restore growth to the economy.  Our government-to-debt ratio fell more quickly last year than did any other eurozone country's and is no longer viewed as being unsustainable by the markets.  We are still in the process of restructuring our bailout debts so as to make them even more affordable, having received unanimous European support for refinancing &euro;18 billion of our IMF loans at much lower interest rates, saving the taxpayer at least &euro;1.5 billion.</p>  <p>The option of applying for retrospective capitalisation of our core banks remains on the table but, as the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has made clear, we are also considering other options that might prove better for the Irish taxpayer and would not involve the transfer of ownership of our banking system to a bureaucracy in Luxembourg.  We have already committed to recovering all funding that this Government injected into our core banks.</p>  <p>Senator Gilroy called for a debate with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, regarding terrorism and, in particular, ISIS.  I will try to arrange for it.</p>  <p>Senator O'Donovan discussed the commission of inquiry, a matter that was raised last week and again yesterday.  It has been alleged that the terms of reference have changed since they were agreed.  I am not sure whether that is the situation, but we will investigate.  If the terms of reference have been changed as alleged, the Minister will attend the Seanad.  However, I do not propose to accept the amendment to the Order of Business.</p>  <p>Senator Keane stated that today was World Cancer Day and referred to the benefits of early detection.  It is right that we outline the successes in the treatment of cancer over the years and compliment everyone working in that field, including Senator Crown.</p></speech>

The successes in the treatment of cancer should be shouted out loud because people are fearful.  Treatment has a tremendous success rate.</p>  <p>Senator O'Donnell discussed the people's forum and Irish Water.  As she rightly pointed out, section 7 of the Water Services Act 2014 provides it as a function of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, to establish that forum.  The Department has met the CER to progress the forum's establishment.</p> <p>The Department is preparing regulations to set out details of the forum and the Minister will be providing the draft regulations to the Oireachtas joint committee for comment before finalising the composition and membership of the forum.  I hope that answers that question.</p> <p>Senators Brennan and Mullen raised the national broadcaster and the lack of accountability in RTE on how the licence fee is spent, and also the question of the large salaries some presenters receive of which the public will not be made aware for at least three years.  There is a question of accountability in that regard and I will bring that matter to the attention of the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised Seanad reform proposals.  That committee has met on several occasions and will continue to meet.  I have spoken to the Chairman of that committee.  When the report is complete, I will invite the Chairman to come in here and debate it with the Members of this House.  That will provide an opportunity for each and every Member to go through it, as it deserves.  I am sure it will be a comprehensive report.  I am thankful that the Chairman is willing to come into the House, if invited, to discuss that report with us.</p> <p>Senator Mooney stated that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is holding back &euro;1 million in lottery funding.  I will certainly inquire what the position is in that regard.  It is strange that &euro;1 million of such a budget would be held back and I am not quite sure what the reason is for that.</p> <p>Senator Healy Eames mentioned that she has written to the Minister regarding the accident and emergency department in Galway.  I am sure the Minister will reply to her in that regard.  Seeing that she has written to the Minister, there is nothing I can do to assist.  I am sure that he will give her the necessary reply.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised Seachtain na Gaeilge.  As in previous years, we will try to arrange some debates in the Irish language.  The Senator also called for a debate on the EU Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  I will ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to come in and see if we can have a debate on that before proposals are sent to Europe.</p></speech>

Last year, the Government allocated almost &euro;600 million to Official Development Assistance.  This represents a significant investment by Ireland in building a fairer, more peaceful and more sustainable world.</p> <p>This represents a significant investment by Ireland in building a fairer, more peaceful and more sustainable world.</p> <p>As a small island nation, our fate is inextricably linked with those of other nations and peoples.  We give aid because it is right to help those in need, but also because we understand that it is in our interest to live in a more equal and prosperous world.  According to a recent Europe-wide survey, this view is shared by the majority of Irish people, of whom almost nine out of ten believe that assisting developing countries is important, and more than two thirds are supportive of an increase in the aid budget.</p> <p>The past year has been marked by significant policy developments, including three seminal publications - the Irish Aid Framework for Action, the peer review of our aid programme by the OECD development assistance committee, DAC, and Ireland's foreign policy review, The Global Island.  The framework for action, which was launched in September, will guide policy and programming decisions on Ireland's aid programme between now and 2017.  The framework outlines the outcomes, actions, and institutional structures necessary to achieve the goals of our international development policy, One World, One Future.  These outcomes include areas that Ireland has worked on for decades, including tackling hunger and poverty and improving access to basic services such as health, education and social protection.  It also includes relatively new areas of work in our aid programme, such as addressing climate change, governance and human rights issues and integrating trade and inclusive economic growth.  Irish Aid's internal structures have been reorganised to align with the new framework, with new policy teams established on inclusive economic growth, hunger and resilience, governance and accountability and essential services.  Given time limitations, I do not propose to go into detail on the content of the framework, but I encourage all Senators to read the document, which is available on the Irish Aid website, because it is easily digestible and well thought through.</p> <p>The report of the OECD DAC peer review of Ireland's aid programme was published in December.  This is the most serious, wide-ranging and in-depth review of each country's aid programme done by peers in other government aid programmes.  Ireland's review was carried out by Austria and Portugal, with Lithuania as an observer.  The review gave a positive assessment of Ireland's aid programme, particularly the extent to which it is targeted at the poorest countries and reaches those who are most vulnerable.  It commended Ireland on grounding its policies in the needs and priorities of its partner countries and having a clear overall vision for development co-operation.  The review noted that Ireland plays a leadership role at a global level on its priority issues, particularly hunger and nutrition.  It also praises Ireland for responding rapidly and effectively to natural and other disasters.  The Ebola crisis in west Africa is a case in point.  The peer review provided valuable recommendations on several issues, including improving our whole-of-government approach to development and encouraging greater sharing of information on programmes and projects, both externally and internally.  Work is under way to address most of these recommendations, and officials in my Department will address the areas highlighted over the coming year.</p> <p>The third key policy document developed in 2014, and published only a few weeks ago, is Ireland's foreign policy review, The Global Island.  This considers the challenges and opportunities for Ireland in a new globalised world under five closely linked themes: our values, our people, our prosperity, our place in Europe, and our influence.  It sets out Ireland's support for a fairer, more just, more secure and more sustainable world, including through our development aid programme, our human rights and peacekeeping policies, and our engagement with global issues such as climate change.  The Global Island again reaffirms the centrality of the Irish Aid programme to our foreign policy, and recognises the aid programme as a vital tool in addressing the complex factors behind poverty, hunger and inequality.  We will continue to promote development as a key part of our values and our foreign policy.</p> <p>Last year, 2014, was also a year which presented massive humanitarian challenges.  The Ebola crisis and an unprecedented refugee crisis arising from conflict and natural disasters caused untold suffering and put a heavy strain on international humanitarian architecture.  Ireland played a strong role in the international response to the Ebola crisis through our embassy in Sierra Leone and our support to partners based in affected countries.  Almost 9,000 people have died from infection with the Ebola virus and more than 22,000 people are reported to have been infected.  Ireland provided funding of almost &euro;18 million in 2014 directly and to organisations working on the Ebola response in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are both partner countries for Ireland.  The funding supported Ebola treatment facilities, community awareness raising, contact tracing and child nutrition programmes.  Ireland also dispatched 42 tonnes of essential household items as part of our rapid response initiative, to be distributed to affected communities.  These included blankets, tents, mosquito nets, soap and water tanks.</p> <p>I travelled to Sierra Leone in October last year and witnessed the difference being made by the work of our embassy staff and Irish Aid's support to our partner organisations on the ground.  I met Irish aid workers in organisations such as Goal and Concern, as well as the Sierra Leone Government and UN partners.  While the challenges were overwhelming, I was hugely impressed with the dedication of those working to alleviate the crisis, and with the effectiveness of our response.  I pay particular tribute to our key personnel on the ground, including our ambassador, Ms Sinead Walsh, and her team, and acknowledge the influential role she has had in ensuring an adequate and proactive international response to the crisis.  There appears to have been a welcome slowdown in infection rates in recent weeks, though there are fluctuations from country to country.  It is critical, however, that we are not complacent as an international community.  Ireland will continue to support the response to the Ebola crisis and its secondary impacts on communities in 2015.</p> <p>The ongoing conflict in Syria and the region has created a deeply troubling humanitarian crisis.  More than 200,000 people have died, with 12.2 million people in need of immediate life-saving support within Syria.  Due to the violence and the lack of access to aid, 3.8 million people have left Syria for neighbouring countries.  Many of those in need of humanitarian assistance are beyond reach, with both the Syrian Government and rebel factions using siege tactics and heavy weaponry in populated areas.  The targeting of humanitarian workers by Islamic State also prevents millions from receiving the help they desperately need.  The UN has responded by delivering cross-border aid, even where the Assad regime has withheld permission.</p> <p>Since 2011, Ireland has provided nearly &euro;29 million in humanitarian support, delivered through UN partners, the Red Cross and Irish NGOs.  Ireland's support has been focused on supporting people displaced within Syria and those across the wider region.  In December 2014, the UN released its 2015 Syria Crisis appeal plans, requesting more than $8.4 billion to meet the needs of 18 million people in Syria and across the region.  We are considering how Ireland can best respond to the need for additional assistance in 2015.</p> <p>Ireland is also continuing to respond to acute crises in South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Iraq, which have witnessed displacements of huge numbers of people due to ongoing violence.  Most recently, we have mobilised emergency supplies to respond to the devastating floods in Malawi, as part of our rapid response initiative and in co-ordination with our embassy in Lilongwe.</p> <p>If the past year was filled with important milestones for Irish aid policy and programming, 2015 promises to see key milestones in the global development agenda.  With agreements expected on a set of sustainable development goals and an intergovernmental climate change deal, this year has been compared to 1945 in terms of its importance to world development.</p> <p>The sustainable development goals will be a set of universally applicable goals and targets negotiated and agreed by the world's 193 countries.  They are aimed at eradicating poverty, addressing environmental degradation and climate change as well as building a more peaceful, fair and sustainable world.  The goals will cover such diverse areas as agriculture, education, gender equality, health, justice, employment and environmental degradation.  This has never been attempted before and will be a huge achievement for humanity if successful.  This year, 2015, will also see agreement on how to finance these goals at the financing for development conference in Ethiopia in July.</p> <p>Ireland is privileged to be at the heart of the sustainable development goal process following our appointment as co-facilitators with Kenya of the inter-governmental negotiations to agree the goals.  Our appointment is testament to the reputation of Ireland's aid programme, Irish Aid, our proud record of promoting human rights and our participation in peacekeeping right across the globe.  This final phase of negotiations officially began on 19 January and will culminate in a summit of world leaders in September 2015.  </p> <p>Agreement on a legally binding climate change treaty will be another critical achievement.  Climate change has already negatively affected the lives of millions of people in the world, from small farmers in Africa to those in the small island states of the Pacific.  If we fail to act quickly and radically, we are on course to make our own planet uninhabitable for vast numbers of people.  That may sound verbose but that is the scenario we are facing.  Indeed, recent weather patterns are testament to that fact.  </p> <p>I am proud that Ireland is playing such a key role in establishing this new global agenda and I look forward to ensuring that we contribute to a new era of global development where poverty and hunger are consigned to history.  I thank the Acting Chairman and Members for the opportunity to address the Seanad this afternoon.  I am grateful for the opportunity to outline the work we have done in the past year and to highlight some of the important upcoming issues for this year.  I look forward to our discussion and any feedback or questions Senators may have.</p></speech>

Molaim an Roinn Gnotha&iacute; Eachtracha agus Tr&aacute;d&aacute;la as ucht an m&eacute;id at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an Roinn chun feabhas a chur ar shaolta daoine in &aacute;iteanna &aacute;irithe ar fud an domhain.</p>  <p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his submission.  Undoubtedly, there is a great commitment not only from the State, but also from Irish people, who have been very generous, to contributing aid for catastrophes, natural and otherwise, across the globe.  Our generosity in that regard is recognised.  There is a great deal of public support for ensuring that Ireland continues to play a positive role in this regard.  It is a tribute to the people that even in the economic crisis, when so many are economically challenged and suffering a lot of distress in their own lives, they still continue to support Irish Aid and want the Government to continue to do so too.  In that regard, we must recognise that we have been falling down.  In 2008, we were contributing 0.59% of our GNP and were well on our way to reaching the target of 0.7%, as committed to by many governments on many occasions.  I regret the fact that we have now fallen back to 0.43% which indicates that we are going in the wrong direction.  There is some criticism due to the Minister of State and the Government in this regard.  A central plank of the Labour Party's manifesto and the programme for Government was to increase our overseas aid in order to achieve the 0.7% target.  </p>  <p>An issue has arisen in recent years whereby money directed through governments in Africa, and one government in particular, was misappropriated.  I know that many efforts were made to recover that money and as far as I know, the situation has now been corrected.  However, as a matter of principle, we should be very careful to ensure that we only support governments which have good democratic, accountable and transparent systems in place.  The whole purpose of this is to ensure that hard-earned taxpayer's money is directed and focused on those most in need.  That money should be focused on tackling poverty, hunger and other health and deprivation issues.  In particular, it should target children who suffer most.  </p>  <p>The Minister of State mentioned the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone and other countries of west Africa.  I commend all of those who have volunteered to help and those who are working on behalf of the State in dispensing public moneys in order to address this very serious health issue in those countries.   Indeed, it could become a global health issue.  Aid workers are very courageous in what they are doing there and I am glad to note that Irish people are to the forefront in that regard.  </p>  <p>The Minister of State also made reference to the conflict in the Middle East.  What is happening there at present is abhorrent and almost beyond comprehension.  The Muslim world, and Arab countries in particular, are facing serious challenges.  The conflict and the displacement and consequent suffering of people in the region is unconscionable, particularly given that the region is awash with money.  Qatar and Saudi Arabia, for example, are extremely wealthy countries.  I was surprised at the number of tributes paid to the former King of Saudi Arabia on his death, particularly in the context of where some Saudi Arabian money has been directed.  It has, in fact, contributed to increasing conflict in the region and elsewhere.  Unless politicians and states in the UN who perform at a global level are prepared to call it as it is, rather than looking to their own selfish, strategic interests, this will go on unabated and unchecked to the detriment of the lives of so many.  </p>  <p>I have seen some of the refugee camps which have emerged as a result of the crisis in Syria.  The Minister of State mentioned that 3.8 million people have left that country since the conflict began, with many more millions displaced internally.  These are people who would have had a reasonably good lifestyle.  Syrian people are hardworking and entrepreneurial and to see them now confined to refugee camps, where they and their children have no future to look forward to, is a sad reflection on the manner in which we function globally, politically, and economically.  </p>  <p>I have also been to Palestinian refugee camps and met Palestinians who have been living there for years.  Some of those camps have been in existence since 1948 which is shocking when one thinks of the wealth of the Western world.  There has been a failure of political leadership and a lot of it is down to the failure of Israel to deal with the Palestinian issue.  Palestinian people, for generations, have experienced nothing better than just existing in refugee camps with no hope of any future.</p> <p>In that context it would be wrong not to refer to the Iraqi and Syrian areas occupied by what is euphemistically called the ISIS state, where some of the most heinous crimes are being committed and where an inhuman regime is operating.  I and other Members condemn the manner in which the Jordanian soldier was killed after his capture.  The Geneva Convention sets down a clear framework for dealing with prisoners of war.  It is totally unacceptable that such a thing would happen.</p> <p>I wish to make a concluding point, if the Chair will allow me.  The Minister mentioned climate change in passing.  Climate change should be a huge priority for Ireland and other countries that have a standard of living to which other countries can only aspire.  Climate change is having a particular effect on those who are living in the greatest hardship in various parts of the world.  I and members of the foreign affairs committee visited the Philippines recently and toured some areas there.  I commend the work being done by Irish Aid and the various NGOs.  We were with Plan Ireland, Concern and GOAL.  Tr&oacute;caire does tremendous work as well, although not specifically in that area but elsewhere.  It was most impressive to see what they were doing in terms of the sustainable development of aid.  They were training people to be carpenters and business people in order that they can not only repair the houses that were damaged in the tsunami but also provide a basis for the future from which they can rebuild when the aid is removed.  However, we were told that the Philippines will have tremendous exposure to climate change.  Many of the islands and much of the land mass of the Philippines might well be submerged by the sea if climate change is not tackled in a concentrated manner.</p> <p>I wish the Minister well in his efforts and commend him on his work.  However, we must intensify that work and ensure our colleagues in the EU follow suit.</p></speech>

He has a particularly challenging role and he has been making significant progress since he took office.<br/><br/>It is timely to have this debate as it is more than 40 years since the establishment of Ireland's official development assistance.  Ireland and the Irish people had engaged with Africa and other developing parts of the world for many years before that, particularly through the many missionaries who travelled from this country and worked among the poorest people in the world.  It was a man who started his political career in this House, the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, led the establishment of the aid programme when Ireland became a member of the European Union.<br/><br/>Today, Irish Aid is the Government's aid programme, which is managed on behalf of the Irish people by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is designed to reduce poverty and hunger, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.  Irish Aid is a key part of Ireland's foreign policy, as recognised in the recent policy review, The Global Island.  The aid programme supports long-term development and provides humanitarian assistance in more than  80 countries, with a particular focus on eight key partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa and one in Asia.<br/><br/>One of the partner countries is Malawi, which is currently experiencing severe floods.  I welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, that in excess of &euro;500,000 worth of supplies are being airlifted into the region for distribution by Irish Aid partners, Concern, GOAL, Tr&oacute;caire and the Evangelical Association of Malawi, to help displaced families in the worst affected districts in the southern region of Malawi.  More than 630,000 people are affected, which is a staggering figure.  There are huge risks of disease due to poor sanitation.  Bilateral overseas development aid to Malawi from Ireland amounted to &euro;14 million in 2014, with an additional &euro;6 million channelled through Irish NGOs, missionaries and other Irish agencies.<br/><br/>Irish Aid's contribution in respect of the Ebola crisis has been mentioned.  The disease has taken the lives of 9,000 people.  A sum of &euro;18 million has been contributed.<br/><br/>The conflict in Syria was mentioned by Senator Walsh.  The conflict has seen 200,000 people lose their lives and 12.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.  Irish Aid has contributed &euro;29 million.  We probably should have a wider discussion on our involvement and assistance in the Syrian situation.  The number of displaced people is truly frightening.  Should we do more in lieu of assistance, possibly by giving homes and assistance here to additional numbers of refugees from Syria?  Perhaps the Minister of State would comment on that.<br/><br/>The key focus of the Irish Aid programme in Malawi and other partner countries is strengthening the vulnerable communities' resilience to the effects of climate change and other shocks, improving the livelihood of the poorest communities, and improving food and nutrition security.  The Irish Aid programme is guided by Ireland's international development policy, One World, One Future, which was published in 2013 and a detailed implementation plan, Framework for Action, which was published in 2014.  The new policy confirms our commitment to achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid when the economic circumstances permit.  I share the concerns expressed by Senator Walsh about the cut in overseas development aid since 2008.  However, in the past two years the Government has managed to stabilise the figure and hopefully it will increase.  The 2015 allocation will be &euro;600 million.  The cut since 2008, at 30%, has been quite severe, but the allocation has been stabilised and we hope to see the cut gradually reversed.<br/><br/>Even during the worst of the recession the Irish people strongly supported the work of Irish Aid and wished to help those who are less fortunate.  One of the reasons is the reputation of the Irish Aid programme.  The Minister referred to the recent peer review, the four yearly examination of Irish development assistance policies.  Erik Solheim, the chair of the OECD development assistance committee, commented on the Irish Aid programme and said that Ireland sets an example in focusing development aid on the neediest countries.  He said:<blockquote>Irish development assistance has contributed to the enormous development success of the past couple of decades.  Extreme poverty has been halved in one generation.  The likelihood of a child dying before the age of five has been halved, saving 17,000 children every day.  More than 170 million people, almost 40 times the population of Ireland, are no longer living with chronic hunger. ... Ireland is a world leader in foreign aid to countries most in need.  Global development assistance reached a record high of &euro;135 billion last year, but many countries are giving a decreasing share to the least developed countries.</blockquote>Many countries that are much wealthier than ours have reneged on some of the commitments they made over the years.  Mr. Solheim said that Ireland's contribution was among the highest in the world and is well above the UN target.<br/><br/>As the Minister said, 2015 will be a critical year in the fight against extreme poverty and hunger.</p> <p>We have less than 12 months left to maximise the progress that was made under the Millennium Development Goals and to put in place a new framework for international development.  This new framework must reflect a significant shift to sustainable development that has clear and ambitious targets that can end extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition in a single generation.  This initiative will entail great responsibilities and actions for all countries.  There will be major challenges in areas such as energy, food, water, climate, conflict resolution and effective governance.  Climate change must be at the top of the agenda.  </p> <p>Recently Tr&oacute;caire brought to our attention a report entitled Feeling the Heat: How Climate Change is Driving Extreme Weather in the Developing World.  The report was developed by the department of geography, NUI Maynooth, and drew on 150 publications on recent research.  The report shows how climate change is likely to unfold in some of the most vulnerable countries in the world.  Climate change is the greatest injustice of our time and the people who do the least to cause it suffer the most.</p> <p>The Minister of State referred to the legally binding international agreement on climate change that will be sought at the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Negotiations to be held in Paris in December.  As he stated, Ireland has a key role to play in achieving agreement on the new sustainable development goals as last month the President of the UN General Assembly appointed Ireland and Kenya to co-facilitate the final major international negotiations at the United Nations over the coming year.  The appointment is a great honour for Ireland but it also brings huge responsibilities.  The challenge for the co-facilitators will be to build a consensus among the 193 member states, on a very broad and comprehensive agenda, to be adopted at a major summit of world leaders to be held in New York in September.  We have to succeed because the lives of the world's poorest and most deprived depends on us to convince others that those who are better off must provide resources to help those in the developing work.  </p> <p>I shall finish by wishing the Minister of State continued success and thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence.  </p></speech>

I thank him for his opening statements on the Government's policy on overseas development aid.</p>  <p>There has been a lot of criticism levelled at the Government for failing to achieve 0.7% GDP by 2015 which was a stated target in the programme for Government.  I am a little bit on shaky ground here because I must admit that up to 2007 I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.  Therefore, I was more informed and contributed to a lot of debates on overseas development aid.  If I am right, when the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, addressed the United Nations in 2000, as part of the Millennium Development Goals, he committed the then Government to achieving the 0.7% GDP at that early stage.  However, throughout the Celtic tiger years we never achieved the target although we got very close and then the crash happened.  There was a great deal of debate around the early part of 2007, and even some suggestion that we should reduce the percentage again.  Please correct me if I am wrong to say that Governments play ping pong with ODA and the rate comes and goes depending on prevailing winds.  Since 2008 the percentage has decreased and it has now reached 0.43%.  I do not doubt the bona fides of the Government or the Minister of State's Department that they have tried to get a greater share of the pot.  </p>  <p>The Minister of State made the point that nine out of ten Irish people believe "assisting developing countries is important, and over two thirds are supportive of an increase in the aid budget."  Even with that there are still dissenting voices in this country but that is nothing new.  I can remember way back there was a selfish view that we should look after our own people first.  In fact, it is not an either-or situation.</p>  <p>The Minister of State is right that the Government, like previous Governments, is committed to the overall concept of providing overseas development aid.  However,  I am curious about some of the changes included in the policy entitled One World, One Future.  He said that the aid programme will now address "climate change, governance and human rights issues and integrating trade and inclusive economic growth."  I am rather interested in this development because for a long time the Irish Government was criticised for not addressing or equating human rights issues with overseas development aid.  We seem to have adopted a charitable approach that is based on giving aid to six target countries in Africa.  Perhaps the list has been changed since. </p></speech>

There is a view that we should just give the money but ensure it is spent on internal economic projects that will lift people out of relative poverty.  However, other countries that provide overseas development aid linked it to trade, a matter on which a great deal of discussion took place.  Is that the current policy of governments?  Do they now link trade to overseas development aid?  I am not sure whether the Minister of State will have time to return to the issue of integrating trade and inclusive economic growth with overseas development aid.  I ask him to reassure the House that he is satisfied that the money that goes to target countries is spent wisely.  There was a great deal of controversy about Uganda some years ago that created enormous problems for everybody but the Government concerned came out of that rather well.  Are modalities in place to ensure that nothing of that nature can recur and that the money is spent wisely?</p>  <p>This debate has afforded us an opportunity to applaud the Government on its continuing policy for overseas development aid.  We have also had an opportunity to encourage it, even in the economic circumstances that prevail, to increase the amount and, hopefully, reach 0.7% of GDP.  I ask the Minister of State to provide the current figures.  Despite the fact that we have not reached 0.7% of GDP, Ireland is still among one of the highest contributors in Europe, as far as I am aware.  Perhaps our rank has changed somewhat over the past couple of years.  Some years ago we were one of the highest contributors among so-called more affluent countries than Ireland.

This is my first opportunity to address him since he was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I commend him on all the work that he has done and on all the great announcements to provide help to those less fortunate in the world.</p>  <p>Given how integral the year 2015 will be for international development, I welcome today's debate as do all of my colleagues here.  In the coming months, the Millennium Development Goals will be replaced by the sustainable development goals.  They will be universally applicable and will cover a range of issues, including climate change, gender equality and human rights.  </p>  <p>It is a sad fact that in many parts of the world people continue to suffer due to a lack of basic infrastructure, shelter and economic and social stability.  As long as this situation endures it is the responsibility of every other first world nation, who can do so, to provide the funding and support so necessary for development.</p>  <p>Ireland's commitment to overseas development is long-standing and the Irish people are renowned for their generosity, a fact that we, as a nation, should be immensely proud.  This awareness has often been laid at the feet of Ireland's history which was shaped so profoundly by the Famine.  This point was reflected in a 2014 Eurobarometer survey which found that 68% of the Irish people spoken to, from a sample size of 1,037, thought that developed countries like ours should allocate more money to overseas aid. </p> <p>This figure is up 12 percentage points on the same survey conducted last year, which suggests that while we as a nation slowly begin to recover and return to economic growth, we are also aware of our duty to those much less fortunate than ourselves.  This says something truly wonderful about the Irish spirit.  During austerity, Ireland's overseas aid budget fell, which is regrettable but unsurprising, given the colossal financial burden the country faced.  However, while accepting this drop in funding, it is important to put Ireland's performance into context.  Despite the hardship we faced and despite not meeting the 0.7% UN development target in 2012, according to the OECD, we did better than many European countries in protecting our aid budget during the financial crisis.  No country will beat us up over not meeting that target because it was a substantial achievement to be able to continue with the level of funding that existed for aid to Third World countries.</p> <p>An OECD review into Ireland's aid spending released in December 2014 stated that the country had punched above its weight on global development issues and had a talent for building networks and alliances to support development.  While the OECD report highlights the ground lost which we must strive to make up, it also shows that Ireland's commitment to overseas development remains as firm as ever.</p> <p>Ireland's track record on development aid speaks to the nation's awareness of its role and responsibilities as part of a global community based on the shared values of humanity.  The OECD report describes how Ireland is considered by its international partners as a trusted colleague.  It also notes how our overseas development aid is disseminated through structured targeting which ensures that these precious funds do not fall into corrupt hands and that they go directly to the people who so desperately need them.</p> <p>As part of an Oireachtas delegation some years ago, I went to Ethiopia.  I saw at first hand the significant work that is being done by Irish Aid and the then ambassador in Ethiopia, Ms Sheila Maguire, and the way the funds trickled down to the projects that needed it so badly.  There are a number of projects that stand out in my mind - the GOAL street children's project and women in self-employment, WISE, both of which are based in Addis Ababa.  It is having a major effect.  The Irish NGOs and charities involved in the sector are doing excellent work and deserve to be commended.  I take the opportunity to highlight their efforts today and to offer my fullest support.</p> <p>The Government has allocated over &euro;600 million for overseas development aid in 2015.  In November last, the Department committed more than &euro;4 million in funding in response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa.  Recently, the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, announced an additional &euro;3 million in funding for vaccines for children dying from preventable diseases, raising the Irish Aid overseas development budget by 20% on last year's spending.  This is a fantastic achievement and a welcome development.  We have yet to return to the level of contribution to overseas development aid that existed before the financial collapse, but we are on track.  We must acknowledge that it is heading in the right direction.  I would certainly echo the calls of Erik Solheim from the OECD for the Government to look at how it might match the figure in future.  In light of the creation of the new sustainable development goals which will be set later this year, I urge the Government to strive to meet the targets as soon as finances allow us to.</p> <p>I take the opportunity, as I did at the outset, to commend the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, on their tireless work on this issue.  What they have achieved is remarkable.</p> <p>I already commended a number of people who have been working in NGOs throughout Africa.  In particular, one man, Alan Kerins, who was actually in school with me, and his project stand out in my mind.  Indeed, so does Ronan Scully of Self Help Africa.  Recently, I and the Minister of State attended an event in that regard.  They need to be commended on the work they have carried out in Africa making life better for those who are struggling there.</p> <p>As Seanad spokesperson for the Labour Party on Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am certainly proud of Ireland's commitment to overseas development, but I also realise that there remains more to be done.  As mentioned, 2015 will be a pivotal year for international aid within the global community.  Countries must come together to formulate new strategies and targets.</p> <p>I am proud to say that Ireland is playing a central role, through the Minister of State, in the process to agree the sustainable development goals following our appointment, by the President of the United Nations General Assembly, as co-facilitator with Kenya of the intergovernmental negotiations.  The appointment is testament to the strong reputation of our aid programme and Ireland's long-standing tradition of promoting human rights and participating in peacekeeping missions.</p> <p>Given Ireland's past, we as a nation remain acutely aware of our responsibilities, and I sincerely hope we can reach the targets outlined by the OECD and the global community.  We should be proud of our standing in the international community and just as proud of the incredible work done by our aid organisations, such as that of Mr. Kerins, Mr. Scully with Self Help Africa, and GOAL.  It is my expectation that our overseas development aid programmes will continue to grow and to save and change lives around the world.</p></speech>

He is a decent, hardworking, intelligent, good-hearted man and a principled politician, and that is exactly what we need in this area.</p>  <p>I received background notes from the office of the Leader of the House, all of which were good and positive, and we take them as read.  However, I am concerned that the background note states that the Irish Aid programme is guided by Ireland's international development policy, One World, One Future, which was published in 2013.  It identifies three overarching goals of the aid programme: one, reduced hunger and increased resilience; two, sustainable development and inclusive economic growth; and three, better governance, human rights and accountability.  It is on the third one that I will concentrate.</p>  <p>There should be clear monitoring - there is some - of the human rights conditions in each of the countries to which we give aid.  There also should be monitoring of the levels of corruption.  Every country has corruption to one degree or another.  Even the Vatican is subject to this vagary of human nature, and this country is not immune from it.  However, the distortions caused by corruption - particularly, for example, in the African continent - are quite staggering.</p>  <p>We should look, for example, at the policies on population.  This is a matter of great concern to me.  The population of the planet has trebled since I was born.  That should cause anybody anxiety.  I go every year to the release of the United Nations report on population, and it never mentions population.  Never once in the years I have been going has it mentioned population.  It talks about female genital mutilation, education and civilian casualties in times of war, and I throw myself on the ground, foaming at the mouth and asking, "What about population?".  It is one of the most critical areas.  Obviously, we cannot intervene.  We cannot tell people what to do.  There is a process of education on such matters as the accessibility of condoms and birth control.  That is one aspect I would ask to be looked at.</p>  <p>The other matter is this.  Immediately after I finish speaking here, I am off to a meeting with the Nigerian ambassador, where I will raise questions about the vicious anti-gay laws in Nigeria, the way they are prosecuted and the fact that these people slavishly accept British imperial legislation in the area.  They enforce such legislation at the behest of evangelical American churches which are doing immense damage there.  Recently, I received reports of the conditions for unfortunate people who are gay and who live in these circumstances.  One phrase that stuck out was that living in Nigeria now, since the passage of the anti-gay Bill, is hell on earth by virtue of something over which one has no control.  If that was merely a moral or cultural issue, then one could say, "Butt out, Europe and the West.  We are not interested in your view.  This is our culture," but they are fighting AIDS.  They have a tremendous incidence of AIDS.  The one way to spread AIDS is to clamp down on homosexual people and homosexual activity.  This is guaranteed to lead to a time-bomb situation.  The UN, the World Health Organization and various groups have tried to point this out but, for political reasons, President Goodluck Jonathan signed this legislation into being, and it is disastrous.</p> <p>Why should we spend Irish taxpayers' money on fighting AIDS when the Nigerian Government is doing everything in its power to frustrate these programmes and, coincidently, to increase the incidence of AIDS in these countries?</p> <p>I would say "Well done" in regard to much of the work.  The failure to move towards the development aid target of 0.7% of GDP is dreadful, and I expect that in his heart the Minister of State agrees with me.  It was shameful that we withdrew from it, because, being a percentage value, the overall amount shrank as the economy shrank.  I know the Minister of State is trying to get back on track, but it was awful that we were derailed and, as a result, passed out by other European countries when we were among the leaders.  I really regret this.  The fact it was expressed as a percentage took care of the economic circumstances.  It meant that as the financial situation here declined we would have contributed proportionately less.  We should have been able to do so.  We should have been able to stick at 0.7%, because this figure would have reflected the continuing financial situation in the country.  Abandoning the target of 0.7% was abandoning a crucial principle.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;600 million will be spent in 2015.  In recent years we have had very good value for money for this expenditure, and we will continue to do so because the money allocated is very carefully managed and delivers very good results.  The key areas where Ireland makes a huge contribution are education, health care and the development of agriculture in the particular countries where we contribute and provide financial assistance.</p>  <p>I have visited a number of areas, including in Kenya, Chad and Gaza, and I am very concerned about how little progress has been made.  I was in Chad in March 2008 and visited Goz Be&iuml;da and Am Bache.  The rainy season there is in June, and between March and June 56,000 tonnes of food had to be brought in to feed 500,000 people for four months.  The nearest port is 2,500 km away and the choice was to bring the food through Sudan to the east, Cameroon to the west or Libya to the north.  This is the type of challenge faced by aid agencies and the UN in trying to meet demands, which sometimes we do not see.  More than 500,000 people were in the refugee and internally displaced camps at that stage in 2008 and very little has changed in the area since then.</p>  <p>What frightens me is how little progress is being made in the control of arms and ammunition in the area, because if these were controlled many other issues would also be controlled.  This is where the international community is falling down.  We are not taking any action against the countries selling to the various interest groups.  The arms trade throughout the world generates huge profits for a very small number of people, but a huge number of people suffer as a result.  We should begin to examine this.  Should we, at international level, clearly identify to countries that while we make a contribution to help countries to develop educational, health and agricultural systems, this progress is being restricted by other countries which contribute arms to these areas?  When I was in Chad we filmed 17 hours of footage and condensed it to 15 minutes, which I use in schools.  Everyone there carries a gun or a machine gun.  When I was there more than 10,000 young people under 18 carried machine guns.  This creates restrictions and causes problems for aid agencies.  When I was there, 85 four-wheel-drive vehicles had been confiscated from aid agencies by armed rebels.  The aid agencies must work to ensure they do not get into conflict.</p>  <p>The enormous contribution of Irish aid workers clearly stands out.  The contribution of the Irish Army is also interesting.  A report to the European Parliament stated that the Irish troops contributed more in Chad in six months than the French Army, with no disrespect to it, had contributed over the previous 20 years.  The Irish Army's approach was to get people working together as opposed to a confrontational approach.</p>  <p>At all times we must keep in mind that when we give support to the various aid agencies and groups we should ensure the moneys are properly spent and that we get value for money.  It is also important that we consider any structures which are already in place.  Rather than developing new structures and providing funding for new agencies to go to an area, we should try to work with existing structures.  The reason I have information about Kenya - I must be careful when I speak about the country, as other Members of the Oireachtas have got into difficulty on the issue - is that a member of my family works there.  She is working in a school with only 18 teachers for 1,340 students, which means a pupil-teacher ratio of 1:70.  To place a teacher there for an entire year would cost only &euro;1,200.  I have suggested that companies should come on board and, rather than giving money to an aid agency, sponsor a teacher, a nurse or someone who can develop agriculture in an area, so there would be a direct link to the money.  We should begin to develop this.</p>  <p>I thank the Minister of State for the work he is doing, and long may it continue.  I also thank all of the aid agencies and the officials at the Department for the wonderful work they do.</p></speech>

Irish Aid, which has long been a central pillar of our foreign policy, retains wide cross-party support.  As a post-colonial State which has faced serious food security issues, an Gorta M&oacute;r, poverty and underdevelopment, we are uniquely placed in Western Europe to provide an overseas aid programme based on solidarity.</p>  <p>Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the fact that overseas development aid funding was not cut in the budget for 2015 as it had been in previous years.  As many other Senators have mentioned, the target expenditure of 0.7% of GNP on overseas development assistance by 2015 will not be reached.  It has been stated that the commitment still remains, but no roadmap or timeframe has been produced to show how and when the figure will be reached.  In the interest of accountability and transparency, will the Department outline how and when it intends to reach the target?</p>  <p>The recent OECD Development Assistance Committee peer review of Ireland's overseas development aid singled out Ireland for its efforts on tackling hunger and food insecurity, and overall the review was positive.  It is clear that Irish Aid continues to be one of the best aid programmes in the world.  I pass on my congratulations and gratitude to all those who work in the programme, and to Irish NGO workers, who are fantastic ambassadors for the country.</p> <p>However, Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned about an increased focus on multilateral assistance over bilateral assistance, a blurring of aid and trade and the Government's commitment to its whole-of-government approach to overseas development aid, ODA.  The bilateral element of our ODA is a cornerstone of Irish Aid and our partner countries like to work with Ireland because of our fair and critical partner approach.  The latest budget made a &euro;10.05 million cut to bilateral assistance spending and an increase of &euro;8.85 million to multilateral assistance spending.  We must work with like-minded donor countries to improve aid and develop accountability and transparency.  We must ensure that there are better donor-recipient relationships.  Many countries share this goal with us, but others do not and many continue to use tied aid and export military products.</p> <p>Further emphasis on multilateral spending has the potential to reduce accountability and transparency.  For example, trade has fallen under the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  In some regards, we are concerned by the possible influence this could have on ODA.  Everyone agrees that increased trade is important for development, but it must be fair and mutually beneficial.  Ireland should not use its aid programme to secure trade deals that may be seen to be overly favourable to Irish firms instead of doing what is best for the countries involved.</p></speech>

I am happy to address it in my reply and I am aware that the Senator only has five minutes, but we do not tie our aid.  We have an Africa strategy as well as the Africa Ireland Economic Forum.  I would be happy to address the Senator's points but, for the record, we do not use our Irish Aid budget for trade promotion.</p></speech>

The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015, which will be laid before the D&aacute;il next week, is not far-reaching enough and fails to address some of the key issues, given the dangers of climate change.  For example, it fails to set binding emission reduction targets, ensures that the body tasked with giving advice to the Government on climate change matters will not be independent and does not contain provisions on climate justice.  It runs counter to some of our ODA efforts and shows up a number of issues in the whole-of-government approach to development aid.  I call on the Minister of State to ensure that policy coherence in development aid becomes a Government priority.</p>  <p>I look forward to the Minister of State's response and congratulate him on his work that he, his Department and the Irish workers and NGOs have done in this regard.</p></speech>

Even in difficult times, we have not cut our budget, which shows where our priorities lie.  When Ireland was suffering, we liked receiving external help.  Under budget 2015, there has been no reduction in the overall level of ODA.  More than &euro;600 million was allocated for ODA and we have been recognised for the successful stabilisation of our development budget in the past three years after severe cuts in the face of serious economic difficulties.  Maintaining the budget by providing &euro;601 million to Ireland's aid programme will be seen as a significant contribution.  We would love to do more.  In light of the last budget, there has been some improvement in our country, but we have never been found lacking when it comes to ODA.  The European Commission's January Eurobarometer report found that support for increasing aid had grown in Ireland by 12% since 2013, which is to be commended and is encouraging.</p>  <p>As has been mentioned, countries in Africa are suffering significantly from drought and climate change.  I am sure that the Minister of State is well aware of the report by Maynooth University's department of geography, entitled Feeling the Heat: How Climate Change is Driving Extreme Weather in the Developing World.  I commend the Government.  People have been discussing a climate change Bill for a long time, but it is only now coming to fruition.  The Oireachtas committee of which I am a member has made a good recommendation on the report.  I do not know whether the Minister of State will also make a submission, but people in the developing world are struggling to survive in the face of drought and storms.  Families can no longer plan for the hungry season because it is changing.  Many reports, particularly the one by Maynooth, have called this a silent emergency.  It is up to us as legislators to break the silence.  It is not a problem that we can solve on our own, but we must do our bit and ensure that the emergency can be tackled globally.  By making the emergency a loud one, we can tackle the injustice of climate change together.</p>  <p>We are always referring to sustainable development and planning.  As mentioned in the Oireachtas environment committee's report, sustainable development is an issue for transport, agriculture and so on.  Our country has been discussing clean energy.  Loud voices have been raised against it.  I noted a report that the reporter, Mr. Jody Corcoran, wrote in January.  He visited Mount Lucas in County Offaly to evaluate its wind turbines, which were 150 m tall.  He stated that he could not hear a sound from the wind farm and that there was more noise from the cars on the motorway.  I am raising this point in the context of climate change and sustainable energy.  He claimed that wind turbines were "rather like a team of elegant ladies dancing at dusk".</p>  <p>We should think of people in Third World countries.  My sister has just returned from providing voluntary services overseas.  She is a secondary school teacher who volunteered overseas for a year.  With Mr. Dermot Divilly, my brother set up Support Africa, an Irish-registered foundation, in 2006.  It is working overseas.  The Minister of State met my brother in Addis Ababa.  I commend my sister and brother.  Here I am as a legislator who I hope can do her bit from afar to support people in all developing countries.  In Support Africa's case, 100% of the money it raises goes straight to the country.  No money is taken out for administration.  Every organisation must have administration funds and the Minister of State is always evaluating what percentage of every organisation's funds is spent on administration and what percentage goes to the country in question.  This is an important subject.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/979" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400022#Z00500"><p>I thank all of the Senators for their contributions.  I will start with ODA and percentage targets.  As I understand it, the targets were set in 1973.  Since then, there has not been a Government that has reached them.  The highest point was reached in 2008 when we hit approximately 0.59%, or a monetary figure of &euro;920.6 million.  I regard this as an apolitical space because, throughout successive Governments, every political party and Independent in the Houses has acknowledged the need to ensure that, in the first instance, we recognise how official development assistance plays a key role in our foreign policy and impacts on the poorest countries.  While there has been a 30% decrease in ODA since 2008 across a number of political mandates, there is a recognition that, in the past two years, we have tried to stabilise it.</p> <p>We did stabilise it last year, and increased it.  While a point was raised about a decrease in some of the bilateral funding and an increase in multilateral funding, the fact remains that, through our multilateral arrangements and relationships with the World Food Programme or the UN agencies, it still continues to create the necessary impact.  The tyres are kicked on this policy by virtue of the DAC or the OECD report which gave us a clean bill of health.</p> <p>There is one further point on the ODA as a percentage of GNP figures.  Ireland is ranked ninth of OECD countries and seventh of EU countries.  The countries ahead of us in the OECD list of countries include Norway.  Its figure is 1.07.  Norway, Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark and the UK are ahead of us in the sense that they have reached or surpassed the target.  However, we are ninth in the rankings.  The Netherlands, Finland and Switzerland are ahead of us but have not have reached the target and they are comparatively rich countries.  We are, therefore, by any objective standard, doing quite well in terms of seeking to reach the target.  However, we have not taken our eye off the ball.  It has to be remembered that the target was set and successive Ministers, across the political spectrum, have reinforced the commitment to it.  It is in the programme for Government, but what we have sought to do in the programme for Government is increase our level of assistance in monetary terms.  However, we are not going to hit the 0.7% target.  This is clear.  Furthermore, the next Government, whatever its make-up in terms of party politics, will also not hit the 0.7% target.  However, we must continue to try to stabilise the monetary element of it and increase it if we can.  It would be necessary to pay out more than &euro;1 billion in the current year if we were to hit the 0.7% target.  This is not attainable given other demands on education and health services and so on.</p> <p>On compliance and governance issues in respect of how we dispense the funding, the Ugandan experience was mentioned.  We met the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade last week as part of the Estimates process.  I had outlined previously at that committee that we are very satisfied that all of the checks and balances are in place on how our funding is dispersed.  Although we have a bilateral relationship with Uganda, there has been a reduction in the amount of funding we have given to it.  We are currently reviewing the programme.  Since that event took place, we have recovered the money on behalf of the taxpayer and very clear checks and balances have been put in place.</p> <p>We do not tie our aid, as others country do, to the purchase of Irish goods and services.  We deliberately do not do this.  When disbursing aid through, for instance, our NGOs, Irish Aid or the UN for stocks, we do not stipulate that particular Irish stocks must be bought.  We require transparency and a chain of events to ensure we know where the money is going.  We are satisfied with this approach.  If we start tying aid to particular actions, we are leaving ourselves open to becoming a hostage to fortune.  The reason it has worked so well for us historically, since Garrett FitzGerald first instigated an Irish aid programme, is because we have had an honesty in our approach to people.  We have never come with an agenda.</p> <p>At the same time, this does not mean that we cannot look at Africa as a continent with 1.1 billion people with which we can trade.  We trade with countries such as Japan, where we have an ambassador and Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland representatives.  We have bilateral relationships with eight partner countries in Africa.  If we take one of the eight partner countries, for instance, Sierra Leone, Kenya or Nigeria, there is no reason we cannot, through ambassadorial or bilateral relationships, seek to trade with these countries as well.  We have an Africa strategy.  Every year we have an Ireland-Africa economic forum.  I will dig out the statistics which I wrote down earlier.  We have increased trade.  In 2010, our trade on an Ireland-Africa basis was approximately &euro;1.7 billion.  In 2013, it went up to &euro;2.3 billion.  I may be plucking this figure from the air, but by 2020 there is the potential for &euro;20 billion in trade, if I am not mistaken.  It is &euro;24 billion.  We are absolutely right to examine and set this as a target.</p> <p>There is not a Senator in this House who has not had some experience of a humanitarian visit to various countries.  When at these refugee camps or when visiting particular areas where Irish Aid is involved, one might see a mother who may have travelled 200 miles with her children from south Sudan to Gambella.  Looking at the children, one cannot but wonder how we can help to educate these children in order that they can become entrepreneurs and have access to health and educational services similar to ours.  How can they become entrepreneurs?  One way of looking at this is to share what we do best, through our innovation systems, with that growing number of people.  The figure is more than 1.1 billion.  There has been an increase of 2 million year on year in the number of people living in Ethiopia.  It is about trading services as well as assisting in capacity building.  The two are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p>Senator Higgins mentioned the Alan Kerins project.  Irish people are delivering excellent people on the ground through the Alan Kerins project and through GOAL, Gorta, Self Help Africa and Concern.  We will continue to be committed to the development agenda and the humanitarian agenda.  However, we must also focus on how we can trade more efficiently, that is, through mutually beneficial trade in a non-tied way in order that we can trade with what is a sleeping giant of a continent.  We are lucky that we do not look at it from a homogenous point of view.  We do not say that Africa is one continent with one people.  We recognise the fact that Sierra Leone is different from South Africa which is different from Nigeria.  We are lucky that we have relationships with all three of these countries and we must continue to look for trading opportunities with them.</p> <p>I take the point Senator Burke made on humanitarian crises.  To be fair to us, if one takes the humanitarian crisis in Syria - I have outlined some of the figures - or the Ebola crisis in west Africa as examples, we have been able, in a very reflexive way, to pivot towards these crises when they occurred by virtue of the fact that we have people on the ground.  If one takes Gaza, for instance, which was mentioned, it is by virtue of the fact that we have a relationship through our office in Ramallah that we have been able to fund the humanitarian crises there.  On Syria, much of the funding is divested through multilateral organisations because we do not have a bilateral relationship with it.  A flexibility has been built into the Irish system by successive Governments to ensure Irish Aid is adequately funded in order that it can pivot its funding opportunities as the crises arise.</p> <p>The issue of human rights was raised and I appreciate the points being made in respect of Nigeria, for instance.  We have a bilateral relationship with Nigeria.</p> <p>It would be easy for us to say we should not fund particular countries because of a human rights or governance record, or a lack thereof.  Our view has always been that if we have a bilateral relationship we ensure the funding gets to those people who are most in need.  The people who are most in need are sometimes not well served by their own governments, but at the same time they depend on us.  The governance we have, the honesty we bring as a country to our relationships with various countries and our lack of a colonial history or baggage, by which I mean we have not gone out to colonise, allow us to influence human rights in a very subtle and discreet way, which we do over time.  Ethiopia is one of our long-standing key partner countries, and Addis Ababa is the diplomatic capital of Africa.  A recent visit by President Michael D. Higgins, who addressed the African Union, served as an opportunity to impart messages to the African Union that for the relationships to be equal they must be such that human rights becomes a key function or pillar in any African nation's governance.  We do not do it with a sledgehammer but through subtle diplomacy, and this has allowed us to make progress over time.</p> <p>The issue of climate change has been raised as have the sustainable development goals.  Recently I visited Africa.  If one looks at the work Irish Aid is doing there, through key partners on the ground and specifically at the work being done to assist farmers in Tigre, which was the scene of the famous famine of the early to mid-1980s, one can see how agricultural systems have come on greatly.  One of the programmes in the area is on potato generation.  This could all be compromised by climate change if there is a 2&deg;C rise in temperatures globally.  We take very seriously our role in negotiating the sustainable development goals in co-facilitation with Kenya.  The reason we do so is because we are mindful of the relationships we have in the countries which are most affected by climate change.  We know our people who work with people there, which brings an honesty, openness and transparency to how we will approach the negotiations.  We are not weighed down with the baggage of having been a coloniser.  We know exactly what it is like in the first instance and we are able to speak for those countries which will need Ireland to be at their back and be an honest broker in these associations throughout 2015.</p> <p>Rather than specifically addressing every Member I have addressed general points.  I hope I have adequately addressed the point on the percentage of GNP targeting and the issues of compliance and transparency with regard to Uganda and tied aid.  I ask Senator O'Reilly to forgive me for interrupting her speech.  I am conscious that Senators must leave to attend other meetings, and I wanted to ensure I was able to clarify the point in case she needed to leave, but she is still here.  I hope I have generally spoken to the issue of climate change and the sustainable development goals.  It is not for me to speak specifically to the points on population control in specific countries.  We are very strong on gender equality and extremely strong on the issue of maternal health and nutrition as it is one of our priorities.  One can see this in action in countries such as Sierra Leone and Ethiopia in particular.  We are also extremely strong on issues such as fistula which, I am shocked to stay, still exists.  Ethiopia has set targets for itself.  The idea that in instances a pregnant woman cannot get to a centre in enough time to be able to give birth in a safe environment is, to my mind, shocking.  We are working very hard with our partners to try to tackle these issues.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400025#CC00300"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to introduce this Bill to the Seanad.  The Bill, which has passed all Stages in the D&aacute;il, has been recognised as progressive legislation which will provide for a fundamental reform of the State's existing employment rights and industrial relations structures and deliver an independent world class workplace relations service which is easy to use, effective, provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, and one that reduces cost to business.</p>  <p>Promoting and supporting harmonious industrial relationships in the workplace is an important element in achieving lasting economic growth and creating and sustaining jobs.  To support this objective, we must have efficient and effective mechanisms to develop harmonious and productive workplaces and to assist employers and employees to avoid disputes.  Where disputes do arise, the parties must be encouraged to work together to resolve them.  Where this is not possible and State intervention is necessary, the services must be provided in the most efficient, effective and professional manner to the highest standards.</p>  <p>The current workplace relations system has evolved over a long period in a piecemeal fashion in response to European Union and domestic legislation and the changing nature of employment.  A system that was intended to be informal, accessible and speedy has become extremely complex and protracted.  While there are excellent and committed people working in the five existing workplace relations bodies, often with challenging workloads, clearly the system itself has not performed and needs to be changed.  For many employers and employees the system is now too complex and onerous, takes too long to navigate and costs too much.  Individual employees as well as many owners of small businesses increasingly believe they cannot navigate the system without professional help.  That should not be the case.</p>  <p>These deficiencies have given rise to, among other matters, complexities for practitioners and users of the service, multiple points of entry to the system, forum shopping and long delays in scheduling hearings and issuing decisions.  My objective is to deliver a world-class workplace relations service providing an integrated industrial relations, adjudication and enforcement service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost-effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement, within a reasonable period.</p>  <p>From an industrial relations point of view, Ireland operates a voluntarist system of collective bargaining comprising non-intervention by the State in disputes but the State does provide dispute settling institutions and frameworks for local level and sectoral wage settling.  I am satisfied that the State's existing industrial relations machinery has worked very successfully and effectively in the past and it is for this reason that it has not been necessary to make any significant changes in the Bill in terms of the manner in which this system operates.</p>  <p>The functions of the workplace relations commission will comprise all those currently undertaken by the Labour Relations Commission, including industrial relations conciliation, advisory services, information and research.  These services, as currently operated by the Labour Relations Commission, have made a magnificent contribution to the industrial relations environment and will be incorporated into the workplace relations commission without change.</p>  <p>Significant progress has been achieved, in advance of the enabling legislation, in so far as the technological, structural, administrative and staffing changes required to underpin the workplace relations reform programme are concerned.  These include the establishment of a shared workplace relations customer service; a shared post-registration unit and an early resolution service; the completion of the design of a computer based complaint file management system; the transfer of the Equality Tribunal to the Department; the launch of an e-complaint facility and a workplace relations website; the design of an adjudicator training programme; the holding of an open recruitment competition for adjudicators and for Labour Court deputy chairs; and the design and implementation of enhanced technologies and business processes.  In addition, two public consultations on the scope of, and framework for, the reform programme were completed and the outcomes in this regard have informed programme design and implementation and the drafting of the enabling legislation.  The Department continues to liaise as required with stakeholders.</p>  <p>The reform of the workplace relations bodies will achieve significant savings in terms of a reduction in staff numbers and the associated costs of delivering the service, while delivering a much improved service to employees and employers.  The main drivers of the reduction in staff costs will be the centralisation of administration and case management services and the automation of business processes.</p>  <p>An essential step to achieving the two-tier workplace relations structures is the enactment of the Workplace Relations Bill which will see the existing five State bodies replaced by two.  Before outlining in detail the main provisions in the Bill, I will outline a number of key measures that will be provided for in the legislation which include the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, coming together under the remit of the workplace relations commission; the appellate functions of the EAT being amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court; the establishment of the office of director general of the workplace relations commission; the appointment of the director general by the Minister on specified terms of appointment; the statutory powers and functions of the director general; the establishment of the workplace relations commission board with responsibility for strategy and annual work programme; the transfer of the existing functions provided by the LRC, including conciliation, workplace mediation and advisory services, to the workplace relations commission; providing workplace relations information and advisory services; a statutory basis for the use of innovative measures such as compliance notices and fixed charge notices to enhance the compliance functions of the workplace relations commission; the sharing of employment related and other specified information between the workplace relations commission, the Labour Court and other official agencies in the context of promoting compliance with employment legislation; the appointment of additional members to the Labour Court to facilitate the increased workload of the court in the new system; a new more transparent system of appointment of adjudicators of the workplace relations commission and chairs, vice-chairs and ordinary members to the Labour Court; the standardisation of certain procedural matters and limitation periods; the length of the period within which a first instance adjudicator's decision may be appealed and so on, across the full range of employment rights legislation; and better enforcement of employment rights awards and better compliance and enforcement measures for employment rights.</p>  <p>I now propose to outline in greater detail the main provisions of the legislation.  The Bill, as passed by the D&aacute;il, consists of 7 Parts comprising 87 sections and six Schedules.  Part 1 comprises sections 1 to 8.  Sections 1 to 6 contain the Short Title, collective citation, commencement provisions, interpretation and measures relating to the service of documents.  Section 7 outlines the penalties which will apply when a person is found guilty of an offence under this Bill.  Section 8 refers to Schedule 2 which details the provisions repealed by this Bill and makes transitional arrangements for complaints or disputes referred to a rights commissioner before the commencement of Part 4.</p>  <p>Part 2 comprises sections 9 to 25 and makes provision for the establishment of the workplace relations commission.  The Labour Relations Commission, LRC, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, EAT, will be replaced by the new workplace relations commission and the appeals functions of the EAT will be incorporated into the Labour Court.  Sections 9 and 10 make provision for the establishment day of the new workplace relations commission.  Section 11 sets out general functions of the workplace relations commission that are additional to other functions conferred on it by specific sections by the Act.  The workplace relations commission will be tasked with taking proactive steps to ensure high standards of compliance with employment legislation and equally high standards in the conduct of industrial relations generally and with the provision of the necessary services to facilitate the speedy resolution of industrial relations disputes at as early a stage as possible.</p> <p>Simultaneously, the workplace relations commission will have responsibility for providing the means whereby complaints under employment rights legislation can be investigated, resolved by early intervention or adjudicated, as appropriate, by competent personnel.  Where the WRC suspects continued non-compliance with employment legislation on the part of workers or employers, it may resort to prosecution of the parties in question.  The functions of the WRC will comprise all those currently undertaken by the Labour Relations Commission, including industrial relations conciliation, advisory services, information and research.  The WRC adjudication service will continue the dispute resolution role of the Rights Commissioners as provided for in the Industrial Relations Act 1969, as well as employment rights adjudication functions.</p> <p>Sections 12 to 16, inclusive, provide for the appointment, resignation or removal from office and functions of the director general of the WRC.  The director general of the WRC will be appointed by the Minister following the holding of an open competition by the Public Appointments Service other than in the case of the first appointee to the office of director general.  The Accounting Officer for the commission will be the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Section 17 provides, on standard lines, that the director general is accountable to committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas other than the Committee of Public Accounts.  Section 20 provides that the commission shall have a statutory basis, in consultation with the Minister, for the preparation and publication of codes of practice for the improvement generally of workplace relations.</p> <p>Section 21 provides for the regular production of a strategy statement by the board of the WRC to be approved by the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Section 22 provides that the board shall prepare an annual work programme in consultation with the director general for submission to the Minister.  Section 24 is a standard provision which provides that the Minister may appoint such staff to the commission as he or she deems appropriate for the effective running of the commission and the discharge of its statutory functions.  Section 25 provides for the appointment of a qualified and experienced lawyer to act as registrar to the commission.</p> <p>Part 3 comprises sections 26 to 37, inclusive, and provides for the compliance procedures that will be introduced under the new workplace relations structures.  The functions undertaken by the National Employment Rights Authority to date in promoting a culture of compliance with employment legislation will be continued by the compliance service of the new workplace relations commission.  However, new mechanisms such as compliance notices and fixed payment notices will supplement the existing statutory powers of NERA inspectors.</p> <p>Section 26 provides for the appointment of inspectors to carry out the inspectorate function under employment legislation, and section 27 restates and consolidates in one location the powers of inspectors, which are at present provided for under a range of individual enactments.  Section 28 provides for the use of compliance notices to promote higher levels of compliance with employment legislation.  Such notices may issue when an inspector forms an opinion that a scheduled contravention of employment law, which the employer concerned fails or refuses to rectify, has occurred.  The compliance notice will set out the steps the employer concerned must take to effect compliance.  An employer may appeal against all or any aspect of the notice to the Labour Court, with a further appeal from the Labour Court to the Circuit Court also provided for.</p> <p>Section 31 will allow the WRC and its inspectors and adjudication officers to share certain employment related information with other statutory enforcement authorities.  Section 32 enables the WRC and other statutory enforcement authorities to advise each other of suspected offences under their respective remits which come to the notice of any of them.  Section 33 is designed to safeguard the wages and other statutory entitlements of employees who are working under public construction or other public contracts while also ensuring competitive tendering and value for money in public expenditure.  Section 35 is intended to provide a statutory basis for administrative co-operation and the exchange of information between employment law compliance authorities of other states and the compliance section of the WRC.</p> <p>Section 36 provides for the use of fixed payment notices in respect of a specified range of acts of non-compliance on the part of employers.  The matters in respect of which a fixed payment notice may be issued are specified in section 36(5).  There are only three offences listed in subsection (5) for the purposes of this section, namely, section 11 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977, which relates to the requirement for an employer to consult employees' representatives and the Minister with regard to collective redundancies; section 4(4) of the Payment of Wages Act 1991, which relates to an employer's obligation to provide an employee with a payslip; and section 23 of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, which relates to an employer's obligation to provide an employee with a written statement of his or her average hourly rate of pay.  The use of this mechanism is intended to encourage compliance and reduce the need to rely on expensive and time-consuming prosecution procedures for the scheduled acts of non-compliance.  The legislation provides that the maximum amount of the charge or penalty specifiable in a fixed payment notice is &euro;2,000.  I am currently taking advice as to whether it would be appropriate for the Minister to issue regulations setting out guidelines as to the appropriate monetary amount of notices in specific circumstances.  The overriding concern in practice would be to ensure consistency in the application of this section and its provisions.  Section 37 provides that the power vested in the Minister under relevant enactments to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under that enactment is transferred to the WRC.</p> <p>Part 4 comprises sections 38 to 54, inclusive, and provides for the new dispute resolution and adjudication structures.  Section 38 provides for the appointment of mediation officers to the WRC.  The Bill, as initiated, provided separately for the appointment of "case resolution officers" and "mediation officers" by the director general to ensure that parties to complaints referred to the director general had access to a range of early intervention options.  However, these provisions were amended on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to provide for the appointment of a single class of "mediation officer" who will deliver the full range of early intervention options that will be provided by the WRC.  This is a more streamlined and efficient arrangement from an internal operational perspective.  No reduction in the scope of complainants' and respondents' access to early intervention will result.</p> <p>Section 39 provides for the case resolution service, which will be provided by the WRC to facilitate the resolution of employment rights disputes where possible at an early stage and without recourse to adjudication.  The WRC will offer a range of early intervention options to resolve disputes under employment rights legislation, including the early resolution service as currently provided by the Labour Relations Commission and the mediation service currently provided by the Equality Tribunal.  Participating in early resolution or mediation is entirely voluntary.  Parties availing of the case resolution service will not lose the right to have their issues in dispute dealt with by means of inspection or a hearing as appropriate to their case, nor will they be disadvantaged with their waiting time for inspection or a hearing.  That is an important point.  Should case resolution yield a compromise or settlement between the parties or a withdrawal of the complaint, the outcome will be confidential to the parties.  Likewise, if the case resolution is unsuccessful, anything divulged by the parties in the process cannot be used subsequently in the adjudication or inspection process.  As case resolution and mediation services are now provided for together in section 39 of the Bill, as amended on Committee Stage, it will be necessary to delete section 40 from the current version of the Bill, which I propose to do by way of amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad, to reflect the amalgamation of the previous provisions which provided for case resolution and mediation separately.</p> <p>Section 41 provides for the appointment of adjudicators to the workplace relations commission.  All first instance cases will be heard by the WRC in a fair and transparent manner in accordance with the law and the principles of natural justice.  To hit this high standard, adjudicators must be suitably skilled and trained for the role.  On the establishment of the WRC, the current cohort of equality officers and rights commissioners will be appointed as WRC adjudicators.  They will be supplemented by a panel of external adjudicators, comprising experienced industrial relations and human resources practitioners and employment lawyers with appropriate skills and experience appointed by the Minister.  The Public Appointments Service has completed a selection process for WRC adjudicators and those selected for appointment on the panel are currently participating in an accredited training programme which is being delivered by the National College of Ireland.  Only those who successfully complete the programme and pass the final assessment will be formally appointed as WRC adjudicators and assigned cases.</p> <p>Section 42 provides for standardised time limits of six months, extendable to 12 months for reasonable cause.  All first instance complaints requiring adjudication will be heard in private by WRC adjudication officers.  The adjudication officer will convene a hearing where both parties are given the opportunity to be heard and to decide the matter.  Parties will be free to represent themselves or choose their own representation.</p> <p>All appeals will lie to the Labour Court, except in the case of complaints under the Equal Status Acts, where the appeal will lie to the Circuit Court.<br/><br/>Adjudication officers will be required to conduct cases in accordance with the principles of constitutional and natural justice.  This obligation will include affording parties the right to cross-examine.  Subsection (11) of section 42 has been subject to some critical comment in that it is alleged that it gives an adjudication officer the power to refuse a lawyer or other representative of a party access to proceedings.  This is not the case.  The Government amendment introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il has clarified the range of persons that may represent a complainant at a hearing, which includes a trade union representative, a practising barrister or a solicitor.<br/><br/>Section 43 empowers an adjudication officer to dismiss a complaint in circumstances in which he or she forms the opinion that it is frivolous or vexatious.  Such a decision can be appealed to the Labour Court.  The words &quot;frivolous or vexatious&quot; are legal terms.  They are not pejorative in any sense.  It is merely a question of saying that as far as the complainant is concerned, if he or she has no reasonable chance of succeeding then the law says it is frivolous to bring the case.<br/><br/>Sections 44 and 46 provide for a streamlined and more effective enforcement procedure for complainants whose complaints have been upheld at first instance by an adjudication officer of the WRC or upon appeal by the Labour Court.  The current system of enforcement of employment rights awards is cumbersome, expensive and not fit for purpose.  In my view, the difficulty experienced by successful complainants in enforcing awards made by those bodies in their favour is unsatisfactory.  Enforcement proceedings generally involve recourse to the civil courts, and, possibly, the relevant sheriff's office, often without a successful outcome.<br/><br/>One of the central planks of these reforms is to establish a new and robust enforcement regime which will provide successful complainants with an accessible and inexpensive means to enforce the award of the WRC adjudication service or of the Labour Court, as the case may be.  For this reason, provision is being made in the Bill for a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the WRC adjudicators and Labour Court determinations.  The general scheme of the Workplace Relations Bill as approved by the Government in July 2012 provided for an improved and more robust system of enforcement of compensation awards under employment legislation via the District Court.  The scheme provided that non-compliance with an order of the WRC or the Labour Court, as the case may be, would be an offence prosecutable summarily in the District Court.  The enforcement provisions in the Bill, within sections 44 and 46 as published, do not currently make provision for an offence in such circumstances; however, this issue is the subject of further discussion between my Department, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General, and I hope to table an amendment for consideration at Committee Stage in the Seanad which will satisfactorily address this issue.  I am confident that the introduction of these new measures will provide for more appropriate, efficient and effective enforcement of employment law.<br/><br/>Section 45 provides that either party to a first-instance hearing will have the right to appeal the decision of a WRC adjudication officer to the Labour Court.  The court will act as a court of final appeal for all adjudication decisions of the WRC.  Appeals to the Labour Court will be <i>de novo</i>hearings held in public, except in exceptional circumstances where the Labour Court will have the discretion to hear certain cases in private, such as those dealing with sexual harassment or disability.  The wording of section 45 of the Bill as currently drafted does not make it clear that the Labour Court will have the power to hear cases in private in such exceptional circumstances and, therefore, I intend to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad to clarify this matter.<br/><br/>Section 48 provides that the only route of appeal that parties will have from a decision of the Labour Court will be on a point of law to the High Court.  This provision does not impact on the supervisory role of the superior courts, which may be exercised by way of judicial review.<br/><br/>Section 50 provides that the director general of the WRC and the Labour Court may strike out cases for want of prosecution where the director general or the Labour Court is satisfied that the complainant or appellant has not pursued the complaint or appeal within a period of one year.<br/><br/>Part 5, comprising of sections 55 to 63, inclusive, makes provision for a range of technical and transitional issues consequent on the dissolution of the Labour Relations Commission.  Section 58 provides for the transfer of all functions from the Labour Relations Commission to the WRC.  The functions which are currently vested in the Labour Relations Commission, including the industrial relations conciliation, advisory, training and research services, will transfer to the workplace relations commission.  Sections 59 to 63, inclusive, make provision for a range of technical and transitional issues consequential on the dissolution of the LRC and to ensure continuity between this body and the new WRC which replaces it.  These are all standard provisions.<br/><br/>Part 6, comprising sections 64 to 71, inclusive, makes provision for a range of technical and transitional issues consequential on the dissolution of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The EAT will continue to function for a limited period after the establishment of the WRC to dispose of all legacy first-instance complaints and appeals referred to it prior to the establishment date of the WRC, including cases that a division of the EAT had commenced hearing.  The decision to extend the period of operation of the EAT beyond the establishment of the new framework is predicated on the assumption that complainants and respondents in matters referred to the EAT prior to the establishment of the WRC would have a legitimate expectation of having the case disposed of before a tripartite tribunal sitting in public and operating with the degree of procedural formality currently applied by the EAT.<br/><br/>I move next to Part 7, which comprises sections 72 to 87, inclusive.  Section 72 enables the Minister to provide by regulation for the levying of fees and charges on the users of services to be provided by the Commission or the Labour Court.  I have decided not to introduce charges on parties for access to the WRC services for many reasons, chief among which is the belief that &quot;forum shopping&quot; will not be a feature in the new system.  However, I am proposing the introduction of a fee in one particular instance.  Where a party who has failed to appear at a first-instance hearing of the WRC without good cause wishes to appeal the decision to the Labour Court, that party will have to pay a fee of &euro;300 when lodging its appeal.  If the Labour Court determines that the party in question had good cause for failing to attend the first-instance hearing, the fee will be refunded.  I wish to clarify that the introduction of any fees will require regulations and any such regulations can be annulled by the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>Sections 76, 78 and 80 make provision for appointment to the positions of chairman, deputy chairman and ordinary members of the Labour Court.  The Labour Court currently has three divisions and nine members - that is, a chair, two deputy chairs and six ordinary members - and it sits in divisions of three.  The Bill will provide that the expanded Labour Court will have four divisions, but restructured for greater efficiency to allow the court to deal with double the number of appeals with only one additional division.<br/><br/>The Bill provides that the appointments of chairman and deputy chairman to the court by the Minister shall, in the future, be through the Public Appointments Service.  These new arrangements will not apply to the persons who immediately before the enactment of this Bill stood appointed as chair and deputy chair, and the incumbents will continue to serve in these positions for the unexpired period of their respective terms of appointment.  Previously, on the appointment of ordinary members, the Minister was obliged to appoint a person nominated by either an organisation representative of trade unions or a trade union representative of employers.  The change proposed will require those bodies to put forward the names of three candidates for appointment in respect of each vacancy for an ordinary member.  The Minister will then choose one person from the panel for appointment.<br/><br/>Sections 77 and 81 make provision for the consequential amendments to the Redundancy Payments Acts and the Unfair Dismissals Acts, respectively, as a result of the new adjudication structures being introduced in the Bill.  A Government amendment was introduced on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il to make it clear that all referrals under the Unfair Dismissals Acts made after the commencement of Part 4 will be subject to Part 4 - that is, these referrals will be dealt with by the WRC rather than the EAT.<br/><br/>Section 79 makes provision for the making of regulations by the Minister, after consultation with the chairman, that certain functions of the Labour Court may be performed by the chairman or a deputy chairman sitting alone.  In particular, such regulations may provide that certain specified preliminary applications or procedural matters can be dealt with by the chairman or a deputy chairman sitting alone.<br/><br/>Sections 83 to 85, inclusive, make provision for consequential amendments to equality legislation - namely, the Employment Equality Acts, the Equal Status Acts and Part VII of the Pensions Act - as a result of the new adjudication structures.  There has been some negative commentary that the disestablishment of the Office of the Director of the Equality Tribunal, which is provided for in this Bill, will result in the diminution of a person's rights under equality legislation.  I wish to make it absolutely clear that this commentary is not true.  This Bill does not make any amendments to the substantive provisions in existing equality legislation which protect persons against discrimination in employment or in the provision of goods and services.  Under the new workplace relations structures to be established by this Bill, all complaints under equality legislation will be adjudicated upon at first instance by the WRC adjudication service with the right of appeal to the Labour Court, except in the case of the Equal Status Act, where appeals will continue to be dealt with by the Circuit Court.<br/><br/>The practice and procedure of the Equality Tribunal provides the closest approximation to the procedures that will be applied by the adjudication service of the workplace relations commission.</p> <p>There will not be any diminution of rights under equality legislation upon establishment of the workplace relations commission and complaints of discrimination under this legislation will have equal priority in the new system with all other employment related matters.  The Bill provides that the current cohort of equality officers will be appointed as adjudicators upon establishment of the WRC, thereby ensuring that their knowledge and expertise in the adjudication of discrimination related complaints will transfer wholly to the new body.  Ireland has an excellent record on equality matters and was one of the first countries to give effect to the European equality directives.  The reforms that will be given legislative effect by the Bill will modernise and enhance the redress mechanisms available to those who believe they have not been treated equally in the workplace on the grounds set out in the Equality Acts.</p> <p>Section 87 provides for an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to bring it into line with rulings of the European Court of Justice in the Schultz-Hoff line of cases regarding how time spent on sick leave should be treated for the purposes of the accrual of annual leave.  This section also provides for amendments to the Financial (Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) (No. 2) Act 2009 and the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Both amendments are being brought forward at the request of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>I will provide a brief comment on the six Schedules to the Bill.  Schedule 1 contains a list of the relevant Employment Acts, the provisions of the Acts of the Oireachtas and statutory instruments that are included in the definition of employment enactments for the purposes of this Bill.  Schedule 2 contains a list of the provisions within individual Acts of the Oireachtas that will be repealed upon the commencement of Part 4 of the Workplace Relations Bill.  Schedule 3 sets out details of the corporate structure of the new WRC.  This Schedule also provides for the appointment of a statutory board of the WRC.  Schedule 4 sets out details of the list of contraventions of employment enactments for the purpose of compliance notices as provided for in section 28.  Schedule 5 sets out details of the individual employment enactments under which a person will be able to present a complaint or refer a dispute to the director general of the WRC.  Schedule 6 sets out the consequential amendments necessary to make to other employment enactments as a result of the new structures for the adjudication of complaints and disputes that will be introduced by this Bill.</p> <p>I wish to bring to the attention of Members of the Seanad that my Department is in discussion with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on a number of issues where the Bill does not fully reflect the policy as set out in the heads approved by the Government.  Moreover, the Minister has agreed to consider some changes suggested by Opposition Deputies and to introduce amendments accordingly.  More minor drafting points and consequential amendments to other Employment Acts are under discussion which we propose to address with amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  As a result I will bring forward a number of Government amendments on Committee Stage in the Seanad.</p> <p>The key issues it is proposed to address by way of amendments to the Bill include ensuring a visible provision in the legislation to create an offence of non-compliance with an order of the District Court to enforce a decision of the WRC or Labour Court under employment legislation.  This refers to sections 44 and 46.  Amendments to sections 42 and 45 are to clarify details relating to representation of parties appearing before an adjudication officer and the Labour Court.  Amendments to Part 6 are to address issues raised relating to the provisions relating to the dissolution of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  An amendment to section 101 of the Employment Equality Act is to provide for the manner in which parallel claims under the Employment Equality Act and Unfair Dismissals Act, will be dealt with by the WRC.  Amendments to the Schedules, in particular, Schedules 2 and 6, are to ensure that all of the consequential amendments to other employment enactments, including providing for the inclusion of the new dispute resolution and adjudication mechanisms in individual enactments, which arise on foot of this Bill, are accurately incorporated in the legislation.  An amendment to section 80 will provide for temporary appointments to position of deputy chair of the Labour Court.</p> <p>I thank Members of the Seanad for providing time for consideration of this Bill.  I emphasise the importance of the Bill in the context of the Government's commitment to reform the State's existing employment rights and industrial relations structures and to deliver an independent, world-class workplace relations system.  While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of this Bill and this is a priority to give legislative effect to the new workplace relations structures and processes.</p> <p>I look forward to contributions from Senators during this debate and the co-operation of the House in securing the Bill's early enactment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I thank him for a most comprehensive outline of the purpose of this Bill.  It needs to be comprehensive because the Bill is very important and substantial legislation.  For many years Ireland has been to the fore in workplace relations and in protecting workers' rights.  This means that Ireland is regarded as a suitable country in which to invest and to create jobs and where workers' rights will be upheld and which has a proper appeals mechanism.</p>  <p>The former Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, has been speaking on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  He worked on this Bill in the previous Government.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports the Bill.  We will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage.  I will consult outside organisations with regard to section 72.  I assume the Minister of State has done likewise with regard to removing the need for fees to be paid to access the WRC.  Speaking personally, the idea of charging people who do not turn up for an approved appointment is a good one in cases where no acceptable excuse is provided.  This could also be applied in the health sector.</p>  <p>I will table amendments on Committee Stage on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the issue of retired and deferred members of pension schemes.  I refer to the example of what has happened to the airline workers.  People who have left a company and are no longer in its employ, either retired and in receipt of a pension or who have left the company but retain pension benefits in the pension scheme, have no seat at the table.  I will table amendments in this regard.</p>  <p>The Minister of State's party leader, the T&aacute;naiste, made an announcement on pensions reform.  I use that term in the broadest possible sense because her idea of pensions reform would be very different from mine. It is important that deferred and retired members would have a seat at the table.  I will look at the appropriate part in which to table an amendment.  We need a commitment somewhere in legislation that those who have worked for a company and those who still have a stake in a company will have a say in what is happening to their pension entitlements and benefits.</p>  <p>Fianna F&aacute;il will study the Bill in more detail with a view to tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  I reiterate that the issue of retired and soon to be retired workers needs to be considered, whether in this Bill or in other legislation.  This type of legislation will need to be updated regularly.</p> <p>Our working lives are changing in terms of the way people work, the type of jobs they have, and the fact that people have multiple jobs.  That is something that needs to be kept under review on a constant basis.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I welcome the legislation.  We want to work with the Minister of State on Committee Stage.  We will table amendments which we hope will meet with the approval of the Minister of State in terms of some of the changes he wishes to make.  I would like him to respond, perhaps not today but on Committee Stage when we table amendments, and to look clearly at the area of pension scheme members who no longer work for a company.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the issue only yesterday.  This is an opportunity to address the issue and to right a wrong that exists at present.  I again thank the Minister of State for being present and for outlining the detail of the Workplace Relations Bill 2014.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1187" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400029#GG00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  A ramshackle maze of laws and procedures built up over decades in a totally <i>ad hoc</i>, spin the bottle and pick one's procedure manner is one legal practitioner's description of the practice of employment law in this jurisdiction.  In answer to that, the Bill is the most comprehensive and innovative reform since the introduction of equality legislation by the former Labour Party Minister, Mervyn Taylor.  It is welcome because when enacted it will obviate the necessity for a complainant to have to navigate multiple complaint mechanisms.<br/><br/>One of the principal attractions of the legislation is the reduction in forum shopping.  As the Minister previously said, if a Minister and civil servants had a blank sheet and were sitting down today to design an employment disputes resolution mechanism we would be in a very different place.  No one would have constructed the overly elaborate, expensive, time consuming and overly litigious system we have.  I do not say that as an attack on previous Governments.  The system was built up organically over the years as different priorities came to the fore.  The nature of EU employment has also changed and the system tried to adapt.<br/><br/>The current system has been of enormous service to the State and has made a huge contribution in terms of fostering equality and advancing employment rights and industrial relations.  That, however, is not an excuse to let matters stay as they are.  We must constantly review every mechanism of State to ensure that it is fit for purpose.  The problems in this area are manifest.  There are myriad methods by which cases can be processed.  A single set of circumstances can give rise to a number of claims which must be processed through different avenues of redress.  There are approximately 30 different forums involved and an overlap of functions between the bodies, resulting in forum shopping.  Claims are often referred to the wrong forum or under the wrong legislation.  A wide range of different practices, procedures and often inconsistent time limits apply in the various fora.  There are different appeal avenues for elements of the same case involving the same employee.  There is an absence in many instances of any intervention whether mediation, arbitration or simple case progression, which if in place would make the process much more effective.  The systems have become overly legalistic with many employers and employees incurring legal costs and delays that are excessive.  There is also a lack of consistent procedure for enforcement of decisions of the various employment rights.<br/><br/>On this Bill&rsquo;s enactment, four workplace relations bodies, namely, the Labour Relations Commission, including the Rights Commissioner Service, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be abolished and their functions will be subsumed into two bodies, a new workplace relations commission, WRC, and a Labour Court with expanded powers.  The current system is a mishmash of various bodies, locations and procedures.  It was ripe for reform and the Minister is to be commended for grasping the nettle.  The intention is that the new streamlined process will reduce costs, increase efficiencies and simplify the process.  The Bill will also give powers to workplace inspectors and introduce two new services to assist employers and employees to resolve and settle disputes themselves without third party intervention, which is vital.<br/><br/>Among the amalgamated functions of the two new bodies, one very important aspect is that the WRC will be tasked with deciding or facilitating the resolution of all employment disputes in the first instance, obviating the need to take multiple claims to multiple bodies.  Strides should be taken to have claims of any sort decided informally though impartially.<br/><br/>A series of articles appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i>recently about the cost of family law proceedings, in particular divorce, in this jurisdiction.  The costs involved in such actions or any legal action are enormous.  Additional to that, the insurance industry has voiced serious concern about the mounting cost of litigation, in particular in personal injury actions.  While discussion of that specific matter is not appropriate in this context, perhaps it is something the Seanad could usefully debate in the future.<br/><br/>The cost of doing business in this country includes the cost of doing legal business.  I am delighted in this instance that the Minister has taken particular note of that and has made strides to have matters addressed informally before the legal route is approached.  Of course every citizen has a constitutional right to access the courts and such informal resolution cannot be imposed.  The solution is to make such an informal resolution fair, impartial, cost effective and speedy.  The legislation appears to do just that.<br/><br/>I would, however, make one point in relation to the practice and procedures of the new bodies.  Would the Minister commit to having one common restatement of the procedure and process of claims through the various stages?  The existing rules could then be repealed.  This would make the process much easier to navigate for the practitioner and speed matters up.  Section 42(13) would seem to allow for that.  I presume the Minister intends, by regulation, to make the practice uniform.<br/><br/>I also have a query on section 42(9).  This is at the heart of the legislation as it deals with the presentation of complaints and the referral of disputes by adjudication officers.  Section 9 holds that these hearings shall be held in private.  There is also provision that only the decisions shall be published and in such manner as decided by the officer but not identifying parties involved in the dispute.  Perhaps the Minister could explain the reasoning behind that.  It might be that a provision is warranted in cases where intimate personal details might be disclosed but otherwise it seems a backwards step.<br/><br/>The process is quasi judicial, with rights of appeal to higher bodies, including the High Court.  Hearings should be held in public if for no other reason than to give the public confidence that it is working fairly.  For years, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal sat in private, and only recently published any decision at all.  It has been rightly criticised for being a secretive process and one in which little public or academic confidence resides.  The Government, for this and many other reasons, is now moving to introduce new legislation in the refugee area.<br/><br/>Fitness to practice hearings are now held in public, with the nursing council recently joining other professional supervisory bodies in so doing.  The family law courts in recent years have followed the path of openness by allowing reporting of cases while protecting the intimate family details of people appearing before it.  I cannot see any reason these cases should not be held in public other than if intimate personal details were to be disclosed.  I ask the Minister of State if could explain the reasoning behind the measure.  I warmly welcome this legislation.  It has great potential to be transformational.  I urge the Minister of State to consider my comments which are made in a thoroughly constructive manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.171" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1196" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400029#GG00300"><p>I will not need five minutes.  This is my first time to address the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, in the House.  I am delighted to meet him.</p>  <p>As a trade unionist, I welcome the Bill.  Anything that would streamline the process for employees who find themselves in difficulty with their employers has got to be welcomed.  With the Irish Congress of Trade Unions I have a number of areas I would like the Minister of State to consider.  While I will not go into them in detail today I would like him to examine section 42(11) and allow for trade union representation at mediation.  I realise there is almost a contradiction in that request, as when one talks about mediation it is usually one on one.  Sometimes an employee would need someone there to support him or her, not necessarily as an advocate, when facing a very strong employer.</p>  <p>I will have more to say on section 43 on Committee Stage.  I would have serious difficulty, as would the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, with the notion that an adjudication officer could dismiss a claim based on the fact that it might be vexatious or frivolous.  The application of such a criterion would operate to undermine the ability of unions to have individual cases heard that are referred under the Industrial Relations Act.  The unintended consequence is likely to be an increase in the collective action as a vital dispute resolution avenue to be removed.  Other complications might arise in the context of the requirement to exhaust all procedures.  Congress is therefore seeking an amendment to clarify the referrals of individual disputes under the Industrial Relations Act and that they cannot be refused on the basis that they may be vexatious or frivolous.</p> <p> In terms of section 72, I understand the need to penalise somebody for failing to turn up without good reason.  However, there is sufficiently strong evidence in the UK that shows where a fee of any sort is introduced, it prices justice out of the hands of workers so I will table an amendment to this section.</p> <p>I wish to raise another issue of concern.  I have been involved for a number of years in bringing cases to the Labour Court through the Rights Commissioner Service and various other tribunals.  Therefore, I am aware of the propensity of employers to arrive, armed with HR experts, members of organisations such as IBEC and legal reputation, to contest a case against a single employee, which makes it a harrowing experience for the latter.  It was my understanding that this Bill would simplify and reduce the onerous task of bringing an employment related issue before any of the agencies that are being amalgamated into the new group.  From that point of view, I hope the legislation would state that if an employee is coming on his or her own unrepresented, then the employer should surely come on his or her own unrepresented.  </p> <p>I wish to make another comment on this area.  Typically, I have been involved in cases that were funded by the State or by State agencies where entire teams of legal representatives attended and where cases were lost but appealed all along the way.  One goes through an adjudication and when one wins, the employer says, "No, I am not going to have that".  Then one goes to what used to be called the Rights Commissioner Service which makes an award.  One wins the case and is awarded compensation, but the employer again says, "No, I am not going to have that".  Next the case goes to the Labour Court, there is the same outcome and again the employer says, "No, I am not going to have that" so one finishes up going to the courts.  Clearly, such behaviour by an employer must qualify as frivolous and vexatious.  I do not want to take away the right of somebody to appeal - by all means, an appeals mechanism must be available to all of us - but if an employer appeals all the way through the system and loses at each stage, then something must be terribly wrong with the system.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill which is a fantastic piece of work.  I have some technical issues with it and I will bring forward a few amendments to sections 42, 43 and 72.  I will leave it at that and thank the Minister of State for his time.</p></speech>

Everyone has given it a general welcome.  All Senators agree that there is a need to consolidate the current set of procedures to deal with employment rights, workplace relations and so forth.  As has been acknowledged, these issues developed in a piecemeal fashion over several years and, therefore, are unduly complex with anomalies, etc.  Other Senators have addressed this point, as has the Minister of State.</p>  <p>Senator Kelly is normally the Labour Party spokesperson on this issue.  I am grateful to him for allowing me to take his place this evening as I was keen to say a few words on the Bill.  I have an interest in employment law and studied, taught and did some practice in this area some years ago.  I am also grateful to my colleagues in the Employment Law Association of Ireland, ELAI, for its assistance.  I know it has been in contact with the Minister of State and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation about the Bill and during its passage through the D&aacute;il.  Like the association, in general, I welcome the Bill.</p>  <p>As the Minister of State has said, it is important to note that Government amendments will be made on Committee Stage, which is welcome.  I know some of the amendments that were accepted in the D&aacute;il came from Opposition Deputies.  I am really glad that we have all been able to work constructively on this legislation. </p>  <p>In a general context, I welcome the Government's commitment to collective bargaining legislation and the Minister of State's work on a low pay commission.  I see this Bill as part of a package of measures that deal with industrial relations reform.  </p>  <p>I have a number of issues with the Bill.  First, I am concerned about the Title of the Bill and the title of the new commission.  The latter is to be called the workplace relations commission as it is intended to amalgamate the industrial relations functions of the Labour Relations Commission, the equality functions of the Equality Tribunal and equality officers, and employment rights functions under the remit of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Rights Commissioner Service.  We have seen a distinct set of specialties develop among these areas.</p>  <p>I have a couple of issues with this area but I will deal first with the title issue.  I am slightly concerned that the title "workplace relations commission" does not comprehensively capture the different specialties and areas that will be covered.  I have spoken to the Minister of State about including the word "equality" in the title.  However, I am conscious the acronym for workplace relations and equality commission would not be so good, but what about calling it the labour relations and equality commission?  It may be too late to change the title but I have put forward my preferred title.  The term "workplace relations" is a move away from the old language we have always used in industrial relations and labour relations.  Can we return to the old way?  The title is less of a substantive point.</p>  <p>I wish to make a more substantive point about building up the existing specialties and expertise among the new panel of adjudicators to be appointed.  I very much welcome, as everyone else does, that persons with existing expertise in these areas will continue to work as adjudicators.  As the Minister of State did in his speech, I pay tribute to the great work that has been done.</p>  <p>Section 41 deals with additional adjudicators.  Some of them have already been recruited through the Public Appointments Service.  The Minister of State has said the adjudicators must have expertise.  I agree that is important particularly as the success of the legislation depends on the ability of the individuals involved.  He has said, and it has been said to the ELAI, that 70 days of training will be provided by the National College of Ireland.  I am concerned that the training covers the three specialties of employment rights, equality rights and industrial relations expertise.  Is there a sense that there will be specialisation among adjudicators?  Will there be three groups of adjudicators?  If so, will the new adjudicators also be broken down into the three areas?  Should section 41 also include a requirement for specific expertise?  Is a requirement needed in statutory form?  </p>  <p>I will return to the issue of equality, but I am glad that the Minister of State has clarified that there will be no dilution of the existing laws on equality and discrimination.  There is an issue in terms of venues and equality legislation.  Cases involving gender discrimination still have a different choice of venue and may go to the Circuit Court, specifically gender discrimination, while other forms of discrimination do not.  We may be required to keep that extra option for gender discrimination due to EU concerns.  Can the issue be explored given the spirit in which the Bill is moving towards consolidation generally?  </p>  <p>In terms of the public-private venue issue, I am glad that the Minister of State will bring forward an amendment, under section 45, to give the Labour Court the power to hear exceptional cases in private.  That is something that has been sought.</p>  <p>As the Minister of State said, section 87 makes provision for an amendment to the Organisation of Working Time Act which will take account of the rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union in terms of sick leave.  I know ICTU also shared that concern.  Given that we are amending the Act, can we address an issue that is close to the Minister of State's heart?  I refer to low hours contracts which has been remarked upon in case law by the Employment Appeals Tribunal in the UK.  Let me give the example of an employee who has a contract to work eight hours per week but, on a regular basis, is asked to work a further ten or 15 hours.  That means his or her working hours could be as much as 20 or 25 hours per week but the overtime is not counted for other purposes such as employment rights and annual leave.  Anecdotally, the Labour Court's recommendations have been favourable to employees found to be in that situation.  Should we seek to put that in statutory form?  I refer to cases where regular hours are worked that are in fact part of the employee's ongoing contract of employment.  Can the hours worked be taken into account when calculating leave entitlements, etc.?  As I said, this has been a specific issue in Britain where there is now case law available.    </p>  <p>In terms of the package of measures regarding labour relations reform, is there a timeframe to consolidate employment legislation, as referred to by Senator Naughton, that rationalises all the different issues?  The legislation could provide that the same powers would exist.</p> <p>For example, we need to ensure that the same powers exist in an unfair dismissal case or an equality or discrimination claim in order that workplace relations commission, WRC, adjudicators would have powers to compel disclosure.  The concern is that if the Labour Court preserves powers to it that are more extensive than those of the WRC adjudicators, the adjudicators would be seen almost as a necessary hurdle to get over before one goes to the Labour Court.  That would have all the necessary adverse effects that we are trying to counter with the legislation whereby everyone will end up going on to the Labour Court in any case.</p> <p>I am conscious that other colleagues have spoken about the suggested amendments put forward by ICTU and the INMO, to whom I am grateful, but I want to comment on the section 72 fees issue.  I was glad to hear the Minister of State say he intends to limit fees to the specific instance where there is non-attendance and then an appeal, but will section 72 be amended to reflect that because currently it appears to provide a wider power to a Minister to impose fees?</p> <p>There is another concern under section 42 that there would be a facility for representation by a union official at mediation as well as at the adjudication stage, and I know amendments have been tabled already to sections 42 and 43.  I am sure we will discuss those further on Committee Stage.  I look forward to that, and I welcome the Bill.</p></speech>

I am in flight, so to speak, between committees but I have tabled amendments to this legislation so I thought it would be rather impertinent of me to table amendments without addressing any of the issues in a Second Stage speech.</p>  <p>I welcome this development and compliment the Minister of State on producing such a distinct Bill because anything that increases harmony in industrial relations is to be welcomed.  There are a number of areas where matters need to be tidied up.  I have been advised on that in correspondence by various people, including a well-known firm of solicitors, so I tabled these amendments.  The Minister of State is in agreement with some of them because that was contained in the correspondence between the solicitors and the Minister of State.  He seemed to think there were arguments here and there, so I look forward to teasing that out on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>In terms of the issues, they are technical, such as the address.  People do not always put down a correct address.  Therefore, we have to stabilise the address to ensure we have certainty in terms of knowing what we are dealing with in terms of who, what and where.  There is also the question of the employer giving the full name of the company.  Sometimes they do not do that, and we need to establish clearly the legal entity that is involved in these proceedings.</p>  <p>There is then the question of various representatives who are not solicitors or senior counsel.  They are representatives for gain and they advertise and so on.  They may not be regulated or subject to the same codes of practice and conduct as barristers, solicitors and so on.  I am tabling an amendment, as advised, to cover that to make sure that people who legitimately represent interests at court should be subject to the same regulations.  They must be subject to the same code of practice.</p>  <p>The appointment of the position of registrar is left fairly vague in the legislation so I tabled an amendment governing the appointment and suggesting that the person involved should have a number of years of professional practice to qualify him or her for that job.</p>  <p>There is a fine of &euro;2,000 but I am tabling an amendment suggesting that should be increased to &euro;20,000 in the case of failure to pay the national minimum wage.  That is a substantial amount but it should be a real disincentive to people who are inclined not to pay.  This is based on the United Kingdom model and what they have recently introduced.  It is one of the areas where we could usefully follow the UK.  I have been critical in the past of the fact that, very often in terms of our legislative procedures, we took down what Westminster had done and stuck it into law here, but there are moments when the United Kingdom experience is a useful one.</p>  <p>There is also the question of the production of documentation, and being a fairly litigious person I know the significance of that because I have battled on both sides.  I have demanded documents from the other side, and I am still doing so in a series of libel cases, which I have every intention of winning, and when they come looking for documents I will say: "Not on your nelly.  You are not getting a smell of these documents.  You can take me to court."  The production of documents is an integral part of that.  It also speeds up the process.  If there is a series of hearings, one sometimes hears that they do not have this or that document.  If there is a requirement to produce documents at an early stage, this will speed things up.</p>  <p>On the question of whether the hearings are held in public or in private, it is a useful practice to hold these hearings in public.  That would generally be the situation, but there may be circumstances where both parties agree that, for a variety of reasons, holding them in private is the best option.  If they are both agreed on that, I do not see why it should not be provided for.</p>  <p>Coming back to the question of people who are not solicitors or barristers but just representatives for gain, they are unregulated in terms of fees and so on.  They are entitled to charge percentage fees, contingency fees and champerty, all of which are illegal for a solicitor.  I want to bring them in under the same codes of practice as exist for solicitors.</p>  <p>There are a number of other technical amendments but I mention two of them.  One is the question of the appointment of extra members in cases.  For example, in cases where there is a conflict of interest with one of the members there should be a possibility to appoint from a pool of reserve members.  We have tabled an amendment which provides for that.</p>  <p>There is also the question of amending the Organisation of Working Time Act because it states that penalising somebody should be an offence but I want to add to that "penalise or threaten to penalise" because the threat of a penalty against an employee is in some circumstances as severe as the actual penalising.  If someone says to somebody that they must do something, not do something, accept such a wage or the consequences will be such and such, the very threat itself is inimical to good workplace relations.  That is included in some recent legislation including the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, so there is a precedent for that.</p>  <p>I have not made a very wide-ranging speech but rather indicated to the Minister of State the areas on which I have tabled amendments.  I look forward to teasing them out and arguing them in substance when the Bill comes before the House again.</p></speech>

That speaks to the issue Senator Bacik mentioned about the Title.  In a previous life I worked in the private sector for quite a long time.  I was a director of human resources and logistics in a small to medium business where we had, on average, 50 employees.  Once I started reading this Bill I got excited because it streamlines the myriad of different pathways.  What is happening here is important.  The idea of workplace relations did not resonate with me in terms of what the Minister of State is trying to achieve with regard to the structure.  My experience of coming from an SME background is that it has a consequence on the culture of organisations.  It is hoped we may never have to use the structures that are available but it helps frame how someone puts in their human resources practice, designs their workplace and what they do in the workplace.  We have to be clear in what we are trying to achieve in that regard.</p>  <p>In his contribution the Minister of State committed to making some changes to the Bill, which I welcome.</p> <p>In fact, what drew my attention to the Bill was being contacted by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in respect of sections 72, 42 and 43.  As other Senators have outlined those issues, I look forward to the amendments on Committee Stage that will be tabled by the Government and by other Senators and then, if needed, an amendment may be brought forward on Report Stage.  However, I note that what is happening here is substantive.  I certainly will work with the Minister of State, as will other Senators, to ensure this Bill can be brought in at the earliest date to ensure good workplace practice.</p> <p>As I stated, it is also about a culture of ensuring pathways are available for employees whose rights are not being upheld and who need an opportunity to appeal or to have their rights upheld.  This must be streamlined, must be clear and must not be cumbersome.  Moreover, everyone must know what are their rights because when one knows what are one's rights, it is much more difficult for people to violate them.  I believe this is what the Minister of State is trying to do in this legislation.  I again welcome the Minister of State and thank him for introducing the Bill today in such detail.  I was happy to see the Minister of State outline where he intends to bring forward amendments, which takes a little pressure off Members.  Obviously, however, they still will be watching.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Government's decision to reform the State's existing employment rights and industrial relations structures, a process that was commenced by Deputy Calleary in the previous Administration.  Ireland has a stellar reputation in the area of workplace relations internationally and one reason we remain as a highly-favoured location for foreign direct investment is because the number of industrial disputes in Ireland, when compared with our competitors, is notably lower.  However, we must remain vigilant in the face of increasing competition internationally.  We must ensure that our employees and employers are provided with the proper workplace mechanisms to ensure that disputes, which inevitably will arise, will be addressed in an effective unbiased manner.</p>  <p>Fianna F&aacute;il believes this Bill will be a first step in guaranteeing the structures needed for the coming years.  My party will support the objective of a world-class workplace relations service, which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial, cost-effective and which provides for a workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period.  A cost-effective system, which delivers for employer and employee alike, would result in significant benefits for the Irish economy overall.  The system that has developed over the past 60 years may have become unwieldy, complex, inconsistent, slow and, in some cases, expensive for users.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports a streamlining of these structures to deliver a better service to those who find themselves obliged to rely on the mechanisms of the State to broker a compromise.  The fact that the services of the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Labour Relations Commission and, in the first instance, functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, are to come together under the remit of the proposed workplace relations commission, WRC, is a sensible move, as is the movement of the functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal, to be amalgamated into a reconfigured Labour Court.  However, Members on this side of the House seek clarification on how the officers of the respective bodies are to be integrated and the Minister of State may outline this in his response.</p>  <p>This Bill will not be judged a success or a failure on whether the structures look well on paper or even on how much money the streamlining of services will save.  The Bill will be judged as a success only if it provides the citizens and companies of Ireland with a more effective and cost-effective service in finding resolutions to disputes, in vindicating the rights of workers and employers and in securing Ireland as a great place in which to invest and to do business in the future.  Employees in Ireland are entitled to receive certain basic employment rights and those rights often need to be guarded.  Fianna F&aacute;il hopes this Bill will make those rights easier to guard than heretofore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1189" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400032#KK00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, and give a general welcome to his proposed legislation and apologise for having my telephone switched on.  While I concede I have not read this legislation in great detail, I listened to the Minister of State's contribution and certainly was both impressed and content with its tone.  In one sense, the necessity to have such detailed legislation indicates we have a long way to go in respect of relations in the workplace but we certainly are moving in the right direction.  The economic situation that has faced this country over the past five or six years and which now is being resolved slowly but surely, provided an environment in the workplace where jobs were so scarce and so difficult to come by and where people in employment were so happy to be there, that some of the previous industrial relations difficulties experienced in the 1980s and 1990s perhaps were deferred - I will not say they disappeared.<br/><br/>However, as the commencement of economic recovery can now be discerned, as can debates on wage increases across the public and private sectors, some issues that previously caused difficulty may come to the fore again and therefore, a good industrial relations mechanism would be helpful in that regard.  At the core of any good working environment must be the concept of respect, namely, respect from employer to employee and <i>vice versa</i>.  One will never have good employment without good employers and good employees and that is what we must aim towards because all the laws on the Statute Book can never ensure harmony and goodwill, which can only be provided within the workplace environment itself.  It is evident that some employers are very good in that respect while others still have much to learn.  However, we must aspire towards a solid working - if Members excuse the pun - relationship on the work floor because one cannot have good employment without good employers and one cannot have a good business without good employees.  Consequently, everyone must work in harmony to make progress.<br/><br/>The summary outlined in the explanatory memorandum provides Members with a clear picture of the aim of the Bill, namely, to create a modern, user-friendly, world-class employment workplace relations system providing significant benefits for its users and society as a whole.  Who could oppose that concept?  Issues will arise and I note the Minister of State already has referred to issues he intends to address by way of further amendment.  I look forward to this because I do not believe any legislation is ever perfect.  When drafted, no item of legislation ever appears to get the full picture initially but during the course of the debate, issues emerge and sometimes are dealt with.  It will be interesting if the Minister of State can take on board in the Seanad some issues raised in the D&aacute;il and which may be raised here on Second Stage.  I believe the Minister of State's openness to amendments and his being in a position to present amendments will be helpful to the overall debate.<br/><br/>As for the new body replacing some older agencies, streamlining in general is deemed to be effective.  Over the past decade, we have gone through a phase of politics and economics in which it was believed that streamlining inevitably was good.  While generally it was, there have been instances in which streamlined agencies have not produced the goods expected of them.  However, it certainly is to be hoped that the Workplace Relations Bill will be helpful in that regard.  On reading the list of bodies to be amalgamated, I note it includes the Labour Relations Commission.  If my recollection is correct, it has been a highly successful agency, the personnel of which have been dominant and I refer to one person in particular.  I believe it was set up in the late 1980s during the time of the first Programme for National Recovery.  It was perceived as a major step forward in that regard and it has engaged in all sorts of dispute resolution, not merely on the factory floor or in the workplace but on matters as diverse as the Cork county board's dispute with the players, as well as the famous concert in Croke Park last year.</p> <p>It is funny; an agency is set up and sometimes it engages in all sorts of extraneous affairs.</p> <p>I wish the Minister of State well with this legislation. If it provides harmony, goodwill and a fair resolution process as early as possible in a dispute, or a possible dispute, it will be making significant progress, and I look forward to that.  These are my initial and, I must concede, inadequate comments.  However, the legislation will be useful.  In a modern economy and a modern workplace, we must continually review our legislation on workers' and employers' rights.  The legislation is one necessary step in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2015-02-04a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2015020400033#LL00200"><p>We have had a very interesting and informative debate on what can sometimes be quite a complex area.  This is not about changing anyone's rights or entitlements.  It is about ensuring we have a streamlined system.  It in no way impacts on the suite of employment legislation that we have or on any of the hard-won rights garnered through that process over the years in this sphere or the equality sphere.  I hope I have made this clear in my earlier contribution.  I appreciate that Senator Bacik understands and accepts this.  She has a particular interest in this area.</p>  <p>I am looking forward to working with Members of the Seanad on Committee Stage.  We can have a very good engagement then.  In my initial remarks, I made it clear what amendments we will be suggesting and moving in the House.  It is not in anyone's interest to take the scenic route around this.  This legislation is a priority.  A significant amount of work has been done at official level in the Department and in the LRC and the Labour Court, which are some of the institutions that will migrate to the new workplace relations commission.  I sincerely thank the Members for their very helpful and well informed comments and observations on this legislation.  Before I do my best to respond to individual remarks made earlier on in the proceedings, I will take the opportunity to revisit the purpose of the Bill, because we should restate it.  </p>  <p>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to root and branch reforms which are currently being implemented in the State's existing workplace relations structures.  These structures have, by and large, served us well, but there are issues with them.  Promoting and supporting harmonious relationships in the workplace is a very important element in achieving lasting economic growth and creating and sustaining jobs.  Senator White referred to this.  Our continued economic recovery very much depends on having robust institutions that everyone can trust and in which everyone can have confidence.  To support this objective, we must have efficient, robust and efficacious mechanisms that citizens depend on and that economic growth and success also depend on.  Where disputes arise, the parties must be encouraged to resolve them, in the first instance, as informally as possible.  Where this is not possible, State intervention is often necessary to ensure we can resolve issues which can threaten industrial peace, erode people's working conditions and pay and have a negative effect on the economy and our reputation.</p>  <p>The Government and I remain committed to a fundamental reform of the workplace relations framework and structures.  We want to deliver a world-class workplace relations service, providing what I have referred to as an integrated industrial relations adjudication and enforcement service which, critically, is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial and cost-effective and provides for workable means of redress and enforcement within a reasonable period of time.  </p>  <p>It is worth saying that the decisions we will make on this legislation will probably outlive all of us.  We want these particular provisions to be in place for a long time.  We need to be mindful of this when we are legislating for something so important.  We need to design it to the highest possible standards, and I think we have managed to achieve this.  The resources we have will be put to their optimum use.  We will maximise our use of them.  We want them to be efficient and we want the process to be less complicated than is the case at the moment.  Senator Naughton spoke very eloquently of the problems that users - whether trade union officials, lawyers, employer representatives or individual complainants themselves - have in navigating what is a very complex system.  I know that Senator Craughwell and others have had experience of this over the years.  We are trying to turn this into a first-class system which is effective and responsive.  We have made considerable progress on this.  We want it to benefit everyone in our society.  We want to have an effective system that people can trust, that works from day one and that prevents the type of forum shopping that has characterised the system to date.  Through the fault of no one, the system developed in a very organic way over decades and is imperfect.  We have acknowledged this in terms of our commitment to legislate and to develop a better system.  I wish to recognise the work of the previous Government in kicking off this process. </p>  <p>I will turn, if I may, to a number of the individual points made.  I do not intend to respond to all of them.  We can have a more detailed discussion on Committee Stage and I look forward to that.  I will deal with the speakers in chronological order.  Senator O'Brien referred to the fees to access the workplace relations commission in section 72.  As a citizen, apart from anything else, I believe it is important that we ensure all citizens feel they can use this service and system.  It is for them.  It is to promote harmonious industrial relations and harmonious relations between employers and employees.  The fees issue is an important one.  However, I make no apologies for our proposal in legislating for this.  Where an appeal is made to the court and someone has not shown up to the original hearing, then the &euro;300 fee will be applied.  I do not think anyone will have a difficulty with this in principle.</p>  <p>Senator O'Brien made some important remarks on providing an opportunity for deferred pensioners, for example, to have their voice heard with regard to their pension situation.  This is a very current debate and I made reference to this on Report Stage when considering this legislation in the D&aacute;il.  It is something we need to return to, as a Parliament, over the next period of time.  I know that there are discussions ongoing within the system at the moment as to how we can best meet the requirements of that cohort of people who feel they do not have a voice in terms of what happens to their pension.  Often, it is a very difficult situation.  I speak specifically with respect to deferred pensioners.  </p>  <p>Senator Craughwell referenced issues to do with representation of trade unions at mediation.  The current practice of mediators in the Equality Tribunal does not restrict who can accompany a party at mediation.  I contend, to be frank, that there is no need to make specific provision for this at this point.  The practice of the Equality Tribunal will be continued.  This is an important point to make.  Senator Craughwell also referred to remarks I made about the vexatious or frivolous nature of some cases.  This is a legal term; it is not a pejorative term.  Of course, a decision by an adjudicator that a case is frivolous or vexatious can be appealed to the Labour Court.  Senator Craughwell also spoke about - he might correct me if I am wrong - the potentially never-ending process of appeals which can often take place.  It is my understanding of this legislation that decisions can be appealed to the Labour Court, but ultimately this is the final appellate court as such.  The only means of further appeal is to appeal to the High Court, and this is on a legal point alone.  I hope this addresses the issue raised by the Senator.</p>  <p>I appreciate the general remarks of Senator Naughton.  She referred to forum shopping and the complexity of the institutional arrangements that we have at the moment.  As I stated earlier, they tend to confuse even the most experienced of trade union officials sometimes, particularly when parallel cases are ongoing and it is often not very clear which forum might best resolve an issue.</p>  <p>The Senator also questioned whether hearings should be in public or in private.</p> <p>The Bill provides that hearings, in the first instance, would be held in private and appeals to the Labour Court would be held in public except in exceptional circumstances, and I outlined those circumstances earlier.  Only in the context of the Employment Appeals Tribunal are hearings held in public, and for good reason.  That has been the case for a long period.  There has not been any demand from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions or from IBEC for public hearings at the first instance.  We held an extensive consultation period around these institutional reforms with the key stakeholders - to the best of my recollection, two consultation processes - and did not detect any demand for hearings to be held in public at the first instance.  The holding of appeals in public meets the State's requirements in terms of the administration of justice in public and our obligations under article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p> <p>Senator Ivana Bacik has a very clear view in regard to the title of the institution and I have some sympathy for her in that regard.  It is an issue we will have to discuss again in the next period of time.  The proposal has a degree of merit and I understand and appreciate that.  It is possible that the Senator is right.  Perhaps the WRC description does not necessarily capture the full reach of the institution but I can assure her that in terms of its emphasis and the work it will undertake, there will be very much a focus on the equality agenda and ensuring that equality is respected and that we uphold the strong and robust anti-discrimination and equality laws, hard won achievements that we are not prepared to dilute in any way.  In terms of adjudicators, I expect that everybody will be trained to a very high standard in the National College of Ireland and there will be an emphasis on the equality side.  I will insist on that and it is very important.  </p> <p>The Senator referred to Schultz-Hoff.  Recently we have had some engagement with the social partners about how to best address those requirements under the Schultz-Hoff case.  We are doing that to address the requirements to the satisfaction of the social partners.  I went into more detail on that issue on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il but it is an issue we can discuss on Committee Stage.  I think all the stakeholders are satisfied that we will legislate for this and fulfil our obligations in terms of amendments to the Organisation of Working Time Act as it arises in terms of the Schultz-Hoff ruling.  </p> <p>I am glad the Senator raised zero hour, low hour contracts because that is an area of interest for me and many others in society.  What we do not want is a economic recovery, which we are undoubtedly having, that is characterised by a race to the bottom.  That is in nobody's interest.  We have certain protections here that are not in place in the UK in terms of how we apply the Organisation of Working Time Act and other important legislation supporting people who are working in vulnerable situations and ensuring they are not exploited.  As the House will be aware, I have commissioned a major study on the extent and prevalence of zero and low hour contracts and expect to have a report in the next few months.  I have asked the group undertaking this research for the Government to make recommendations on legislation that may need to be amended or regulations that may need to be changed to ensure we do not have a race to the bottom.  We always support and encourage good, strong and sustainable employment.  Sometimes low hour contracts suit people in certain circumstances but under no circumstances should they become the norm.  All of those issues will be addressed in the next period of time.  This is the first piece of research the State has undertaken on zero and low hour contracts.  That has been a deficiency in the past.  There are 32,000 zero hour contracts in Northern Ireland.  We are aware of this from significant research undertaken by the CIPD in the UK and Northern Ireland.  That is very valuable because it informs public policy making and I want to have the evidence before I and my Cabinet colleagues make any decisions on what to do to protect the vulnerable and those who are working on zero and low hour contracts.  We have got much anecdotal information through our constituency clinics, our own experiences and our own networks about the prevalence of such contracts, but we will address that issue in time.  </p> <p>Correct me if I am wrong, but I think Senator Bacik referred to the consolidation of employment rights legislation.  That is something that has been on the radar of successive Governments.  The logic of developing a new institutional framework would follow on to a situation where we would, in time, have a complete consolidation of the myriad pieces of employment rights legislation that can often be confusing and complex.  It is critical that citizens understand their rights and entitlements and that employers understand their responsibilities and obligations.  It is certainly on the agenda.  It is an enormous task and a huge piece of work and is something the system will respond to in time.  If the Senator is asking if this will be done this week or next week, I can categorically say "No".  I have addressed the fees issue which the Senator raised.</p> <p>Senator David Norris raised the issue of increasing fines for employers who are not compliant with the National Minimum Wage Act.  I implore the Senator to work with us on the establishment of the low pay commission and support our efforts to have that whole area reviewed before we start talking about the issues of fines and so on.  We are setting up the low pay commission, a very important public policy initiative and something which will be an important innovation on the landscape.  We will be progressing that in the near future and expect to have the first meeting of the new low pay commission in a matter of weeks.</p> <p>Senator Jillian van Turnhout reflected on the new institutional framework from an SME perspective.  As employees and workers often find it confusing and challenging to navigate the existing system, similarly SMEs who are constantly struggling for survival often cannot afford the expert advice needed to navigate these structures.  I see this system as working for the benefit of business and workers.  We want it to be citizen friendly and we do not want a situation where, in the first instance, people are expected to walk into a process with an army of experts, lawyers, barristers or experienced trade union officials.   I can assure those who raised this issue that I have personally spoken in recent days to some trade unions who are concerned about some elements of the package.  They have worked well with my Department as has IBEC and other interests on this potentially transformational set of reforms.  Where there are concerns, the Government and I have an open mind and will work to address those as best we can.  Of course, we may not accept everything that is proposed, but we certainly have an open mind.  </p> <p>I thank Senators for their contributions and look forward to working with them to ensure this necessary legislation is enacted as soon as possible to enable the workplace relations commission to do the job we have asked it to and a job that our economy and society needs it to do.</p></speech>

He is a regular visitor by now and a very worthwhile contributor.  He gets things done, which I like.<br/><br/>Nobody likes going to court.  Most people do not end up in court, but too many do.  The reason is that alternatives are not examined.  We have brought forward numerous proposals over the last number of years in respect of reducing the use of courts.  Successful motions have been agreed in the House on community courts and restorative justice practices.  Today, I am pleased to propose this motion on mediation.<br/><br/>In proposing the motion I acknowledge the significant amount of work that has been done to advance the cause of mediation in this country to date.  The ball started rolling in this respect when the Law Reform Commission considered it necessary to produce a report on mediation in 2010.  That report was published and its content made for interesting and common-sense reading.  Following that report, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to his credit, published the general scheme of a mediation Bill in 2012, which he referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member, for its analysis.  The committee sought public submissions and on their receipt engaged with stakeholders and made a series of recommendations, some of which were similar to what was recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  The reality is that wherever in the world mediation is operated it tends to be successful.  Indeed, in Ireland there is what I would describe as an <i>ad hoc</i>type of mediation, which is conducted by many good people in this country who facilitate it.  Its success rate is 80%.  It is certain that 80% of court cases do not end to people's satisfaction, so mediation works, even though it is <i>ad hoc</i>, unregulated and not really considered a profession in this country.  Imagine what could be achieved if mediation was operated properly.<br/><br/>I am anxious that the legislation be published.  It is not on the A list of legislation, but is on the B list.  A full Bill should be published in 2015 to professionalise and regulate the mediation sector in this country.  I wish to see a number of things happen.  First, there should be a register of mediators.  Second, there should be a certain standard of education for mediators.  Currently, somebody can call themselves a mediator if they complete 40 hours of professional training.  With the greatest respect, as I have no issue with the people who are providing the 40 hours of professional training, I do not consider that adequate or sufficient to enable people to provide the type of mediation that will work.  Obviously, there are very successful practitioners in this country who have achieved successful results, but we must have a professional approach.  In fact, I would favour a proper degree in mediation provided by some of the legal departments of our colleges.  I would also favour mediation being made a compulsory module within the LLB and BCL degree courses provided by our universities at present.  Mediation forms a part of some of the law degrees in this country, but it is essential that it become a compulsory element.<br/><br/>Similarly, it should be compulsory for barristers and solicitors to advise and recommend to their clients that in the first instance, and as a first response, they should consider mediation.  Some elements within the legal sector tend not to favour mediation because of the possible loss of fees, although that would only apply to a minority.  However, we must legislate to ensure that mediation is recommended in all company and civil cases.  At present it is a requirement in family law, and it works extraordinarily well in that area.  This country has done extraordinarily well in terms of mediation within family law, and I believe this should be extended to civil law, when neighbours are in dispute with each other, and company law, where companies are in dispute with suppliers and so forth.  There is no reason that mediation cannot be a first response in the vast majority of legal cases in this country.  At present it is not, and it should be.<br/><br/>There should be a proper regulatory authority to deal with mediation.  It would supervise and issue codes of conduct and practice in terms of education, disciplinary procedures, dealing with mediators and defining what is and is not acceptable.  We must ensure that when malpractice and bad standards occur there is some type of recourse for people and a regulator to whom they can make complaints.  The regulator would have power of censure.</p> <p>I want mediators to have a licence whereby they would have to apply for it and it would be subject to renewal.  I want there to be proper public awareness of mediation and of the service and work that mediators provide.  The level of knowledge of mediation in this country is currently very low.  That is something that can and should be changed and the introduction of this legislation would ensure that can happen.  I want international companies that are providing mediation services in this country regulated by such legislation.  We can become a centre of excellence in the area of mediation in this country.  We are considered to be a country that is well ahead of most of our peers when it comes to arbitration.  We are seen as being the seat of excellence for arbitration internationally, and not only in Europe.  There is no reason the same cannot happen in the area of mediation.  Given the high reputation we have internationally in peacekeeping and in terms of our having a neutral status, there is no reason in the world we cannot be a seat of excellence for mediation the same as we are the seat of excellence for arbitration.  All this can and should happen.  </p> <p>I would like 2015 to be the year when we get the legislation published and enacted.  That would be a significant first step to ensuring mediation in this country is properly regulated, that the public know about it, that mediators who are doing a professional job and want to be regulated are regulated, and where rogue mediators and people who put the word "mediation" after their name even though they do have a sufficient and appropriate qualifications to be able to do so are taken out of the system.  For too long we have had light touch regulation, be it in planning or in the supervision of architects and people who claimed to be architects having only completed a F&Aacute;S course on drawing.  The same was happening in those areas but thankfully that was tidied up and credit to this and previous Government for achieving that.  We now have a responsibility, as a core part of the overall suite of legal services reform in which the Government is engaging, to ensure that mediation needs to be the first responder.  I am happy to propose this motion in the hope that we will see a chain reaction following on from it where, by the end of 2015, we will have a mediation Act following the passing of such legislation by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

The Fianna F&aacute;il Party supports the notion of mediation services, as set out in the motion.  The only problem we would have is that we would criticise the Government's delay in the publication of the mediation Bill, the general scheme of which was agreed in 2012.  The proper codification of mediation services in Ireland would have the potential to reduce business and legal costs in a significant way and bring about a reduction in the time parties to disputes spend in court.  I concur with many of the points made by my colleague, Senator Conway.</p>  <p>A pilot mediation programme conducted in the Dublin district and circuit courts in 2013 resulted in 831 concluded agreements, which resulted in saving an estimated 11.3% of court sitting time and annual savings of &euro;119,000 plus in Courts Service costs, in addition to &euro;225,000 in legal and board costs.  We urgently need the enactment of the mediation Bill to make these cost savings widely available as well as delivering faster and better quality outcomes for those involved in disputes.  </p>  <p>A draft general scheme of a mediation Bill was published in 2012 by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The aim of the proposed Bill is to encourage and facilitate the use of mediation in resolving civil, commercial and family disputes.  It seeks to provide an effective and efficient alternative to litigation by reducing legal costs and speeding up the resolution of disputes.  There are a few important points I wish to put on the record.  As currently drafted, and subject to the Bill going through the Houses, the scheme of Bill introduces a new statutory obligation on solicitors and barristers to inform their clients, prior to commencing court proceedings on their behalf, about the possibility of using mediation as an alternative means of resolving a dispute.  That is a central plank of the proposed legislation.  It provides that all mediation related communication between parties shall be confidential, an essential ingredient.  It also provides that it is for the parties themselves to determine the enforceability of any agreement reached as a result of the mediation.  It further provides a statutory basis for the courts to invite parties to consider mediation and adjourn court proceedings while mediation is ongoing, echoing existing procedures in the court rules.</p>  <p>This is not world breaking news, although it is in the mediation circle, but if we consider the high profile case involving our international and famed golfer currently before the courts, it was decided to give the parties another six hours or another day and, hopefully, the matter could be worked out through mediation.  That makes a good deal of sense, rather than the adversarial position that is sometimes adopted in courts.  The Bill also introduces an obligation on mediators to provide the parties with information on their training and qualification.  The Bill contains a provision that allows parties to request a mediator at any time during the mediation process to make proposals to resolve the dispute, which the parties can then accept or reject.  Such a request would effectively convert the process into conciliation.  Conciliation is a particularly popular mechanism for resolving disputes in the construction industry, as has already been set out.  The provision in the Bill is not expanded in detail and therefore it is likely to be the subject of further debate as it is developed.  I urge that the Minister would introduce the Bill in the Seanad first and then by the time it gets through both Houses, certain improvements and changes can be made to the Bill.  </p>  <p>The Bill is not intended to replace existing systems for resolving disputes outside of courts systems, such as those operated by the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court in the employment field, or the Private Residential Tenancies Board in regard to landlord and tenant disputes.  It would work in tandem with them and not as a replacement for them.  </p>  <p>The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I am a member, has already completed pre-legislative scrutiny of the concept of this Bill.  However, the Government has yet to indicate when the Bill will be published in full and brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I hope the Minister of State will clarify that here tonight, as has been requested also by Senator Conway.</p>  <p>I am sure I do not have to remind the Minister of State that the Fine Gael-Labour programme for Government called for the encouragement and facilitation of mediation to resolve civil disputes, which is an aspect of their proposals with which I on this side of the House, and we as a party, would concur.  The programme states that mediation will deliver significant costs and time savings for businesses and the State and that the  Mediators Institute of Ireland, known as the MII, has demonstrated that significant savings can be made through mediation. </p>  <p>Mediation is a voluntary process of conflict prevention and resolution that allows the parties an opportunity to address their issues in a confidential, private and safe environment.  Mediators are trained in conflict resolution skills and techniques and have the expertise needed to give people the best possible opportunity to resolve their disputes.  I am not an expert on family law; it was not my forte, and when I was studying law family law was not even on the curriculum.  However, having been a practising solicitor for many years, I have found from my experience that it is essential in the very sensitive and tense negotiations in family cases in particular, and sometimes also in commercial cases, that people can stand back from the fray and try to settle these disputes outside the court.  The adversarial system often drives a wedge between parties and sometimes that gap cannot be bridged.  </p>  <p>I support the motion.  This is a welcome development and we urge the Minister of State, in so far as he can, to fast-track the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would like to see it introduced in this House first.  We need extra legislation in this Chamber. </p></speech>

I again welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to the House, and commend Senator Conway on introducing this motion.  It is in keeping with his general interest in this area, of which I am aware because I am a colleague of his on the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  The motion calls for the Government to commit to the publication of the mediation Bill.  Others have spoken of the history of the Bill, the scheme of which was published by the then Minister for Justice and Equality in March 2012 on foot of the publication of a Law Reform Commission report in November 2010, which made a range of recommendations and included a draft Bill.  As Senator O'Donovan has noted, a commitment was also included in the programme for Government to encourage and facilitate the use of mediation.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the heads of the Bill was held by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in May 2012, which then published a report on it in June 2012 and I wish to speak briefly on some of the aspects on which the joint committee reported.</p>  <p>In general, however, as Senator Conway in particular has stated, the use of mediation is already well-established in family law and solicitors in family law disputes have a statutory duty to advise their clients about the option of mediation.  We have had in place a well-established Family Mediation Service since 1986, which assists and offers an effective mediation service for families facing relationship breakdown and that is very important.  However, mediation is not limited to family law, as we also have established mediation practices in respect of labour relations and industrial relations and I note that earlier today, Senators were debating the Workplace Relations Bill in this Chamber, which proposes to create a stronger emphasis on mediation services in workplace relations in general.  Again, this was welcomed by all sides.</p>  <p>The objective of the Government's proposed mediation Bill is to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings throughout a range of civil, commercial and family law disputes.  It clearly goes well beyond the established mechanisms in family law and in the workplace.  Again, this has received a broad welcome.  When the joint committee held its hearings, it received submissions from a number of groups and individuals and heard from a range of different entities, which included the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators, the Dublin Solicitors Bar Association and Family Mediation Ireland.  Essentially, the justice committee heard of the need to ensure greater regulation of mediators overall, as Senator Conway has noted, as well as the need to ensure that in a particular type of mediation, namely, family law dispute mediation, there might be specific principles for which provision would be needed, particularly for child-centred mediation practice.</p>  <p>I acknowledge the heads of the Bill proposed to make specific provision for the involvement of children in mediation and family law disputes if it was in their best interests.  Some of the general principles also would have to give way to specific principles in the case of family law disputes.  The Law Reform Commission report also acknowledged this and there are a couple of points in this regard.  The commission set out the need for a statutory code of practice for mediators and this came up again at the joint committee's hearings.  However, it also made recommendations beyond what one might think of as the typical mediation scenario.  For instance, one strong recommendation was that in a dispute arising out of alleged medical negligence cases, health care professionals should be able to make an apology without this being an admission of liability.  While this is a very difficult and contentious area, it is worth noting that the Law Reform Commission had addressed it back in 2010.</p>  <p>I will turn briefly to the justice committee's comments on the heads of the Bill.  While its recommendations are being considered by the Government at present, like the others I wish to ascertain what will be the timeframe for the Bill's introduction, given the general welcome for it and the agreement of everyone on the need for it.  However, I am glad the recommendations made and points raised by the joint committee are being considered and that the heads may be amended accordingly.  The first issue we raised was that of public awareness, as there is a good deal of ignorance about the availability of mediation services.  Many people go through the court system almost as a default without considering mediation.  In that regard, the joint committee welcomed the fourth head, which provided that solicitors must, prior to commencing civil proceedings on behalf the client, advise the client to consider using mediation.  The joint committee suggested there might be some strengthening of this duty and that there must be some obligation to provide a particular type of information or to require the Courts Service to make available information to potential litigants or in other words, to broaden the duty beyond the solicitor.  Senator Conway already dealt with the issue of regulation of mediators and the absence of any regulation of mediation practice was a real difficulty that was addressed before the joint committee.  Allied to that, another issue raised before the joint committee was that there is no single list or register of mediators and therefore, the public cannot see whether a person has any training or is following any particular code of conduct.  I acknowledge this matter was addressed by Senator Conway.</p>  <p>On a similar note, the joint committee suggested it should be mandatory for all mediators to publish a code of conduct under which they practised and I believe the Bill seeks to address this through the preparation.  I understand this issue is being considered on foot of the Oireachtas pre-legislative scrutiny stage before the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I understand there is discussion about the establishment of an oversight and development body which would, among other things, prepare codes of practice for mediators and would oversee the application of any approved code.  However, it may well be that different codes of practice would apply, depending on the type of dispute.  As I stated, family law disputes would have particular considerations that would not apply in other cases.</p>  <p>The joint committee also examined the issue of confidentiality and while that is provided for in the heads of the Bill, we suggested that head No. 10 be amended to provide statutory protection for mediators against being called as a witness in subsequent legal proceedings unless it was overwhelmingly in the interests of justice that the mediator give evidence.  This really was to ensure that confidentiality was strengthened.  Finally, the joint committee considered the issue of the withdrawal of a mediator.  Some of those who made submissions to the joint committee stated that heads appeared to oblige a mediator to give reasons if the mediator wished to withdraw and we thought this was not in accordance with best practice.</p>  <p>My final point is that all Members would welcome the publication of this Bill.  Ireland could be a centre for international mediation and international arbitration given its location and the number of multinational firms that are here.  That point came up repeatedly at the hearings before the joint committee.  I acknowledge this is a concern for everyone but the Bill must be published as soon as possible in order to ensure that this becomes the case.</p></speech>

I certainly concur with Senators O'Donovan and Bacik about urging the Minister to bring the Bill before the Seanad first and I hope a clear date will be given in this regard.  I believe the Seanad is highly conducive to this type of Bill, by virtue of the manner and the environment in which it works and on such issues, it has proven itself to be a good forum.  As Members have stated, the area of mediation that requires legislation ranges across the medical, family, civil, personal injury, property and commercial fields.  While this is quite a wide area, obviously, the area I know best is family law and that is where my main focus will be today  However, on reading the motion tabled, the first thing I did was to contact Ms Josepha Madigan, who I believe has written the only book to be written in Ireland on appropriate dispute resolution.  While Ms Madigan is a family lawyer, she also is a practising mediator and a former council member of the Mediators Institute of Ireland.  Consequently, for my contribution today, I have gleaned knowledge and have taken quite a lot of information from her because she is an expert in this area.  I should also note she is a Fine Gael councillor, so one side of the House will be happy and I will not comment on the other.</p></speech>

I do not plan to read them all out but when one goes through the recommendations, what is interesting is that many of them have been done or are near completion because the profession itself can develop them and is doing the work in these areas.  In this context, for example, it was recommended that the Courts Service should commission or prepare comprehensive information booklets on the process of mediation, that the form of regulation for mediators should continue to be self-regulation through a mediation professional body and that there be a code of conduct for mediators and that mediators must receive training and accreditation.  However, other areas called for by the Law Reform Commission, some of which are really important, are all dependent on the Minister and the Bill being transposed into legislation.  For instance, it would place on a statutory footing for mediation both domestic and cross-border issues.  Moreover, as the Law Reform Commission has recommended, there is a need for a distinct form of privilege to be set for mediation and Members must ensure this happens.  In addition, the panel of accredited mediators should be extended to the legal aid board because one should avoid the scenario whereby one can get mediation if one can afford it but not otherwise.</p> <p>The message that mediation can save the Exchequer substantial moneys is demonstrated in the recent EU report, Rebooting the Mediation Directive, which highlights that if a 9% success rate is achieved in civil and commercial medication, it creates savings for the state.  In Ireland, the Family Mediation Service has a 43% success rate and, in a recent survey, members of the Mediators' Institute of Ireland said they had a 56% success rate at the Equality Tribunal.  Mediation works, particularly on a human level.  I would like there to be an opportunity for all disputes to go to mediation and we should ensure a mediation information meeting is compulsory for all parties to attend prior to the issuing of court proceedings.  Participation in mediation is voluntary and can never be mandated but an information meeting should be compulsory.  Perhaps we watch too many American television programmes and we have only one picture of mediation but we need to understand how well mediation works and how important it is.</p> <p>The book published by Ms Josepha Madigan clearly outlines family law.  In such cases, we think of a parting husband and wife, their concerns for the children, maintenance and the family home.  However, the type of cases coming before the courts is ever expanding.  They involve unmarried parents, cohabitees, same-sex couples, grandparents with rights of access and donors of sperms or eggs for IVF treatment.  In addition, the issues to be resolved are much more complex.  Some reflect the current state of the economy such as applications to relocate.  Another complicating factor is the increase in family cases involving one or more parties from outside the State, in which need cultural aspects need to be understood and addressed.  Mediation can very much help in this regard.</p> <p>A common factor in almost every family law case, however, according to Ms Madigan, is the emotional aspects such as hurt, disappointment, lack of trust and often anger.  In this context, the adversarial system in our courts is a blunt instrument, limiting and often preventing the opportunity for positive communication between the parties.  As a result, family law cases that go to court can cause further damage to the relationship between the parties and their children and such cases can be frustrating, stressful or both for all involved, including the lawyers and judges.  Countries with a similar adversarial system to Ireland such as England, Australia, New Zealand and Canada have introduced non-adversarial mechanisms such as mediation as an integral part of family law proceedings.  We need to catch up in this area.  Legislative changes have been made here but what is contained in the heads of the proposed Bill needs to be implemented.  All too often in family law cases, the voice of the child is not heard and his or her best interests are not paramount.</p> <p>I hope the Minister of State has good news for the House.  I am very supportive of the motion.</p></speech>

There are only advantages to mediation.  Most disputes can be followed by mediation almost immediately, thereby preventing the bitterness and distress resulting from court cases from creeping in.  Most cases will take at least a year to be heard in the courts and these delays to proceedings can also lead to severe hardship.  The important element of mediation is the parties themselves set the rules and they are empowered.</p></speech>

It also allows parties to regain trust in each other and to know they can continue to interact and work together while also enabling them to find common ground.</p>  <p>When parties engage in litigation, the pleadings to ground the case can be bitter and this leads to difficulties in areas where there was no dispute originally.  Mediation takes parties away from the battleground of litigation to a neutral venue and it is also more economic for the State because legal proceedings can often be a heavy burden for the State to carry, especially when the Legal Aid Board is involved in civil family law proceedings.  The board has a massive caseload and most of its solicitor or barristers are in court on numerous occasions dealing with preliminary applications.  Mediation avoid this time wasting and gets to the point of the dispute.</p>  <p>As Senator O'Donovan said, it is timely to discuss this issue today given the case involving the famous golfer.  After all the brouhaha and publicity in the media, he is sorting it out through mediation.  If we can regulate mediation through legislation, as Senator Bacik said, we could become a European or world centre for mediation and arbitration, as we are respected throughout the world in that regard.  It would be an important step forward.</p>  <p>Unlike Senator O'Donovan, I would not criticise for not having the Bill on the A list.  There is a huge legislative programme but it is important to deal with the Bill, hopefully in the lifetime of the Government.  It would be a great achievement and it would be great it if it were introduced in the Seanad.</p>  <p>There is a need, as previous speakers said, for the registration and regulation of all mediators.  A person cannot just do a weekend course and say, "Here I am now.  I am ready to solve the world's problems.  Bring them to me".  Mediation must be properly regulated.  Training and accreditation needs to be professionally aligned and regulated.  Currently, there are more than 40 mediation training bodies in the State providing courses ranging from one day tuition to masters programmes.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 mediators are turned out annually with little or no opportunity to practice or gain experience.  The driver to train in most instances is to support funding requirements for organisations.  Training must be regulated and must not be left to vested interests.</p>  <p>Many bodies have been mentioned.  Representatives of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators are in the Visitors Gallery.  They are interested in the debate and the progress of the Bill.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Arbitrators is represented in the Gallery today.  Its members are very interested in this debate and the progress of the Bill.  They are very concerned about the quality of training offered to accredit mediators.  The idea that one can spend 40 hours or 60 hours in training, after which, following an assessment, one can advertise as a mediator is of serious concern.  I urge the Minister of State to use his best offices and to speak to the powers that be to get the Bill into the Seanad as soon as possible.</p></speech>

He will second the amendments, which were tabled to enhance the motion, not to take away from it.  We support the broad thrust of the motion.  Like Senator Jim D'Arcy, I am not a solicitor and I do not have a legal background, but I do have experience in the family law area, as he does.  Mediation is a better way to deal with some issues and it is a practice that has been introduced in recent years that helps in the family law area.<br/><br/>Comparisons may be made with the concept of restorative justice from the criminal point of view.  The principle of restorative justice is based on mediation between the perpetrator and the victim at very low levels of anti-social activity.  The intention is to build up trust and to get people talking.  It is seen as a better way than to have the criminal justice system dealing with it on its own.  In family law and other areas there is a breakdown in trust.  There are emotional issues and all sorts of other factors come into play.  Let us be honest: solicitors do make a lot of money from these issues where they can play parties against each other.  Mediation is a better way to deal with such matters.  When people are adults, they approach it from that perspective and they want to resolve conflict, which is essentially at the heart of the matter.  One needs a facilitator when two people come together or in cases other than family law when parties come together to try to get agreement on something.  Mediation offers people the opportunity to talk through issues and develop agreements that are in everyone&rsquo;s interest in a much more constructive way.  It is a positive step forward.<br/><br/>I share some of the concerns that have been expressed about accreditation, which is hugely important as well, but the broad thrust of the Private Members' motion is something we support.  I did not intend to speak but I wish to put on record my support for mediation services based on my experience.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh will deal with the amendments that have been tabled.</p></speech>

I compliment my colleague, Senator Conway, on tabling the motion.  It should help to give a sense of urgency in order that the legislation can be introduced more quickly.  No doubt the Minister of State will take on board the calls that have been made tonight for him to urge the Cabinet to bring the Bill forward as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>I like the concept of mediation.  The general objective of the mediation Bill is to promote mediation as a viable, effective and efficient alternative to court proceedings.  Like other speakers, I was really delighted to hear, in the very high-profile case involving the golfer Rory McIlroy and a man with Galway connections in Horizon Sports Management-----</p></speech>

Mediation is a flexible process that is conducted confidentially, in which a third party assists the parties to a dispute in working towards a negotiated settlement.  As Senator Jim D&rsquo;Arcy said, the outcome, hopefully, is much more amicable and the parties can build on the goodwill that emerges through the successful resolution of disputes through mediation.</p>  <p>Another very significant issue in the achievement of a mutually agreeable resolution through mediation is that it can yield significant cost savings compared to litigation and arbitration, which might otherwise have been pursued.  We all know the huge cost of going to court.  Very often, parties who end up in court discover, much to their cost, that the vast bulk of what they were arguing about goes to the legal profession in trying to resolve matters, whereas if they had got around a table with a third party, mediation could have resulted in a much more satisfactory outcome.  The cost implications and the resolution of contentious matters that can be achieved through the mediation process make it worthwhile.</p>  <p>The mediation process improves communications, narrows outstanding issues, defuses emotions and defines areas of agreement.  Sometimes it can play a very important role even if the issue ends up in court.  The mediation process can help to narrow the difference between parties, and even when it takes court involvement to achieve a final outcome, the mediation process is recognised as making a very valuable contribution towards the ultimate resolution of issues.</p>  <p>Although he has endured much criticism in his time, it would be appropriate to pay tribute to the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, for the publication of the mediation Bill in draft form, and to recognise the fine work done by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on the issue.  Like other speakers, I urge the Minister of State to ensure there is urgency in the introduction of the legislation, as it has a major contribution to make towards a much better understanding between people in dispute.</p>  <p>The regulation issue, to which reference has been made is important.  It is important that there is a proper register to ensure that those operating as mediators have the proper skills and training to deliver proper and satisfactory outcomes to the clients to whom they provide a service.  All in all, what is proposed is very positive.  I again commend Senator Conway on helping to table the motion.  I hope that before the end of this year we will see significant developments in the legislative process.</p></speech>

Mar a deir mo chomhghleaca&iacute;, an Seanad&oacute;ir Cullinane, i bprionsabal aonta&iacute;onn Sinn F&eacute;in leis na smaoint&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; chur chinn.  Tr&eacute;asla&iacute;m le mo chomhghleaca&iacute; as Contae an Chl&aacute;ir, an Seanad&oacute;ir Conway, at&aacute; tar &eacute;is an r&uacute;in a chur chun cinn, ach n&iacute; aonta&iacute;onn muid go bhfuil br&uacute; s&aacute;ch l&aacute;idir &aacute; chur ag an Rialtas maidir leis an gceist seo.</p>  <p>There has been much talk and speculation in the lifetime of the Government about the long-awaited Legal Services Regulation Bill.</p> <p>It seeks to provide for reform of the law relating to the charging of costs by legal practitioners and the system of the assessment of costs relating to the provision of legal services.</p> <p>We first got sight of the Legal Services Regulation Bill on 12 October 2011.  It was debated on Second Stage two months later, and yet here we are, in February 2015, and it has still to complete Committee Stage.  However, the mediation Bill, in the context of cost issues and resolving matters, could be as important for citizens as this Bill.  So much of what happens in family law and civil law could be resolved at an early stage with a robust mediation process, and yet it is also stuck in the system.</p> <p>The draft general scheme of the mediation Bill was published in 2012.  The Government listed the mediation Bill for publication in late 2013.  In April 2013, the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, stated that the Bill would be published in early 2014, and we are still waiting.  We are expected to acknowledge the Government's commitment to further develop and expand mediation services throughout the State.  We cannot do that and that is why we have tabled the amendment.  I second the amendment that has been put forward.  I am sure the Minister of State will understand that I and my party find it difficult to acknowledge this and, therefore, he will understand my amendment suggesting the deletion of this section.</p> <p>The Government should show its commitment to developing and expanding mediation services throughout the State by bringing this Bill through in the lifetime of this Government, which we all know is running out.  During a contribution in the D&aacute;il, the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, pointed to the major benefits that would be delivered to the court system and society at large with the enactment of the Bill through increased use of mediation to resolve disputes.  We call on his successor, Deputy Fitzgerald, to continue with the work started and ensure the passage of this Bill as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>Mr. Tom Ward, chief clerk of the Dublin Circuit and District Courts, reported that a pilot mediation programme that ended on 31 August 2013 resulted in 831 concluded agreements, which resulted in saving an estimated 11.33% of court sitting time and annual savings of &euro;119,476 in Courts Service costs plus &euro;225,164 in Legal Aid Board costs.  The money saved via this process is glaringly evident.  Why are we not seizing on the opportunity both to increase access to justice for all and to save money?  The delay is baffling.  We urgently need enactment of the mediation Bill to make these cost savings widely available as well as delivering faster and better quality outcomes for those involved in disputes.</p> <p>Access to justice in its widest sense of the effective resolution of disputes, whether through court-based litigation or alternative dispute resolution processes, is an essential aspect of ensuring the realisation of the fundamental rights recognised and given protection by the Constitution.  Mediation procedures increase access to justice for all, but particularly for some of the most vulnerable in society, and this is more important than ever.  In promoting access to justice, a modern civil justice system should offer a variety of approaches and options to dispute resolution, not only costly solutions.  We need to ensure that we are offering a wider range of options to suit all.</p> <p>I and Sinn F&eacute;in are supporting this motion, but I want to be clear in saying that the Government's actions on this so far are not good enough.  I urge the Government to step up and prove its commitment to mediation services by bringing this Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency.  I note that Senators Conway, Bacik and others have also called for this.  It would be a shameful indictment of the Government if the Bill fails to go through in its lifetime.  It is now time for action, not more talk.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuilimid ag cur chun cinn na leasuithe at&aacute; molta againn.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn glacadh leis go bhfuil an Rialtas i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re faoin mBille seo muna bhfuil s&eacute; in ann l&eacute;iri&uacute; d&uacute;inn anocht go bhfuil s&eacute; ag iarraidh an Bille a bhr&uacute; tr&iacute;d chomh tapaidh agus is f&eacute;idir.

I am pleased, therefore, to have this opportunity to address on her behalf the important subject of mediation.  I thank the Senators for providing me with the opportunity to address this important issue.</p>  <p>As Senators will be aware, the programme for Government for National Recovery 2011 - 2016 contains the following commitment: "We will encourage and facilitate use of mediation to resolve commercial, civil and family disputes in order to speed up resolution of disputes, reduce legal costs and ameliorate the stress of contested court proceedings."  The general position is that the Minister for Justice and Equality obtained Government approval for publication of the general scheme of the proposed mediation Bill in March 2012.  The contents of the general scheme of the Bill were subsequently considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  That committee's subsequent report identified a number of specific issues meriting further examination in the context of the drafting of the Bill.  The current position is that the Bill is being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC.  Senators will appreciate that the Government has a demanding schedule of urgent Bills which are currently being drafted in the OPC.  For that reason, it is not possible to give a specific date for publication of the Bill at this stage.  However, the Minister has asked me to say that she intends to proceed quickly with enactment of the legislation following publication later this year.</p>  <p>During this short intervention, I want to focus on certain key provisions of the Bill.  The Department has met Ms Josepha Madigan on the Bill.  The Bill, when published, will take account of her valuable insights.  One of the main aspects of the Bill is the introduction of a key provision which provides for the introduction of an obligation on solicitors to advise their clients to consider utilising mediation as an alternative to court proceedings for the resolution of disputes.  Under the section, it is proposed that a solicitor must advise his or her client to consider using mediation as an alternative means of resolving the dispute; provide the client with information concerning mediation services, including the names and addresses of persons or organisations qualified to provide such services; and provide an estimate of the legal costs likely to arise in the event of court proceedings, together with an estimate of legal costs if the client is unsuccessful in those proceedings.  This provision further requires that any person commencing civil proceedings must provide the court with a written statement confirming that his or her solicitor advised on the possible use of mediation as an alternative to the court proceedings for settling the dispute.  I should add that the Bill places a similar obligation on a barrister with regard to the provision of information on mediation.</p>  <p>The Bill further provides that mediation may be embarked upon by parties on their own initiative at any stage prior to, or after the commencement of, court proceedings.  The section also contains a provision which is designed to reinforce the fundamental principle that the outcome of a mediation process shall be determined by the parties themselves.  It also underlines the principle that participation in mediation is voluntary, and any party involved in a mediation process may withdraw from it at any time and without explanation.</p>  <p>The Bill also contains important provisions concerning the role of the mediator.  It requires a mediator to prepare a written agreement on the terms of the mediation process; places an obligation on the mediator to establish whether he or she has, or may have, any existing or potential conflicts of interest in the case; and sets out the information which must be given by the mediator to the parties before the commencement of the process, and which includes information concerning the voluntary nature of the process, the manner in which the mediation process can be concluded and confirmation that the outcome of the process will be determined by the parties themselves.</p>  <p>The Minister believes that parties to mediation should be informed as far as possible in making decisions regarding a choice of mediator.  For that reason, the Bill contains a requirement that a mediator must, before the commencement of the mediation process, provide details to all parties of his or her training and experience in mediation.  This is in line with the practice already set out in various voluntary codes of practice for mediators.  A mediator must also, if requested, provide a party with information regarding any specialist training he or she might have which would be relevant to the matter at hand as well as details of any continuing professional development activities which he or she has undertaken.</p>  <p>Confidentiality is a basic and fundamental aspect of any mediation process.  Therefore, the Bill will provide that confidentiality should generally apply to communications made during mediation processes.  However, in certain circumstances, the interests of justice would not be served by confidentiality and the Bill therefore provides that it will not apply where disclosure of a mediation communication is necessary to implement any agreement arising from the mediation; where disclosure is necessary to prevent physical or psychological injury to a party; where disclosure is required by law; where a mediation communication is used to commit or conceal a crime, or to threaten a party to the mediation process; and where the communication is needed to prove or disprove a civil claim relating to alleged negligence or misconduct of a mediator during the mediation.</p>  <p>The Bill also provides that the parties alone have the power to determine whether an agreement has been reached and the manner in which it becomes enforceable.  The section further provides that a court may, on the application of the parties to any written agreement reached at mediation, enforce the agreement.</p> <p>In addition, the Bill provides that a court may, either on the application of any party involved in proceedings or of its own motion, where it considers it appropriate having regard to the circumstances of the case, invite the parties to consider using mediation as an alternative to the proceedings.  The Bill also provides that where a court has invited parties to consider using mediation, it may, in awarding costs in the proceedings, have regard to any unreasonable refusal by a party to consider using mediation where such a process had, in the court's opinion, a reasonable prospect of success.</p> <p>Following publication of the general scheme, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality held two days of oral hearings and, subsequently, in June 2012, published a report on the general scheme of the Bill.  While the committee's report did not make recommendations, it presented some observations on particular issues which arose both from the submissions received by the committee and during the oral hearings.  A key issue identified by the committee was the possible establishment of a regulatory structure for the mediation sector.</p> <p>The Minister has asked me to inform the House that, following receipt of the report of the joint committee, her Department held consultations with several mediation bodies and individual mediators on the issues identified in the report, in particular the possible establishment of a regulatory structure.  The position regarding the establishment of such a regulatory structure is that the Minister is conscious that many qualified mediators are drawn from professions which are already subject to strict regulatory oversight.  They include members of the legal profession and professionals from fields as diverse as accountancy, engineering and social work.  Any new regulatory structures for mediators must take due account, therefore, of the existence of these regulatory regimes and ensure that any further regulatory burdens and compliance costs are both necessary and proportionate.</p> <p>One possible way forward would be to give statutory recognition to a representative body or council established by the mediation sector itself.  Such a body could be entrusted with functions such as promoting public awareness of and providing information to the public about the availability and operation of mediation services across the State; maintaining and developing standards for the provision of mediation services; drawing up and overseeing the operation and application of codes of practice for mediators; establishing and maintaining a register of mediators who have signed up to approved codes of practice; developing and approving continuing professional development activities for mediators; and advising on the establishment and operation of mediation information sessions in family law cases.</p> <p>The discussions which have taken place with mediation bodies have focused on the establishment of such a structure.  The intention is that it would be self-financing and would consist of representatives drawn from across the mediation sector.</p> <p>The Minister has asked me to refer to another important provision which will be included in the forthcoming Bill.  The Government believes that mediation has a particularly important role to play as an alternative to adversarial family law proceedings.  Mediation can provide a less stressful and adversarial process for the resolution of cases of family breakdown and the related issues of custody and access to children.  The Bill will contain a provision, therefore, which will require parties embarking on such proceedings to attend mediation information sessions.  Such a requirement is in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on mediation and conciliation.  Discussions have taken place with the Legal Aid Board on this issue and the board has indicated that it would be willing to assist in the provision of mandatory information sessions in family law cases involving children.</p> <p>I should also point out that there is an increasing international trend towards the use of mediation as a tool for the resolution of civil disputes.  For example, a mediation directive has been adopted at European Union level and has been given effect throughout the EU since 2011.  The directive has been given effect here in the European Communities (Mediation) Regulations 2011.</p> <p>I thank Senators for tabling this motion and for providing the House with an opportunity to discuss this important subject.  I appreciate that Senators are anxious for this Bill be brought before the Seanad first and I will communicate their desire directly to the Minister herself.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Conway on tabling this Private Members' motion.  I will be brief because most of the areas I wanted to cover have been dealt with.  I second Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's amendment.</p>  <p>The Minister of State said the Bill is being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  We must appreciate the fact that the Government has a number of very important Bills before it, so this legislation must take its place in the queue.  As Senator O'Donovan pointed out, the pilot mediation programme conducted in the Dublin District and Circuit Courts in 2013 resulted in 831 concluded agreements.  This resulted in saving an estimated 12% of court sitting time and an annual saving of more than &euro;120,000 in Courts Service costs and &euro;225,000 in Legal Aid Board costs.</p>  <p>This is important legislation for ordinary people, so it should be enacted as quickly as possible.  Just today in the High Court, mediation worked and saved enormous costs in the Rory McIlroy case.  It is therefore something worth examining.  This Bill will not deal with celebrities but with ordinary citizens.  In his comprehensive contribution, the Minister of State said that barristers and solicitors will be obliged to inform their clients about mediation.  That matter should also be examined.</p>  <p>I will not take up any more time as most of the areas I wished to raise have been covered and there is no point in repeating them.</p></speech>

I commend Senator Conway on bringing forward this motion.  I will not pretend to be an expert in this area and I bow to the experience of my colleagues who have a far more in-depth knowledge about it.  I could write what I know about law on the back of a postage stamp.  Having read the motion and undertaken some research on it, however, I have found that there is currently no regulation of mediation services.  That is why the necessary legislation would be most welcome.</p>  <p>Senator Conway's motion urges the Government to publish the relevant Bill.  I support his call, while taking into account that pre-legislative scrutiny took place as far back as 2012.  Let us not ignore that having a mediator and mediation can be effective.  As part of civil proceedings, mediation could save an individual requiring legal intervention from costly legal cases, including family cases involving divorce, child contact in residence, as well as debt, housing, immigration, welfare and employment.</p>  <p>It is a constitutional right to have legal representation, which the State is obliged to provide to those who do not have the means to afford a solicitor.  However, to acquire free legal aid services, the Legal Aid Board has laid out financial eligibility requirements.  These deal with the uncertainty of acquiring legal services needed by a client.  The Law Reform Commission recommended that solicitors should advise their clients to seek a mediator as an alternative to litigation.</p>  <p>In May 2014, Ms Karen Irwin said that not all solicitors necessarily know about or practise mediation.  What they are giving is a definition as opposed to listening to what the case is about and deciding whether it is suitable for mediation, how long it might take and how much it might cost.  One is really asking somebody to give an opinion on something about which they may know nothing.  It has proven to be entirely unsuccessful in cases involving separated couples and this is why the mandatory information provision was introduced.  Without it, the procedure did not work.</p>  <p>As we all know, divorce is one of the commonest cases in the courts.  It is acknowledged that there is no such thing as a perfect family.  Families comprise ordinary individuals, including husbands, wives, brothers, sisters and other relatives.  They go through challenges and trials.  Relationships break down and parents may separate or divorce.  Parents and children may have disagreements, while siblings may dispute over financial and property matters.  Families in conflict seek resolution to complex problems they may have been facing and struggling with for years.  Mediation grants valuable support and empowers families in conflict, especially those with little money, to make their own decisions and reach balanced agreements of benefit to both parties involved in the legal spat.  In time, it can mend the emotional issues brought forth by discord.</p>  <p>We are all well aware of the importance and impact of mediation in industrial disputes.  Without the Labour Relations Commission and the services of a rights commissioner, many a dispute would have dragged on when it seemed there was an impasse.  Indeed, one of the most highlighted impasses in recent years concerned the Haddington Road agreement.  Without the intervention and services of the chief commissioner of the Labour Relations Commission, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, it may not have been possible to get that agreement over the line.</p>  <p>In many cases, mediation can be a quicker and cheaper option for people.</p> <p>However, it is vital that mediators are properly trained as people are entitled to the best service possible and without regulation, this may not always be the case.  In most cases of family law, the issues can be very sensitive, traumatic and have a major effect on people's lives.  It is imperative that the mediators know their stuff and give the best service possible while ensuring fairness and equality are paramount.</p> <p>People who use the services of a mediator must have recourse to appeal or complaint if they feel they have not been represented properly or have been unfairly treated due to the fact that a mediator was not fully trained.  Without regulation there is no course for complaint.  I ask that the Minister of State bring forward this legislation without further delay.  There is not much time left for the Government and we would like to get this through.</p></speech>

There is an interest in conflict resolution and identifying solutions in this House.  As I indicated in my opening remarks, there have been motions, some sponsored by me, on restorative justice and community courts.  We need to consider an alternative to the traditional model of justice.  We have set the standard with regard to arbitration and there is no reason we cannot very quickly set the standard for mediation, particularly the education, training and registration elements.  We should be able to stand over the quality of mediators and the complaints procedure.  There could be an ombudsman to govern the area of conciliation, mediation and arbitration.  That would ensure that the quality and integrity of the systems are protected.</p>  <p>I agree with much of what was in the general scheme of the Bill published in 2012.  The Oireachtas justice committee had two days of hearings and it did incredible work in engaging stakeholders.  To be fair, most people involved with mediation want to see it regulated and a proper structure put in place.  That protects the integrity of their profession as well.  There is not a pile of difference between Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's amendments and my perspective on the issue.  It would be a serious error of judgment, betrayal or whatever term one might use if this is not enacted in the life of this Government.  There is only a year left and it will happen pretty quickly, as it needs to.  This was a commitment in the programme for Government, and if it does not happen it will amount to a breach of faith in the programme between the two parties.  I am sure my colleagues in the Labour Party will not allow the Minister for Justice and Equality away with not publishing this legislation.  This must happen for the purpose of credibility if nothing else.</p>  <p>I commend Councillor Josepha Madigan, a Fine Gael representative who is rightly considered an expert in this area.  She provided my office with very useful information and I have no doubt that she has already engaged the Department and will engage Members of the House if they wish to avail of her expertise in the matter.  I acknowledge the work of my own personal assistant and legal adviser, Ms Karen Dempsey, who has put much work into this motion to get the tone right and ensure it could be a sign to the Government that this has gone on long enough and we will use Private Members' time in the Seanad to debate the issue.  There are thousands of people out there who could save vast amounts of money if mediation legislation could be adopted.  Of the people who engage in mediation, 80% reach a successful outcome; the funny element is that the parties tend to speak to each other afterwards.  When parties go to court, divisions are created that are never healed.</p>  <p>I thank all Members for the debate, which has been very worthwhile.  We are virtually unanimous.  The Minister of State, the Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality have a responsibility to the people of Ireland to get this moving.</p></speech>
