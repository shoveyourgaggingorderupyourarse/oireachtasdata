This is an issue she might be familiar with both in the context of her current brief and a previous portfolio.  I have raised this issue and the delays in processing work permits on a number of occasions.  However, I would specifically like to refer to the stamp 3 system.  This week it was announced that our unemployment rate has dropped to 5.3%, which is a phenomenal achievement, and we are on course to achieve full employment in 2019.</p> <p>However, the unemployment rate for those seeking stamp 3 visa holders is a whopping 93%.  Many of the stamp 3 visa holders work in industries that are currently trying to recruit and where their skills are badly needed, such as information technology, finance, health, education and hospitality.  I have just come from a meeting with a very large-scale technology company which is unable to fill more than 1,000 positions it announced last year simply because it cannot recruit people in Ireland or in the EU and it needs stamp 3 visa holders to fill these jobs.</p> <p>With the threat of Brexit looming and many companies looking to Ireland to expand, companies need to be aware that they can find the skilled workers they require in Ireland.  If these workers are stuck in limbo and unable to contribute to our economy, this will be a serious issue for Ireland post-Brexit and into the future.  We must be pro-active and address the situation before it escalates to new levels.  Ireland is a global economy and this must be clear to those looking to live, work and grow their businesses here.</p> <p>Moreover, an estimated 80% of stamp 3 visa holders are women.  This is a clear loss to our economy.  We are not only losing out on the skills and talents of these stamp 3 visa holders, of which more than 90% hold a bachelors' degree and almost 50% hold a masters degree, we are also losing out on their tax contributions.  Stamp 3 visa holders are also exempt from our social welfare system and must pay non-EU fees for our higher education institutions.  This is not a suitable environment for those who are residing legally in our country.  This is seriously affecting the well-being of those we allow into Ireland with more than 90% of those surveyed experiencing low self-esteem due to their lack of access to education and personal development.</p> <p>Stamp 3 visa holders are not allowed to work in Ireland but are allowed to look for work.  Currently, applicants for work permits are forced to wait eight to 12 weeks for their applications to be processed.  Additionally, the application for a work permit must be received 12 weeks prior to the start of the employment period.  This leads to job offers being withdrawn and the applicants feeling as if they are tourists in a place where they are legally residing.  Many employers are not aware of the fact that stamp 3 visa holders are permitted to work.  This fact is not made clear on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, website and can further hinder stamp 3 visa holders chances of finding work if they are even considered for roles in the first place.</p> <p>This is not a tenable situation for Ireland.  It is not fair nor is it to our benefit.  In other EU countries, this is not an issue and it should not be one here.  The stamp 3 visa system clearly need to be reformed as well as the waiting time for work permit applications, which I have raised before.  This will allow Ireland and our economy to live up to its potential for employees and employers alike.  For every business that chooses not to open in Ireland and where a stamp 3 visa holder cannot access a work permit, we are losing out on valuable skills and contributions to our economy.  When we allow people to reside legally in Ireland, they should feel welcomed, not ostracised.  Forcing these people to live in limbo or untenable situations is not fair and is not the Ireland we should want to portray to the world.  This cannot and should not continue for all of our benefit.</p></speech>

I am aware of all the very good work he is doing with businesses.  He has put forward a very good argument on the stamp 3 visa process.  I have been in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, but I am taking this Commencement matter for the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.</p> <p>Immediate family members, that is, dependants, partners and spouses, of critical skills employment permit holders have very broad access to the Irish labour market through the dependant-partner-spouse employment permit.  The dependant-partner-spouse employment permit is uniquely available to the families of critical skills employment permit holders as part of the Government&rsquo;s policy to promote Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness as a location for highly skilled workers.</p> <p>The criteria attaching to this permit type is substantially less demanding than for other employment permit types, that is, the application process is free of charge; all jobs are eligible, except for domestic occupations; remuneration must be at or above the national minimum wage; and their prospective employer is not required to undertake a labour market needs test.</p> <p>However, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, appreciates that the process is not as streamlined as it should be for family members of critical skilled employment permit holders who are stamp 3 holders accessing the labour market.  Officials in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Department of Justice and Equality have met with representatives of stamp 3 permission holders to hear their concerns.  The resolution of this matter falls within the remits of both the Minister's Department and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p> <p>The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has asked her officials, in co-operation with the Department of Justice and Equality, to examine the issues that have been reported, including improving the information available for these prospective employment permit holders and their employers.  In the short term these measures include: the introduction of a letter of support for stamp 3 permission holders to issue to successful critical skills employment permit applicants setting out the options regarding the employment permits process; the provision of up-to-date and clear information on both Departments' websites about this permit type; a revision of the frequently asked questions, FAQs, document on the Department&rsquo;s website; and a leaflet on this issue is being drafted for representative bodies, NGOs and other stakeholders.</p> <p>In addition, officials of both Departments are consulting on possibilities for streamlining the process for granting permission to work for this cohort of people as recommended in the Review of Economic Migration Policy 2018.</p> <p>Proposals are currently being prepared for consideration by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and her colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I am hopeful in terms of the work that will be done between the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and their Departments.  Much of this feeds into the Minister of State's current role, particularly in the higher education sector, when we consider the many people coming here and the fees they face.</p> <p>On the proposals, there needs to be third discussion that is reactive and, crucially, swift.  I received a petition last week signed by more than 6,000 people who are affected by this issue.  I passed it on to the Taoiseach and I look forward to the follow-up meeting with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, but we need swift reform.  I cannot state firmly enough that this is not just about realising the economic potential, which is so obvious to our country as we seek to be that island at the centre of the world.  We have a responsibility on a human level.  I mentioned in my earlier remarks that I met this morning with representatives of a very large technology company that is struggling to fill positions.  It now finds itself opening up for coffee just that the spouses will have somewhere to go because they feel isolated, unable to work and unable to truly integrate in our society.</p></speech>

The view of the Minister and the Government is that having an efficient and responsive employment permit is a critical lever in addressing the economy's skills needs.  We work hard, as the Senator has acknowledged, to attract and retain international talent.  The Senator has come up with a very important proposal and I will follow it up with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-12-06a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1374" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018120600002#B00500"><p>I thank the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, for taking time out of his extremely busy schedule to accommodate me with this Commencement matter.  As he is aware, I have raised previously the issue that Shannon Airport is the only international airport in the country without a European hub.  I am framing this debate specifically in the context of Brexit.  Shannon Airport's connectivity to the world is through Heathrow Airport, which is a great hub in terms of connectivity.  In regard to worldwide connectivity, it is ranked 13th and first in terms of Europe connectivity.  However, in the event of a hard Brexit, or whatever form Brexit takes, and we are now only four months away from it happening, third or fourth traffic rights for passengers coming through airports will be expected to be within any deal, but co-chairing may not be included.  Currently, someone wishing to fly with, say, Aer Lingus, from Shannon Airport to Australia, for example, via Heathrow Airport, under current co-chairing arrangements they will be able to book that flight through Aer Lingus, get a connecting flight in Heathrow and travel on to Australia.  However, under what is now being proposed by the European Commission, co-chairing may not be applicable.  That means Heathrow Airport may not have the level of connectivity that Shannon Airport needs.</p> <p>I met with the Shannon Group in recent weeks and relayed my discussion with them to it.  I requested that it make a submission to him as the Minister responsible looking for a Brexit strategic route development fund to establish a European hub, thereby ensuring that Shannon Airport is Brexit ready.  That could be in Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Paris-Charles de Gaulle.  Effectively, it would be a major European hub.  In terms of the last time Shannon Airport had a hub, CityJet was flying into Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport up to 2009 and Ryanair was flying to Paris Beauvais up to 2016.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, we will be utterly exposed in the event of a hard Brexit in terms of connectivity through Shannon Airport if there is no European hub.  As a result of the fallout from Brexit, it may become difficult to secure access through Heathrow as a European destination.</p><p>I wish to put a couple of statistics to the Minister.  Of all traffic through Heathrow, 45% provides onward connection.  Of all traffic going through Shannon Airport, 46% goes to Heathrow.  The mid-west region has well over 120 foreign direct investment companies.  Shannon Group alone supports 46,000 jobs in our region.  Under the Project Ireland 2040 plan, we are looking for balanced regional development.  In the event that we do not have proper European and worldwide connectivity following Brexit, the mid-west and west will be put at risk in the areas of jobs and tourism, which is hugely important for us.  The airport is actively engaging with airlines now to establish a European hub and I ask the Minister to consider the proposal he received in that regard last Friday.  I ask him to take it under serious advisement.  The issue is not solely about the airport.  It is about the mid-west and western regions, balanced regional development under Project Ireland 2040, the protection of jobs and investment and inward tourism.</p><p>Support will be needed by way of a strategic route development fund to help the airport to establish a European hub quickly to ensure we are Brexit ready should access through London Heathrow not continue in its current form.  A key element is code-sharing, which means it will not be possible to book a flight through Shannon and onwards through Heathrow.  That would not be facilitated any longer under code sharing.  I hope the Minister will consider this matter in the spirit it is raised.  This is about Ireland Inc., Shannon Airport and the Limerick, mid-west and western regions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-12-06a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018120600002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for the very interesting and challenging proposal he has made.  It is sometimes difficult to know where the fine lines should be drawn between being provident and prepared and being premature.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell has got the balance right judging by his interest in the region.  It is only proper that he should bring forward proposals of this nature.  However, he will realise that the Brexit scenario is unwinding and we are preparing for all possible eventualities.  The proposal the Senator sent to my Department last week will get due consideration.  It will go into the mix in circumstances in which all constructive proposals should be examined properly.  This one will be.</p> <p>The national aviation policy recognises the important role Shannon Airport plays in the economic and social fabric of mid-west region.  The airport enjoys the advantage of full US pre-clearance as well as the longest runway in Ireland and the ability to handle all aircraft types.  These features underpin the airport's ambition to expand and to develop niche opportunities in aeronautical and aerospace engineering.  This was integral to the aim of Government in the separation of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority, the restructuring of Shannon Development and the establishment of Shannon Group in 2014.  Shannon Group promotes and facilitates air transport and aviation services in and around Shannon Airport and optimises the return on its land, property and shareholdings in subsidiary companies.  Its principal activities include the operation management and development of Shannon Airport, but also the promotion, management and development of the commercial property portfolio held by Shannon Commercial Properties, SCP, and the operation of the heritage and tourism sites managed by Shannon Heritage.  A fourth business unit of the group is the International Aviation Services Centre, IASC, which is focused on further development of the aviation business cluster in Shannon.  Under the National Development Plan 2018-2027, Shannon Group, through its subsidiaries Shannon Airport Authority, Shannon Commercial Enterprises and Shannon Heritage, plans to invest in excess of &euro;150 million in its capital programme over the period to 2022.  That is quite a short period in airport terms.  Therefore, not only does Shannon Group manage the airport; it plays an important role in facilitating development and innovation in the mid-west region.  As Minister, I support this role and I ensure that my Department does everything possible to facilitate it.</p> <p>The Senator will appreciate that the establishment of air transport connections is a question of commercial agreement between airlines and airports.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have no function in these commercial decisions.  The Government's regional airports' programme provides Exchequer support to some of Ireland's smallest airports, namely, Donegal, Ireland West Airport Knock, Kerry and Waterford, through a number of schemes and in compliance with EU guidelines on state aid.  Passenger numbers at these airports are under 1 million per year and the capital supports under the programme are limited to grant-aiding investments in safety and security enhancements to help these small airports to comply with international regulatory obligations in these areas.  A public service obligation, PSO, air services scheme also operates between Kerry and Dublin Airports and between Donegal and Dublin Airports and is justified under EU guidelines by reason of peripherality.  I have no plans to introduce additional PSO air services domestically or internationally.</p> <p>There are ongoing consultations between my Department, other Government Departments and agencies and public and private aviation stakeholders in order to continue to support Shannon Airport and Shannon Group in their strategic endeavours as well as to encourage the airport to plan for and mitigate the risks associated with Brexit.  In that context, it is important that the entire aviation industry, including airports, takes steps to prepare and where possible to reduce exposure and to limit reliance on any one particular destination or service.  The full implications of Brexit will only become clear once the future EU-UK relationship has been decided.  However, the draft political declaration setting out the framework for the future relationship between the EU and the UK, which was published recently, foresees a comprehensive partnership between the EU and the UK across a range of areas of importance to Ireland, including air transport.  The European Commission's contingency plan, which was published on 13 November, outlines plans to propose measures to ensure that disruption to air travel between the UK and the EU will be minimised in the event of a disorderly UK exit from the EU, subject to reciprocity.  My officials will continue to engage with Shannon Group to explore ways to minimise whatever negative effects might arise as a result of the UK's departure from the EU.</p> <p>The Government also supports the development of air connectivity and the expansion of air services more generally through targeted funding for co-operative marketing activity.  Co-operative campaigns with partners facilitate increased marketing effort and help promote destinations more widely.  Funding of &euro;1 million was made available to Tourism Ireland annually in 2016, 2017 and 2018 for co-operative marketing.  This funding, supported by contributions from regional tourism stakeholders including airports and ports, was matched by air and sea carriers and resulted in total overseas marketing expenditure of &euro;2.6 million in 2016 and &euro;2.4 million in 2017.  An increased budget allocation for 2019 will continue to support both seasonal and regional growth and will be underscored by a commitment to focus co-operative partnership activities on the January to April and October to December periods for Great Britain and the North American and European markets.  I encourage all airports, including Shannon Airport, to avail of this funding to optimise air services with regard to alternative European hub connections.</p></speech>

I welcome his commitment to examine the proposal submitted to his Department last Friday by Shannon Group on the need for a strategic route development fund as a contingency plan in the context of Brexit.  This is about contingency planning now but it may become a reality very soon.  In that regard, it is about preparation.  We cannot have a situation arising where the entire western seaboard of Ireland, including the mid-west where I live, has no European connectivity.  Cork has such connectivity, as does Dublin.  It is important.  This could arise as a result of something completely outside the control of Shannon Airport.  This is Shannon Airport's backstop.

This site is valued at &euro;100 million.  The annual vacant site levy is 7% and this will be ring-fenced for local regeneration projects and is payable to Dublin City Council.  I hope this decision will ensure that the site is developed expediently and that there will be proper planning, housing and amenities in this area, which needs attention from the Government.  I look forward to seeing the plans and seeing movement on the site.</p> <p>I have raised the issue of cyber and telephone scams on unsuspecting members of the public.  The Revenue Commissioners have warned about a scam that involves an unsolicited call from people purporting to work for the Revenue demanding immediate payment of tax bills and being told that a criminal case will be taken against them if they do not pay their putative tax bill immediately.  I understand that no one has fallen victim to the scam yet but it is likely that somebody could, and people should realise that they should not give credit card or personal details over the phone, especially in response to an unsolicited caller. </p> <p>Cybercrime is a major issue, which is starting to affect more and more businesses, particularly in respect of malware and ransomware.  According to Europol's fifth annual Iinternet organised crime threat assessment, ransomware was the greatest malware threat in 2018.  Ransomware lockdowns can result in outages, financial loss and reputational damage.  Large companies and public organisations were attacked by ransomware last year.  Their systems were encrypted and locked down.  Now this ransomware is not only affecting desktop computers and servers but is starting to attack people's phones.  It is something that people need to be aware of to ensure that all their software is updated and they have all their security settings on.  If it is ignored, it goes away but it can be upsetting for people to receive, especially the ransomware-type emails because they feel vulnerable if they receive them.  I would like people to make sure that all their security systems, particularly on their phones, are updated and that they ignore any ransomware-type messages that they receive by email.</p></speech>

We should also make adequate time available to deal with this legislation in order that nobody will feel that he or she is being shouted down or rushed off the points he or she is making simply because those points are unpopular or will delay what others want to happen.  We have 13 days in which to complete our deliberations on this legislation and, if we make amendments - I do not know if we will - send it back to the D&aacute;il for its further consideration by the D&aacute;il.

There is no need for <i>ad hominem</i>arguments to be made one way or the other and there is no need for anger or rancour to enter into this.  Although deeply held moral convictions both ways are probably an issue, that does not mean they have to be shoved down other Senators' throats.</p><p>I appeal to the House not to consider the legislation in a manner which is unseemly or uncivilised or which, in view of the fact that the D&aacute;il has already deliberated upon the Bill, ignores our duty to consider it carefully, listen to all points of view on it and examine whether it is in a proper form to be passed.  We should not be deflected from that by preconceived notions as to where we stand on the issue one way or the other.</p></speech>

I would add that in terms of being a civilised House and how we treat each other, there will be people watching who will not be here to advocate for themselves.  When we talk about not having any personalised attacks, therefore, Senators need to be very aware that people watching will be greatly affected by the comments that are made.  When we make contributions, we should always think of those outside of this Chamber and not just insult each other.  Our contributions will have a massive impact on those watching proceedings.  I watched much of the debate in the D&aacute;il and I know that friends of mine who are familiar with fatal foetal abnormality and other issues had to turn off because they could not watch any more.  We need to be able to stand up for them when they are being personally attacked, and not only each other.</p> <p>I wish to propose an amendment to the motion for the arrangements for the sitting of the House to the effect that, in addition to the change regarding Tuesday's sitting arrangements, the Seanad shall meet at 11 a.m. on Monday, 10 December 2018 and that Standing Orders 29 and 30 shall stand suspended.</p> <p>We will obviously be taking Second Stage of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 this afternoon.  We need to complete our deliberations on this important legislation for Irish women and return it to the D&aacute;il before the Christmas recess in order to prevent an undue delays.  I propose that we take Committee Stage on Monday as well as on Tuesday.  There is a pressing need to have this Bill passed in order to allow for services to start in January.  However, we also want to ensure that we have a chance to properly debate any concerns we may have regarding its provisions.  Monday sittings are not unusual.  We had one before the summer in respect of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill due to the Government's desire to see that legislation progressed quickly.  Such a move can easily be justified in the context of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018.  There is a chance that we could run out of time by the end of next week.  I propose, therefore, that we make arrangements now to ensure that the latter does not happen.  I propose that there be no Commencement debate on Monday and that the entire day be dedicated to the Committee Stage debate on the Bill, which is of significant public interest.  I know the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is supportive of such a scheduling change because he said so in his briefing yesterday.  I hope to get agreement from this House on this but I look forward to the response from the Deputy Leader.</p></speech>

I commend the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which, under the chairmanship of Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, launched its latest report this morning.  Deputy Ferris and I were present at the launch.  The committee has done a wonderful job on this.  The report is on Article 41.2 of the Constitution and the effort to remove or replace it.  The committee has come up with two recommendations which offer really good options that could be taken.  This is an opportunity for us to examine the role of carers in the home and to give to them their rightful place and enshrine this in the Constitution.  It would be really useful for the Minister to come before the Seanad to discuss this report in order that everybody can contribute to the debate.  I also encourage wider society to get involved in this debate because it is an opportunity for us to enshrine the socio-economic rights of people who care for others in the home in a concrete way.  I hope the Acting Leader can facilitate such a debate.</p> <p>Yesterday, we heard from a number of people who work in various part of the health service.  It was a useful presentation and it gave us an insight into what it is like for people working within the health system and trying to cope with the demands they are meeting every day, be it a shortage of staff or a lack of equipment.  What emerged from the presentation is the lack of capacity there to meet demand.</p> <p>A particular issue about which I am extremely concerned is the need to draw attention to the fact that acute psychiatric patients and people in need of mental health supports and treatment are, quite rightly, presenting at accident and emergency departments.  If somebody with an acute psychiatric condition or with mental health challenges is forced to wait for hours in an accident and emergency department, it can give rise to a very difficult situations for the staff there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is something that needs to be examined.  People in such circumstances need to be seen.  I am extremely worried about the number of people who present in accident and emergency departments, who after waiting there for hours leave without any treatment at all.  Other people have to wait for long periods also.  There are thousands of incidents around this country where people present at accident and emergency departments and difficulties arise.  Injuries have resulted from people not getting the timely treatment and care they need.  The staff in accident and emergency departments are not in a position to deliver that without having the proper resources to do so.  I would like the Minister to come to the House to specifically address the issue of how to deal with people presenting in accident and emergency departments with acute psychiatric conditions, and how the situation can be improved in order to avoid injuries and worse.</p></speech>

At the forefront of my mind in debating the Bill is the responsibility we have to the citizens that voted overwhelmingly in the referendum that the legislation should go through and that we should deal with it in a timely manner so as to ensure women can get the healthcare to which they are rightly entitled from January on.  I would have liked the Bill to have come here much sooner and I will be aiming to ensure we can provide that health service to women from 1 January.</p> <p>On numerous occasions I have raised the development of 3,500 units in Poolbeg west.  We are now coming up against a time restraint.  Back in September, An Bord Plean&aacute;la said it needed additional information from Dublin City Council by 28 January 2019.  Dublin City Council provided the information to An Bord Plean&aacute;la on 27 November, nearly two months ahead of schedule.  The closing date for submissions on the Poolbeg west development is 2 January.  This is a time-sensitive issue.  We have always argued in this House that the housing crisis can only be dealt with on a supply basis.  I call on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come to the House because if the matter is not addressed urgently by him, those who are on the housing list and who so badly need housing will lose 550 units.  That is unacceptable.  I have raised the matter for three years and very little action has been taken.  I give some praise to the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, who was proactive in regard to the development.  He visited the site on many occasions and was part of the agreement on the financial undertaking for the additional 550 units.  However, nothing has happened since.</p></speech>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la has no other option than to make a decision on that basis.  In all conscience, I cannot allow a situation whereby the 550 units would not go ahead.  They are to be part of the affordable rental scheme and possibly the rent-to-buy scheme.  A wide range of people in different sectors and socio-economic classes would have an opportunity to live in the heart of the city.  Inaction on this issue is not acceptable but we have had nothing but that.  There was a solemn undertaking from the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, that 550 units would be delivered.  The situation is time sensitive.  The matter must be discussed in this House before 2 January.  Otherwise, we face losing 550 units, which would be an outrage.  The developer does not have to provide the 550 units.  The receiver could supply the land and approved housing bodies could build the units.  I want to ensure the 550 units are delivered for the citizens of this city.  The inaction of the Government on the issue is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

I do not know what the Leader is considering but I suggest that as an option for him to consider.</p><p>I have been looking back over recent years at the way this country has developed.  On the one hand we have a significant number of American companies here that have produced many jobs.  The corporation tax that has been paid in the past 12 months is a substantial contributor to the budget.  Likewise, Irish companies are making a significant contribution in America.  I understand that Irish companies employ more people in America than American companies employ in Ireland.  I was struck by our level of contact with the structures in the US.  When I was in the European Parliament we had a joint committee of the European Parliament and the US Congress and I think it might be worth establishing a contact with the structures in the United States.  The Seanad should build a relationship with Senators in the US.  In the forum to which I referred a group of us met once every six months either in Washington or Brussels.  Such an idea should be considered in view of the substantial contacts between the countries, the reliance of American companies in Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>in the American market.  I urge you a Chathaoirligh, together with the Leader and the leaders of all the groups in the House, to give serious consideration to this proposal.</p></speech>

I advise the Members of the proposed legislation, namely, the Children's Digital Safety Bill 2018, which seeks to fill a gap in regulations as regards access to unsafe online material, in particular content containing an encouragement and incitement to suicide and the encouragement of prolonged nutritional deprivation that would have the effect of exposing a child to risk to death or endangering health.</p> <p>The reason I am so concerned about this is that although the good news is that we have seen a decrease in suicide among many of the cohorts of people in Ireland there has been an increase in young female teenage suicides.  That is because they can, whether by accident or deliberately, have access to methods on how to take their life or how to starve themselves.  That is causing me great concern.  It is something the House should be addressing and legislating for.</p></speech>

It is appalling that websites that tell people how to commit suicide should exist.  Recently, there was a case before the courts where a man murdered his wife, having contacted a site called, How to Murder Your Wife, where he got precise instructions.  It is outrageous that such things should be allowed on the Internet.</p> <p>I also wish to mention the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill which is coming before the House.  It is an extremely important Bill.  It is a very sensitive subject and I hope there will be what Senator Mullen ironically called "a respectful debate".  The issue is very complex.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be a mistake to rush into it and I think the Government is making a mistake in this respect.  It is not appropriate to lay this burden on general practitioners.  I see no reason we should not have clinics for this as it is in clinics that this should be delivered.  Perhaps I should leave my comments on this issue for the debate.</p><p>I recently visited a young doctor who voted "Yes" in the abortion referendum.  He told me something that I had thought was a myth.  He said there was a considerable amount of regret among women who have abortions.

We need to look at other ways of addressing the issue.  Sometimes it is not about throwing money at a problem - it is about pooling resources.  Everybody knows the good news story about the emergency department at Roscommon County Hospital, which is part of the Saolta group.  Senator James Reilly was probably one of the best health Ministers this country has had.  He had a very difficult time when there was no money but he got all the various hospitals to come together.  Roscommon County Hospital now works with University Hospital Galway and the hospitals in Castlebar, Sligo Ballinasloe and Letterkenny.  In the past week there has been a new blood science project and a new laboratory in the hospital, where patients get results much more quickly because of the hospitals working together.  A radiographer won a prize in the past two or three weeks in Roscommon County Hospital and, in a survey, 92% of people thought the hospital was either good or very good.  However, we do not hear that.</p> <p>The results are down to the staff and everyone else working together.  In the past few years, all the major parties have come together to work on the ten-year plan for health.  I hope health will not be a political football, which it once was.  There were people who had nothing to do with health but shouted and roared about it but they are missing now.  When people work together we get a good result.  The only problem in Roscommon County Hospital now is that it is so busy there is not enough car parking.  It will be addressed but it is a serious problem.  People who were giving out about other things five years ago are now giving out about car parking.</p></speech>

The facility will provide access to the Smartbay observatory, allowing scientists to conduct research into the marine environment.  There are serious concerns locally about this and I ask the Leader to bring it to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy English, and ask him to come into this House to give us a briefing on the situation.</p> <p>Senator Colm Burke made some comments about business.  I am a rapporteur for a SME White Paper and policy document which we are creating.

We should not forget that, since the decisive vote on 25 May, more than 1,600 people have travelled overseas for an abortion, and 550 have imported safe but illegal abortion pills.

She also raised the issue of unsolicited calling.  We have all experienced seeing somebody from Somalia ringing us on our phones, trying to get money out of us.  The emails to which she referred are of great concern.  When I was a solicitor, I remember an older person coming in and presenting me with an email that was obviously a scam, though it was not obvious to that person.  There are people who are not used to dealing with emails and who are vulnerable as a result.  It is a valid point to raise and it is an issue we should discuss in the new year.</p> <p>I agree with Senator McDowell that this is a civilised House and there is plenty of scope for us to have a fair and respectful debate this afternoon and next week.  I do not think for one second that we should bulldoze the legislation through the House or that we should simply rubber stamp things.  Nor do I subscribe to the view that some people are morally inferior to others in this House.  I referred to this point on the Order of Business yesterday and I suggested that some people just think they are better than others.</p> <p>Senator Ruane and others raised the possibility of sitting on Monday.  The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018 will be discussed today and next week.  I have no difficulty with sitting on Monday but it would have to be Monday afternoon.  It would require the Cathaoirleach to allow it because the deadline for submitting Committee Stage amendments is tomorrow and we would have to allow the Bills Office to at least have Monday morning to get the amendments to us for Monday.  I think 11.30 a.m. is a bit early for rural Senators, as well as for the Bills Office.  I am agreeable to sit on Monday and Tuesday for Committee Stage but we may need a break between Committee Stage and Report Stage.</p></speech>

I have not had a chance to read it but I have heard Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in talking about it on the radio this morning.  My opinion differs from that of the committee.  I do not believe that we are well served as women by the entire debate on the removal of a clause which implies that a woman's place is in the home from the Constitution being focused on carers as if women and carers are synonymous.  I would have thought that the patriarchal society that led to that provision being in the Constitution in the first place is what needs to be discussed, along with the importance of a woman's role in life more generally.  The report is what it is.  </p></speech>

Senator Colm Burke suggested that we sit a little later on Monday if we are sitting.  I would agree with that.  His suggestion about more connectivity between politicians in America and politicians in Ireland is something that would never be anything other than positive for Ireland.  I agree with that.</p> <p>I have no difficulty accepting Senator Freeman's amendment.  I support the Bill.  I commend her on tabling it.  Senator Norris concurred with Senator Freeman's amendment.  He also mentioned the Bill coming up today.  His comments are really suitable for the actual debate.</p> <p>Senator Feighan mentioned Roscommon University Hospital.  In fairness to him, he has been a champion for that hospital and has gone through a lot on a personal and local level because of that particular issue.  Car parking at hospitals is an issue.  I did some work on it a couple of years ago.  It is something at which the Minister has looked.  I am satisfied that work is going on in the HSE to address car parking fees and the availability of car parking.  It can be very difficult for families to afford astronomical car parking fees when somebody is very ill and in hospital for an extended period of time.  </p> <p>Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh also supported the Children's Digital Protection Bill 2018.  His comments in respect of GAA clubs were also well made, especially with regard to small clubs such as those he mentioned.  I am not familiar with the specific issue in Galway he raised but it strikes me as something which would be suitable to submit as a Commencement debate in order to get a specific answer, as long as the Senator has not raised it in the last six months.</p> <p>Senator Warfield is also supportive of the Bill being debated on Monday.  It seems we have consensus in the House to order our business for Monday.  That concludes the Order of Business.</p></speech>

The Minister regrets she cannot be here as she is obliged to be at a ministerial meeting of the EU Employment Council today.  However, she is looking forward to working with the Seanad to ensure the passage of the Bill before the end of the year.</p> <p>As Senators will know, the main purpose of the Bill is to ensure a legislative basis for the increases in social welfare rates, including the &euro;5 increase in the maximum rate of all weekly social welfare payments, announced as part of budget 2019.  The Bill also contains a number of key reforms to the social protection system.  In particular, the Bill provides, for the first time, for the introduction of a higher rate of payment for qualified children aged 12 and over.  This responds directly to research which has consistently identified that older children have additional and different needs from children in younger age groups.  Another very important measure is included in section 9, which provides the legislative basis for the review of the State pension (contributory) entitlements of pensioners who were awarded less than the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory) following changes to the rate bands introduced in 2012.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A very substantial body of work has already been undertaken over the past number of months.  The Department has been issuing letters to more than 70,000 Irish resident contributory pensioners, while a further 8,000 letters to non-resident pensioners will issue this month.  These letters explain the review process and informs pensioners that the Department will contact them with the outcome of their individual pension review.</p><p>There are other measures contained in the Bill which will have a positive impact on the situation of lone parents.  They will benefit from an increase in the earnings disregard as well as from the increases in the weekly rates of payment and the increases in the qualified child payment.  The Minister was very pleased to be able to respond to an issue which was raised with her at the pre-budget forum last summer by providing in the Bill that the domiciliary care allowance will continue to be paid for three months in those cases where the child being cared for passes away.  I welcome that measure particularly.</p><p>An amendment to the Pensions Act is being provided for in this Bill which I know will be welcomed by Seanad Members.  We are providing for a right of entitlement to spousal pension benefits, in certain circumstances, to same-sex couples where the scheme member could not have entered into a legally recognised relationship, such as marriage or civil partnership, with his or her partner because the relevant legislation, namely, the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act of 2010 and the Marriage Act of 2015, had not been enacted in Ireland.  It is appropriate that I extend my thanks to Dr. David Parris as well as to Members of this Chamber, and in particular to Senator Bacik, for their instrumental role in enabling this issue to be addressed.</p><p>Before I go through the various sections, I should mention that some other significant budget measures are not covered in this Bill.  Some, like the Christmas bonus being paid this week, the increase of &euro;25 in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and the introduction of a disregard for maintenance payments for the working family payment, are matters which are dealt with by way of regulations rather than by primary legislation.  Two other key measures in the budget, namely, the extension of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to the self-employed and the introduction of the paid parental benefit scheme, will be legislated for next year prior to their formal introduction before the end of 2019.</p><p>I will now briefly outline each of the provisions contained in this Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title of the Bill, its construction and citations, and commencement provisions.  Section 2 provides for definitions of terms used in Part 2 of the Bill, which concerns amendments to the Social Welfare Acts.  Section 3 provides for an increase of &euro;10, from &euro;376 to &euro;386, in the reckonable earnings threshold for employees where employer PRSI contributions are paid at the lower rate of 7.8%.  This change reflects the increase in the minimum wage from &euro;9.50 to &euro;9.80 per hour from 1 January 2019 and will ensure that the same proportion of employer contributions is paid at the lower rate.</p><p>Section 4 provides for changes to reflect, in respect of PRSI collection, the introduction in January 2019 by the Revenue Commissioners of a real-time system in place of the current monthly or annual return system.  Under the new system, a return to Revenue will be required on each occasion a worker is paid.  The amendment will take effect from 1 January 2019.  Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, provide for the increased weekly rate of maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit with effect from 25 March 2019.  Section 8 sets out the proportionate increases in the rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit which are payable where the average reckonable weekly earnings are less than a prescribed amount.  The new rates take effect from 21 March 2019.</p><p>Section 9, as I mentioned earlier, sets out the legislative basis to allow us to proceed to apply an alternative method, namely, the aggregated contributions method, for determining entitlement to the State pension (contributory) for persons who attained pensionable age on or after 1 September 2012 and who, under the existing yearly average method, are not entitled to a State pension (contributory) at the full rate.  Sections 10 and 11 address a gap in the current legislation to ensure that a person who was in the care of the State on attaining the age of 18 is fully exempted from the age-related reduced-rate payments of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or supplementary welfare allowance.  Currently, that exemption expires when the claimant concerned attains the age of 25, while the age-related reduced rates continue to apply until age 26.  Pending enactment of this legislation, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has applied these provisions on an administrative basis to ensure that no claimant is negatively impacted in the interim.</p><p>Section 12 is an amendment to the Bill as initiated which the Minister was happy to accept in the D&aacute;il.  It simply confirms the existing legislative position and practice of the Department insofar as exceptional needs payments under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are concerned.  I mentioned earlier that the Bill is providing that domiciliary care allowance, DCA, will continue to be paid for three months in those cases where the child in respect of whose care the allowance is being paid dies.  Similar provisions also exist in the case of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and the extension of that approach to recipients of DCA is provided for in section 13.  Section 14 provides for a review of the carer&rsquo;s allowance.  This measure reflects the shared views of the Minister and all sides of the D&aacute;il and, I am sure, of the Seanad, that it is timely to reflect on the position of carers given the crucial role they play in society.  I commend carers for their great work, particularly in the area of my own portfolio, disability issues.</p><p>Section 15 provides that decisions to award a social welfare benefit or payment which is to the benefit of a claimant, a positive decision in other words, can be made by an automated information system.  Just as importantly, it also provides that decisions which deny entitlement to a benefit or payment can only be made by a deciding officer.  Section 16 provides for the formal repeal of the prescribed relative allowance, a legacy scheme which has been closed to new applicants since the introduction in 1990 of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  The last claim for this payment closed in 2017.  Section 17 and Schedule 1 provide for the necessary amendments throughout the Act to cater for the important reform I mentioned earlier whereby separate rates of the qualified child increase for children aged under 12 and those of 12 years and older are being introduced.</p><p>Section 18 together with Schedule 2 provide for new rates in respect of social insurance benefits.  All maximum weekly insurance-based pensions and benefits will be increased by &euro;5, with proportionate increases for those in receipt of reduced rate payments.  Proportionate increases for qualified adult dependants are also provided for, along with an increase of &euro;2.20 for children aged under 12 and &euro;5.20 per week for children aged 12 and over in the qualified child increase.  These measures come into effect on dates between 21 and 29 March 2019.  Section 19 relates to the issue of benchmarking of social welfare rates.  The Minister indicated on budget day that with the core rates now having been largely restored, the business of setting our headline welfare rates should be examined.  There are different approaches to benchmarking which seem to be effective in other countries, typically using a system whereby core rates are fixed each year by reference to market earnings and-or price levels.  It is timely that we look now towards developing a framework for an informed, rational and evidence-based approach to setting welfare rates.  This section of the Bill commits the Minister to consulting with stakeholders on these issues.  Consultation will be extremely beneficial in this regard.  Section 20 responds to a recommendation contained in the Make Pay Work report published last year under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  In practical terms, the section dispenses with the practice of distinguishing between employment of a rehabilitative nature and work more generally for recipients of disability allowance, blind pension and some recipients of the supplementary welfare allowance.  In addition to making it easier for recipients of those payments to take up employment opportunities, this measure will also reduce the administrative workload for GPs and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This is very important in respect of employment for people with disabilities.</p><p>Section 21 provides that a review will be undertaken of how maintenance payments are addressed in the various means-testing arrangements operated by the Department.  Section 22 provides for an increase in the earnings disregard for the one-parent family payment from &euro;130 to &euro;150 per week, with effect from 28 March 2019.  The effect of this measure will be to increase the amount of money that a lone parent will receive from employment without it reducing their social welfare benefit.  Section 23 together with Schedule 3 provide for new rates in social assistance payments.</p></speech>

Fianna F&aacute;il broadly welcomes this Bill which gives effect to a range of social welfare measures announced in budget 2019, including a &euro;5 increase in weekly social welfare payments, although, unfortunately, these increases will not come into effect until March.  It also finally puts in place the legislation required to address the anomaly in the calculation of the contributory pension, on which so many of us lobbied.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il used its best influence to ensure that budget 2019 was fair and that significant resources were directed at those on low incomes and dependent on social welfare.  Moreover, it was our party that led the campaign to address the inequities in our pension system and to reverse the disastrous changes introduced by Fine Gael and Labour in 2012 which made it even more difficult for people, particularly women, to qualify for a full State contributory pension.  While the Government has been slow to act we are glad that at last there is movement on this issue and that any increases due to this cohort of pensioners will be backdated to 30 March 2018.  However, we need clarity from the Minister on how many people will benefit under this new calculation method as there is much confusion on this.  A revised calculation method that benefits only a handful of people will not wash with Fianna F&aacute;il and-or those who have been affected.  We need details on how the revised method will operate in practice and who will benefit.    </p> <p>While this Bill contains several welcome measures we should not lose sight of the fact that the recovery has not reached all sections of society and this Fine Gael-led Government is failing on several fronts.  The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul now receives twice as many calls for assistance as in 2008.  The child poverty target to reduce by two thirds the number of children in consistent poverty by 2020 will most likely not be met.  There are 95,000 children who would have to be lifted out of poverty by 2020 if this target was to be met.  Some 780,000 people in Ireland live below the poverty line including 250,000 children.  Half of lone parents are experiencing deprivation.  Family homelessness increased by over 350% between September 2014 and September 2018.  We regularly hear how 10,000 people are homeless.  Some 500,000 people are awaiting an outpatient appointment.  The Minister has not published the promised national action plan for social inclusion 2018-2021.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il will continue to hold the Government to account and work for a better Ireland; an Ireland that looks after all sections of society, not just those who, as the Taoiseach put it "get up early in the morning".  We will continue to use our influence to deliver progressive social change and policies that benefit society as a whole, not just Fine Gael&rsquo;s preferred privileged few.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State is not a member of Fine Gael but I would have put this to the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection had she been here.</p></speech>

They are welcome but it is a pity that the increases will not be paid until the end of March.  What is so magical about March, particularly when there are so many other increased costs, notably on energy, over the cold winter months?  It seems these delays are almost policy, they have become so commonplace but I urge the Government to avoid this in future.  I expect the rationale is to save money, while dangling the reward of the carrot in five months.  Where increases in payments are necessary and announced as part of the budget, they are needed immediately, not five months after they are announced.</p> <p>I welcome the full exemption of age-related jobseeker payments for young jobseekers in State care.  This was an important move, which was sought for some time and is welcome.  I ask the Government to consider the age-related jobseeker payments and the impact of the reduced payments on those between 18 and 24 years.  These reduced payments are a proven contributory factor in homelessness.  We can see that from the homelessness figures and many organisations representing homeless people have said that this discrimination in the system is having an impact.  It is ensuring young people are trapped in homelessness.  They are setting up tent villages on wasteland across this country, mostly hidden away from society.  There is a large embankment, hidden behind trees, at the Luas line in Rialto.  They are directly affected by the lack of an increase in payments for 18 to 24 year olds.  I urge the Minister of State to consider how we are neglecting them.</p> <p>Every year the gap between jobseekers is widened based on age which makes it increasingly difficult to close.  It is deeply regrettable that the Minister continues with this failed policy of discrimination against our youth, introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, and it ignores the impact it is having on young people.  This discrimination based on age must end. </p> <p>What is the basis on which social welfare increases are decided?  I am aware the Minister engages with organisations in a pre-budget forum, which is welcome.  One key finding brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention at the pre-budget forum was benchmarking in respect of adequacy.  The Minister should examine the Social Welfare Commission Bill 2018, which my colleague, Deputy John Brady, recently introduced in the D&aacute;il.  That Bill would take the political football out of the budget process every single year.  It would ensure that vulnerable households receive an income that is adequate to meet their needs and would result in an adequate standard of living.  This is a very basic objective for our social protection system and I urge the Government to consider the Bill.  It was drafted with engagement from many stakeholders who see its merit and call for its introduction.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=06"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is the Minister of State aware of it?  I accept that he does not have direct responsibility, but will he comment on its progression?<br/><br/>I welcome that, in the D&aacute;il, the Minister accepted an amendment tabled my party regarding consultation with stakeholders on examining ways in which social welfare rates could be increased with the aim of ensuring adequacy for all recipients. That will be done in quarter 1 of 2019, which I hope will ensure a fairer methodology for increased rates next year.<br/><br/>Provision for the extension of the jobseeker&rsquo;s payment to the self-employed is not included in the Bill.  I am informed that there were reasons for this and that it will be included in separate legislation next year.  Will the Minister of State provide a commitment with regard to when it is planned to draft said legislation?<br/><br/>I welcome the amendments that the Minister accepted from my party colleague, Deputy Brady, in the D&aacute;il.  These are important amendments that strengthen the Bill.  As already stated, the first relates to benchmarking and the Minister&rsquo;s engagement with stakeholders.  That is vitally important and will strengthen their voice.  It is also the reason adequacies of payment are vital.<br/><br/>The second amendment makes provision for a report to be produced on the financial hardship faced by carers who must be providing full-time care - the Minister of State is very <i>au fait</i>with carers - in order to receive carer&rsquo;s allowance.  This restricts them from taking up other work to supplement their incomes.  It makes provision also for examination of their access to pension entitlements, as well as the barriers to the labour market they face following a period of providing care.  The report will be presented to the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We know, and the Minister has acknowledged it time and again, that carers are often overlooked, overworked and marginalised.  However, the biggest problem they face is isolation.  It is vital that we scrutinise the social welfare rates and ensure they are adequate for carers, given that they save the State an enormous amount of money.<br/><br/>The third Sinn F&eacute;in amendment insists that the Minister conduct a review and report on the financial effects of the consideration of maintenance payments as household income in the means test for various social welfare payments.  In particular, child maintenance should be regarded as an income for the child and not as household income.  I hope the Minister will take seriously any findings of this review and adapt payments accordingly.</p></speech>

I am aware he has a great interest in this area.  This is very important legislation which will provide a legislative basis for the increase in social welfare rates, including the &euro;5 increase in the maximum rate of all weekly social welfare payments announced in the budget.  I very much welcome that, and it has been broadly welcomed by people.  An extra &euro;5 may be a lot of money to some people and not enough to others, but it was nice that we were in a position to increase those payments after many years of difficulties in the State.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which has reviewed its processes over the past ten years.  If more Departments were like it, this would be a better country.  I have seen at first hand the number of initiatives it introduced in very difficult times, saving the taxpayer money but also ensuring that the customers are treated with respect and dignity.  That was done in the most difficult of times.  Many previous Ministers looked at a better way of taking care of the State's finances while also treating people who were unemployed and entitled to these benefits with huge respect.</p> <p>The local enterprise offices, LEOs, are one example in this regard.  I visited the LEO in Sligo about a year ago and I was bowled over by the changes that were introduced by the people who work there and by those who work for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It would do no harm to invite more politicians to the offices to show them the range of services and supports that are offered.  I am proud that the Department has moved with the times.</p> <p>I am contributing to the debate on the Bill on behalf of Senator Butler, who has worked extremely hard for the extension of jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed.  I have been self-employed in the past.  When the recession came, tens of thousands of people who never received or wanted anything from the State were left totally on their own for one reason or another, be as a result of falling property prices or their businesses going under.  Many self-employed people are still angry that they were left in that position and that nothing was put in place for them.  The Bill will be of help in that regard.  I hope we will never find ourselves in a situation such as that again.  It was something nobody foresaw but I saw it at first hand, and I know most of those self-employed people would have spent every penny they had to save their businesses.  They would have spent every penny in their pension funds to save the jobs of their staff.  Unfortunately, they were unable to do that because the businesses may not have been fit for purpose and things had moved on.</p> <p>Those of us in public service are privileged to have pensions.  There are those who say that the people to whom I refer speculated and brought property and shares during the boom,.  However, they do not fully realise that the individuals in question bought Bank of Ireland and AIB shares.  Those shares were their pensions.  They were blue-chip pensions, and they ended up being worthless.  The recession impacted even more on them because their shares were their pensions.  If someone wanted to set up a pension, they went to professional experts.  That was the way farmers and self-employed people looked at it.  If it was a blue-chip pension, one got back 1% or 2% every year.  These were their pensions, and they were lost.  I do not believe we realise the impact that had on the self-employed.</p> <p>I am delighted that the Christmas bonus will be paid this week, although I understand it is not covered in this legislation.  The increase of &euro;25 in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance is very welcome also.</p> <p>Section 24 formalises the Minister's commitment that analysis of the impact of Brexit on the range of reciprocal arrangements between Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in the social protection arena will be made public on its completion.  The British Government may not have lived up to its obligations on this.</p> <p>The European Court of Justice ruled that Irish citizens who had worked in the United Kingdom are entitled to the free fuel allowance.  My mother got the allowance because my father worked in the UK.  It was approximately &euro;330 a year.  We hand out money every day and sometimes there is no regard for it, but when those people who had worked as nurses or on building sites in the UK and retired back to Ireland got that &euro;330, they were very grateful.  Many of them may no longer be entitled to it - there may have been a change to it - but I wonder if there is the same take-up of it now that there was three, four or five years ago.  Are they still getting it?  There should be liaison between the two countries on that.  I may be wrong, but it was very welcome.  It was lovely to get a phone call from someone in Wexford or somewhere else regarding that matter.  These people never wanted for anything.  They worked all their lives and got something they were entitled to but were very grateful for it and thankful to the United Kingdom taxpayers.</p></speech>
