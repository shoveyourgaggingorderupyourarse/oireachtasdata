I hope they have a wonderful day here.  I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who is a Rossie like myself.  I know he has been dealing with this issue and that people have been coming to him in relation to the dental treatment service scheme.  I am getting a lot of representations about it as well.</p> <p>We all have to acknowledge the importance of oral health and dental care.  Dental and oral health is an essential part of one's overall health and well-being.  Poor oral hygiene can lead to dental cavities and gum disease and other diseases as well.  It is, therefore, important that we have an excellent dental service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It really is important that we have an excellent dental service.  Unfortunately, at the moment, we have many difficulties under the medical card scheme that applies to 16-year-olds and over.  Like many Oireachtas Members, this representation is made to me an ongoing basis by people not able to get the service.</p><p>In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and the other Ministers of State in the Department, an additional &euro;10 million in budget 2022 was put in place.  I understand &euro;16 million that was not spent in 2021 is also being used to try to improve the situation.</p><p>One of the big problems we have is a lack of dentists to do the work.  I am afraid that if we cannot bring those people back into the system, we will have an ongoing problem.  This is not just unique to Ireland.  I read that thousands of dentists have left the free dental scheme under the National Health Service, NHS, in England.  It is happening here.  Many dentists do not want that work and do not want to do that business anymore.  They are not buying into the scheme.  It is time for new ideas and new ways forward.  I do not have any magic solution.  I do not know whether the Minister of State has any magic solution this morning.  We must realise and understand that dental healthcare is extremely important, particularly for young people.</p><p>It is not good enough that people have to wait and suffer.  As we all know, some of those dental healthcare problems can become lifelong problems for people if they are not handled at an early age.  Most politicians, irrespective of what side of the House they are on, whether they are in government or in opposition, know we have a massive problem here.  It is not really a political problem as such but we must try to try to solve it.  It is up to us to solve it.  We have a problem within the system of getting dentists to serve all over the country and to do that work.</p><p>I will not detain the Minister of State any longer on this.  I await his reply.  It is not going to be a simple problem to solve.  I am very concerned about people having to wait long periods for dental care, however.  As I said, it is something that really needs to be looked after from an early age for people and it is a problem that the political system will have to tackle.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-28a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062800002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the issue of dental services for medical card holders.  I am taking this debate on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.</p> <p>Dental services for children up to 16 years of age are provided by the public dental service of the HSE through its dental clinics.  These services are provided to eligible children and do not depend on medical card status.  HSE dental clinics provide a screening and fissure sealant programme for children at key stages of development, that is, children aged six to eight, children aged 11 to 16, and, where resources are available, children aged nine to 11.  The service includes referral for further treatment, including orthodontic treatment, where necessary.  Emergency care for children up to 16 years of age is also provided.</p> <p>The Minister is aware that since the emergence of Covid-19, there has been a significant increase in delays accessing dental care for those in target school classes.  This has resulted in backlogs emerging in the targeted schools programme.  The Minister has been assured by the HSE that it is continuing to restore dental screening and treatment to children up to 16 years of age through recruitment initiatives to fill vacancies that have arisen or may arise, prioritising clinical treatment and patient groups and reallocating clinical resources according to greatest need.</p> <p>Dental treatment for medical card holders aged 16 and over is provided under the dental treatment services scheme.  Services available annually have included an examination, two fillings and emergency extractions.  More complex care and a broader range of treatments for patients with special needs and high-risk patients is also provided, some of which requires prior approval.</p> <p>Both the Minister and the Government have been concerned for some time that medical card patients in some parts of the country have been experiencing problems in accessing dental services.  To help address this issue, the Minister secured an additional &euro;10 million in budget 2022 to provide for expanded dental health care for medical card holders, including the reintroduction of scale and polish.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To address the concerns of contractors about the sustainability of the scheme, the Minister is using an estimated &euro;16 million of an underspend in this year's Estimate allocation of &euro;56 million to award fee increases across a number of items, including fillings and restorations.  The combination of these two measures represents an estimated total additional investment of &euro;26 million in the scheme this year over and above what was spent on the scheme in 2021, which was &euro;40 million.</p><p>Following consultation with the Irish Dental Association, these new measures came into effect on 1 May.  The Minister hopes that this significant additional investment in the scheme will attract more dentists to treat medical card patients.  The Minister has been assured by the HSE that its local services on the ground will assist any persons who are still experiencing problems in accessing a service.</p><p>These measures are designed to address immediate concerns with the scheme, pending a more substantive reform of dental services to align with the national oral health policy.  As part of this work, the Minister has given a commitment that there will be a substantive review of dental services, and work on this has already commenced.</p></speech>

They are very welcome to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I say that on behalf of the Leas-Chathaoirleach, the Minister of State and on my own behalf.  It is great to see people here.</p> <p>I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the other Ministers of State in the Department are trying to sort out this matter.  As the Minister of State has pointed out, extra money has been invested to try to deal with the service in parts of the country where dentists are not available to carry out this work.  I know that the HSE is doing its best as well.  It has advised that it is doing everything it can to expedite the processing of applications from dentists who wish to be reinstated on the DTSS.  I hope those dentists who have left the system can now come back into it and assist people who need assistance.</p> <p>To return to the point I made initially, oral healthcare is so important to the population, in particular at a young age, but also as people progress through life.  Dental care is important.  I hope that by highlighting the matter here and following some of the changes made by the Department and the HSE, that we can get more people back into the system and solve some of the problems that exist.</p></speech>

The HSE has also been taking action to resolve the problems in children's dental services.  However, the Minister and the Government recognise that the current model of provision of oral healthcare is in need of fundamental reform.  Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, the national oral health policy, provides the guiding principles aligned with Sl&aacute;intecare to transform the current oral healthcare service over the next eight years.  It will support provision of all levels of care by appropriate healthcare professional and in the most suitable settings.  It will also support patient choice and access, and will replace the current service, which is based on the dental health action plan 1994, which was informed by data from the 1980s.</p></speech>

He tells him that he ordered Lieutenant Kendrick to make sure that Private Santiago was not to be touched, but then Santiago is transferred off the base.  He asked why there were two orders.  Jack Nicholson replied that sometimes men take things into their own hands, to which Cruise retorted with the famous line: "No, Sir&hellip;[you said] Your men follow orders or people die".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Two weeks ago, an order was given after Oireachtas Members from Meath sat in the Department of Health with 18 of the lead figures within the HSE and top clinicians in Ireland.  They painted a stark vista of clinical concerns regarding the operation of the emergency department in Navan.  We all listened intently.  A stark vista was also painted of the emergency department situation in Drogheda, where it is proposed to transfer patients from Navan to sit in a queue for 12 hours waiting to be seen.  The leading clinical director in the room claimed he would rather see people in that queue in Drogheda than in Navan.  That is hardly a sales pitch for the people of Navan.  We heard that clearly, as did the Minister for Health.  Consequently, that day he put a hold on the plans by the HSE to reconfigure the emergency department in Navan.  Last Sunday, Paul Reid, the CEO of the HSE, adopted the role of Lieutenant Kendrick while on radio and decided he was going to ignore the order and do his own thing.<br/><br/>My question is very straightforward.  Who is in control of our health system?  I do not want the stuff the Department will have prepared in advance.  I want Deputy Feighan, as a Minister of State in the Department of Health, to answer that question.  Who is in control of our health system?  The senior Minister halted plans.  That was not done for parish pump political reasons, as Fionn&aacute;n Sheahan claimed yesterday in the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Not only could the clinicians not answer our questions about capacity, they also admitted they would be sending patients to an already overcrowded emergency department.  They blatantly said that.<br/><br/>The HSE has given the two fingers to the Minister for Health.  We have been warned by consultants, and by Paul Reid, that politicians holding out against this could result in the deaths of people in Navan emergency department.  That works both ways.  Nobody in that room was able to answer the tough questions on what would happen to people from Navan when they got to an overcrowded emergency department in Drogheda, where they would have to wait for 12 or 13 hours to be seen.  That is not an adequate health service.  It is a stain on the country.<br/><br/>The HSE is proposing to handle people like cattle.  It is a goddamn disgrace.  It is operating on a wing and a prayer.  It wants to build up capacity later and recreate Limerick and Navan.  Not on my watch.  The claim that people will die works both ways.  The HSE cannot threaten me or other politicians.  Why can it not do its job to provide the services people need?  It is given the budget so it should go and do it.  Men follow orders or people die.  Lots of lads are playing God here.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062800002#E00200"><p>I thank Senator Cassells for raising the matter of the plans to reconfigure services at Navan hospital&rsquo;s emergency department.  Navan is one of nine hospitals that were designated as model 2 hospitals under the smaller hospitals framework, which was approved by the Government in 2013.  Navan is the last of these nine hospitals to undergo transition to a model 2 hospital.  Currently, Navan is a model 3 acute general hospital with a 24-hour emergency department service to which patients may self-present or be brought by ambulance.  It also provides a range of inpatient and outpatient general medical, elective surgical and orthopaedic services.  Ambulances currently bypass the emergency department for certain conditions that cannot be catered for at Navan.  These are STEMI heart attacks, strokes and traumas, as well as paediatrics and obstetrics.  Patients who present to the emergency department who require surgery are transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  The HSE has advised that the current acute model of care at Navan holds significant risks from a governance and clinical care perspective.</p> <p>In 2013, the smaller hospitals framework described the evolution of healthcare delivery, including the shift to day surgery and ambulatory care, and the consolidation of complex care in larger volume centres.  There is a recognition that there is a link between volume and outcomes.  This in no way means we must only provide care in larger hospitals.  Less complex care, which is the majority of hospital care, can be and is provided safely in smaller hospitals.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Other hospitals in the smaller hospitals framework that have already transitioned to becoming model 2 hospitals provide excellent examples of how these hospitals can be even busier than before.</p><p>As the Senator mentioned, elected representatives from the Navan area met the HSE operational and clinical leads on 13 June.  At that meeting, the HSE described clearly the patient safety rationale for the proposed change to a model 2 hospital so that critically ill and unstable patients could have the best chance of survival.  Let us ensure that these issues of survival and patient safety are at the forefront of discussions on this matter.</p><p>There would be a 24-7 medical assessment unit, which would continue to cater for the vast majority of medically unwell patients who currently come into Navan hospital through its emergency department.  There has been considerable capital investment in Navan hospital, with the opening of a new second general theatre, a new day ward, an expanded recovery room, a new laboratory, a new rehab unit and a new psychiatric day ward.  There are other future development plans.  The future vision for Navan hospital is that, with the expansion and development of services, it will be busier.</p><p>It is important to note that Navan hospital is not closing or being downsized.  However, while recognising the real clinical concerns, the Government is clear that several important issues, including additional capacity in other hospitals impacted and the continued ability of people in the Navan area to access emergency and urgent care, would need to be fully addressed before any proposed transition by the HSE could be considered.</p></speech>

No one questions that, but what we are being asked to accept from an agency whenever it fails people in emergency departments across the country like it did in Limerick is a one-word statement from its PR department telling us, "Sorry".  I do not want the HSE's "Sorry".  It proved in that room two weeks ago in front of us that it did not have its homework done and that, just as happened in Limerick, it was trying to implement something before having capacity built up.  It has admitted this, yet after bulldozing its way onwards, it has the brass neck to threaten politicians that we will have blood on our hands because people will die.  That works both ways.  Transferring people from Navan to an overcrowded emergency department in Drogheda is not a health policy.  It is dangerous.</p></speech>

That is a core element of the planning for the reconfiguration at Navan.  These concerns must be addressed.  More widely, access and quality are core to the Government's unprecedented investment in the health system.</p> <p>I will bring the Senator's concerns to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.</p></speech>

In Dublin, the Royal Canal and Grand Canal urban greenways are being progressed.  In Dublin 15, we have seen rounds of non-statutory consultation and we await the next planning stage.  I believe that an application in respect of the Royal Canal greenway will be submitted in autumn.  Environmental surveys are being conducted currently and there will be a report on the latest public consultation in June.  The sooner there is progress with this greenway, the better.</p> <p>The Royal Canal and Grand Canal greenways will provide significant recreational benefits, but they are also major transport infrastructure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are plans to connect the two greenways via Lucan and Westmanstown and to make Lucan into a destination town for tourism, which is great news.  South Dublin County Council is heading for its second round of public consultation and Fingal County Council is tendering for preliminary designs and perhaps going into a public consultation on that next year.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, is a key stakeholder and it is funding this canal loop.</p><p>Why stop there?  Why limit Dublin to only urban greenways and transport-led greenways when we have, on our doorstep, the Liffey Valley.  The Liffey Valley could easily be a spur to this Dublin canal loop greenway, a spur that would be a world-class and sustainable amenity.  It could criss-cross the Liffey Valley, which was recognised as a special amenity area in the 1990s, although nothing has happened in conservation or in enhancing it since.  It is recognised by Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications as an area of outstanding beauty and special recreational value.  If we can make greenways work in geographically sensitive areas in other parts of the country, why not do so here?  It has hidden weirs, the St. Edmundsbury lands, the Strawberry Beds and Shackleton Mill, a water-powered flour mill from the 1770s.  It can also be connected to some of Dublin&rsquo;s most stunning parks, like St. Catherine's Park, Porterstown Park, Waterstown Park in Palmerston, the Phoenix Park and the Irish National War Memorial Gardens.  There is the Farmleigh Bridge, which we should do a feasibility study of to see if it can be opened up to connect from Palmerston Park and Waterstown Park through to the Phoenix Park.</p><p>We are talking about connectivity to the Phoenix Park and here is an example of a greenway that would connect to the Strawberry Beds and Palmerston via a bridge that is not being utilised.  Then there is a spur to the Dunsink Observatory, which needs to take its place in our heritage and in our cultural and scientific history.  We should open it up as an asset and that can connect to the Phoenix Park and Ashtown via the Hamilton Way.  It is great that the canal loop greenway is on the table but where is the progress and can we please include a Liffey Valley greenway within that as well?</p></speech>

The programme for Government sets out an ambitious and wide-ranging set of commitments on walking and cycling and has committed that over &euro;360 million in cross-government funding will be spent on walking and cycling per annum over the lifetime of the Government, equivalent to 20% of the 2020 transport capital budget.  This investment will help support the planned delivery of almost 1,000 km of improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025, as well as additional investment in greenways.</p><p>The Minister for Transport announced an allocation earlier this year of &euro;289 million for active travel in 2022, in addition to an investment of &euro;60 million for greenways.  This year&rsquo;s allocation builds on significant progress in recent years.  Expenditure on and delivery of active travel, as funded by the Department, has increased substantially, quadrupling from <i>circa</i>&euro;45 million in 2019 to &euro;184 million in 2021.  The Department has also recently published its sustainable mobility strategy with a list of actions that will guide public investment in the coming years, promoting and creating an environment that encourages more walking and wheeling, with a great use of public transport supported by services such as increased bike parking and shared bike schemes and by bringing in reduced fares on public transport.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Not only should walking and cycling infrastructure be safe and accessible for all, it should also form part of a wider sustainable mobility network which will allow people to travel in and around our cities using the sustainable modes of transport of their choice.  This must be taken into consideration by the Department, the NTA and the relevant local authorities when allocating funding to new active travel or greenway infrastructure projects.  The Department of Transport is working with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the NTA to develop a national cycle network which will ensure that investments are focused in an efficient manner and which should outline the cycling routes that are currently available across the country, identify gaps in the network and ascertain the improvements that are likely to be required.</p><p>With regard to the canal loop urban greenway, substantial sections of the loop are already completed, including Portobello to Grand Canal Dock, Guild Street to the Royal Canal, Royal Canal phase 2, which is Sheriff Street to North Strand Road, and Royal Canal Ashtown to Castleknock.  There are also a number of sections of the canal loop urban greenway on the NTA's active travel capital programme which are in development, including Royal Canal phase 3, which is North Strand Road to Phibsborough, Royal Canal phase 4, which is Phibsborough to Ashtown, Royal Canal Castleknock to Kildare border and the canal loop greenway from Lucan to the Grand Canal.  Any sections of the loop not completed or in planning are included on the latest greater Dublin area cycle network and will thus be considered to be added to the capital programme in the coming years.</p><p>To conclude, a lot of work has already taken place on sections of this route, a lot of work is ongoing and where work has not commenced it will commence in the coming years.  The completion of this work will see a connected, continuous route that will benefit commuters, leisure cyclists and tourists in the coming years and provide safe, segregated cycling infrastructure that will attract even more people out of their cars and onto bicycles for journeys to work, to school and just for the pleasure of cycling.</p><p>Senator Currie has raised an important issue.  It is an issue on which a great deal of work has taken place.  I see it in my area with the Sligo greenway and the many greenways we want to connect villages and towns.  I hope we can be like Germany or Holland and just see this as a normal way of travelling into the city.  There are big opportunities here.  It has already started and that the Senator is anxious to see it progressed as quickly as possible.  It is a very commendable view, and a view that this Government is committed to delivering.</p></speech>

The recruitment of active travel personnel in county councils reflects it as well.  I am here because I see an opportunity for Dublin 15 and I want to put every effort into seeing it happen.  The Minister of State spoke about the greater Dublin area cycle network.  There were errors in it, actually, as part of the greater Dublin area transport strategy and the Liffey Valley greenway was dropped.  There were still routes on the map but there were fewer routes than there were in the previous one in 2013.  I am very keen that this remains a strategic priority.  It does not have to be a separate greenway but should be a spur of this project.  It would open up a section of Dublin that is hidden and it could be a world-class, sustainable recreational amenity.</p></speech>

With regard to the wider active travel measures being promoted by the Government, this year has seen another increase in the Department of Transport's overall funding for cycling and walking, in line with the Government&rsquo;s prioritisation of active travel and greenways.  We saw the increasing number of people opting to make journeys by walking or cycling during the Covid-19 restrictions.  That shows the potential to make real strides in the modal shift towards more sustainable modes of transport.  The money is there and, as politicians, we have to be vigilant to ensure the funding remains.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> There are major opportunities in this area.  We have come of age in the past number of years regarding what the Senator talked about, such as spurs and linking all the various greenways.  I am not saying there was any blockage but the funding is there.  Many people in the local authorities are now aware that this is what needs to be done.  The Government is fully committed to this.  I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that we do not have the Minister for Education or her Minister of State.  I appreciate that the Minister of State may not have the level of detail I need and require, apart from the briefing he has been given.</p> <p>As we all know, education is the passport to the future because tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it.  I am not suggesting that education only happens in schools.  We obviously have informal education, which is very important, at home and within society, but schools are the fundamental building blocks because they provide education in communities and towns.  It is vital that we have sufficient schools to provide education and to provide children with the opportunity to socialise, learn how to make friends and interact with one another, as well as learning the academic subjects they need for life.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity this matter affords me to comment again on this subject.  I appreciate the fact it was chosen.  It is a very important issue for families and students in Newbridge and Kildare.  This is not the first time I have raised it.  I have done so a number of times.  While preparing for this, I was a little struck by the lack of progress since I last raised the matter.  I certainly hope we will receive a level of reassurance from the Minister of State that the Department is working proactively in the background to ensure that every child within our community of Newbridge and Kildare will have a school place in the coming months and beyond.</p> <p>I have called for a more co-ordinated approach to the allocation of secondary school places a number of times in this House and when I was in the D&aacute;il.  Towns such as Newbridge, Kildare and others throughout south Kildare continue to grow and prosper.  We see thousands of new houses being built and people moving into homes in our area.  All of this is bringing a welcome boost to our local economies.  However, I have raised a red flag in the Houses over the past seven years regarding the growth rate of houses far outpacing our infrastructural advancements.  We see towns whose resources are already maxed out continuing to grow.  These infrastructural deficits include the areas of transport and congestion, accessing GPs and school places.</p> <p>One particular area is that of school places.  The long-term vision for the provision of additional school places in our area hinges on the acquisition of an eight-acre site at Magee Barracks in Kildare town to facilitate the relocation of the Curragh Post Primary School, which is very welcome.  The acquisition is at an advanced stage, but a commitment has been given that there will be modular buildings in place by September of next year to facilitate this.  From speaking to the principal and those in the education and training board, ETB, they have not been provided with a site map or any notion of where the entrance and exit to the school will be.</p> <p>I believe we are now at a critical point as regards preparation.  In essence, I want to know if the Minister of State can give an assurance that every young person who needs a secondary school place in south Kildare will have that in September.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also ask for an assurance from the Minister of State that the project to provide modular accommodation on the site and the other projects around the area are progressing at a sufficient rate to cater for the enhanced demand in the 2023-24 school year and beyond.</p></speech>

The Senator mentioned the lack of progress on the issue.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department of Education divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system.  It collates data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels.</p> <p>Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through either one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; and the provision of a new school or schools.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I wish to advise the Senator that the Department of Education is aware of increasing pressures and demand for additional post-primary school places in a number of school planning areas, including south Kildare.  However, it is important to note that where enrolment pressures arise, it may not be as a result of lack of accommodation but may be driven by the following factors.  There may be a duplication of applications, where pupils have applied for a place to a number of schools in the area.  There can be issues around the school of choice, where pupils cannot get a place in their preferred school but there are places in other schools in the town or area.  Some towns and areas have single-sex schools, and while places are available in the school they are not available to all pupils.  External draw is another relevant factor, with pupils coming from outside the local area.</p> <p>The Department is working to establish the true extent of any capacity issues through ongoing discussions with the relevant school authorities and patrons.  In that context, similar to the process adopted in advance of the current academic year, the Department is engaging with school patron bodies and school authorities to identify particular capacity requirements for the forthcoming years which may necessitate action including, where required, the provision of modular accommodation solutions.</p> <p>As the Senator is aware, the Department is progressing a number of building projects in south Kildare under the national development plan.  The most significant project in terms of planned additional capacity is a new 1,000-pupil school building for Curragh Post Primary School.  Following an extensive site identification, assessment and negotiation process, agreement in principle, subject to contract, has been reached for the acquisition by the Department of a permanent school site in Kildare town to provide a replacement school for the Curragh Post Primary School.  The site will accommodate 1,000 pupils and will include a four-classroom special education needs unit.  The new school will cater for the increased demographic growth at post-primary level due to occur in the Kildare south region over the coming years, the majority of which is projected to occur in Kildare town.</p> <p>The location of this 8-acre greenfield site is next to two existing primary schools, Kildare Town Educate Together National School and Gaelscoil Mhic Aodha, within the grounds of the former Magee Barracks, Kildare town.  The development of the post-primary school on this site will enhance the education facilities available to the Curragh Post Primary School and the existing primary schools in a new educational campus arrangement.  Due to commercial sensitivities, it is not possible to provide further information at this time.  This will provide for significant additional capacity in the area.</p></speech>

I had hoped that there would have been some update on the proposed new school.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I note the Minister of State mentioned data from a range of sources, including child benefit and school enrolment data.  Of course that is important but 1,500 new homes are being built in Newbridge and I think there is close to 1,000 new houses in Kildare town, so a new school is hugely important to both towns as well as to the Curragh.  The principal of the existing school has not had any contact from the Department in the last six months nor a map, which I mentioned earlier, that shows where the proposed first modular buildings and then the permanent building would be.  Obviously planning permission must be sought from Kildare County Council for the modular buildings.  Also, there is no notice about the location of the entrance, exits, etc.  That information is hugely important for transport that must go in and out of the school.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Education to ensure the principal and patron of the school receive the information as soon as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-28a.44" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062800002#L00800"><p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State.</p> <p>Next September, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is due to make a decision on the planning application submitted by Shannon LNG Limited for a proposed liquefied natural gas terminal on the Tarbert-Ballylongford land bank.  The company behind the proposed plant has stated that the Shannon LNG terminal could be built in 12 months, and could even be built to accommodate a gradual transition to green hydrogen production in the future, thus aid Ireland in reaching its climate targets as well as bolster our energy security.  Indeed, a spokesperson for the T&aacute;naiste said earlier this month that he is particularly keen to assess the proposed plant's capabilities with regard to green hydrogen production and that he believes there is real potential for this in the Shannon Estuary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister, Deputy Ryan, also spoke in favour of green hydrogen when the House debated my motion on energy back in May.  The question was asked whether Shannon Estuary would be used for green hydrogen and, if not, whether it would be used for green fossil fuels.  What if it could do both?  During the debate in May, when speaking about hydrogen, the Minister spoke about liquefied natural gas in the medium term and hydrogen in the long term.  He said that is where the investment will be in ten years' time.  What of those ten years, however?  Are families to accept that energy prices will continue to climb while scientists and engineers work to make hydrogen economically viable and attractive to investors or should we take up an offer to increase the national supply of electricity with a new plant that could green itself over its lifetime?  </p><p>Obviously, we await the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and, in addition, the programme for Government explicitly states that the project does not have the support of the Government, which had it withdrawn from the EU list of projects of common interest last year.  This month, the Taoiseach said that the concept of a terminal which could transition to hydrogen production was interesting but that, given the time it would take to construct the terminal, it would not solve the current energy crisis.</p><p>However, I am not sure that anyone is positing that such a terminal could be a total fix.  Rather, it could be a useful measure to help in building up the country's energy security and lowering the cost of living.  What kind of approach is it to refuse a partial solution or a step towards one in favour of waiting until a perfect one comes along and to fail to implement successive suggestions over the course of months and years and, when people point out that the problem persists, to respond with, "Oh well, it is very complicated.  We cannot possibly fix it overnight.  There is no silver bullet here."?  There will never be a silver bullet for energy, housing, economic downturns or for viruses.  We need to take what help we can get to make things better for the people on the ground.  </p><p>There is a reason that climate activism is a priority solely for the first world.  Basic needs must be met first, in the here and now, before people can have the luxury of engaging in it.  I guarantee that, if we polled the people of Ireland and asked if they preferred slashed energy bills or meeting climate targets, we would see the truth of that statement.  It might not be the fault of the Government that this energy crisis happened and that it did not see it coming but fault will lie with the Government if it fails to react to it.  A hybrid LNG-hydrogen terminal at the Shannon Estuary might be just the reaction we need.  I ask the Government to consider its position on the plan in this light.  It would benefit us in the medium and long term.</p></speech>

The national energy security framework published in April 2022 provided a single overarching and initial response to address Ireland&rsquo;s energy security needs in the context of the war in Ukraine.  It co-ordinates work connected to energy security across the electricity, gas and oil sectors and sets out a whole-of-government response to the challenges posed to energy security and energy affordability.</p> <p>As set out in this framework, my Department is carrying out a review of the energy security of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and gas networks.  This review is focused on the period to 2030 in the context of net zero emissions by 2050.  It is considering the risks to both natural gas and electricity supplies, and a range of potential measures including the need for additional capacity of indigenous renewable energy but also the need for the importation of energy such as liquefied natural gas, energy storage, fuel diversification and renewable gases such as hydrogen.</p> <p>The underlying technical analysis is being updated to take into account the war in Ukraine.  The completion of the review as set out in the national energy security framework is scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of this year.  Following this, the results will be brought to Government.  The Government policy statement on importing fracked gas was approved by Government and published in May 2021.  This policy statement provides that, pending the outcome of this review, it would not be appropriate for the development of any LNG terminals in Ireland to be permitted or proceeded with.  As of now, the review is ongoing and the results have yet to be submitted to Government.</p> <p>Hydrogen can be produced through a number of processes powered by a wide range of sources including fossil fuels, nuclear energy, biomass and renewable energy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The energy source, the production process and the by-products influence how carbon intensive hydrogen is.  Different colours are used to indicate how the hydrogen is produced, the energy sources used and the carbon intensity of the hydrogen.  Green hydrogen is sustainably produced from renewable electricity and has a zero-carbon intensity, while other types of hydrogen produced from fossil fuels are not of a zero-carbon intensity and can be classified as either grey or blue hydrogen, depending on the technology used to produce them.  For example, grey hydrogen is produced using natural gas and a reformer, while blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas, a reformer and carbon capture and storage.  Hydrogen produced from LNG is not classified as green hydrogen.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s policy is such that hydrogen ought to be produced and deployed in the Irish energy system in a way that is coherent with our decarbonisation goals, in particular to avoid any potential locking in of non-green or non-renewable hydrogen use that fails to align with Ireland&rsquo;s target of achieving net zero by 2050.  Ireland has significant offshore wind potential and the production of green hydrogen from variable renewable electricity could help Ireland fully utilise its renewable resources to decarbonise, reducing significant levels of curtailed renewables and improving energy security.  Therefore, our priority is for green hydrogen sustainably produced from renewable sources.</p><p>I thank Senator Keogan again for raising the issue and look forward to hearing her views and those of any other Senators.</p></speech>

We are not just waking up to the fact Ireland has significant offshore wind potential.  We have always known this.  The wind has been blowing there for donkey's years; it did not start just now.  That we are talking about it only now is just not good enough.  We are in a very serious energy crisis.  This LNG proposal could help us, as a nation, get out of that crisis.  We have the deepest water in Europe for cargo shipping, a floating storage and re-gasification unit that, as a ship, will have LNG storage capacity of up to eight days' demand for Ireland, something we need to take into account.</p> <p>The planning is now bogged down with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I understand that the issue of concern relating to the application for the people arose because some of that source gas was going to come from fracking in the United States.  If the company gave a commitment that natural gas would be sourced from the Middle East, would that allay the concerns the Minister of State might have?  People are at the pin of their collar putting petrol in their car and their energy costs are growing daily.  We have to react to that and we need to do something.  The buck stops with the Green Party.</p></speech>

The Council of the European Union sat down and decided we needed to bring in a new package, known as RePower EU, that will involve greater ambition on the level of renewables that can be deployed.  Part of that plan will involve sourcing fossil fuel energy from countries other than Russia and to find other means to do that, and also to reduce the period in which it takes to obtain planning permission for renewable energy, to between one and two years.  The Council wants EU countries to designate special areas as faster areas for renewable energy and we are going to take part in that.  I am sorry it did not happen sooner.  If I had been involved, it would have, as the Senator can imagine.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned the possibility of reusing an LNG terminal for the export of hydrogen.  There are two basic types of terminals, namely, import and export terminals.  We are looking at developing an export terminal in the form of liquid ammonia, which could be used by other countries that might need it.  Ammonia is more energy dense than hydrogen and presents a more feasible solution.</p> <p>There is no silver bullet for energy, as the Senator noted.  We need a combination rather than having all our eggs in one energy basket.  We need the diversity, strength and resilience that comes from using multiple sources of energy in order that if one of them is unavailable or very expensive or if it fails for some reason related to the weather, we will have a back-up of these different systems.  Combined with that, we need good grid connections interconnecting us with other countries.  We are developing the Celtic interconnector to connect our grid to France, we have multiple connections to the UK and we are looking at other countries as well.</p></speech>

It is certainly an important issue for me and more important, for the community of the Cooley Peninsula in north Louth.  This issue was brought to my attention a week and a half ago by Ms S&iacute;le Murnaghan who is the principal of Monksland National School.  It was brought to my attention because of the inability, perhaps, of Ms Murnaghan to successfully engage with the Department over a number of months after the Department approached representatives from Monksland National School in January of this year to ask whether they would like two special classrooms to care for pupils with autism.  Naturally enough, Ms Murnaghan and the board of management jumped at such a proposal and were delighted to have been asked.  They thought this could be September 2023 and that they would be able to have children ready by then.  The Department came back and said it actually wants them in September 2022, which is excellent.  That shows the ambitiousness of the Department in being able to provide special classrooms for children with autism.</p> <p>On the back of that, the local community and pupils who would avail of this were identified.  We pretty much have ten children, which covers nine families, enrolled for September 2022.  This week, we approach 1 July, which means 1 September will be roughly eight weeks away by the end of the week.  As of yet, we are still waiting for the final confirmation from the Department that the money will be made available.  I have all the information for the Minister of State in terms of the timeline from when the Department first got in touch on 26 January.  This is without seeking to cast aspersions or apportion blame because that stuff is in the past.  I am speaking on the floor of the Seanad today on behalf of the parents, pupils and teachers of Monksland National School to get this project over the line.  I am not trying whatsoever to apportion blame to anyone within the Department.  The current state of play, however, is that a submission was sent in a number of weeks ago in terms of the costs that would be needed to go ahead with this.  That was supplied by the planner.  Only last week after I raised this in the Seanad did the Department get back in touch to say it needs a further breakdown of those costs.  That breakdown is now going back into the Department.  Hopefully, once that breakdown goes back in, the Department will be able to approve it straightaway.</p> <p>We only have eight weeks left to make sure these two classrooms are built and ready to welcome new students in September.  I think we can do it within those eight weeks.  Let us be very clear about it, however.  Eight weeks is an incredibly short timeframe to get the level of infrastructure and facilities needed into a small rural national school in north Louth.  I firmly believe there was quite a delay through administrative errors on the Department's side.  As I said, however, I did not come to floor of the Seanad to try to find a scapegoat.  I came here to try to find a solution.  I really hope that through the offices of the Minister, Deputy Foley and Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, when the final bit of paperwork is submitted - which is a further, more detailed breakdown of the costs - there will be absolutely no delay in the decision from the Department and that it will be approved.  Then, we can get on with having this school for the community and students that dramatically need it come September.</p></speech>

The school had an enrolment of 132 pupils in the year 2021-22, with a mainstream staffing complement of a principal plus four mainstream teachers for the current academic year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In addition, the school has two special education support teaching posts.<br/><br/>This year, the Department of Education will invest in excess of &euro;2 billion, or more than 25% of the Department's budget, in the area of special educational needs support.  As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special classes and places are at unprecedented levels.<br/><br/>In this academic year, there are 2,148 special classes in schools across the country.  Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide.  A range of strategic initiatives has been put in place with the NCSE in recent years to support and expand special educational needs provision in schools throughout the country.  These initiatives include enhanced arrangements for the planning and co-ordination of SEN provision requirements involving the Department, the NCSE and key stakeholders such as patrons and management bodies.<br/><br/>Our planning utilises the Department of Education's geographic information management system, GIS, to support a strategic and co-ordinated approach to the delivery of SEN provision.  This includes real-time data on capacity across the school system.  This has resulted in a more streamlined and joined-up planning process, which has ensured a targeted approach to meeting demand for special education placements ahead of each new school year.  The Department of Education is satisfied that this approach is delivering.  This intensive intervention has seen more than 300 special classes already opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year, as well as the establishment of two new special schools in Cork and Dublin last September.  This targeted approach will continue to identify and meet demand for special education placements throughout the country.<br/><br/>The NCSE, through its network of SENOs, special educational needs organisers, is currently engaging in a process of establishing two new ASD classes in Monksland National School for the 2022-23 school year.  Two ASD special classes were sanctioned by the NCSE on 9 February 2022 to meet expected demand in the area.  When the NCSE sanctions a special class in a school - primary or post-primary - it is open to the school authority to apply to the Department for capital funding to reconfigure any existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation under the Department's additional school accommodation scheme, ASA.  ASA application forms are available on the Department's website, <i>www.education.ie.</i></p></speech>

In his response, he indicated that there is a very significant school building programme happening right across the State.  That is correct, but I have the timeline here in black and white.  The Department took 38 days to reply with an update to an email from a school principal.  To me, that does not indicate that we are able to embark on a significant building programme when a principal like S&iacute;le Murnaghan in Monksland National School has to consistently chase the Department and sections within it to see if she can get the classrooms across the line.  It is there in black and white, but I will not go into it because I do not want to focus on the mistakes of the past.</p> <p>What I want is a solution for the Cooley Peninsula, Monksland National School, S&iacute;le and the board of management, but most important, what I want is a solution for the pupils who will start in the school on 1 September.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know the Minister of State, through his good offices, will bring that point back to the Minister for Education and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.

The school's application has been assessed and a decision issued directly to the school authorities with regard to the proposed permanent accommodation.  The school has also been approved for two 100 sq. m buildings of temporary accommodation to cater for its immediate needs in the interim.

Imagine being out with a member of one's family in a shopping centre in Dublin to pick up the basic foods or clothes one wants and these missiles suddenly hitting, with people dead and injured.  It is utterly outrageous and monstrous carry-on.  Every Member, including the Leader and you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, will join me in condemning this blatant and outrageous attack on people.  There seems to be no end of it from Russia, with innocent people being hit down in this way.  It is so tragic.</p> <p>It was appalling to listen to the news reports last night, to see the destruction and to see bodies and people being taken out of a building that had been completely destroyed.  It is just too bad, and it is important that all countries, including ours, condemn such actions by Russia.  They are being perpetrated by Russia, regardless of what it says.</p> <p>I welcome the Government's plan to tackle domestic and gender violence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is very important this is done.  I welcome the statement by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Government.  We hope that will progress very quickly.  I know it is something the Leader has a major interest in.  We do not have a refuge in County Roscommon.  I am glad to see the Government will move to ensure that every county will have a refuge.</p><p>On another good note, I am glad to see that Irish workers are the most productive in the world, according to the Central Statistics Office.  According to that body, workers in the Republic added an average of &euro;95.76 to the value to the economy for every hour worked in 2020.  We should laud all our workers and commend them because the Irish have a good work ethic.  It is lovely to see that bit of good news.  I wanted to note that today.</p><p>I will very briefly refer to the fact that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, this morning announced an extra 1,000 college places.  That will be very important to our student population as regards the points race.  The places will be in IT, architecture, education, engineering and other areas.  That is important.  I am glad to see the Minister and the Government have acted on that.</p><p>I understand the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, brought legislation to Cabinet this morning with the publication of the Health (Exemption for Children from Public In-Patient Charges) Bill 2022.  As Members know, this will pave the way for the abolition of overnight and day case inpatient charges for children aged under 16 in all public hospitals.  That will be very much welcomed by many people.  I hope the Bill passes quickly.</p></speech>

It is heartbreaking for all involved.</p> <p>We all know that the cost of living is an issue that has come to the fore with rising inflation and the associated impact of the illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Fuel prices are certainly putting people to the pin of their collar.  I have met with numerous groups regarding cost-of-living issues.  I recently met with people involved in providing home helps, who do a tremendously important job for our loved ones throughout the country.  They are feeling the pinch because they have to drive every day to their jobs to meet their patients or the people they have to help.  It is putting an undue burden on those workers who are low paid as it is.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, regarding a stipend or additional funding for home helps to cover their increased costs.  These home helps also informed me they will not receive the &euro;1,000 pandemic bonus payment, as I understand it, because they are agency staff as opposed to home-care assistants working for the HSE.  That is not good enough because they do a tremendously important job.  They are on the front line and many of them worked during the Covid period.  Those who worked during that period should be entitled to the &euro;1,000 payment.  I ask the Leader to raise that with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.</p> <p>Chas m&eacute; le hoibrithe c&uacute;namh baile le d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus d'ardaigh siad costas breosla, peitreal agus d&iacute;osal, mar go mb&iacute;onn orthu taisteal &oacute; &aacute;it go h&aacute;it chun an tseirbh&iacute;s a chur ar f&aacute;il.

That is important.  I wish to acknowledge the speed at which the Minister and her officials have progressed the work from the last time she was in the House talking about the package of measures.  Central to the strategy is the Government's focus on tackling the issue of service provision.  That is to be welcomed.  While we do not know the exact detail of the measures, some details have been provided in various briefings today.  We know that there will be a five-year plan to tackle DSGBV and that &euro;363 million in resources will be provided for the strategy.  That is an important step.  It would be important that the Minister to come to the House when she is available to continue the conversation she started.  There was major engagement on the issue when she was last in the House.  When I was travelling to Leinster House in the car earlier, I heard a representative of one of the women's advocacy groups speaking on "Morning Ireland", and saying that zero tolerance is the destination.  I think that sums it up clearly in a simple message.  Zero tolerance is the destination.  I thank the Minister and her team for the work they have done.  I look forward to hearing the details of the strategy later today.  I hope that at some stage we will have some engagement on the matter in the House.</p> <p>On healthcare, I and many other Senators asked for a debate on health services.  I ask the Leader to outline how her office's engagement with the Minister for Health is progressing.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, issued a statement this week, highlighting that there is a shortfall of ten nurses in every emergency department.   HIQA recently published a damning report on the emergency department at University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  It makes for shocking reading.  The issue was covered by many media outlets over the weekend.  The Central Mental Hospital is still not open, yet the &euro;1.7 million state-of-the-art facility has been built.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is deeply unhappy about the situation and has issued statements to that effect.  There is uncertainty around the emergency department, the ICU and the provision of emergency care in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan.  Last week we had a debate on the shortage of neurological nurses.  Therefore, there are many issues around health services.  I ask for an opportunity, if it is possible, to focus on those issues in the House and keep the pressure on those responsible.  I am not personally attacking the Minister for Health or anyone else.  However, there is a will on all sides of this House to focus and crystallise on the importance of healthcare.  We must set out the short-, medium- and long-term measures that we can put in place to address the issues.  I ask the Leader to provide an update on the progress of her engagement with the Minister of Health in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

I want to begin by reading into the record a quotation from the G7 leaders' communiqu&eacute;:</p> <blockquote> 	We, the Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7), met in Elmau on 26-28 June 2022, at a critical juncture for the global community, to make progress towards an equitable world.  As open democracies adhering to the rule of law, we are driven by shared values and bound by our commitment to the rules-based multilateral order and to universal human rights. </blockquote> <p>As the Leader is aware, Boris Johnson and the British Government are co-signatories to that communiqu&eacute;.  Currently, in Dublin, Belfast and London people are gathering to protest against the British Government's Bill of shame, the legacy legislation which will grant its forces an amnesty.  It is legislation that causes deep concern domestically and internationally in respect of how it flies in the face of conventional understandings, and indeed, in its impact upon victims.  We also know that currently, the British Government is legislating to break international law with its Northern Ireland Protocol Bill.  I want to take the opportunity to reiterate our opposition to, and reassert the dangers and threats posed by, both pieces of legislation to peace, progress and the rule of law.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While I understand it may be difficult to facilitate an update before the recess, maybe shortly after that it would be timely to have an update from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on the all-island strategic rail review.  We all know the importance of greater connectivity and in the context of the climate emergency, greater investment in public transportation infrastructure has never been more important.  We all have seen the maps online of the devastation caused to rail networks and rail links all around Ireland.  Consequently, it would be timely and important to have input from the Minister on how the review is progressing and how the Seanad can play a role in assisting that work. </p><p>In the limited time afforded to me, I will mention an issue to which I may return and on which other colleagues will also touch, namely, the agreement by the Cabinet to train Defence Force members to carry out security duties at Dublin Airport.  Such an initiative is a shocking indictment of where we are at and would again ask the Defence Forces to effectively become security guards at Dublin Airport.</p></speech>

The reality is that the prevalence of Covid-19 is increasing, staff are missing, airlines across the world and in Europe are cancelling flights every day and there are strikes in parts of the world.  I applaud the Dublin Airport Authority for being proactive, notwithstanding the difficulties it does have.  I take the point the Senator made about taking staff welfare on board and how you look after workers is a fundamental point to which we should come back.  I hope the Minister for Transport or the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton or whichever Minister the Leader can get will come to this House for a debate on the plans to make sure that the travelling public are not discommoded in this summer season.</p> <p>I rise primarily to mention the celebration of Dublin Pride last Saturday.  I thank the Leader and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for their presence at Dublin Pride last Saturday along with so many other Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and across political parties, staff from Departments and the staff here in Leinster House.  It was a wonderful day but sadly, the event was marked by the news that two people were killed in Oslo that morning, which was an attack based on religious grounds against members of the LGBT community.</p> <p>June is Pride month.  Let us consider how far Pride has come, from where it began to where it was last Saturday.  It is important that we do not let the month of June pass without calling for a debate on diversity and equality to be arranged before the summer recess.  I ask for that debate conscious that we had a peaceful and celebratory Pride march and events last Saturday, for which I thank the organisers of Dublin Pride and all who participated on that wonderful day.  As I am very conscious that two people were killed in Oslo that night, I recognise that as a society, we have come on a journey but have more to do.  Today, in the Upper House of the Oireachtas, I wish to remember the two people who were killed in Oslo while celebrating Pride and acknowledge that we could walk  safely and without fear in Dublin last Saturday afternoon.</p></speech>

To mark the occasion I wish to draw attention to the delay in adding spinal muscular atrophy to the newborn heel-prick test.  Each year in this country six babies are born with the condition, which is known as SMA.  The degenerative condition means that most affected children will never walk.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Left untreated, 95% of children with the severest form do not live beyond 24 months.</p><p>We can be thankful that there have been significant advances in the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, with drugs over recent years.  Those drugs are eligible for reimbursement, which is something we all can be proud of.  There is proof that the earlier a child receives treatment for SMA, the better the outcome will be.  Many children born with the disease do not present with symptoms until 12 months after birth.  Later diagnosis can result in significant damage being done.</p><p>However, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach will know, there is a simple PCR test that can diagnose SMA with near perfect accuracy from a spot of blood.  Each year, approximately 60,000 babies are born in this country.  Each child receives the heel prick test for a very small number of serious medical conditions.  I am told it is possible to add SMA to this list for as little as &euro;5 per individual.</p><p>The representative group for people affected by SMA has written to the newborn screening advisory committee to ask that SMA be added to the heel prick test schedule.  I understand that submission was accepted but, unfortunately, no progress has been made six months later.  This means that children are not being diagnosed at the earliest possible opportunity and that vital time is being lost.  As I have said, the drugs are very effective but time is of the essence.  Addressing this delay is of vital importance to the families concerned.  I respectfully ask that the Leader communicate with the Minister to seek an update on the current position with regard to this matter.  I look forward to the response.</p></speech>

They are the lowest paid public servants.  Many of them will be dragged to Dublin from all over the country to provide these services.</p> <p>I appreciate that Dublin Airport is in crisis.  I was out there at 2 a.m. this morning and I saw the queues and the crowds.  I have to compliment the staff.  My two granddaughters, tiny little girls, were standing in the queue for over 40 minutes and a Dublin Airport Authority official came over and said that it was not fair to have those little girls standing in a queue and brought them straight to the top to check in.  I compliment the people because that is not an easy thing to do when there are long queues of people.  I understand that they did the same for many children.</p> <p>Whenever there is a crisis, whether floods, Covid, fires or anything else, the Army is brought in.  Some of these guys and girls will be asked to work 24-hour shifts and they will not be paid the standard overtime that any other employee in the State would get.  It is wrong in every sense of the word.  On the pay policy being pursued by the Government at the moment, I agree that the low paid have to be compensated but, when one gives a low-paid person &euro;500 in a national pay round, one damages the differentials that exist.  It is now the case that non-commissioned officers who are being monitored by commissioned officers are earning slightly more than those officers because of the differential that has come about.  </p> <p>I visited McKee Barracks for veterans' day and there was great anger that no Minister showed up at the barracks for the day.  I again had the issue of the 2016 medal thrown in my face.  People who served for 40 years were not given the 2016 medal but people who served for one day in 2016 were.  It is not about the medals but about respect, loyalty and why we look to the military in every circumstance.</p> <p>We have had the commission report for five months but absolutely nothing has been done about it.  Many things could have been done at the stroke of a pen, particularly in the area of pay.  I cannot understand it.  Germany became aware of a problem in its defence forces and threw &euro;100 million at it in a matter of days.  Other countries around Europe are doing the exact same thing while we have been sitting on this report for five months, waiting for a memo to Cabinet in the dying days of this Government.  I should have said "dying days of this term", although who knows?</p></speech>

I think it is fair to say this was a stunt designed to cover up the failures within the Department of Education.  The hurt and negative aspersions that have been cast over the four schools have been very damaging.  One of the schools, St. Gabriel's National School in Stoneybatter, has a great record and reputation for providing for children with additional needs.  This September, it will have eight class teachers and six support teachers, while a special class for those with moderate difficulties was established in 2016.  That says a lot about the commitment of the school to pupils with additional needs, yet last week the Minister of State sought to portray it as uncaring and as failing to provide any resource or support to children with additional needs, which could not have been further from the truth.</p> <p>The truth is that that school has been working for the past year on putting in place a new autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit for September 2023, and working with the architects engaged by the Department of Education itself with regard to renovating two classrooms, yet that did not seem to matter when a letter was sent from the Department to the archbishop at 7.30 p.m. on Friday, 17 June.  You could not have made it up.  The email to the archbishop was cc'd to the school.  The Department did not even have the grace to send it directly to the school and instead effectively put a gun to its head and said that if it did not engage, its name would be published.  The school engaged and replied, yet that did not matter when the Minister of State made her statement last week.</p> <p>She has done severe damage to schools that are trying really hard, and it is important that any of us who knows those schools speaks up.  The school I know, St. Gabriel's, has a great record and reputation and it wants to continue doing that work.  The Minister of State needs to get on with her work of ensuring there are more special places, as opposed to seeking to cast blame.  I have come to know that St. Gabriel's is putting in a new ASD unit because a preschool will have to leave that school building over the next 12 months and the area will lose a very precious and important preschool facility because it is located within that primary school.  It is a complete nonsense to say the school has not been engaging.</p> <p>Separately, the public sector pay talks have been off the radar for the past two weeks, since their collapse, and we have not heard any meaningful or substantial offer from the Government.  We are hearing from public sector workers that they are looking for a pay deal and the Government has not yet come to the table.  We need to see it happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-28a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1653" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062800002#Y00200"><p>That was a quiet opening to this week's proceedings.  To respond to Senator Sherlock, I think I heard the T&aacute;naiste clearly state that our public servants deserve a pay rise.  The offer made was very generous, although the talks stalled insofar as it was rejected.  I think it would be expected that any union would reject the first offer.  We all know how these negotiations play out and I assure the Senator they will end very shortly in a productive pay increase for all our public servants.</p> <p>With regard to the announcement by the Minister of State with responsibility for special education, this is the first time in the history of the State that there has been a Minister of State with that sole responsibility.  We have never spent more money on providing special education for all our children who need it.  As the numbers have grown over recent years, there has been an increase in the number of special needs assistants to levels our Garda force does not even enjoy, so we know and recognise how great an issue it is to provide services in a timely manner.  We have all experienced frustrations with the Department over the years in regard to schools we have represented, but to be fair to the Minister of State, her announcement on Friday evening was as a result of many months of frustration with regard not just to the four schools she mentioned but to many schools throughout the country that see this as a negotiation.  They think that if they have to do something on behalf of the Department to serve the needs of their pupils, they will make sure they will get something else.  That is a really frustrating place to be, not least when parents and children need the provision of services from the State, and we all know how critical we are of the State when it does not provide those services.  To be fair, the delivery of the services is incumbent not just on the Department of Education, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, or anybody else who is responsible for special needs services but also on every vested interest to ensure we will work in a timely manner to serve the children we know need the additional resources.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State's statement was born out of frustration more than anything else.  What I really welcome is the newfound renewed capacity to be able to work with the Department to make sure we do deliver not just for the children of Stoneybatter but the children of Coolock and all the other children around the country who need special education and extra resources.  </p><p>Senators Craughwell, Buttimer and &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke about the announcement by the Department of Defence and the Minister for Defence of the sanctioning of our Defence Forces to help out with Dublin Airport, particularly around security issues we know we have seen over the past few weeks but expect to probably be exacerbated because of the rise of Covid in the next number of weeks.  While Senator Craughwell makes very valid points regarding the stipend that will be paid to our Defence Forces, I must say that I am very proud that we have Defence Forces who are willing to stand up in any and every emergency in this country because they never let us down.</p><p>Despite all the difficulties with regard to recruitment, pay and conditions - everything we have spoken about for the past number of years - they never let the State down so they are to be commended.  This is not to say that Dublin Airport should not be reminded of the fact that the reason we are in this mess is because it miscalculated, let 1,000 people go and offered a paltry and precarious contract in the past number of weeks looking for people to work 20 hours but to be available for 40 hours for buttons.  It has nobody to blame but itself for being in this situation.  Thankfully, after the past number of years, which were absolutely crap, people are going on their holidays again, which is wonderful to see.  I want to put on the record that I am immensely grateful to our Defence Forces, who consistently stand up and help us when we find ourselves in the breach.  Senator Craughwell also raised the 2016 medal.  I will follow up with the Minister for Defence and come back to him.   </p><p>Senator Gallagher reminded us that today is International Neonatal Screening Day and asked me to send a letter to the Minister for Health to find out when spinal muscular atrophy will be included in our national screening programme.  I am very happy to do that.  </p><p>Senator Buttimer spoke about the lovely, happy, warm and fun feeling we all experienced on the streets of our capital city on Saturday.  It really was an enormous pleasure to be there, to support and to be an ally but also just to enjoy the fun and experience the joy that our friends, neighbours, cousins and colleagues - our citizens - expressed on the streets on Saturday.  The Senator is right to remind us all that certain things happen to certain minority communities not just in Ireland but all over the world.  I add my condolences to those of the Senator for the two gentlemen whose lives were taken so cruelly in Oslo on Saturday and remind everybody that we all need to be allies for every single minority and diverse community in Ireland because they suffer an awful lot of things we might not even be conscious of.  I remind everybody to be an ally not just for the month of June but for every month.  </p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile asked that the Minister for Transport come to the House to give us an update on the all-Ireland rail review.  Senator Buttimer looked for an update on the Dublin Airport plans.  I think both Senators are aware that we are very stretched for the next couple of weeks but I will do my best to try to get it in as quickly as possible.  </p><p>Senator Boyhan had previously asked for time to be set aside for a rolling debate on health.  This request was made to the Minister for Health last week.  I regret to say that the only access I have to the Minister for the final two weeks of this term is to debate the Bill Senator Murphy spoke about this morning that will remove charges for children under the age 16 in public hospitals.  I will organise a debate on the issues highlighted by Senator Boyhan this morning as soon as the Minister's diary allows and if it is not possible in this term, I will organise one to take place as quickly as possible when we come back after the summer recess.  </p><p>Senator Kyne spoke about the impact of fuel prices on home help carers who are agency staff and asked me to raise the issue with the Minister for Health, which I will do.  He also spoke about the &euro;1,000 Covid payment that, unfortunately, has only been ring-fenced for HSE staff instead of for all staff.  </p><p>Senator Murphy welcomed the third domestic violence strategy, which will be announced in full detail by the Minister for Justice this afternoon, and commended the fact that we will now have a refuge centre for victims of domestic violence in every county.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are going to double the number of places and double the sentences.  It is all very welcome.  There are 144 specific actions in the plan and &euro;363 million to make sure every single Department, because this is a cross-Government response to domestic violence, has the money and resources needed to make sure the plan is enacted.  The Senator also welcomed the 1,000 new college places announced by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science this morning and the new legislation by the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly.</p><p>Senators Murphy, Kyne and others talked about what can only be described as the act of terrorism in Kyiv yesterday, where the Russians bombed, maimed and murdered people going about their daily business when buying clothes, food and other items in a shopping centre.  They were trying to live their normal lives.  I sometimes wonder about the justification of war and the arguments some people or territories and countries put forward to justify that war and, indeed, talk about the rules of engagement and how some things are allowed and some are not.  In any circumstances, bombing people who are going about their normal lives in a shopping centre could not be called anything other than terrorism.   People in shopping centres going about their business are not what adversaries could describe as strategic sites.  I add my words of abhorrence to what can only be described as an act of terror.</p><p>Finally, although nobody brought it up today, on behalf of this House but definitely on my own behalf, I thank Mr. Paul Reid, chairperson and CEO of the HSE, for his three and a half years' service, which probably felt like ten years, God love him, and the amount of work and effort he put into running the HSE.  He looked after us as a country and made sure the services that needed to be available were available and stood over one of the world-class deliveries of a vaccine, which has kept us mostly safe in this country.  I thank him for his public service.  I really wish him well.  He has seen very little of his beautiful family and his two new grandchildren over the last number of years.  I thank him for his service and wish him every happiness in whatever he chooses to do.</p></speech>

We are sorry about the little hiccup.  Amendment No. 1 amends the meaning of &ldquo;principal burial land&rdquo; in section 2 of the Bill.  As drafted, there are two criteria.  A person must have died while a resident and must have been buried in a &quot;manifestly inappropriate&quot; manner before the State may intervene.  The requirement to meet both criteria is a barrier and this amendment changes the wording of this provision.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 seeks to expand the meaning of &ldquo;principal burial land&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill to ensure that it includes burials where there is concern that death occurred in a violent, unnatural, sudden or unknown way.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 has the same aim as amendment No. 3 but goes about it in a slightly different way.  The amendment seeks to revise the scope of the Bill to fit with international definitions of mass grave sites such as the definition used by the Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p><p>Amendment No. 7 seeks to amend a provision of the Bill limiting interventions to situations where a person died while ordinarily resident in an institution and where that person was buried in a &quot;manifestly inappropriate&quot; manner.</p><p>Amendment No. 8 arises from the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth's pre-legislative scrutiny report and, more specifically, from recommendation 6 of that report.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Amendments Nos. 4 and 9, which are linked, seek to revise the scope of the Bill to meet international best-practice definitions of mass grave sites and to expand the circumstances that might warrant an investigation.</p><p>I will not go into amendments Nos. 30 or 40 but we would appreciate if the Minister could accept them.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 39 will insert after the word "violent" the words "accidental, homicidal, undetermined or suspicious deaths".  This will expand the criteria listed in the section by which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have to be alerted to evidence of human remains.  The current requirements are quite limited and, therefore, there is a significant possibility some deaths would not be adequately examined if such a death were to occur.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-28a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062800002#LL00300"><p>A number of these amendments are similar to some brought forward on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il and, unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept them.  Amendments Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 7 to 9, inclusive, seek to alter the definition of &ldquo;principal burial land&rdquo; and the conditions for making a Government order to allow for interventions in cases where inappropriate burials have not been discovered but where the burials relate to a person whose death may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner, or suddenly and from unknown causes, or where the circumstances of the death or body-disposal method were not investigated as to their lawfulness.</p> <p>Amendment No. 30 seeks to alter the function of the director such that he or she would have to arrange for the forensic excavation and recovery of human remains where a death may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner or suddenly and from unknown causes.  These amendments would allow for interventions in cases where inappropriate burials have not been discovered.  This approach would fundamentally alter the scope of the Bill and, ultimately, change the underlying objectives of the legislation.  This is clearly at odds with the Government decision to create a lawful basis for a forensic excavation, recovery, analysis and identification of remains at institutional sites where manifestly inappropriate burials occurred, as is the case on the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam.  These amendments would also represent a strong interference with the jurisdiction of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.  Any intervention in an investigation relating to a violent or unnatural death or where there are questions regarding the lawfulness of the circumstances surrounding the death should clearly come under the remit of those two bodies.  That is why the Bill rightly provides upfront that an order may not be made if an investigation or inquest is under way and if the Garda Commissioner is of the view it would be premature to make the order for intervention pending the outcome of the investigation.  Similarly, the Bill rightly provides that where an intervention under the legislation is under way, a director must notify An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner of any evidence of violent or unnatural death that comes to light during the intervention and then follow their directions.  Moreover, it is unclear how within this legislation it would be established prior to an intervention that a death had occurred in a violent, unnatural or sudden and unknown manner.</p> <p>The manner in which bodies are buried forms part of the considerations of what may constitute manifestly inappropriate burials or where they have been buried in a way that would not be reasonably considered to constitute a dignified interment.  I do not see a justification to refer to the body-disposal method given the manner of interment is included in the scope of the Bill.  This legislation seeks to complement existing law, including the Coroners Act, not to replace it.  As a major change to the general scheme, I removed all restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner, something I was called on to do by both the Oireachtas joint committee and relatives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We did that to ensure the role of the coroner would continue to be respected.  Under this legislation, the director must try to identify the circumstances and cause of death of recovered remains and if evidence of violent or unnatural death emerges, notify the coroner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na immediately.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 39 and 40 are concerned with changing the description of the type of death that must be notified to the coroner and a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  While I appreciate the intent, I can assure the Senators that the current wording of violent or unnatural would encompass any suspicious death where there is potential evidence of same, including homicide.  In practical terms, it is also important that the wording remains aligned with the basis for exhumation in the Coroners Act.</p><p>More broadly, the director will publish the full post-recovery analysis report in respect of all recovered remains, which will include the cause and circumstances of death where it is possible to ascertain it.

This Bill is designed to create a lawful basis for forensic excavation, recovery, analysis and identification of human remains at institutional sites where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When the abhorrent situation at Tuam was first discovered, the Government was advised that a full forensic standard excavation, recovery and identification of human remains could not take place under the legislation that existed at the time and that new legislation was needed.  That is what this legislation is.  This Bill is intended to fill the legislative gap in order to allow us to respond appropriately to the situation at Tuam.  To avoid delays in responding to any similar situations that should arise in the future, the legislation was expanded to allow for excavations and identification programmes at other institutional sites, should similarly manifestly inappropriate burials be discovered.  </p><p>Removing considerations of evidence regarding "manifestly inappropriate burials" would result in an unclear basis for any intervention.  It would make it difficult to determine the circumstances under which this law could be used to intervene at a particular site.  Furthermore, the deletion of the term "manifestly" would not correspond to the original Government decision that underpins the drafting of this legislation.  </p><p>Section 8(1) of the Bill sets out four criteria which can be used to determine whether a burial site contains manifestly inappropriate burials.  These are as follows: that the human remains are uncoffined; that they were buried in such a manner that would not have complied with the requirements at the time of such burial set out in the burial grounds&rsquo; regulations; that they were buried in a way that would not reasonably be considered to provide a dignified interment; or that they were buried collectively and in a manner or in a location which is repugnant to common decency and would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place. </p><p>These criteria are included in the legislation to ensure that there is sufficient consideration given to key factors before any intervention can take place at a burial site.  They do not limit the fact that any intervention under the legislation will involve a full forensic standard excavation, recovery and analysis.  There must be evidence, in accordance with clear criteria, that the people were buried in a manner that is considered inappropriate.  </p><p>As Senator Flynn knows, Ireland has a long history of respecting burial sites and of respecting the dignity and the sanctity of burial sites.  That is why we are setting this threshold.  It has to be a manifestly inappropriate burial before we can intervene in the very significant way that this legislation allows us to intervene.</p></speech>

However, I cannot support it.  We need to allow a latitude that intervention does not occur because it may be the desire of the mothers of babies interred for there to be no intervention.  I can think of instances such as Bessborough where mothers want to be able to sit beside where their baby is interred and there are many others in a similar situation.  To substitute the word "shall" would oblige the Minister to act.  I do not believe that is correct.  There needs to be discretion and the word "may" within the legislation provides for that discretion.</p></speech>

I am not in a position to support these amendments.  Replacing "may" with "shall", as proposed by amendments Nos. 5 and 6 would, as Senator Seery Kearney said, remove the discretion of the Government and constrain its ability to make Government decisions on proposals which are brought to Cabinet.  It would not be appropriate to compel the Government to make an order.  The legislation provides a range of conditions which have to be met in making an order.  The intention is to provide detailed guidance to the Government on making a decision on such a significant and sensitive matter.</p> <p>The other amendments in this group seek to remove the important concept of safeguarding objectives of public interest or to reduce the factors that underpin it.  Excavation and recovery of human remains is an extensive complex and sensitive intervention.  In making a decision the Government has to balance the need to intervene with the need to respect the long-standing tradition of the sanctity of burials and consider the overall public interest.  The legislation, therefore, sets out a number of factors that the Government will take into account when determining if an intervention is proportionate, including the need to accord dignity to persons buried on the land and the need to respect the views of relatives of persons buried on the land, public health and alternative options, if any, that may be available.  </p> <p>Safeguarding public interest in not unique to this legislation and is an extremely important concept.  In a context where this legislation is significantly impacting constitutional rights, it is vital it sets out a robust legal basis grounded in the public interest for that impact.  Looking at the factors listed, I know we all agree with the need to respect the views of relatives of persons buried on the land, and I acknowledge amendment No. 24 would provide for this.  I have met many survivors and families connected to various mother and baby institutions and I have heard the very strong views expressed by some that they would regard excavations at their relatives' remains as a violation and something they would fundamentally oppose.  It must be emphasised that in expressing these views everyone has always acknowledged the situation in Tuam is absolutely unique and that it is absolutely essential that we excavate in Tuam but the legislation we are designing here is not just for Tuam.  It is for other sites as well and it must be designed in such a way that takes account of different views of relatives with respect to differing sites.  </p> <p>It is also safe to assume no one would question the importance of according dignity to persons buried on the land.  However, public health is also an important aspect of an intervention and public health considerations are one of the main reasons laws around the exhumation are strictly controlled.  We cannot disregard the impact on the wider public, including local residents.</p> <p>Regarding social and economic interests,  I would like to stress cost is not a criterion set out in either the general scheme or the Bill.  The Bill revised previous wording and replaced the term "economic impact" with "social and economic interests of the State".</p> <p>I believe the amendments being proposed would fundamentally weaken the protection of constitutional rights within the legislation and, therefore, the legislation itself and it would not be in the ultimate public interest of those who are most centrally affected.  As such, I cannot accept these amendments.  I would note I am confident applying the public interest test set out in section 8(3) will in no way prevent the intervention we all want to see at the site in Tuam.</p></speech>

What we are dealing with in this provision is where there is a burial on private residential land.  We are thinking of a situation where perhaps an institution sold off land to an estate and now there is potential intervention on that land.</p> <p>Under the original heads of the Bill I brought forward, the Bill stated that if there are private dwelling houses on private land that is subject to a potential intervention, there will be no intervention.  The intervention was stopped.  That is not the case any more.</p> <p>When we brought the Bill to the D&aacute;il we stated where an intervention is sought on private land it can take place but up to 20 m from any residential house on the land.  We amended that in the D&aacute;il and brought that distance back to 10 m.  Therefore, an excavation can take place on private land within 10 m of a residential house.  We think that is a fair balance between ensuring an excavation can take place but the immediate privacy of a landowner will not be automatically interfered with by the very substantial works a dig requires.  The Senator is seeking to remove this further.  We feel 10 m is a fair limit.</p> <p>I wish to make another point concerning an issue that was raised a while ago.  This particular provision does not apply to the situation in Tuam because the land in Tuam is in public ownership.  The site, as we all know, is the garden of remembrance there but it is also the cark park and playground, and the entire site is in public ownership.  This provision will in no way interfere or limit the ability to undertake an investigation in any part of the Tuam site.</p> <p>It is also important to note an investigation can go within 2 m into private land adjacent to the Tuam site.  As we know, there are many back gardens that immediately abut the site of the septic tank and it is possible, under a separate provision of the legislation, for works to take place within 2 m of those gardens.  Work almost certainly will have to take place because there is a very large wall immediately overlooking the site, which will have to be temporarily removed for safety reasons.  </p> <p>I am not in a position to accept this amendment but I want to make it very clear the provision we are talking about will not in any way interfere with excavation on any part of the Tuam site.</p></speech>

The criteria set out are all-important factors that need to be considered in deciding whether or not to make an order.  If an investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a coronial inquiry is taking place, an intervention under this Bill could potentially interfere with the investigation or inquiry.  This is precisely why the legislation provides that the Government should not make an order in this situation if - and I emphasise if - having consulted with the Garda Commissioner or the coroner concerned, the Government is of the view that making an order is premature pending the outcome of the investigations.  There is also a strong rationale for excluding official burial grounds, for ensuring that the appropriate buried human remains are not disturbed unnecessarily and that health and safety considerations are taken into account.</p></speech>

It is impossible to memorialise something if we do not know or agree on what we are acknowledging.  The report of the expert technical group itself stated that in order to memorialise, it is essential to know what and who are being acknowledged in that memorialisation.  Further investigation on behalf of the Government will be required in order to memorialise effectively.  In the absence of specifying what the substantive reasons are for not engaging in intervention, it is impossible for this provision to be a proportionate engagement with the rights and preferences of victims and survivors, including former residents of institutions and their families.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is also noted that Ireland's international obligations under relevant EU and UN conventions should also be checked as the memorialisation measure in lieu of a proper investigation, as is being suggested in the current wording, would appear to allow an Irish Government to literally bury the truth in order to avoid international embarrassment.

That is what we are all seeking to achieve here.</p> <p>Because we are dealing with different sites, I am not in the position to accept these amendments.  It is vital to recognise that excavation may not be the desired outcome in every circumstance.  I know  that Senators here will have engaged with family members who have differing views as to the treatment of the remains of loved ones.  Again, and I make this point every time, this is not the situation in Tuam.  Everyone is in agreement about the need to excavate in Tuam.  However, in other sites there are different views.  This legislation, which is not site specific, has to be sufficiently flexible to allow the Government to take account of different circumstances and differing views that may arise in the future. </p> <p>On foot of the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations, this provision in the legislation has been amended to specify that the Government must have substantive reasons to form the view that memorialisation of the burials on the land without further intervention is more appropriate.  I would like to dispel any potential misperception that this provision will allow the Government to refrain from intervention.  The Government will have to clearly set out the reasons for choosing memorialisation.  That rationale has to be sufficient and must reference the particular reasons why the decision was taken.  I hope that provides an element of reassurance.  </p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are very doable.  We should be engaging with relatives and relevant people are around us.  It would be interesting to hear the Minister speak on this.

As we know, what is proposed here is significant in terms of excavation, exhumation and identification.  If there was a strong view there, that would be a substantive reason.  We have to look at this on a site-by-site basis.  However, certainly strong views held by relatives that they do not want to see intervention would, to my mind, constitute a substantive reason.   This would be on the foot of the Minister having brought a proposal to the Government.

Public awareness and perception of common decency and dignified burial have evolved and matured over the years and these burials should be viewed as in compliance with the burial requirements we have now.  It was common practice that babies were buried with others who were not known to them.  This, of course, would not be acceptable now.  My own brother was buried in the angels plot in Glasnevin with a child who died in childbirth and without baptism.  I do not think we would tolerate that as a society today.  That is the rationale for that amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 is as above whereby any consideration of burial grounds and their contents should be considered to be in compliance with contemporary practice.  Moving with the times, we can look back at how we treated babies in the past but we would not tolerate it today.</p></speech>

The provisions they seek to remove are necessary to aid the clear interpretation of the criteria that define a manifestly inappropriate burial.  Amendment No. 21 seeks to remove the phrase "at the time of such burial" from subsection 8(1)(b) of the legislation.  As I explained in the D&aacute;il, it is important that an assessment of burials relates to the time at which such burials took place and the agreed custom, practice and requirements at that time.  It is difficult to justify assessing burials with reference to requirements that were not applicable or perhaps did not exists at the time of such burials.  Burial ground regulations have also changed since 1922, which is the start of the period when this legislation is applicable.</p> <p>Similarly, amendment No. 23 seeks to remove the phrase &ldquo;and would reasonably have been so considered at the time the burials took place&rdquo;.  One of the criterions the Government must try to assess before deciding whether a burial site associated with an institution has manifestly inappropriate burials is whether most people at the time of the burial would have found the burials at a site like Tuam acceptable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Without this, it is much more difficult to interpret what "repugnant to common decency" means.  There is also a risk of incorrectly applying present day customs or values.</p><p>Amendment No. 22 seeks to remove references to the manner or location related to the burials of remains and limit it to the fact that they were collectively buried.  Accepting this change would significantly broaden the scope of what may constitute manifestly inappropriate burials.  There may be a considerable number of locations where bodies were buried collectively in the past but which may not be necessarily regarded as "repugnant to common decency".  The term "collective burials" would also be open to interpretation in the absence of reference to how remains were buried.  It is, therefore, essential that the manner and location of burials are taken into account when assessing the inappropriate nature of burials.</p></speech>

I will set out the reason I believe that is the case.</p> <p>Amendment No. 31 proposes that the circumstances and causes of death are considered in post-recovery analysis and that these are noted in the director's report to the Government.  This is provided for in the Bill already.  Section 10 outlines the general functions of the director and section 10(b)(iii) specifies the requirement to arrange for the post-recovery analysis.  Section 35(2) places an obligation on the director to carry out the process of post-recovery analysis and provides that this includes establishing, if possible, the circumstances and cause of death.  The section further provides that the director's report must document the outcome of the activities undertaken as part of post-recovery analysis, which includes establishing the circumstances and causes of death, where possible.</p> <p>Amendment No. 41 proposes that a report on forensic examination and recovery and post-recovery analysis be prepared following the expiration of the period of operation of the office of director of authorised intervention, which will include the performance of functions by the coroner.  As I outlined, section 35 already provides for a director to prepare a report following post-recovery analysis and this report must document the circumstances of the discovery of the human remains, the forensic excavation recovery and the outcome of the activities carried out during post-recovery analysis.  A report on the functions carried out under Part 2 is therefore already provided for, and there is a requirement that this report be published and publicly available.</p></speech>

In response to the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, report I made provision for final arrangements.  The amendments are to do with the final arrangements for the burial of remains following identification and recovery.  In response to the PLS process I provided that final arrangements will be made in line with the wishes of family members.</p> <p>Section 57 provides that where a familial match has been made, the director will make arrangements at the request of family members to either return remains to family members or make arrangements in line with their wishes.  In cases where a familial link has not been established or where an identification programme is not undertaken or is not continuing, a director will make final arrangements having regard to the stated wishes of persons who believe they have family members buried at the site, the dignity of the deceased and the condition of the remains.  The matters that are set out in the amendments are already provided for in the legislation.</p></speech>

Many detailed and thoughtful recommendations were made by the joint committee to ensure that families felt heard.  However, not all families will get the opportunity to have a decision on the remains, but it is to be hoped it will be many more than we anticipate.  I am grateful to the Minister for taking on board the recommendations of the report.</p></speech>

This amendment is a small addition to section 30.  I understand that the Minister of State has the notes in front of her.<b></b>We hope that these provisions do not prevent somebody from speaking up in the interest of the public good.

The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 already protects the rights of those making a protected disclosure under that Act.  The Act does not in any way prejudice the rights of those making a protected disclosure under the Protected Disclosures Act.  While it is an offence under section 32 of the Institutional Burials Bill to intentionally or wrecklessly disclose confidential information, the Protected Disclosures Act provides a defence.</p></speech>

For example, there is no mention of forensic anthropology in the Bill whereas forensic anthropologists would be essential in the analysis of human remains, and in co-ordination with forensic geneticists, to re-associate the human remains recovered so the absence of clearly stating their role in the process risks having unqualified and inexperienced professionals carrying out this work.  Working with co-mingled remains is a highly complex process and it will require experts who have sufficient experience in that process to carry out the work.</p></speech>

On foot of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the provision in the general scheme was significantly revised to ensure that appropriately qualified persons deliver excavation and post-recovery analysis in line with international standards, and according to professional rules and guidelines.  It is clear that the works need input from a range of disciplines and it is not necessary to refer to that in the legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Only a multidisciplinary approach can meet the international standards and deliver the required work.

A decision was made to not expressly recommend anything because a wider scope allows for the growth of scientific knowledge and so different types of disciplines that, as yet, we do not know or they have not yet been named.  As a consequence, there was a recommendation to have appropriately qualified persons to allow the scope to be as wide as possible and for the legislation not to be overly prescriptive because being prescriptive in any way would, perhaps, exclude.  So the wording that is there was confirmed and reiterated as part of the PLS process.</p></speech>

We, in the Civil Engagement group, believe that the Government should work with people and that people have a right to information about their relatives, etc.  We recommend that the Government accepts the amendment because it is important that family members get closure.  The amendment calls for a simple task to be done, especially with the technology that is available these days and I look forward to hearing the ministerial response.</p></speech>

The Bill provides that before an identification programme begins a director will hold a public information campaign to raise awareness about the programme, and outline how eligible family members and spouses or civil partners of a deceased person can register an interest in participating, objecting to another person's participation or their interest in receiving remains.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has always been the intention of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, that the information campaign would target persons within and outside the State and that they would be in plain English.  I am happy to give the undertaking, along with the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, to take effect here today.  I do not think that this needs to be included in the legislation.  Sustained engagement with survivors and former residents of the mother and baby homes and county homes is central to the delivery of all elements of the Government&rsquo;s action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby homes and county home institutions.  The Minister has engaged with survivors in relation to aspects of all ongoing work on a regular basis.  He is immensely grateful to all of those who continue to give so generously of their time to engage with the State on these issues.  He is committed to continuing this work in a manner that is transparent and accessible to surviving communities, both at home and abroad.  I hope that speaks to the Senator&rsquo;s point on communication both at home and abroad.  To that end, the Department continues to engage with the Department of Foreign Affairs to utilise the invaluable resources that is our network of embassies and consulates right across the globe to ensure that we can reach as many of the survivors living abroad as possible.  </p></speech>

It is to insert the word &quot;all&quot;.  It expands on the meaning of relevant information and documents in the Bill.  It inserts the word &quot;all&quot; before the records to show that there is no ambiguity as to which personal records are to be shared with an applicant.  All of the records should be shared and it is a straightforward amendment.  </p></speech>

I do not propose to support this amendment as I feel it is unnecessary.  The definition of relevant information and documents in the Bill is open-ended and it facilitates the consideration of various types of documents that may support the identification of a deceased person, including records relating to a person who resided in the institution concerned.  No record relating to such a person is excluded from the current definition.</p> <p>In response to amendments proposed in the D&aacute;il, the list of examples given in the definition was expanded to include explicit references to baptismal certificates, institutional admissions, the discharge records, as well as information obtained in post-recovery analysis.  However, the definition remains open-ended so as not to unintentionally exclude documents which the director may need in undertaking his or her function.  In this context, I highlight that section 27 provides for a director to compel and enforce a source to provide such information and documents as required for the purpose of assisting him or her in performing his or her functions under the Act.  The definition of "information source" includes public bodies which have or had a role in relation to the institution concerned and religious organisations or bodies.  This section also empowers.a Minister to designate a person as an information source if the Minister considers that he or she may have documents.  </p></speech>

It adds a provision to the Bill so that when a report is published regarding the review of an office of director of authorised intervention that relevant officials would make themselves available to attend the relevant joint committees.  Doing so would provide Members with an opportunity to scrutinise the report and engage officials on the content.</p></speech>

In response, the Minister agreed to examine it in order that it would be possible to amend the legislation to ensure that a director would be in a position to attend Oireachtas committee meetings following publication of the final report.  On Report Stage in the D&aacute;il, the Minister brought forward amendments that require a director to submit a final report to the relevant Minister at least 12 weeks before dissolution date.  The relevant Minister will then be required to lay the report before the Houses within six weeks of receipt.  This timeline provides, at a minimum, for a guaranteed six-week window when a director could be called before an Oireachtas committee to discuss the report prior to dissolution date.  These amendments were accepted and incorporated into the Bill.  I am of the view that the amended provision addresses this issue sufficiently.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the House on Second Stage.</p> <p>It has been 50 years since the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 established the Higher Education Authority, HEA.  That is the context.  It is 50 years since we have legislated in this area.  The Irish third level education system has been on an incredible journey during that period.  In 1971, there were approximately just 20,000 students in higher education and this has increased to over 200,000 students in the present day.  It is quite an extraordinary success in this country.</p> <p>Higher education has become more accessible to all students in all parts of society, although we all accept that there is more work to do.  Ireland now has one of the most highly educated workforces in the world.  I put to the House that the single biggest transformation in Ireland over the recent decades is in and through education.  We need to continue that transformation to meet the State's social, economic and labour market needs.  In our colleges and universities, we develop the right skills for our future workforce, and we do much more than that.  We nurture the societal benefits of education and we build our research capacity to drive forward innovation.</p> <p>This Bill repeals the 1971 Act and marks a new dawn for our higher education system.  It maintains a reformed HEA and brings in generational changes, all of which are key to the development and progress of our human talent and capability.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Bill repeals the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 and reforms the legislative framework for higher education, enabling improved policy development and planning in the sector, a focus on the needs of the learner not just the institution and improved oversight and regulation of higher education institutions, HEIs.  The reforms in this Bill will: improve oversight, including in respect of financial matters; focus more on the needs of the learner; and enable improved policy development.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-28a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062800002#QQQ00300"><p>I am sure that can be arranged.  We will make copies available.</p> <p>The Bill provides a legal basis for the functions of the HEA and the role of the Minister.  HEIs are independent entities established under statute or as not-for-profit or private institutions.  The HEA is the statutory body that acts as an intermediary between autonomous HEIs and the State.  Crucially, the HEA is responsible for securing the achievement of Government objectives for the higher education system and ensuring accountability and securing value for money in the use of hard earned public funds.</p> <p>This legislation is a key part of the Government's reform agenda and should not be read in isolation.  As colleagues will be aware, I published a landmark policy document, Funding our Future, which charts the various reforms made in higher education, in May.  After years, if not decades, of people ducking and diving the question as to how to sustainably fund higher education, the Government is answering that question.  The initiative will: include additional Exchequer investment in higher education, because we recognise that education is a public good; increase student supports; and reduce the cost of education.  Investment in higher education and helping families with the cost of education are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p>The legislation will recognise that autonomy and flexibility are essential features of HEIs.  As we carefully go through this legislation on the different Stages, Senators will see that there is a strong recognition of academic freedom, autonomy and flexibility and that there is not a one-size-fits-all model in the context of the higher education landscape.  That must, however, be matched with transparent governance and with accountability to students, stakeholders, staff and the public.  It is important to note that the legislation will not impinge on the academic freedom of HEIs or their staff in any manner or means.  This is a core tenet that will continue to be enshrined in legislation.  Institutions will continue to be supported to do what they do best, namely, deliver excellence in education and research and provide places of engagement and insight to support a flourishing democratic society.</p> <p>The objective of the higher education system is to provide high-quality education that is: innovative and adaptive to the needs of the learner; advances equality, diversity and inclusion; strengthens engagement with the wider education system and wider society; creates knowledge; and maximises the contribution of higher education to social, economic and cultural development.  The Bill will provide a detailed and modernised framework to provide for the achievement of these objectives within an appropriate oversight and accountability framework.</p> <p>The Bill was published in January.  It has probably been consulted on more than any previous Bill in the history of the State.  It has been discussed over a long number of years by quite a few Governments.  Good luck to anyone who wants to state that there has not been consultation in respect of it.  The Bill completed its passage through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week.  I am in Seanad &Eacute;ireann today to seek to advance the Bill during this legislative session.  I realise that this is an ambitious timeframe, but I have come here in the spirit of co-operation and wanting to work together.</p> <p>As stated, there has been extensive consultation on the Bill, including three formal consultation processes in 2018, 2019 and 2021.  The general scheme was scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science during a pre-legislative scrutiny process between July and September 2021.  There has been ongoing engagement with key stakeholders throughout the development of the Bill.  I have made significant changes to the Bill as a result of that engagement.</p> <p>We have had meaningful engagement.  What do I mean by that?  We brought forward or accepted the themes of 179 amendment on Committee and Report Stages.  We did not just rock up with a Bill and say off we go.  We teased out a number of significant matters, including the structure of the governing authority, environmental sustainability - I compliment Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh on the excellent work he has done in that area - the student voice and student engagement.  We also did major work in the context of 20-odd amendments relating to the Irish language and strengthening its role.  In the D&aacute;il, 97 amendments were made on Committee Stage and 82 amendments were made on Report Stage.  These amendments were brought about after engagement with the Oireachtas, stakeholders, representatives and civil society groups, including students, during the passage of the Bill.  This has placed us in a stronger position as we debate the Bill in this House.</p> <p>I will now list some of the matters we have covered so far.  We have increased the student voice from two to three representatives on the governing authorities or boards.  We have strengthened teaching and research through Irish.  We have strengthened provisions for sustainable development, including climate action and biodiversity.  We have put in place additional consultation provisions for key stakeholders, including students, HEIs and trade unions.  We have strengthened the provisions relating to the autonomy of HEIs, specifically in the context of their relationship with the HEA.  We have provided for the incorporation of educational institutions into a technological university, which is very important in terms of St. Angela's College being incorporated into the Atlantic Technological University but which could be important more broadly.  We amended the Student Support Act 2011 to provide for the awarding and payment of bursaries and scholarships to disadvantaged students to pursue further and higher education.  We have done a lot of good work through amendments in the other House to strengthen the functions of the HEA in terms of cross-Border co-operation.</p> <p>I will now outline the key sections of the Bill.  Part 1 contains standard provisions for a State agency and includes the interpretation section.  A key amendment to this part was the inclusion in section 2(3) of a definition for environmental development and sustainability, which significantly strengthens the provisions in this Bill for sustainable development and climate action.</p> <p>Part 2 includes provisions on the HEA, the objects and functions of the HEA, ministerial powers and information, the board of the HEA, administrative co-operation with other bodies, funding and accountability of the HEA, the CEO of the HEA, and the staff of the HEA.  Some key amendments made to this section have strengthened the objects and functions in terms of the Irish language.  The functions were also expanded to incorporate an international function for the HEA, and provision has been made to strengthen cross-Border collaboration.  An amendment was also made to provide that guidelines issued by the Minister to the HEA may be published, which is an important step in terms of transparency.</p> <p>Part 3 includes provisions for strategic planning in respect of tertiary education and funding.  The strategy for tertiary education is a key provision that enables us to set a long-term strategic direction for tertiary education for the next ten years.  Again, key amendments were made to the relevant section with regard to the Irish language and environmental development.  This will ensure that these issues are central to strategic planning in the sector.  Amendments were also made to provide for consultation with a list of relevant bodies, including institutions, students and trade unions.</p> <p>The Bill provides for the funding of HEIs and other bodies in accordance with conditions of funding as specified by the chief executive.  Important amendments were made with regard to the balance between the powers of the CEO and the board of the HEA.  There was a useful debate in this regard during the D&aacute;il engagement.</p> <p>Part 4 provides for engagement with students, including engagement at national level, and HEIs and contains provisions with regard to a student survey.  Part 5 provides for the development of an equity of access, participation and promotion of a success plan and provisions for lifelong and flexible learning.  Part 6 includes provisions for the supply and processing of personal and non-personal data.  Part 7 provides for the designation of institutions of higher education and the obligations of certain designated institutions of higher education.  Part 8 provides for the oversight provisions by the HEA of designated institutions.</p> <p>A number of amendments were made in the D&aacute;il to strengthen the autonomy of HEIs.  These include: providing that the CEO must have significant concerns prior to requesting a HEI to undertake a review; providing for HEA board approval for a number of remedial measures that which could have a reputational impact on an institution; removing the provision with regard to providing assistance to a HEI following a review and replacing it with a provision that a HEI may request assistance, which is an amendment that was sought by the sector; and incorporating an appeal of the appointment of a reviewer and a stay on the appointment.  Part 9 provides for the establishment of an appeals board by the Minister within 28 days.</p> <p>Part 10 provides for amendments to the Universities Act 1997, including provisions relating to the appointment of new smaller, competency-based governing authorities.  Again, key amendments were made to this part.  Ultimately, what we are trying to do here is have smaller governing authorities and more external representation.  That does not mean representation necessarily appointed by the Minister and can be more broad in terms of how external appointments are made.  What we are trying to do is move to a competency-based composition of a governing authority.</p> <p>Trinity College Dublin is legally different and will therefore be permitted to appoint an additional six fellows to its governing authority in recognition of Trinity's distinct legal basis and, in particular, the distinct role played by the fellows of the college.</p> <p>Part 11 provides for amendments to the Technological Universities Act 2018.  Part 12 provides for amendments to the Regional Technical Colleges Act and the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act.  Part 13 provides for amendments to the National College of Art and Design Act 1971.</p></speech>

The third level education landscape has been transformed over the last number of years.  We have had the creation of the brand new Department of Further, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  There has also been great focus on third level, which is crucial.  There has been the development of technological universities to drive innovation in new campus towns and cities across the country.  The third level qualifications of a degree, masters and PhD are now more accessible to people everywhere.</p> <p>The announcement earlier today regarding additional places at third level is welcome, especially after the increases that each of the HEIs delivered over the last two years.  The HEIs have been incredible, in particular when one considers that they were at the pin of their collars.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There has been so much work within the Department and the HEIs to deliver this.  The expansion of third level, as the Minister mentioned, is targeting college places as well as the apprenticeship programme.  One thing we have focused on, which has been a target throughout his Department, is further and higher education and how important it is to have that.  Even if there are not opportunities for people to continue under further and higher education, they can still achieve degrees.  There is no longer just that traditional path we always speak of, whereby people go directly to college.  There are so many people who sometimes cannot afford the costs of going to college, whether because of rent or having to travel for hours on end.  I studied in Coleraine and we talked a lot about transport on buses.  It involved an eight-hour journey, with two buses, a train and another bus, to get from Ballinasloe to Galway, then to get a bus to Sligo and to go over to Derry, before travelling to Coleraine and Portstewart.  Students do this.  They travel and put in the hours but we have to show there is more accessibility, and through the technological universities and campuses, we can now do that.</p><p>I like the fact that IT, architecture and construction, nursing, engineering and education and welfare are now part of this apprenticeship programme and that 16 new apprenticeships that have been rolled out.  Members also were given a breakdown and although it does not include the medical student places, I acknowledge the work of the new technological universities that have come into being and are really delivering here, as our HEIs have been doing over recent years.</p><p>The core objectives of this legislation on the HEA relate to promoting and supporting our higher education institutes.  It is about excellence in teaching, learning and research, and that is down to investment not only by our Government but also from non-Exchequer areas.  We need to ensure our institutions will be able to take an income from international students, which was such a loss over the two years of lockdown.  Moreover, they need to be able to take an income through Horizon Europe and other international funding programmes that reward success at an international peer-review, competitive level.</p><p>We also need to promote and safeguard the interests of students and advance equality, diversity and inclusion in higher education.  Much work has been done by our HEIs, particularly at National University of Ireland, Galway, under the consent framework.  That has been crucial in tackling an awful lot of challenges we are seeing in our third level sector.  Our HEIs are taking the lead and rolling it out, with an evidence base around it, in order that we will have safer places for students and staff in HEIs.</p><p>The accountability framework, too, is very important.  I have spoken to representatives of the Irish Universities Association, IUA.  As the Minister stated earlier, there are 179 amendments on which he has engaged over a long consultation process, and this has been going on through a number of Departments.  It is crucial that the voice of all stakeholders be heard and engaged with and that we come out with legislation that will really work for us in Ireland because we want our institutions to be world class.  They need to be world class.</p></speech>

The Bill before us needs to come into play right now.  A body of work is being done by all our HEIs and the stakeholders that have been involved but we need to crave success and excellence and there needs to be a sense of competition between our technological universities and our HEIs.  We need to reach those rankings again.  We need to ensure that through our peer-review system, which has been set up by Science Foundation Ireland and the Irish Research Council, IRC, we will reward and support as much as possible those research teams that are achieving success, but we cannot do that until investment is in place.  When it is, universities will in turn also have opportunities to bring in further income based on that Government investment.</p> <p>It is crucial the international reputation of the higher education sector be aligned.  The Government and representatives such as the Minister, the Department and the HEIs must be aligned in what we want to see as success for the third level sector.  Success comes in many different forms.  It can be 200,000 people achieving qualifications, Ireland ranking high in innovation, and building research teams that excel and draw down funding.  If we do not see that happen at every level in every section of our third level, that is where I would say we would need to come back to it.  There is going to be a lot of monitoring and review of this legislation.  We need to show it is fit for purpose, and we will talk through all these sections as we move through it.</p> <p>I appreciate the fact the student voice has been included, particularly at secondary school level during the lockdowns and earlier during the pandemic, and that we are now bringing this through at third level as well in the form of the competency-based nature of the governing boards.  They will be crucial to support our HEIs where there are gaps because they will be able to offer that student voice.  Other areas we have spoken about and which the IUA has raised relate to the chief executive of the Higher Education Authority and how we are going to think about financial issues.  The CEO's role will be under the funding conditions set out for each of our HEIs and there will be able to be a quick and speedy response in funding.  There will also be an appeals process and board approval for a lot of other measures when it is considered what is going to be done in terms of the outcomes of any type of review.  It is important the policies being developed by the HEA will also include a public consultation section and that it will allow all stakeholders to feed in to these policies that will be developed to help improve the sector for all of them.</p> <p>As for the three-person appeals board, I acknowledge amendments have been taken on board relating to the ten-year period of experience for the barristers and solicitors.  We are also looking at ensuring that someone who sits on that appeals board will have knowledge of the Irish third level sector.  Of course it can be someone from an international background, but he or she will need to have knowledge of the Irish third level landscape.  We are very different from many other countries.  The UK is no longer in the EU and is no longer drawing down non-Exchequer funding from Europe, while the US has the National Science Foundation, NSF, and the National Institutes of Health, NIH, a very different model from that in Ireland.  It is crucial that anyone involved in the appeals process really sees what is needed here.</p> <p>This legislation is absolutely necessary because we want a world-class third level sector and that will happen only when we have this legislation in place to support our HEIs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-28a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1675" speakername="David Norris" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062800002#RRR00400"><p>On 8 June 2021, the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, stated:</p> <blockquote> 	It is not an overstatement, I believe, to make the argument that the ruination of the university tradition, by a process of attrition, surrender to the quiet hegemony of that which is really unaccountable, is at hand.  Indeed the very <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>of the university, I believe, is at stake. </blockquote> <p>That is a very interesting quotation from the President of Ireland.  There has been an enormous increase in the number of students, something I have noticed myself.  When I was studying at Trinity College, there were 2,000 students; now there are almost 20,000, a tenfold increase.  Of course, that is in parallel with the general trend for the increase in numbers receiving a university education.</p><p>This is a large and complex Bill of more than 140 pages.  I am very pleased we have in the Public Gallery my distinguished colleague from Trinity College, Sean Barrett, pro-chancellor and former distinguished Member of this House, who has been very helpful in preparing me for this legislation.  The US Supreme Court interpreted the royal charters and letters patent of Dartmouth College in 1819 as prohibiting the interference of the Governor of New Hampshire in the governance of the college because charters are binding in perpetuity, including in the post-independence US, but the Minister has refused the request of my distinguished colleague, Sean Barrett, to place the document in the library and I ask him now why he refused to do so.</p><p>This is access to information and information informs debate - that is what it is for.  In addition, the Government cannot dismember a charter foundation and we promised not to do so under the Belfast-Good Friday Agreement, which respects diversity of tradition and identities.  I have heard a lot of blather from the Minister about diversity and so on but he has shown no respect for it.  The Bill assumes the Trinity College Dublin, TCD, charters and letters patent can be altered as in the Bill.  The contrary case is that the charters and letters patent are binding in perpetuity on both the monarch, in the case of the United Kingdom, and successors and on the bodies in receipt of the charters.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Trinity has a distinct diversity of identities, which should be respected.

What a pity.</p><p>May I point out to the previous delightful speaker that Trinity is the highest ranked university on this island?  We were proud that at one point it was ranked 50th or thereabouts globally.  Given that there are universities like Oxford, Cambridge, Dartmouth, Yale and Harvard, that was a wonderful position for a small island like this to be in.</p><p>In terms of diversity, this situation looks to be an exact parallel with the great fight by the great dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift, to maintain the independence of the speaking voice, and the intellectual and academic freedom of, the dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in defiance of the authorities at the time.</p><p>The Minister is perfectly right to make the point that all of the universities are in receipt of substantial funds from the Exchequer.  For this reason, they should of course be accountable.  However, the Minister is taking unto himself very considerable powers.  I will give two examples.  According to the explanatory memorandum on Chapter 2:</p> <blockquote> 	<i>Section 11 - Power of Minister to give directions to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s</i>provides that the Minister may give a direction in writing to An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s requiring it to comply with any matter referred to in this Act including having regard to any other enactment or the implementation of any policy or objective of the Minister or the Government.  It provides that An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall comply with any such direction and shall inform the Minister of the measures taken to comply with that direction.  It also provides that the Minister may amend or revoke any such direction in writing.  </blockquote> <p>In Chapter 3, section 16 deals with membership of the board of An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s and provides that the board will have 12 members - a chairperson and 11 ordinary members - and that all appointments will be made by the Minister.  According to the explanatory memorandum:</p> <blockquote> 	[Section 16] provides that the board shall consist of persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have sufficient experience and expertise in certain competencies.  It also provides that not less than 1 of the members shall be a student or a full-time officer of a national student union, nominated by the national student union.  </blockquote> <p>In Chapter 2 on the provision of funding by An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s, section 37(1)(c) - &quot;a person who, or a body which, provides support services for higher education&quot; - needs greater clarification.  It is vague, so I would be grateful if the Minister provided a more detailed opinion on this matter.</p><p>It is lamentable that there should be such a grotesque grammatical lapse in the explanatory memorandum regarding section 75, which reads: &quot;<i>Section 75 &ndash; Provisions relating to Trinity College, Dublin</i>provides that the governing authority of Trinity College Dublin shall comprise of 17 members&quot;.  You do not &quot;comprise of&quot;.  You either &quot;comprise&quot; or you are &quot;comprised of&quot;.  I would like people to note that.</p><p>There is confusion over the repeal of section 19 on visitors.  This section provides that the Government can appoint a visitor to a university.  I originally believed this to be an interference with Trinity's right to nominate the visitor.  The visitor is someone to whom students or staff can make an appeal directly.  In my time, it was a great man, the late Mr. Justice Theodore Conyngham Kingsmill Moore.  I do not believe that anyone else in the House will remember who he was.</p></speech>

Perhaps he has that experience.</p><p>The joint committee wrote:</p> <blockquote> 	It is widely recognised that legislative reform will be of limited value unless it is accompanied by a sustainable funding model.  The HEA, as part of its core remit, must retain a key role of advising the Minister on the level of public funding required to enable HEIs to fulfil their responsibilities under the legislation and their performance goals agreed with the HEA. </blockquote> <p>This is crucial.  Without funding, nothing will get done.  No matter what different vantage points we assume, we all want to improve education.</p><p>Finally, in conclusion, at last and at length, the Irish people have had a love of education since the earliest and darkest days of our history.  At a time when it was forbidden for Roman Catholics to attend school, there were hedge schools.  During the Dark Ages, we were the beacon of intellectual light for the whole of the Continent.</p></speech>

In a previous role, I was familiar with some of the background work involved.</p> <p>The Bill aims to replace the Higher Education Authority Act 1971.  The HEA was established three years prior to that.  The Minister referred to how our higher education system had transformed considerably over the half century since.  Approximately one in ten of those aged between 18 and 20 years of age used to go on to higher education.  Today, that figure is more than six in ten.  Our universities have a much greater research function now and we have seen the growth of the regional technical colleges, RTCs, which became institutes of technology and technological universities.  There is also a greater emphasis on second-chance education now.</p> <p>Of importance is the recognition of the change in the role of the university, particularly by the State.  Previously, attending university would have been viewed as training for the professions.  Now, there is an understanding about how universities are driving innovation, contributing to solving societal and economic problems, and shaping Irish and global life.</p> <p>Any regulatory regime that we put in place through this legislation or otherwise has to be concerned with trying to ensure that we continue to meet the objective of having a globally recognised excellent system of higher education.  I have always had a problem with university rankings because they only measure certain elements.  It is important that we have a globally recognised excellent system that meets the needs of Irish society primarily.  We can be proud of the contribution made by staff and management down the years to this achievement.</p> <p>Previously, economic policy was based a great deal on tax and talent.  In this century, the battle will be around talent.  As a result, we must ensure that our universities are the driving forces behind talent and that we support them in that regard.</p> <p>Since a great deal more power is being granted to the HEA under this Bill, it is crucial that the authority have an adequate number of staff to deal with some of the new responsibilities being given to it.  Echoing something that Senator Norris said and perhaps speaking from my experience in another life when I worked with the HEA, another matter that is crucial but is not sufficiently spelled out in the legislation is the relationship between the Department and the HEA.  For example, the Minister can give direction to the authority regarding its annual plan and so on.  There may be a requirement to spell that out in more detail in the legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need an administrative and regulatory structure that supports academic excellence.  One mistake that is often made is that academic autonomy does not mean the ability to do whatever you want.  Academic independence must be respected.  Due to the challenges we had in some of our higher education institutions, this legislation addresses some of the questions around financial accountability on the part of our institutions.</p><p>I will turn to the objectives and functions set out in sections 8 and 9.  I refer to two of the functions that were set out in section 3 of the original 1971 Act.  One was "promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research" and another was "promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education".  I am a little concerned that in the functions being provided for within this Bill, there does not seem to be the same level of emphasis on those aspects.  This is at a time when the concept of liberal education is under threat.  I am not even talking about complete totalitarian regimes but what has happened in Hungary, for instance.  It is important that we have an authority that promotes and respects the democratisation of higher education, as well as the value of higher education and research.  I am not just talking about the economic value or the value for the individual but the role of higher education in contributing to institutions.  That is something the Minister might reflect on.  While there is rightly a lot of emphasis on the access agenda, the 1971 Act referred to "promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education".  There is less talk of promotion in this Bill.  The language used is about supporting it.  There is a slight difference between promoting and supporting but we can get into some of that later.  It is important that we raise awareness about access.</p><p>Having watched the debate on the Bill in the D&aacute;il, it is clear the Minister took on board many of the proposed amendments, addressing quite a number of concerns of various stakeholders.  It is certainly the case that the authority, an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, will now have a far more regulatory rule, which will move it into a different position.  It is also proposed to reduce the board size of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  To follow up on Senator Norris's point, there is no difference there as the Minister has always appointed the members of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  It is just a case of having a reduced board, which is to be welcomed.  Regarding the composition of that board, there is the question of international experience and internationalisation.  There should be a guarantee of one member of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s who is either from outside the State or from inside the State but with experience of international education.</p><p>I welcome the commitments Senator Dolan mentioned around student engagement in Part 4 of the Bill and access and lifelong learning in Part 5.  I ask the Minister to give some assurances on the issue of designated institutions and authorised providers.  This was raised on section 53.  The Minister will be aware that a question has arisen around the National College of Ireland and its future status with regard to the legislation.  Perhaps he might provide us with some clarity on that matter.  On oversight, in section 66 there are nine remedial measures the CEO can take with regard to the designated institutions.  The Minister said that only three of those require HEA board approval.  In the interests of checks and balances, nine should require some reference to the board.  Otherwise it would be conferring a lot of authority on the chief executive.</p><p>University governing bodies are considered in many cases to be too large and unwieldy.  Provisions in this regard are set out under section 76.  Given that the role of the governing body is the strategic direction of the university, appointment to its governing body should increasingly be competence-based.  We need to find mechanisms within our universities to represent the views of all stakeholders.  Given the modern role of universities, which we have set out, that competence-based requirement will be essential.  Broadly, I am very happy with the legislation and I hope the Minister will look favourably on some of the amendments tabled on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

Having been a member of the joint committee that did pre-legislative scrutiny on this Bill, many of the recommendations have been taken on board by the Minister so I thank him for that.  However, I will outline some areas where improvement is needed.  The lack of independence of thought leads to real issues across the globe.  Education is front and centre when it comes to many of the problems across the globe.  Much of the authoritarianism and populism is driven through education systems.  Our education system came from being a method of control of the population.  It has changed from that but it would be a grave misunderstanding of the current system to say it is autonomous and independent.  It is to an extent but not having State control does not mean there is no control.  It does not mean it is fully independent because everybody is dependent on something else for their funding.  At the moment many institutions are heavily dependent on State funding, which simply is not enough.  I think the Minister would admit that himself.  He has made huge changes in that regard.</p> <p>In 2018, a UNESCO paper stated, "Recent trends in privatization and marketization of education ... tend to favor a vision of education as an individual and consumable good".  That is what we have to make sure we do in this Bill.  What we are doing is stating that there have to be State controls when it comes to our education system.  Otherwise we would be allowing ourselves to be at the whim of other forces.  I have the utmost respect for institutions around the country.  We have not gotten to that point but there is a real danger that we could, as has happened in other jurisdictions where people are essentially following the money.  When there are large industries bringing money, particularly for research, it is very hard to say no to that.  One of my colleagues mentioned the international element and what is measured.  Oftentimes what is measured is research output and not teaching or that social good.  The core of this Bill is about education as a public good and that is why it is a good Bill.  It is long and lists stakeholder after stakeholder.</p> <p>An awful lot of the recommendations of the committee were taken on board, as well as those made on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  The Minister brought his own amendments and did the work in engaging with stakeholders.  He took on board the amendments that were put before him and tabled his own to take those things into account.  I note that he has included trade unions as stakeholders, which is a massive step forward.  During the pandemic we saw the absolutely essential role trade unions play in our education system.  The unions, particularly the student unions at secondary and third levels, were in the centre when dealing with the pandemic.  As was said by the Minister for Education and officials from her Department, the education system simply was not flexible enough at the time to deal with the pandemic.  There will be more and more challenges like that in the future, climate change being one of them.  There will be an influx of people from other countries, as is happening now with Ukraine.  We need a flexible Bill and that is what this is.  It is a flexible Bill listing stakeholder after stakeholder to be engaged with as institutions change and flourish into the future.  The Minister has taken on board the recommendation that students be involved.  Having sat on the board of NUIG, soon to be the University of Galway, I understand that it is a core requirement that the people who are in the middle of education are actually sitting there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That has been taken on board.  I agree that this element of competency-based members and representation must be met.  One of the difficulties is that people are on the &uacute;dar&aacute;s for a long period.  They are all people who have left education whereas students are coming and going.  That is the way it is written in at the moment.  I would like if we could perhaps discuss that on Committee Stage and Report Stage.  I know from personal experience that when people are coming and going on a yearly basis, they do not perhaps have the same influence as those who have been there for a long period.  There is that institutional knowledge.  There is an automatic respect for somebody who has been sitting in place for a long period.  We need to make sure students are respected equally for their contributions.</p><p>It also seems there are points where it is written in that training goes one way and flows towards the students as opposed to it also being about listening to students.  If there is to be full engagement, that is what we need to have in that regard.  This Bill has huge teeth, particularly because it allows for the withholding of moneys.  The real strength in this lies in withholding public money if things that are in place to actually protect the well-being of our population are not met.  That must be front and centre when it comes to education.  People should choose to go into education because it pays a dividend to them, and not just in economic terms but in terms of improving their lives.  Of course, education is also about ensuring we have a strong citizenship and that we are working towards common goals.  It should also give something back to individuals, however.  That is why the emphasis that has been placed on equality, diversity and inclusion is incredibly important.</p><p>There is a missing piece here.  I will go back to that issue around private schools and private institutions in general.  It is still the case that nine of the 20 schools that sent the highest proportion of their students to third level education in 2020 are fee-paying schools.  The Minister has addressed that in some ways but perhaps not through this Bill.  I wonder whether there is something we can do around that.  He has provided, for instance, &euro;3 million for the higher education sector for more autistic inclusivity and to help autistic students navigate their time in third level.  He has also provided &euro;3 million each year until 2026 in order that universities can come up with pathways for students with intellectual disabilities.  Those are hugely welcome, as is the widening of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants.  I could go on.  I know there is much there but when it actually comes to the Bill, I wonder whether more can be done.  Perhaps we need to look at that on Committee and Report Stages.  I thank the Minister for his time.</p></speech>

Before I begin, I share the sentiments of other colleagues.  I recognise and appreciate that substantial progress has been made with regard to this Bill.  It will improve the overall governance framework.  As other colleagues have acknowledged, however, there is room for improvement.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in supports legislative reform in higher education to clarify the role of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, increase inclusion and access and ensure proper governance and accountability.  I recognise that the Minister and his Department have taken on board a number of recommendations Sinn F&eacute;in put forward during pre-legislative scrutiny and on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  These include issues regarding the role for the HEA in promoting an Gaeilge or the Irish language, increasing North-South co-operation, increasing the number of board members and the removal of the limit on numbers of members on academic councils as well as others.</p> <p>I welcome the inclusion of student representation on the board of the HEA.  I also call on the Minister to take on board the committee recommendation that trade union representation should be included on the board.  Likewise, I welcome the inclusion of a specific role for the HEA in promoting cross-Border co-operation in higher education.  The Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science also specifically called for a role for the HEA in promoting cross-Border student enrolment.</p> <p>I note and welcome that the Bill now makes specific reference to the role of the HEA in promoting the Irish language.  I assume this was an oversight in the general scheme and I am glad it is now included.  That said, the role given to the HEA in promoting the Irish language is weaker in the 2022 Bill than it was in the 1971 Act it will replace and the Universities Act 1997.  This should be strengthened.</p> <p>Despite these changes from the general scheme and original Bill, there is still substantial room for improvement in this legislation.  We will continue to work constructively with the Minister in the hope that this gets the Bill to where it needs to be.  As things stand, I am not satisfied that the Minister has struck the right balance between the autonomy of institutes of higher education and governmental oversight.</p> <p>We have engaged extensively with the sector over recent months and the management of every institution accepted the need for the highest standards of transparency and accountability for public finances.  That is beyond question.  The Minister will always have Sinn F&eacute;in's support for any policy that achieves that.  However, there are many proposals in this Bill that reduce the autonomy of institutes without any clear relationship with transparency or accountability.  We have yet to see or hear a convincing justification for dictating such rigid governance structures, such as the mandatory 19-member limit on governing bodies.  These are unpaid positions.  Every governing body has its own unique make-up and tradition.  Slashing the numbers allowed on the boards seems like a decision that colleges are more than capable of making themselves provided they meet certain standards of competency and external representation.  The substantial reduction in size will put more strain on the members and reduce the representation on the boards of different sectors of the institution and, indeed, the wider community.  The removal of broad representation on the governing bodies would be a real loss.</p> <p>It is unfair to say this legislation will move the sector to a competency-based governance model.  Governing bodies are currently made up by members of the academic and non-academic staff, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, alumni, local authority nominees, trade union representatives, employers organisations and others.</p> <p>In 2018, a Fine Gael Government passed legislation on technological universities that stipulated a 22-person governing body or 26 in certain cases.  A few short years later, that has been reduced even further again without any clear explanation as to its merits.  We welcome the move to increase the number of student representatives on governing authorities from two to three on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Governing boards benefit and are strengthened by external member ship but again, this legislation mandates a majority of external members without clear justification or explanation.</p> <p>I wonder how strong the justification could possibly be given board exemptions have been granted to Trinity College Dublin already.  I have no issue with Trinity College Dublin being shown flexibility to reflect its unique governance structure.  I believe different models can be equally successful provided certain safeguards are in place to ensure good governance, transparency and accountability.</p> <p>Trinity College Dublin is not the only college with its own unique history and governance structure.  The newly-formed Atlantic Technological University will soon make Castlebar a university town.  This multi-campus technological university involves thousands of students spread across locations in Castlebar, Galway city, Killybegs, Letterfrack, Letterkenny, Mountbellew and Sligo.  The geographical spread and multiple campuses mean it is very distinct from most other colleges yet it is provided with no flexibility.  To anyone watching - student, parent, academic staff or otherwise - this looks unfair and elitist.  The Minister could look again at the rigid, overly prescriptive governance structures and adopt a fair approach that can be applied to everyone without damaging the unique characteristics and differentiated missions of different institutions.</p> <p>Another issue is that the Bill grants sole powers of review to the CEO of the HEA and empowers the CEO to make a determination on whether further action is necessary following a review.  The right of higher education institutions, HEI, to appeal a decision by the HEA must be robust enough to provide HEIs with assurances that they challenge decisions.</p> <p>We met representatives of most third level colleges in the State over the last 12 months, all of whom were more than happy to be held to the highest standards of accountability as recipients of public funding.  That said, there was also a great deal of concern about the watering down of their institutional autonomy.  Good governance and accountability can be ensured without sacrificing the autonomy of third level institutions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The greatest testament to governance of higher education is that they have managed to maintain the performance of the system over the last decade.</p><p>We have seen over the last ten years of austerity in the higher education sector that governance is not the fundamental main issue that faces the sector.  Legislative reform will be of limited value unless it is accompanied by a sustainable funding model.  During that time there has been piecemeal privatisation and deep commercialisation of public third level education.  Today, most universities have a majority of revenue that comes from sources other than the State.  Some of that is positive such as winning competitive research funding or attracting more international students.  However, it has been driven out of necessity due to what the Irish Universities Association labelled as State divestment from third-level education.</p><p>The ethos and focus of these centres of education and research have been shifted towards commercial consideration.  Huge amounts of time and energy are spent operating on a commercial basis, which is energy that would be better spent on education and research.   Of course I do not blame the individual institutions as this has been the explicit policy of successive Governments.  We see this in fees because this country has the highest undergraduate fees in the EU.  In addition, fees at graduate and postgraduate levels are even higher.  There are extortionate on-campus accommodation costs.  Despite a student accommodation crisis there are universities that reserve half of all of their on-campus accommodation for fee-paying international students as a means of attracting a revenue stream.  We now have a ratio of 23 students per academic staff member, which is far higher than the European average of 15 students.</p><p>Colleges still operate under the employment control framework that is austerity policies.  The seven universities now hold around &euro;1 billion of debt with hundreds of millions of euro already agreed to be borrowed.  These loans often come with commercial conditionality.  In other words, money can be borrowed for student accommodation on the condition that market rents are charged.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in will always engage seriously and constructively on issues of governance and higher education but this legislation will be meaningless unless we are serious about funding the sector.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the HEA should be given a clear mandate to protect the public nature of the education system.</p></speech>

I have a particular interest in this legislation having been a member of the governing body of the UCC and the HEA board, in a previous life.  This legislation has been mooted for a while and it is good to see it come through the Houses.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has had extensive engagement both with the joint committee and in the D&aacute;il on amendments and stuff like that.  I hope that he is just as enthusiastic with amendments in this House.</p> <p>A number of issues that I wished to mention have already been raised and I shall repeat them.  I wish to discuss the balance of power in terms of the CEO of the HEA.  The Minister has agreed that three out of the nine areas would have to go to the HEA board for permission for the CEO to follow-up on.  Given our capacity nowadays to meet within 24 hours using Zoom technology then we do not have to wait to get people in.  The old argument that the board could not be constituted quickly enough for a serious matter no longer stands because, as we have seen over the past two years, we can constitute people from any part of the world within quite short notice.  The old argument is not a strong enough reason not to stipulate that one needs HEA board approval for all nine areas.</p> <p>In the past few days I spoke to representatives of different groups who feel very strongly about this matter.  It seems that we have nearly gotten there with three areas and we should go the whole way with the remaining areas.  As a former member of the HEA board I know that if something serious arose that the CEO felt required a level of mediation or whatever then we would all hop to it pretty quickly.  In addition, if one is a member of the board then one is committed to education.  Therefore, it would be worthwhile for the Minister to consider expanding this provision to the nine areas.</p> <p>I feel that this legislation centres power with the one person who is the CEO.  We are proposing legislation that depends on the will of one person to do what is right, to initiate and to be the judge.  Is there a gap between the spirit and intent of this legislation?  I ask because that is a lot of judge and jury for one person.</p> <p>As some groups have mentioned, there are issues with codes and guidelines.  There is a list of codes and guidelines.  However, if one does not comply with them then there will be a series of consequences.  I do not believe that these are guidelines if there are consequences.  The Minister will appoint the members of the appeals board and one member must have legal expertise such as a barrister or equivalent.  It is important that the legislation stipulates that a person has higher education knowledge.  It is obvious that one of the members must have higher education knowledge.  If the legislation explicitly stipulates that one person must have legal knowledge then we should stipulate that a person has higher education knowledge, and perhaps even from an international perspective.  I hope that the appeals board will be extremely rarely used but if we are going to establish a board then we may as well properly constitute it.</p> <p>Originally, this Bill was due to be about governance.  Perhaps, it is testament to the Minister or his team that this Bill has gone a little beyond a governance framework.  It is a broad and encompassing Bill.  Obviously the Bill does not deal with the future funding of higher education and the committee is compiling a report on funding.</p> <p>I note the correspondence that the Minister had with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, around dealing with the issue of a students' union and defining a students' union.  That issue could not be covered in this Bill.  The definition of a students' union, who they are and who the Government can engage with have been matters between the old Department of Education and now we have a different Department.  A variety of political parties have consistently opposed the basic concept of defining a students' union, which seems strange.  There is no great threat to be derived from defining students' unions.  Without being too pedantic, a student union is for one student and a students' union is for all of the students.  I thought that it might be a bit crazy to propose a cacophony of amendments seeing as "a student union" seems to be the agreed terminology.  Following the point that Senator Norris made about grammatical errors then we, students' union people, will live on with our "s".</p> <p>The term "value for money" has been used quite a lot when discussing this legislation.  Without question, we want to see value for taxpayers' money.  Sometimes when we talk about value for money we gloss over the fact that the Government supplies the money and for quite some time institutions have run things while being quite underfunded.  It is important to put on the record that while we are in favour of value for money, the institutions have worked in a very tight system that creaks at the seams to provide value for money when the money was not there.</p> <p>A previous speaker alluded to the following matter.  When we consider the TU mergers one realises that there are multiple campuses.  Those mergers have been worked on for quite some time and are quite delicate sometimes.  Has the Minister given consideration to temporarily allowing the governing bodies to allow for representation by a variety of campuses that will eventually merge into one TU?  Has this matter arisen?  I suggest that a temporary facilitation for the next ten years is given to allow a smooth merger and thus listen to the voices on the boards.</p> <p>Concern has been raised about support staff and trade union representation.  I am concerned because both at a local governing body level and at the HEA level there is no specific reference to representation.</p> <p>This Bill is significant legislation that will shift how the HEA will operate.  A new Department has operated for two years.  It is important that the HEA is not reduced to an entity that just distributes money and then chases people when they do not distribute money.  Even when I was a member of the HEA board, the HEA advocated and lobbied on behalf of the sector.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that it does not get shifted the other way where the HEA becomes something of a sheriff around town as to who gets what money and what happens with it and then loses the ability to advocate on behalf of what is a very large sector, given the HEA has over &euro;2 billion.  I am still not entirely sure if the balance as to where that needs to be is exactly right in the legislation, but I look forward to engaging with the Minister further as we go through the different Stages.</p></speech>

I welcome all attempts to modernise the higher education sector and I hope we will be able to do that in this Bill.  However, Senators Ruane and Higgins and I will be proposing a number of amendments to the Bill to address the serious concerns the Civil Engagement Group has.  The Higher Education Authority Act is 50 years old and society and education have changed a great deal in that time, so it is time to take the necessary steps to evolve our education system too.</p> <p>I welcome every opportunity to advance equality, diversity and inclusion in our education system.  There is a clear lack of those in the higher education system and I support the Bill's attempt to address that.  I am glad that the Bill proposes proper accountability for the funding given to institutions as we must ensure that funding is used wisely and fairly.  I am also glad that the Bill proposes a clear commitment to better engage with students, but I question why it only allows for three students on university governing bodies.  We should be actively listening to student representatives to address students' needs properly.  I strongly believe that more than three students should be on the university governing bodies.</p> <p>As a member of the education committee, I took part in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and I am very disappointed that the Government decided against the recommendation to include specific reference to a universal design.  We must ensure that all education environments are designed to be made accessible to all people regardless of their age, disability and background.  Including universal design in the legislation is the only way to do this and ensure that it happens.</p> <p>I am glad the promotion of North-South co-operation, as recommended by the committee, has been included in section 9 of the Bill.  Living in a Border county, I know how important student mobility is, as is collaboration with the higher education authorities in Northern Ireland.  I am also glad that the Bill includes the committee's recommendation to ensure meaningful representation of traditionally under-represented social groups in higher education.  We must ensure equal access and representation for all in our higher education institutions.  We also must make sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to be successful in those institutions.  It is great to see the limit of seven on the academic council is removed.  At the same time, I am disappointed that the legislation is not fair to all higher education institutions in the country.  Despite the fact that we are introducing legislation to reform all institutions, it appears as though one institution secured a key exemption from the proposed reforms.  It has been stated that Trinity College Dublin will be the only university permitted to retain a majority of the internal board and will have 22 members on its governing body, while other universities will have 17 members.  It is very unfair to treat institutions differently.  If we really want to move forward and modernise the education system in this country, we must do it together and do it fairly.</p> <p>I understand the concerns regarding the independence of universities and I agree with the importance of promoting student representation.  However, the changes should be uniformly applied to all 24 institutions addressed in the legislation.  We cannot introduce legislation that does not treat all the institutions equally.  I urge the Government to consider this.  We must ensure independence within governing bodies and I would be wary of increased Government control within these bodies.  We need assurance from the Minister that this will not affect the independence of the governing bodies of our educational institutions.</p> <p>I join USI in expressing concerns about the reference to value for money.  We must ensure that the conversation does not move towards one of further marketisation of higher education.</p> <p>Again, our group will have a lot of amendments to add to the Bill and as the Civil Engagement Group engages with people, it is to be hoped we will be listened to.</p></speech>

I have a keen interest in it.  I served in the previous education committee when this legislation was mooted.  I also served on the governing bodies of both a former institute of technology and the University of Limerick, so I have had a great interest in this area.</p> <p>I welcome the fact that the Minister is amending the Housing Finance Agency Act 1981 to allow educational institutions to take out loans and build their own student accommodation.  This has been a major problem for a long time and it is welcome to see this included in the legislation.  I am aware that one or two of the ITs approached the Minister or had engagement with the Department regarding their ideas on this.  Certainly, in Limerick there is the University of Limerick and Mary Immaculate College. as well as a college of higher education, so there is a huge student cohort.  A shortage of student accommodation has been a major issue for a long time.</p> <p>I also welcome that the Minister is awarding payment of bursaries and scholarships to students to facilitate persons who are educationally disadvantaged.  That is very important, particularly in the context of lifelong learning where people from all walks of life are being encouraged to go forward.  While I realise the Minister has developed the apprenticeship side of things, many people are now going on from apprenticeships to complete a degree and to go on further.  That is to be commended.</p> <p>There are a few issues, some of which have been raised already.  In terms of getting approval, sometimes it went back to the chair of the HEA but I believe it should require the approval of a number of board members or even the full board.  One of the Senators pointed to the importance of Zoom now and the fact that one can organise a meeting online quite quickly, whereas in the past it would have been necessary to bring the board together.  Many things can happen online now and I believe it should not just rest with one person and that a number of people having the power to make approvals should be considered.</p> <p>Regarding compliance with guidelines, codes and policies, I understand that due to different things that happened in the past, there is alleviation there where perhaps financial penalties can be applied to somebody who steps out of line.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There has to be a balanced approach as well.  I would just put that on record. </p><p>In terms of the appeals process, I note in the legislation that the Minister is proposing a team of three.  I would like him to consider somebody who has international experience.  I know that it has happened in other countries that they have brought in people with a particular level of expertise.  That has added to proper engagement and to bringing in different perspectives.  This is something that the Minister could look at.  Limerick College of Art and Design is part of T&uacute;s and, because art is such an international experience, they bring in many experts from outside of Ireland, as well as drawing from our own level of expertise.  It a matter of sharing resources and sharing thoughts.  Having that international experience brings a different and more balanced perspective.  </p><p>If the Minister is going to set up an appeals board, I would like to see someone on it who would have that area of expertise.  Overall, I welcome this legislation.  It has been crying out for amendment.  It has been 50 years since it was amended and much has happened in that time.  Our education system has changed so much.  I know about the passion, determination and the drive not only of the Minister, but of his staff in the Department.  I commend all on the legislation coming forward and look forward to working with the Minister on this in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-28a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062800002#XXX00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a very important Bill.  Sadly, this this House has got to the stage where contributions are limited to five minutes, which is inadequate.  W.B. Yeats&rsquo;s great speech &ldquo;We are no petty people&rdquo; would have been ruled out after about two paragraphs, given how we now operate things.</p> <p>I have huge problems with this Bill.  I want to outline some of them to the Minister.  First, I do not think it is correct that the Minister should choose the appointees to the Higher Education Authority in the way that is provided for in this Bill.  We can look at the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and other institutions.  There, at least, they have to go through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, or something to be approved for membership of these bodies.  Yet, here, the Minister has total discretion in relation to appointments.  The criteria for appointment are so general that effectively the Minister of the day will choose the board of An t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  </p> <p>The second issue I want to raise is a really serious problem with the legislation.  Could I draw the attention of the House to section 143 in respect of guidelines, codes and policies?  An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s may prepare or adopt and issue guidelines, codes or policies to designated institutions of higher education for any purpose relating to this Act and concerning any matter or thing referred to in this Act or any other enactment, and the implementation of any policy or objective of the Minister or the Government.  It can say, &ldquo;It is Government policy to do this and we are issuing a guideline&rdquo;.  What is the consequence of that?  We then find, if we go to section 64, that the chief executive officer of an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s is entitled to determine that an institution is in breach of a Government policy guideline and can take certain steps in relation to that.  The steps are set out in section 66.  At the moment, with the exception of the measures as in subsections 66(3)(a), 66(3((b) and 66(3)(d), which relate to a requirement to undertake a course of training or review of the strategic development plan of the institution, the chief executive officer is entitled to make a determination under this section without the consent of the board.  One of the things he can do without the consent of the board is the withholding by an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s of funding due to be paid to the institution of the refund of funding paid by an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s to it.  Why would something like that not require a majority of the board to say they agree with this, especially if the power of admonishment to the institution does require a majority consent?  </p> <p>I am talking about the whole idea of university autonomy.  Government policy is to be handed to a university and the person who enforces compliance with the Government policy is the chief executive of an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s.  He can make a decision to withhold funding from an institution if it is not complying with it in his view.  The only remedy is to appeal to an appeals board.  The appeals board deals with appeals not merely from him but from the Minister.  The Minister chooses the people who will be on the appeals board to decide his own case.  This is fascinating.  Under the Act, he choose the three people.  It is a very unusual situation.  The Bill says that they are to be independent, but you choose three people to vet yourself.  That is wrong.  All of that is wrong.  </p> <p>There is another issue, which is a minor matter.  However, it is something that I would ask the Minister to take account of.  In a number of cases, if a person is sentenced to imprisonment by a court of competent jurisdiction, they cease to be a member of the governing body or whatever it may be.  If, for instance, the president of the student union is given a seven-day public order offence for a demonstration, or something like that, he or she is gone.  That is not right. </p> <p>I have only had five minutes.  I do not want to delay the House.  There is the combination of the power of the Government to enact a policy being handed to the chief executive of an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s and for him to cut off funding to a university or institute of higher education for non-compliance with Government policy.  The whole idea of university autonomy is being inverted by that.  A lot more thought needs to go into this Bill in order to conserve autonomy.</p> <p>I will finish on this point.  We do not need to rush this through.  It has gone so far.  We are coming up to the end of July.   I know even from the courts that everyone suddenly gets into a neurotic state of mind and thinks that if it is not done now it will never be done.  However, this Bill needs very serious further consideration.  It should not be guillotined and it should not be rushed through.   </p></speech>

He makes a pertinent point in two parts.  I congratulate Senator Dolan on the work she has done in the committee on the Bill bur it needs further parsing and teasing out.  Perhaps if Senator McDowell reviews section 68, it may answer some of his questions.  I was reading this the other night.  I was wondering why, to my mind and from that initial cursory reading, we were giving huge power to the chief executive.  Then I note in section 68 a provision on the appointment of a reviewer of a designated institution of higher education.  I wonder if this addresses Senator McDowell&rsquo;s points.  Maybe it does not.  Section 68(9) states that &ldquo;An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall consider the final report&rdquo;.  However, being an educationalist, I note that there is a board of management of a school and there is a governing body.  There needs to be transparent autonomy that allows for whatever determinations that are made to be clearly laid out.  I would always be concerned if the power is vested in a single person, whoever that person may be.</p> <p>By the same token, and I apologise that I cannot find the answer to this, can the Minister answer a question on the composition of the governing body of University College Cork?  Are the lord mayor and other councillors still included in that position?  I hope that this is not taken away.  If they are not included that would present a serious problem.  I would be completely and diametrically opposed to removing the lord mayor of Cork from the governing body of University College Cork.  I mean that.  I think that would be a wrong move.  It would take away a tradition that has served the university well.  I would hope that we can change that.  </p> <p>In saying all that, I welcome the Minister to the House and commend him on the work that he has been doing in the Department.  Tonight, we are here to discuss an important aspect of the work that he is doing.  We must try to ensure that the cost of putting students through college is reduced.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On "Morning Ireland" earlier, the Minister gave me huge hope and confidence and supplied a breath of fresh air.  I thank him for that.  The cost of putting students through college is far too high.  The Government must and will help to assist students and their families.  As the Minister indicated, and it is in the preamble to the legislation, the trajectory of people attending college has grown exponentially.  That has been quite evident in many of our university cities and towns.  I am very fortunate to come from Cork, where we have a very fine institution, University College Cork, and the equally fine Munster Technological University, formerly Cork Institute of Technology.</p><p>I thank all the people involved in the administration and teaching of third level education.  Our higher education system has changed so much since I was in it.  I welcome the innovative changes that have taken place.  Equality of access is important.  I remember the day the former Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, and then Taoiseach, John Bruton, announced free education at third level.  Unfortunately, that pathway to third level education has not been as equitable as we would have liked and hoped to see when it was launched on that momentous day.</p><p>Not everybody can go to third level.  That is why what the Minister is doing as regards the apprenticeship programme is absolutely critical.  I say that as somebody who taught the leaving certificate applied and recognises the totality of our education system, the wholeness of it and the fragility of the student who struggles and ends up trying to do leaving certificate plus but is not able to.  The Minister is correct that we have let apprenticeships lie for a decade.  What he is doing with apprenticeships is fantastic.  This morning's announcement regarding the different types of apprenticeships and their development is one all in this House should support.  We should work with the Minister to ensure we support the key areas in which we need people and that the issue is addressed in the context of the whole-of-government approach.</p><p>I will also refer to the increased places the Minister has offered in Munster Technological University and University College Cork.  I am looking to see where Munster Technological University is in the list of new places.  University College Cork has been given 51 places, but I am wondering if I missed Munster Technological University.  If I did so, I stand corrected.  I do not see it on the list, however.  If it is not there, why is that the case?</p><p>I thank the Minister for this important Bill.  I have a couple of concerns that I will come back to on Committee Stage because I am very passionate about education.  The Minister's contribution to higher education makes this a good day.  I thank his officials.  Today's announcement of 1,000 extra college places and the development of a new apprenticeship programme is one we should celebrate.  We should work to ensure we put career pathways in place for people on both paths.</p></speech>

It is good to see the Minister.  I will make a short contribution as my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, made a broader one.</p><p>I will raise an issue regarding the University of Limerick.  As the Minister will know, the Bill was amended on Report Stage last week to allow for the extension of governing authorities that are due to expire.  The relevant text can be found in the Bill, as amended by Report Stage amendment No. 98 in the D&aacute;il.  It reads:</p> <blockquote> 	... where the term of office of all or the majority of the members (including the chairperson) of a governing authority of a university expires by the effluxion of time during the period referred to in subsection (2), the Minister may, at the request of the governing authority of the university and if the members concerned so agree, extend the term of office of those members for such period (that is not longer than the period referred to in subsection (2)) as the Minister may determine to facilitate that governing authority to comply with that subsection. </blockquote> <p>I understand entirely why amendment No. 98 was made.  The period referred to in subsection (2) is 12 months from the date on which the new section 16 provisions will be commenced.  The difficulty is the manner in which the provision is currently worded may not assist the University of Limerick.  It will end up having to select a governing authority for a very short period with a new governing authority being selected a few months later.  In essence, if section 16 is not commenced before the term of the current governing authority expires, which is 30 November, then the provision will be of no use at all to the University of Limerick.  This is because the governing authority's term will have already expired by the effluxion of time before the section is commenced.</p><p>It is a simple question for the Minister.  The preferred scenario is that it would be open to the University of Limerick to make an application for an extension of the governing authority from the date of the Bill's enactment, as opposed to from the date of commencement of the provisions referred to in the amendment.  It is an important issue for the University of Limerick.  I needed to raise it today.</p></speech>

My colleague, Senator McDowell, has already adverted to the strange situation where we get five minutes in which to make Second Stage contributions in respect of a Bill of this importance.  It is in keeping with a pattern in recent years of less and less respect for the deliberative process in these Houses, in particular the Seanad.  I regret that.  I listened with interest to the Minister's speech.  He galloped through it but, thankfully, with the help of a script, it was possible to follow.  It strikes me that a very cursory approach is now being taken to the legislative process.  That is a very unhealthy thing.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It provides a legal basis for the functioning of an t-&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas and the role of the Minister.  He mentioned the significance of this legislation 50 years on.  We are told in the briefing that the purpose of the legislation is to reform the legislative framework for the higher education system &quot;enabling improved policy development and planning in the sector, a focus on the needs of the learner ... and ... oversight and regulation of higher education institutions.&quot;  I wish that the relative independence of institutions in the sector would be upheld.  I see new detailed structures for their new governance structures, which is fine, yet it appears there is a real danger of micromanagement of their activities by the State.  There will be amendments on Committee Stage.  I hope they will be fully supported, starting with the six university Senators who will, naturally enough, have a particular interest in this legislation.  I expect and hope for support across the House for what will, in effect, be amendments that seek to guarantee and copper-fasten good governance.</p><p>From my contact with the universities in recent months, it is clear they are very conscious of good governance locally within their university structures.  However, they believe that some of the measures in this Bill as it stands cut across respect for the good governance that can be done locally.  In this day and age, much is said in our society about the principle of subsidiarity but there is real reason to be concerned about the excessive power being given to the CEO of the HEA under this legislation to take remedial action in issues as important as the funding of universities without, in many cases, recourse to or support from the board of an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s.  The universities believe that if we are to be judged in our governance, we ought to be judged having regard to the question of whether there is support from the board of the HEA for the actions of the CEO.</p><p>I know the Minister has listened, but it is clear the question is has he listened enough.  Certain amendments have been taken on board, for example, regarding the power of the CEO to take action without reference to the board.  I was struck by the thin nature of the justifications on offer for allowing this strange situation to endure, especially in matters as important as funding.  It seems recourse to the board must be had in more minor matters, one might say, for example, where there might be a need to retrain somebody or some such issue.  When it comes to issues as serious as the funding of universities, <i>a fortiori</i>, there should be a requirement for the CEO to have the support of the board before taking action and not to act unilaterally.</p><p>The explanations on offer as to why the Government is satisfied with things as they stand so far, and that the Attorney General, for example, has looked at this and is happy, makes me wonder what that means.  Does it mean he thinks it is constitutional or that he likes the cut of the jib of the legislation?  This kind of vague rationale is simply not enough when we are talking about the extensive powers being given to the CEO of the HEA in a way that cuts across the institutions.  The health of our society needs to have a measure of autonomy, not least a measure of significant autonomy.  We are not talking about a lack of accountability.The universities want to be accountable but good governance means good governance and that there is always oversight of those who have considerable powers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why there will need to be amendments that insist on the requirement that the CEO of the HEA goes to the board in order to be able to take significant action.  Given that we can have incorporeal meetings and meetings by Zoom, it is not impossible in this day and age to arrange meetings very quickly to deal with serious matters, such as funding, where an immediate overnight decision will not be taken anyway.  With respect, the Minister and his Department need to listen more to the concerns of the universities on that.</p><p>As the Minister is aware, the universities continue to have concerns about the requirement to comply with codes, guidelines and policies.  It is an established tradition and feature of university life that there is either compliance or an explanation for non-compliance.  The Minister said that overall, that is still there in the architecture of things.  Where is it?  The universities certainly do not feel that it is there.  I will conclude by commenting on the issue of the appeals committee.  It seems to be a no-brainer that the composition of the appeals committee should include an independent, external, international figure.  It is also no-brainer that public servants should not sit on an appeals committee.  What we are looking for here is independent adjudication of whether decisions are properly taken.  Those are among the matters that I and others hope to return to on Committee Stage.  </p></speech>

I came through the further education system.  It opened many doors for me and my colleagues.  Indeed, some of my colleagues who went through Limerick Senior College in the early 1990s went on to become CEOs of some of the largest corporations in the world and finished up studying in institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University and Princeton University.  None of them would have got a place in a higher education institute with their leaving certificate results.  I am 100% behind the Minister on further education.</p> <p>Today, I am going to ask the Minister to pause the process.  We are moving a little bit too fast here.  I am aware the Minister said that there was a consultation process.  However, in respect of consultations undertaken in the last few years, he world has moved on since last year, and even further from two years ago.  That is particularly the case with Trinity College Dublin.  Right now there is a very delicate situation in Northern Ireland.  Boris Johnson and his Government are currently ramming through legislation on the Northern Ireland protocol.  It has been hailed by one side of the community in Northern Ireland as the motherland defending the rights of the citizen in Northern Ireland.  On the other side of the community, it has been regarded as the British Government reneging on a deal that it already agreed to.  We have rightly pointed out that the legislation, which is currently passing through the House of Commons, is unnecessary, unwise and probably in breach of international law.  In this Bill, particularly in relation to Trinity College Dublin, we are handing one side of the community a stick to beat us with, insofar as we are taking away the autonomy of Trinity College Dublin.  I recall that back in the days when I was president of the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, we were moving towards the establishment of the technical universities.  At that time, I could see the HEA casting its eye over the established National Colleges of Ireland, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin City University and University of Limerick, and thinking it needed to get its hands on that lot as well.  Looking at what the institutions have achieved on their own without Government interference, Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, National University of Ireland Galway, University College Cork and Maynooth University are recognised all over the world as institutions of excellence.</p> <p>Two words were used by my colleagues earlier.  One was "control" and the other was "competition".  I think that competition is healthy.  It drives innovation within universities.  The freedom and flexibility to move when various things happen within the world economy is what it is all about.  Successful universities are able to react immediately.  On control, the control should come from the local governing body, not from central Government.  There is too much of a drive to drag everything into a central organisation which controls every last move universities make.  I wonder how quickly they will be able to react if they are being controlled at every single level.  Are we going to kill innovation, and the ability of our universities to raise money either through the corporate sector or attracting students to study in Ireland?  It is fantastic that international students come here.  The flexibility that our third level institutions have had over the years to attract foreign students is commendable.  Looking at Finland, universities in Finland are independent.  They receive 64% of their funding from the state.  They do not need a higher education authority looking over their shoulder.  My own university, the London School of Economics, is an independent university.  It does not have anyone looking over its shoulder.  I am a little concerned.  I have no difficulty with the Minister legislating for the technological universities, which are new entities in this country and have yet to prove themselves.  However, I have some difficulty with the Minister stepping into the area that he stepping into with the National Universities of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin.  I would also include in that Dublin City University and University of Limerick, both of which are extremely innovative and would match any of the National Universities of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin, in my view.  I am concerned.  I have heard from various people who are involved in universities around the country that they are going to meet next week to discuss this Bill.  If they are telling me that, then there is something terribly wrong here.  We have been told that there has been extensive consultation.  However, I am being told that the universities are meeting next week to discuss the Bill.  If that is the case, we need to take a step back and give the institutions an opportunity to discuss the matter.  There is not a lot one can say here in five minutes or eight minutes.  Even when the Minister had 15 minutes to speak, he did not finish all his points.  If the Minister is not willing to pause the legislative process, we will have to bring forward amendments.  I sincerely hope that we do not go down the silly route of guillotining the Bill at some stage before the end of the session.  We can always come back to it in September.</p></speech>

I am glad to be back in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  Unlike in the other House, I am not a Member here.  The Seanad orders its business as the Members wish to order its business.  I am here to genuinely engage in good faith.  We genuinely engaged on the issue in the D&aacute;il.  We did not just come in and use our D&aacute;il majority to say, "Thanks very much, good night and good luck."  We brought forward 179 amendments.  While they were all brought forward in my name, bar one, many of them arose from opposition contributions and engagement with the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, the Irish Universities Association, IUA, and the Technological Higher Education Institution, THEA.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh brought forward quite a few amendments on behalf of Conradh na Gaeilge.  We also had very extensive engagement with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, as I mentioned earlier.  I am here to engage in good faith.  It will take the time that it takes, and we will work our way through it.  I would not be so rude, as a Member of the Lower House, to try to tell the Upper House how to do its business.</p> <p>At the outset, I wish to state that what we are trying to do in this Bill is to ensure that there is good, robust, modern internal governance in the institutions, which absolutely respects their autonomy.  This legislation sets out the importance of autonomy and academic freedom.  There is no threat to either, whether legal, policy-wise, implicit or explicit.  We took steps in the D&aacute;il, which I am sure we will be able to tease through on Committee and Report Stages, to further strengthen the importance of autonomy.  I really value having autonomous institutions.  They are a cornerstone of our western democracy.  However, we also need to know that there are good, internal, robust governance structures in place.  That is what we are trying to achieve with this legislation.  We can have the debate about whether we have got the balance right and how to improve it.  Let us do that, as we did in the other House.  However, let us not suggest that we are setting out to do something that we are not setting out to do.  I am not saying that it has been overly suggested here, but I have read about such suggestions.  We are not setting out to do anything to undermine academic freedom or autonomy.  I would never do that.  I do not believe anybody in a democracy would so such a thing.  I agree with Senator Mullen that we value the role of our universities.  I agree with Senators O'Reilly and Byrne on democratisation, free thinking and independence.  I wish to make that point at the outset.</p> <p>Senators Byrne and Hoey will be pleased to note that in many ways, this legislation is setting out in law what is already done in practice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are many excellent areas in which the HEA is proactively involved but it does so on a good faith basis that is not set out in legislation.  It makes sense to clarify in law what the HEA is when a Bill is being brought forward that defines its role, including its functions, objects and the role of the Minister in the new Department and what that does and how it interacts.  I was taken by Senator Hoey's point, and I want to fully agree with it on the record, that the HEA is not just a funding distribution office that hands out cheques for the year.  It does a lot more than that and it does a lot of really valuable work.  I just came from the launch of the zero-tolerance strategy on sexual violence and I would like to single out Dr. Ross Woods and the HEA for the incredible work being done in getting our sector to the place we want to be at in leading a zero-tolerance approach.  I use that as one example.</p><p>There has already been a good debate on CEO versus board in the HEA and on the balance of that division.  I want to be truthful and clear that we will turn to this in a lot of detail on Committee Stage.  We have to be careful not to just read parts of the Bill in isolation.  The Senators are all experienced legislators, including having a former Attorney General in the House, and the importance of reading the Bill in the round is genuine because it is not just about picking sections.  The CEO has to operate within the law and the framework, and there is an entire section in the Bill that sets out the functions of the CEO.  The CEO is accountable to the board in all of his or her decisions.  Would we be asking the CEO of the HSE to revert to the board of the HSE on every matter or would we accept that the CEO of the HSE runs the HSE but is accountable to the board?  We need to have honest and detailed consideration of the role of a board versus the day-to-day role of an executive and the different functions they possess, including the different functions of a full-time professional versus an expert competency-based board that has a different role.</p><p>The legislation is clear that the first step, which we worked on in the other House, is that if there is an issue of significant concern - and that phrase and threshold were put in deliberately - the first step is for the CEO of the HEA to ask the HEI to undertake a self-review.  It is not just a case of jumping right in and withdrawing funding; that is genuinely not what the Bill is trying to do and we can tease that through.  The HEI can rectify any issue at that stage before we get anywhere near the CEO making any determination.</p><p>As I have said already, the CEO can only operate in the framework and in compliance with the Bill.  In discussing the balance, which is a legitimate debate that we had and we made some changes in the other House, we need to look at that specific section in the Bill on the functioning of the CEO.  We also need to remember that the CEO is accountable to the board at all times in the performance of his or her functions.  The CEO has to provide members of the board with information, including financial information.  A board, in doing its job, would be holding the CEO to account.  Five of the six remedial measures which require CEO approval are funding related and the CEO of the HEA is the Accounting Officer for the HEA.  It is also the CEO who is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts.  When it comes to the Oireachtas discharging its function it is not the board that is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and it is not a chair or member of the board; it is the CEO of the board.  Can the CEO be accountable without having the ability to make those decisions and without that power?  That is a legitimate question that we should discuss and consider.</p><p>I want to talk about Trinity College Dublin and I want to thank Senator Norris for his kind words.  I got dizzy by the end of his contribution but I have the utmost respect for the Senator, who has served this House and country with distinction.  I always like that Senator Norris can disagree without being disagreeable.  He made an important point about funding and I said in my opening comments that this Bill cannot be read in isolation from the other pieces of the jigsaw that we are trying to put together on third level education, the most crucial of which is the funding our future framework on sustainably funding higher education.  That has been welcomed by every higher education institution, every president of every university, every chair of every governing authority and probably every party in the D&aacute;il.  The issue now is to get on and deliver it and I accept that.  Funding is important and it cannot be looked at in isolation.</p><p>On Trinity College Dublin, there is an idea that I got some mad notion and went off on one because of the monarch and all this stuff that was being quoted at me.  We wish the British Queen well during her jubilee year but I am not in any way accountable to any monarch and neither is this House.  The Constitution of Ireland and the Oireachtas are sovereign and there are many better historians than me in this House, but one does not need to be a historian to recognise that, so we will not get far in discussions on the monarch.  Perhaps that only gives an indication of a throwback to a different era rather than a liberal and outward looking democratic republic with a parliamentary democracy and Trinity College Dublin is on this journey.  I welcome former Senator Barrett and I know he fully disagrees with me on this Bill.  I still fundamentally respect him while disagreeing on that but I welcome him back to the House.</p><p>Trinity College Dublin completed its governance review and it identified the benefit of additional external membership; not me.  Trinity College Dublin envisaged in the review that 40% of its governing authority should be external.  That was not me but Trinity College Dublin and this is consistent with the provisions in the Bill which provide that not less than 40% of Trinity College Dublin's board should be made up of external members.  I heard from Trinity College Dublin Students' Union about changes to the composition and about giving the students more voice.  I want to praise Leah Keogh of the Trinity College Dublin Students' Union and we acted on that.  We also heard from the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, more broadly and we acted on that.</p><p>Senator Flynn asked for an explanation on why Trinity College Dublin is being treated differently.  I am treating it differently in recognition of the legal difference and the fellow structure and I am allowing Trinity College Dublin to have six fellows, as no other college or university in Ireland can.  We should bring a bit of balance to this debate and recognise that it is fundamentally, totally and absolutely wrong that the CEO of any organisation is the chair of the board, which is the situation in Trinity College Dublin.  Trinity College Dublin is autonomous, independent and brilliant and we love it.  We think it is great and we are working with it but this place is sovereign, it will do its job and we will work with Trinity College Dublin.  I thank the college for the work it has done, including the work it has done with visitors and I thank it for the co-operative and engaging way it has worked with us on this.</p><p>I also want to return to the issue of comply and explain because a good point came up.  Am I OK to continue?</p></speech>

Senator Hoey and a number of other Senators brought up the issue of guidelines; that the guideline has to be done and if that is not done one might be in trouble with the HEA.  This also needs to be seen both in law and in context.  The policy intent is compliance and I accept Senator Mullen's challenge to show that and to talk through it because he suggests that the sector has concerns about this.  I hear that as well so I am happy to do that on Committee Stage and we will have a chance to tease it through.</p> <p>This is about co-design and the HEIs themselves are consulted on the preparation of guidelines by the HEA and they can indicate any issues of compliance at that stage.  One of these guidelines is about environmental sustainability and one will be about sexual harassment.  We have an issue if public institutions are not implementing guidelines.  These are not in the space of academic freedom; and I am sure the Senator will want to stress-test me on that and make sure that is the case but this is not a case of the Minister of the day saying this course should be provided, that course should not be provided or to teach a course in a particular way.  This is about public policy and we are not interfering or intruding; we have every right to be in that space.  If somebody else wishes to be in that space he or she should run for the Oireachtas and get elected because we have a democratic mandate and I will not apologise for developing an education system where the HEA, which is not just a funding body, will bring forward guidelines to make sure our sector leads when it comes to environmental sustainability, gender equality and access and inclusion.</p> <p>In Senator Flynn&rsquo;s absence I want to say I am taken about the point she made on universal design.  We might need to explicitly state that in the legislation or we might be able to give an assurance around guidelines.  I would like to return to that on Committee Stage also.  I suggest that perhaps I can provide useful briefing and engagement on comply or explain guidelines and where we are.  I am sure we can tease that through a little bit more.</p> <p>I also want to mention the National College of Ireland, NCI, which Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned, and I welcome Dr. Deirdre Giblin to the House.  The answer to the Senator's question is that this legislation sets out a pathway for a designation.  The National College of Ireland is playing an incredible role in our higher education landscape and if "unique" is not the right word it is pretty close to it and it is playing a special and particular role.  We have had good meetings on this and this gives us an ability we do not really have at the moment in providing a pathway to designation.  I discussed this with NCI and while this is not explicitly designating NCI - and I went through the reasons with it - it is providing a pathway that has not existed to date for it and for others.</p> <p>We have had a good engagement.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile asked me if the number on the board is too rigid and that is a fair point.  The number is arbitrary and there are no two ways about it.  There is no reason 17 is better than 13, 15 or 19 but someone has to pick a number.  We started wanting 12, we went to 17 and we are now at 19 because of the increased student voice and the knock-on effect on external members.  The numbers 12, 17 and 19 have not shown huge rigidity.</p> <p>I will come back to Senator Gavan on the UL governing authority and I note the point and the importance of it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I agree with colleagues.  Education is a public good.  As Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, education as a public good lies at the core of the Bill.  That is why we are trying to pass what is a good Bill.  We are trying to pass a Bill that is flexible and future-proofed.  We are trying to provide a Bill that respects autonomy and academic freedom but also the role of the HEA, the Department and the Minister of the day and getting that balance right.  I have no doubt that this House will tease those matters out with us at whatever speed it wishes.  I look forward to that.</p></speech>

The amendment was previously proposed and rejected on Committee Stage as it would effectively allow a drafting inconsistency between section 34(12A), which would not reflect the amendments to section 34(12) of the principal Act.  Section 3(b), which the Senators propose to delete, is a technical drafting amendment to amend section 34(12A) of the principal Act.</p> <p>The amendments to section 3(b) reflect the related amendments at section 34(12), which in turn have been introduced by section 3(a) of the Bill.  As previously stated on Committee Stage in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, it is notable that Senator Higgins has not sought to amend the main amendments to section 34(12) introduced by section 3(a) of the Bill.  For information purposes, the purpose of the amendments to section 3(a) are technical drafting amendments, which have been reformed into sections 34(12)(a) and (b) of the principal Act on the basis that section 34(12)(a) already requires the planning authority to consider both whether a mandatory above-threshold EIA is required and to make a screening determination in the case of sub-threshold EIA development.</p> <p>Following this, section 34(12)(b), which prohibits planning authorities considering retention applications for developments that would have required a determination as to whether an EIA is required to be carried out, that is, where a sub-threshold EIA development is screened to require EIA, is being deleted as superfluous as screening for EIA is a prerequisite for section 34(12)(a) to apply.  Therefore, for the above reasons, I must reject the proposed Opposition amendment No. 1.</p></speech>

The condition our amendment would add is that the development on adjoining land must be for a purpose related to the original development.  This is to ensure that people can only apply for substitute consent on adjoining land where substitute consent has also been sought for similar development on the primary piece of land.  We do not want to see situations where completely unrelated developments are being pushed through the substitute consent process.</p> <p>Amendment No. 8 is similar to amendment No. 4 in that it seeks to add the condition that developments on adjoining land given permission under substitute consent must be related to the original development.  It deletes the wording in section 5 that it is not required to be the same as the primary development and changes it to a requirement that the development is related.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

In accordance with groupings of amendments proposed in the Seanad, I will address Opposition amendments Nos. 4 and 8 together, as they both seek to amend section 5 of the Planning and Development Act (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022 by requiring section 37L applications to have a related purpose to the substitute consent application development.</p> <p>Proposed amendment No. 4 concerns the insertion of "for a related purpose" after the word "land" in new paragraph (a) of section 37L(1), as inserted by paragraph (a) of section 5 of the Bill.</p> <p>Amendment No. 8 concerns the substitution of the phrase "must be related to" for "it is not required to be the same as" or "of the same description as" in the amendment to 37L(3), as inserted by section 5(c) of the Bill.  I cannot accept the Senator&rsquo;s proposed opposition to this section, which concerns simultaneous application for future development under section 37L of the principal Act.</p> <p>As previously set out in my response to Opposition amendments, this amendment to the principal Act widens the type of development availability for any future development consent assessed.  This means that the applicant is not restricted to application related only to the same type of development as a substitute consent application but can seek to change the use of the land to suit development needs.</p> <p>The proposed amendment to section 37L will also allow the potential for an integrated approach to assessment by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for such related development proposals on the same or adjoining sites, but it will also be of benefit for the understanding of the public, as assessments will be held at similar times and by the same authority rather than by separate authorities.</p> <p>In the very rare cases where substitute consent is sought, it is sought after a bona fide mistake by the developer has been realised, often following a court judgment that has revised the common legal understanding of whether a development or class of developments were a breach of the law whereby a developer thereafter seeks to formally correct the mistake and where the developer is also exposed to significant negative risk of mandatory enforcement and remediation of the site if substitute consent is refused.</p> <p>In this regard, it is important to note that it is material consideration for An Bord Plean&aacute;la in considering whether exceptional circumstances exist in the substitute consent proposal; whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised, as well as the additional material consideration of whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted or has previously carried out an unauthorised development.  In other words, the risk of exceptional circumstances not being deemed to exist and therefore being refused substitute consent is apparent if the applicant cannot adequately demonstrate his or her bona fides that he or she could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Any perceived benefit to future-facing applications of being able to apply directly to the board instead of having to apply separately to the relative planning authority first will be significantly outweighed by the inherent vulnerabilities and significant potential financial exposure if the related substitute consent application is refused.  In such cases, the relevant planning authority will be statutorily obliged to initiate enforcement proceedings against the unauthorised development to seek remediation of the site.  Furthermore, the future-facing planning application on the same or adjoining site may also be refused if, for example, it relies on any element of the refused substitute consent proposal.  In other words, the legislative proposal to allow parallel substitute consent and planning applications is not unnecessarily developer friendly in scope, noting the significant constraints and vulnerabilities for the developer attached to progressing a substitute consent proposal as well as the application's benefits to the public in allowing an holistic assessment of two related proposals on the same or adjoining sites.</p><p>Having regard to the above, the Government's proposed amendments to section 37L are considered to be reasonable.  As such, I must oppose amendments Nos. 4 and 8.</p></speech>

I oppose the amendments, which seek to apply a limit of &euro;5.48 million to the upper commercial value of any future-facing development of the land that is the subject of the application for substitute consent.  Such an imposition would unreasonably limit the type and extent of any future development permissible and runs contrary to the reasonable objective of section 5.  The Government's amendments to the Bill are intended in exceptional circumstances to bring developments that have been determined to be operating outside of environmental planning law back into the planning framework irrespective of the commercial value of the sites.  In the rare cases where substitute consent is sought, it arises after a bona fide mistake has been realised by the developer - this often follows a court judgment that has revised a common legal understanding of whether a development or class of developments was in breach of the law - and the developer seeks to correct the mistake formally, with the developer exposed to the significant negative risk of mandatory enforcement and remediation of the site if substitute consent is reduced.</p> <p>It is not the Bill's intention to preclude any site from being brought back into the planning system by way of substitute consent based on commercial or monetary value.  Therefore, I oppose the amendments.</p></speech>

In this regard, the proposed amendment is superfluous as section 177K, which is the successor to section 177D(2), already requires that in considering whether exceptional circumstances exist the board shall have regard to specified matters including, in section 177K(1J)(a), whether regularisation of the development concerned would circumvent the purpose and objectives of the environmental impact assessment directive or the habitats directive.</p> <p>Other criteria in section 177K(1J), which have been carried over verbatim from section 177D(2), which is to be repealed, include: that the board shall have regard to whether the applicant had or could reasonably have had a belief that the development was not unauthorised; whether the ability to carry out an assessment of the environmental impacts of the development for the purpose of an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment and to provide for public participation in such an assessment has been substantially impaired; the actual or likely significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site resulting from the carrying out or continuation of the development; the extent to which significant effects on the environment or adverse effects on the integrity of a European site can be remediated; and whether the applicant has complied with previous planning permissions granted or has previously carried out an unauthorised development.</p> <p>As the Senators will be aware, these criteria were developed on the basis of legal advice from the Office of Attorney General, following consultation with the European Commission in 2010 and following the European Court of Justice, ECJ, Derrybrien case relating to the scope and interpretation of the environmental impact assessment directive.</p> <p>Having received significant legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in drafting this Bill, I am satisfied that the criteria in section 177K(1J) meet the requirements of the ECJ Derrybrien judgment as well as other ECJ and Irish national court judgments since then, including the Supreme Court judgment of July 2020 on quarries and substitute consent, which it should be recalled was the genesis for the initial amendment of the present substitute consent provisions in December 2020, by way of the Planning and Development, and Residential Tenancies, Act 2020, which introduced the consideration of the exceptional criteria in the main substitute consent stage.

It marks another point where we are disempowering our local authorities and removing local community representatives from the planning process.

I cannot accept the proposed amendment, as one of the key objectives of the Bill is that the current two-stage substitute consent process - which includes various alternate initial steps prior to applying for substitute consent, such as that contained in section 177B - is to be replaced with a single-stage substitute consent application process that is fully in compliance with the environmental impact assessment directive and related ECJ judgments, such as the Derrybrien judgment and the recent Supreme Court judgment on quarries and substitute consent.</p> <p>For information, section 177B of the Act provides that where a planning authority becomes aware of a development granted permission for which a screening, environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment was or is required, and in respect of which a final judgment of an Irish court or the ECJ has been made that the permission was in breach of law, the planning authority must direct the person to apply to the board for substitute consent.  The requirement to obtain leave from the board under sections 177C and 177D or a direction from a planning authority under section 177B to apply for substitute consent is being repealed, in which case a person can apply for substitute consent directly to the board.</p> <p>I note that it is presently the case that if a person requested to submit a substitute consent application under section 177B refuses to do so, it will become a planning enforcement matter for the relevant planning authority, pursuant to sections 177O(3) and (4) of the principal Act.  The deletion of section 177B does not change the fact that if a developer is operating an unauthorised development which should have been subject to environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment but which was not, the development can still be subject to planning enforcement by the relevant planning authority in the normal way, in accordance with the provisions of section 154 of the principal Act.  In this regard, there is no diminution of the planning authority&rsquo;s ability to initiate planning enforcement against unauthorised development.  It is for this reason that I must oppose amendment No.13.</p></speech>
