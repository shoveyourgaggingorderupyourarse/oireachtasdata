As always he is prompt and I appreciate his presence in the Chamber.</p> <p>There have been a number of plans and proposals for a high-speed rail service between Dublin and Belfast on both sides of the Border.  The objective is that the journey time between Dublin and Belfast would be reduced to 90 minutes.  The direct train between Belfast Central Station and Connolly Station in Dublin takes more than two hours at present.  One of the proposals is that the Northern Ireland transport company, Translink, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would work to provide a non-stop, 90-minute service, departing at hourly intervals.  The Project Ireland 2040 plan also commits to a feasibility study for a high-speed rail link between the two largest cities on the island.</p> <p>Mr. Keith Moffat, the former chief executive of Translink, has said that the cost of such a service involving 125 mph trains and an upgrade of the track would be in the region of &euro;733 million.  A proposal for this cross-Border service was contained in one report confirming that a high-speed, high-frequency service could be economically viable.  There is some momentum behind this.  Five local authorities - Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, Louth County Council, Newry, Mourne and Down District Council and Belfast City Council - also commissioned their own report.  That report states that the improved rail connectivity offers the opportunity to tackle some of the challenges facing the island of Ireland in the future, which include the impact of Brexit and attracting foreign direct investment.  The report notes that the current service between Dublin and Belfast is slow and infrequent.  It outlines that there are currently eight trains a day in each direction, taking two hours and 15 minutes to make the 100 mile journey.  The report notes that by international standards that this is slow for a railway connecting two major cities and its vision is for a 60-minute journey time to bring the service to a level on a par with the train service between Frankfurt and Cologne, a service on which I have travelled many times.  </p> <p>The local authority also examined other case studies such as the high-speed rail service between Lisbon and Porto in Portugal and the service between Amsterdam and Rotterdam in Holland.  If we want an agreed Ireland, by having a high-speed rail network between the two largest cities in this country, we would send a signal that we have an objective in connecting the two main cities on this island.</p></speech>

I am glad to have the opportunity to address this issue in the House.  The Minister for Tourism, Transport and Sport, Deputy Ross has asked me to convey his apologies as unfortunately he could not be in the Chamber this morning.</p> <p>The Senator rightly highlighted the importance of the Dublin-Belfast corridor.  It does not just connect the two largest cities on the island but it also has a broader all-island context through strengthening linkages between Belfast, Dublin and Cork.  Those linkages are well served by high-quality road and rail links and can play a critical role in supporting economic growth and competitiveness.  I am glad that Project Ireland 2040 recognises its importance and sets out a number of proposals on how we can build on the corridor's existing strengths and promote its economic potential further.  These proposals are a mixture of short, medium and longer-term measures but, collectively, they have the potential to improve the passenger experience for all those who use rail along the corridor.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Brendan Griffin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2333"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->First and foremost, Project Ireland 2040 states that the priority funding objective in respect of the mainline rail network is appropriate maintenance and renewal of the existing network.  While this funding objective might not strike people as particularly exciting, I assure the House that it is critical to improving passengers' journey experience in the short to medium term.  The increased levels of funding that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has secured mean we are now in a position to fund the rail network to a steady-state level and provide a degree of certainty in respect of that funding for the next five years.  This is a significant and recurring contribution from the taxpayer of &euro;200 million every year over the next five years and is a significant improvement on recent years.  This increased funding will allow for increased ballast cleaning, more rail milling and greater levels of track renewal on the Dublin-Belfast line.  It is these sorts of initiatives which can result in a smoother journey for the passenger, with improved journey times to boot.</p><p>We are also providing funding towards the development of a new national train control centre, which will allow for the better management of the entire network, including the Dublin-Belfast line.  Construction on this project is expected to start later this year.  Our colleagues in the North are currently working on a package of track improvements around the Lurgan area which will benefit the Dublin-Belfast main line and are expected to be completed later this year.  This type of track renewal and investment on both sides of the Border will potentially allow for improved speeds on those sections of the track where they are not currently possible.  However, in the longer term, Project Ireland 2040 commits towards an evaluation of high-speed rail, as raised by Senator Feighan, between Dublin and Belfast, Dublin and Limerick Junction and Dublin and Cork.  This study will evaluate the economic benefits and value for money of high-speed rail against improvements to existing and planned line speeds along the lines.  It can be confirmed to Senator Feighan that it is planned to commence this study during 2020.</p><p>As the Senator can see, a number of measures are under way and planned which are designed to further improve the rail network between Dublin and Belfast.  The Minister is confident that these measures will improve and enhance services over the short, medium and longer term and further strengthen links between North and South.</p></speech>

I look forward to seeing the 2020 study being expedited as quickly as possible.  As I said, however, I was in China nine months ago, and from Shanghai one can travel the same distance as that from Dublin to Belfast in 20 minutes.  If we are serious about an agreed Ireland and about transport links on this island, we must start with the cross-Border Dublin-Belfast line.  I look forward to the report being implemented.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-28a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032800002#B00400"><p>I thank my county colleague for coming before the House to take this matter on behalf of the Minister.  I raised it over six months ago and I raise it again today.  Two weeks ago, I tabled the matter for a Commencement debate and then received a reply by email from the Minister.  He was only able to come in on that occasion.  In the reply  to which I refer, he explained why it is not possible for his Department to share on driver licences held by people in this country information to the effect that they want to be organ donors.  A person is asked this question as part of the application process, and the response is printed on the licence in the form of a code, 115, which indicates that the person wants to be an organ donor.  The Minister stated that under EU rules on data protection, we would need the permission of applicants to share their data.  He also indicated that the difficulty was that people had not been asked if they were willing to have this data shared with a third party such as the HSE and that it would not be possible to share it without their consent.  He was obviously unaware that he had already allowed his Department to share data from the driver licence registry with private companies such as eFlow and people who clamp vehicles.  The Department had also shared the data with the Garda and the Courts Service, as it should have done.  However, he stated at the time that data protection rules would not allow him to share the data with the HSE.  That was not true.  I have with me a copy of the statutory instrument that would allow him to share the data with the HSE.  He has signed similar instruments for all the other bodies, including the courts, clamping companies and private operators such as eFlow to which I referred.</p> <p>We have discovered from the Irish Kidney Association that sharing these data with healthcare professionals is important because of their ability to share the data with the families of loved ones who are potential donors.  Only approximately 300 families find themselves in this situation in any given year.  If specialist nurses are not involved in talking to families, only 22% will offer their loved ones' organs to be donated.  If, however, a specialist nurse who is a transplant co-ordinator asks a family, the figure increases to 52%.  Furthermore, if the family is informed, and it is shown, that their loved one wanted to be an organ donor, this increases to 92%.  We would therefore go from about 50-50 to 92% if the Minister would only sign the statutory instrument to allow the HSE access to this information.  Since we have highlighted this issue in the media, the change in the Minister's response has been interesting.  At first he stated that because of European rules, he cannot share the data.  Then it was pointed out that actually he had shared the data already.  He has now come back with a new reply stating it is up to the Department of Health to ask for the data.</p> <p>Our request, and I hope the Cathaoirleach will allow it, is that during Organ Donor Awareness Week, which is next week, the Minister for Health come in and indicate why he has not requested the information from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Perhaps the Minister of State might use his good offices to ask that this simple process whereby the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would share the data and the Department of Health would ask for the data be followed in order that when families are faced with the traumatic situation whereby they lose a loved one, they would have the information at hand to the effect that their loved one wanted to be an organ donor.  The number of people who have indicated on their driver licences that they want to be organ donors is reaching 1 million.  This information is available to everyone else - clampers, the courts and the Garda - but it is not available to the families of the loved ones facing a decision that is traumatic and extreme but that can transform and save the lives of many people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-28a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1318" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032800002#B00500"><p>I thank Senator Mark Daly for raising this matter.  In fairness, he has been pressing the issue of organ donation for a number of years and has been very passionate about it.  I commend him on his work in respect of the matter.  As we know, organ donation saves many lives and is critically important.  Again, I convey the apologies of the Minister who cannot be here.</p> <p>As the Senator stated, in replies given to him last May, the issue of the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and data protection in general were raised as being an impediment to progress being seen on this matter.  One of the issues about which the Minister is concerned is that we need to be very careful about this.  One of the suggestions is that it may be possible to add a question to the application form asking whether people consent to the sharing of the information.  As a licence is valid for ten years, it would then take a decade to work through the system to cover everyone in this regard.  As for the HSE and the Department of Health, there is a significant body of work to be done before it can be established whether the statutory instrument to which the Senator referred could be effective.  If it is intended that the HSE could look up lists of potential organ donors, for example, where a patient died and the HSE wanted to know quickly if the patient had signed up to be a donor, there could well be benefits.  However, the Minister still needs to hear the HSE's views on this, as well as those of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, before he can take action.  There are at present many pressing issues within the Department, particularly in the context of Brexit.  As acknowledged since last May, this matter has not received the priority or attention it needs in view of the other constraints currently affecting the Department.  However, I will go back to the Minister on the specific question of the statutory instrument to which the Senator referred - perhaps he could give me a copy of it - and ask him to look particularly at the legal issues surrounding it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Brendan Griffin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2333"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2333&amp;amp;pid=BrendanGriffinFG&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If it is the case that a simple statutory instrument, if signed, would address this issue, that would be a major step forward.  I will commit to see if we can make progress on it.  None of us knows who will be affected by this or whose life could be saved in the short term as a result.  This is deserving of further scrutiny and attention, and if a quick solution can be found here, that would be major progress.</p></speech>

I am aware Brexit is a headache for the Government, for Westminster and for much of Europe, and it is an important issue of State, but comparing this matter, which is one of life and death, to Brexit is a difficult one to swallow having regard to the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-28a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032800002#C00300"><p>I am glad the Minister of State did not read out the full reply, which, I know, was not written by him.  It is ridiculous to say that under current EU rules on data protection we need the permission of the applicant to share the data because the Minister has already shared the data with eFlow, the courts and the Garda.  The Minister can do it, and has done it.</p> <p>I refer to the Minister giving the reply he gave two weeks ago.  It is different from the reply he gave last Friday, 22 March in which he stated he had not been asked for it, which I accept.  We are making progress.  The Minister is still unaware he is sharing the data already.  It is unfortunate that the Minister is unaware that he has signed the statutory instrument for private companies to have access to that data.</p> <p>People indicate they want to be organ donors because they want others to know.  They do not want it to be a secret.  That is why it is there to be shared.</p> <p>The issue for next week - hopefully, the Cathaoirleach will allow the debate - is for the Minister for Health to come in and ask why we have not asked for the data.  In essence, the Minister is acknowledging that he will share the data if he is requested to do so by the Department of Health.  It is obviously of concern to the Minister that what the Department of Health does with it is appropriate.  He outlined that it would be the national transplant unit of the HSE, if it makes a formal application, and how that information would be used and how it would be accessed by healthcare professionals.</p> <p>To use data protection as an excuse when the Minister has already shared this data from the driver licence with others is not an acceptable answer as to why there is inaction.  People die on our transplant waiting list because there are not enough organs.  It is a systems failure.  Countries such as Croatia and Spain have surplus organs because they have better systems.  This will help.  If it saves one life, it is worth doing.</p></speech>

I was listening to a similar debate with Deputy Mattie McGrath in the other House recently.  Without pre-empting the debate, I ask Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill to outline his case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-28a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1382" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032800002#C01200"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting the matter for discussion.</p> <p>This is an issue which relates to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and a decision taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, which would remove the Cahir local electoral area from the Clonmel Borough District following the local elections in May.</p> <p>Since the amalgamation of Tipperary County Council in 2014, Clonmel and Cahir were joined together as one district.  The subsequent review of boundaries by the independent boundary commission recommended that the borough be split into two wards: the Cahir electoral area, with four councillors; and Clonmel, with six elected representatives.  However, the borough continues to meet as one unit in accordance with the submission made by the local authority at the time.</p> <p>Notwithstanding this, it is my understanding from local authority councillors that prior to Christmas the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, signed a ministerial order removing Cahir local electoral area from the Clonmel borough.  Instead, the Cahir local electoral area, LEA, is being joined with the Cashel Tipperary Municipal District.  Local councillors have submitted a notice of motion to the March meeting of Tipperary County Council expressing their dismay and concern at this decision.  The motion called on the local authority to insist that the Minister review the decision, for the Department to liaise with the local authority CEO and local authority officials to best address the concerns of the current elected members of the borough district regarding the geographical size of the proposed new super district of Tipperary-Cashel-Cahir.</p> <p>The logistics of removing Cashel LEA, in terms of staffing and funding, and the negative effects this would have on members of the public seeking services and assistance have been highlighted by local councillors.  This is clearly in stark contradiction to the recommendations made by the boundary commission.  It appears that it is a solo run being taken by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>The motion, which was unanimously passed by the councillors in Tipperary, was jointly signed by the former mayors, Councillors Andy Moloney, Pat English and Martin Lonergan, and the current mayor, Councillor Richie Molloy.  This motion was submitted due to their deeply held and serious concerns around this issue.</p> <p>There has been a linkage between Clonmel and Cahir going back 204 years to the time when Charles Bianconi established a transport connection between Clonmel and Cahir.  This link is being severed now by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and that is regrettable.  It goes against the wishes of the local people and the local elected councillors.  Therefore, it is not the democratic wish of the local communities in Tipperary.  The matter has been raised in the D&aacute;il by my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath.</p> <p>What the councillors seek here is a simple rational intervention by the Minister, namely, to proceed with the recommendation of the independent boundary commission that both would remain as one entity with separate wards or, alternatively, put the decision on hold pending a review and consultations with all key stakeholders and re-engagement with the boundary commission.  That is a reasonable request.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is not at that Department, and he probably will be coming here with the civil servants' response to the issue.</p> <p>This decision goes against local democracy.  It is a ministerial interference at a local level which is not being welcomed by councillors, on a cross-party basis, from Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Independents.  No one welcomes.  The Minister should put this on hold pending further consultations.</p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me the opportunity to elaborate on the matter.</p></speech>

Local authority members and the Association of Irish Local Government had raised concerns regarding a number of issues in respect of LEAs.  A concern was raised about the need to ensure large urban centres wore adequately represented.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, established two independent local electoral area boundary committees, No. 1 and No. 2, in December 2017 to review and make recommendations on local electoral areas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In response to the concerns raised, the committees were specifically asked to have regard to, among other things, the need to ensure adequate representation for large urban centres.  The committees were not specifically tasked with defining municipal districts, MDs, save where it was considered necessary, as it was intended that MDs would largely remain unchanged.  The recommendations made by each committee in their respective reports in respect of local electoral areas were accepted in full and were reflected in the statutory instruments signed on 19 December last.  The overall policy objectives, particularly regarding large urban electoral areas with populations in excess of 15,000, have been largely met.</p><p>In considering how best to configure the MDs in Tipperary, and to ensure Clonmel is adequately represented, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, varied the recommendation to designate a distinct MD entitled "Borough District of Clonmel".  Clonmel is the largest town in Tipperary.  It is a former borough town with a population of more than 17,000 people.  The LEAs of Cahir and Cashel-Tipperary were aligned in a single MD.  The MDs designated in Tipperary largely deliver the key requirements of good local government.  The interaction the Minister of State has had with local councillors has been positive on this front.  He has engaged with both the elected members and the executive of Tipperary County Council and visited Clonmel and Tipperary town recently to discuss the MDs with local members.</p><p>The boundary committees, having fulfilled their remit and presented reports of recommendations, now stand dissolved and, therefore, no longer exist.  As a result of his engagement with elected representatives, the Minister of State is considering a proposal to change the name of the Cahir-Cashel Municipal District to the Tipperary-Cahir-Cashel Municipal District.  Municipal districts have been largely welcomed by councillors and representative groups.  They have been effective since the 2014 elections.  With changes to the LEAs, to ensure the areas covered are not too big and large urban areas are well represented, they will be even better following the next local elections.  In that context, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is currently examining ways to increase the autonomy of MDs and the number and extent of functions carried out at district level.</p></speech>

It would appear the Minister of State has made his decision.  This will have drastic consequences for the town of Clonmel.  Councillors in the Clonmel borough area have told me this will reduce the funding available to the local government unit there.  As Clonmel has a population of 17,000, there will be a big impact not just on Tipperary but also on the wider region.  This is a retrograde step.  I appeal again to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, although I know this is not his brief, to use his good offices to try to influence the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to cease from pursuing this decision.</p> <p>I also ask that he engage in further consultations and put off the implementation of this decision until those consultations have concluded.  I know he was in Tipperary recently and met elected members and staff.  Following that, however, the council passed a motion at its monthly meeting.  That was because it did not accept what the Minister of State was stating.  He was informing the councillors and not consulting them, as was outlined in the response.  I ask the Minister of State to have another look at this issue.</p></speech>

I will convey his points to the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan.  As the Senator stated, the Minister of State visited Clonmel but circumstances have changed.  There was a discussion locally afterwards and a motion was passed by the democratically-elected members of the council.  As a former city councillor myself, I think those voices should be listened to.  I will bring these concerns back to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur raibh an Aire-St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach seo.  I thank the Minister of State for taking time out of his schedule to be here.  As he knows, the Border, midlands and western, BMW, region has now moved back from what is called a developed region to a region in transition.  This reflects the two-tier economy on the island of Ireland.  Dublin, the east and Munster are growing while the west and the north flatten.  I will be interested to hear what plans the Government has to address this.  After 2020, the BMW region will be recategorised as a region in transition while the southern and eastern part of the country will continue to be described as developed.</p> <p>EUROSTAT has confirmed that funding to this country will continue under three categories of region in the post-2020 period.  These are less developed, transition and more developed.  That certainly is good news.  The European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, has been delivering on providing funding to the regions in Ireland since as far back as 1999.  It was also important that there was regional representation at both national and EU level.</p> <p>However, the regions have taken a backward step over the past number of years.  That is proved by this recategorisation backwards from what is called a developed region to a region in transition.  The EU has stated and confirmed what we have been saying in this part of the world for a long time.  The BMW region has been left behind in recent years.  It is no surprise to anybody living there.  People living in the Border region are at a greater risk of poverty compared with the rest of the country.  A recent report from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, showed that 25.7% of the residents in counties Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal and Leitrim struggled financially in 2017.  The report also outlined that several counties within the Border region suffer compared with other parts of the country regarding access to broadband, transport, disposable income and housing vacancies.  </p> <p>The good news, however, is that the EU has recognised this.  Our recategorisation means there is an opportunity for increased funding from the EU to address this underinvestment in the region.  This is a serious opportunity for us to address that underinvestment and I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's plans to address that particular issue.  There is also an opportunity for the regional assembly to address the legacy of underinvestment and increased EU Exchequer funding post-2020.  It is vitally important that the regions take, and continue to have, control over the allocation of funds to their regions.  </p> <p>Brexit is staring us in the face.  People wonder why the British community decided to make the decision it did.  I suppose some people may feel disconnected and distant from Europe.  It is important that the EU has a connection with people on the ground, so that no matter what part of the world or this country they live in, it is possible to see a tangible connection with the EU.  From that point of view, I understand the Minister of State's Department is conducting a review of the delivery of European investment funds to the regions with a view to, perhaps, removing responsibility from the regional assemblies to a centralised system.  That would be a serious backward step.  I hope he will confirm that will not be the case.</p></speech>

I am taking this Commencement matter on his behalf.  The BMW region is one of Ireland&rsquo;s two regions for the purposes of EU funding.  During the 2014-2020 period, the ERDF alone will deliver more than &euro;320 million worth of investment to the region.  This investment is concentrated primarily on research and innovation, information and communication technologies, ICT, small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and promoting a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>These are the types of investments that can make a difference to inclusive growth and regional development.  The region also receives support through a range of other EU programmes including the European Social Fund, ESF, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD, and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Patrick O'Donovan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2316"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2316&amp;amp;pid=PatrickODonovan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with the Senator on the importance of achieving balanced regional development and I note the recent data released by EUROSTAT regarding levels of GDP per head for the regions of Ireland.  The development of all of the regions of the country is something that this Government takes very seriously.  In 2018 the Government launched Project Ireland 2040, an ambitious, strategic vision for Ireland&rsquo;s investment in critical infrastructure in the future.  It consists of two core elements: a national planning framework and the investment of &euro;116 billion over a ten-year period.  For each regional assembly area, regional, spatial and economic strategies are being developed to support the implementation of the national planning framework and the economic policies and objectives of the Government by providing a long-term strategic planning and economic framework for the development of the regions.  The national development plan envisages investment across a range of areas aimed at delivering public infrastructure over the coming years including increased investment in broadband, roads, tourism and agriculture and an investment of &euro;4.5 billion in our regional and local roads.</p><p>The year 2018 saw the launch of the rural regeneration and development fund.  With a total budget of &euro;1 billion over the period to 2027, the fund will promote rural renewal in order to enable towns, villages and outlying rural areas to grow sustainably as vibrant places in which to live and work.  The first call for proposals under the fund was launched in July 2018.  Some 84 projects have been announced with a total value of &euro;117 million.  The newly-established Department of Rural and Community Development has made considerable progress with &euro;237 million invested across a package of supports to strengthen our rural economies and communities.  By promoting development in all regions we can bring new life back into towns and villages which were previously neglected.</p><p>Given the potential impact on rural and Border areas of this country arising from the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, a Brexit resilience package of &euro;78 million was announced for the agrifood sector for 2019 in the last budget.  This includes a range of measures to support farmers and industry against the background of the challenges that lie ahead.  I also acknowledge the special role of the PEACE and INTERREG programmes in the Border region.  Ireland and the United Kingdom are currently partners in two EU-funded cross-Border co-operation programmes which incorporate the Border counties with a total value of &euro;550 million over the period up to 2020.</p><p>In conclusion, the Government is extremely committed to balanced, sustainable development in all regions, including the Border, midland and western region.  This is demonstrated by investment in sectoral strategies.  It is underpinned by the national development plan which will deliver modern public infrastructure over the coming years which, it is to be hoped, will improve the lives of people throughout the country and allow our companies and economy to continue to thrive in a globalised world.  I will bring the points the Senator has raised to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this is not a matter for his Department, but the increased EU funding of 55% for any particular project is a serious opportunity for Government to invest in the region.  I ask the Minister of State to stress to his colleague that it is vitally important that the regions should be responsible for the allocation of that funding and that the system should not be centralised.  Perhaps the Minister of State could get a response to that question for me.  I thank him for his time here this morning.</p></speech>

With regard to the areas to which the Senator has primarily referred in respect of economic development, it is important to point out that unemployment in all of the regions, particularly in those outside Dublin, has fallen.  That needs to be recognised.  Every labour exchange, as we previously called them, across the regions has noted a huge drop in unemployment from the high point in 2012 and 2013 to where we are now.</p> <p>There is a role for local authorities with regard to some of the investment that is available to access.  We all need to examine our individual local authorities and their county managers to see whether they are putting projects forward for the various funding streams.  In the last round there were massive disparities in respect of the projects allocated funding.  It really calls into question what our local authorities are putting forward.  The money is there and the schemes are there.  I am a former local authority member, as are some Members of the House.  We need to scrutinise what our local authorities are putting forward.  </p> <p>A number of different Departments have a role in the matter to which the Senator is referring.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is very important as the keeper of the purse, but others are involved in respect of the regional strategies that have been outlined, for example the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  With regard to the economic throughput, the Ministers, Deputies Ring and Humphreys, are also involved.  This has been taken as a whole-of-Government issue and it is being taken very seriously.  A more co-ordinated investment by Government is already being seen in all of the regions in parallel with the drop in unemployment across the country but there is always more that needs to be done.  We are very cognisant of that.  That is why we are going to continue on the path we are on.</p></speech>

He has been courteous to all of us in our time here.  We wish him a long and happy retirement.  He is retiring to Kerry, which is always a great idea.  When he gets there, I will be sure to show him the bakery run by the three Moriarty brothers which shut down after 49 years of business.  When they retired, they wrote a lovely thank-you note on the window of the bakery in beautiful script and gave a piece of advice to others who seek to retire.  The note in question stated that the brothers would have to learn how to spend time without spending money.  I hope Donal Hickey masters that art as well.</p> <p>Under this Government, we have reached the tragic landmark of 10,000 people being homeless .  I note the continuous activity masquerading as action on the part of the Minister with responsibility for homelessness.  I would call him the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government if he was providing any, but we will just have to call it as it is.  On his watch, homelessness has become an acceptable face of Government policy.  We will be looking for another debate on this issue.  It goes with other promises like Fine Gael's pledge to end the trolley crisis.  We need to hear what the Minister has to say for himself about this issue.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, Fianna F&aacute;il will propose an amendment to the Order of Business in respect of the issue of corporate manslaughter.  The relevant legislation was first proposed by the Law Reform Commission in 2005 as a result of the hepatitis C scandal in which blood products which were contaminated with hepatitis C were knowingly distributed to women.  Thousands of women were infected and hundreds died as a result, yet no one went to prison.  The man who knew the blood products were contaminated did nothing about it.  I raise this issue again because we have brought our Bill forward again.  The officials in the Department of Justice and Equality have refused to meet me, despite the Minister's pledges that they would do so.  They have concerns about the Bill.  The part they are concerned about is that under which people would actually go to prison as a result of corporate manslaughter.  In the North, there were arrests over incidents at a nightclub.  We have seen court action resulting from the Hillsborough tragedy in which nearly 100 Liverpool fans died as a result of corporate neglect on the part of the police.  The person in charge is facing prosecution and possible conviction.  If the hepatitis C scandal happened again, nobody would go to prison because the Government has refused to allow the legislation to move forward.  I wish to ask the Leader why that is the case.  I suspect it is because many senior officials in a lot of Departments are afraid that at some stage they might face prosecution under the legislation as a result of their inaction.</p></speech>

He is extremely courteous and professional and has always been pleasant to me throughout my long years of service.  He will be missed in this House.  Senator Mark Daly notes that he is returning to his native Kerry.  If one cannot retire in beautiful west Cork, Kerry is the next best place to go, so I will forgive him for that.  I am sure he will be at Croke Park next Sunday, shouting for his native county.  I call on Senator Craughwell.  I almost addressed him as an officer.</p></speech>

It would be nice indeed to be promoted to the commissioned ranks.  Sadly, that was not an option during my time.  It is interesting that the Cathaoirleach mentions them.  We frequently discuss issues relating to the Defence Forces in this room.  Some work has been done with respect to the retention of commissioned officers.  It is not really working, but some effort is being made in that area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have been contacted recently by a number of non-commissioned officers, including sergeants, quartermaster sergeants, company sergeants, sergeants major and a barrack quartermaster sergeant.  They are all highly experienced and approaching retirement age.  Sergeants are retiring at 50 years, some with 20 years' service, and have vast experience that is available to the State.  Could the Deputy Leader examine the strategy in place on retention?  Is there a strategy on retaining non-commissioned officers, from the rank of corporal upwards, who have vast experience and do not want to retire early or at a young age?  Is there a policy in place?  I cannot find one.  If there is none, could we have one put in place?</p><p>The Deputy Leader will know I have been supportive of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, throughout the homelessness crisis.  The figures today are quite shocking.  I am sure they are attributable, to a large degree or at least in some cases, to Airbnb.  My colleague, Senator Kevin Humphreys, has constantly referred to the Airbnb scandal, which is leaving families homeless while landlords are making a killing.  I will let the Senator speak for himself on this in a few minutes.  He has been the champion in the House in this area and has brought much pressure to bear right across the Oireachtas on the short-term profiteering that is taking place.</p><p>We are told there is a shortage of building capacity in the country.  I sit on the Luas in the morning on my way in and count the number of cranes.  We are building offices at a phenomenal rate.  If one goes to Sandyford today, one will see hoardings all over the place showing offices with 220,000 sq. ft here or 230,000 sq. ft there.  If we are able to build offices, for God's sake why are we not able to build homes?  Why are we not able to put people into homes?  Are there empty office blocks, particularly around the city of Dublin, that could be converted into homes?  There is no point in having offices for businesses setting up in this country if there is nowhere for their staff to live, or if the enormous multinationals are renting properties at inflated prices in order to accommodate their staff.  It is acceptable in the short term but it will be detrimental to the country in the longer term.  Therefore, I ask that the Minister be invited to the House at the earliest possible date to have a discussion on the difference between commercial housing and non-commercial housing.  I still support what the Minister is trying to do through Rebuilding Ireland but it is becoming increasingly difficult.</p></speech>

The teachers include Ms Simmons, Ms King, Mr. Walsh and Ms Shannon.  I welcome, in particular, Senator Wilson's twin daughters, Niamh and Maeve.  Many of the children have a big occasion on Saturday week.  I wish them every success.  I hope they have a lovely day in Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann.  Sometimes we have a falling out with Senator Wilson but the visitors, particularly Niamh and Maeve, can be very proud of their local Senator.  He is a long-standing and well-respected Member of this House.</p></speech>

There was a group in earlier also.  I hear some of them will be budding politicians.  Niamh and Maeve might be Diarmuid's daughters but I hope they do not take any notice of Daddy and join the right party.</p><p>I wish to say farewell to Donal Hickey and thank him for his exceptional work.  I wish him well in the future.  I apologise in advance as Kerry will be beaten on Sunday by Mayo.  I am sure he will get over that.</p><p>I commend the report issued this morning by the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, which is chaired by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.  I ask the Deputy Leader for a debate on the report's recommendations and outputs.  It would be very interesting.  I will not get into the details of the report; suffice it to say that some of the content is very good and some of it needs to be expanded in respect of rural crime.  I would appreciate it if the debate could be facilitated as soon as possible.</p><p>This morning, it was reported that only 7% of women who had repeat smear tests for cervical cancer have received their results.  That leaves around 2,370 women still waiting on repeat test results, despite being promised priority testing and results within four to six weeks.  IT problems in the laboratory company, Quest Diagnostics, and the unexpected high volume of samples have all been mentioned as reasons for the delay.  That is absolutely unacceptable.  It shows the system is not working and is broken.  I call on the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to rectify this immediately.  If it were not bad enough that these women have had to go through the harrowing process of getting tested again, they are now forced to wait for unacceptably long periods to find out the results.  We recently had statements in the House on this issue and all sides agreed that the highest priority was to ensure those who still needed screening completed would be a priority.  Screening works and saves lives, as we know, but the Minister must ensure that such a vital service is properly resourced and fit for purpose.  Yesterday's figures show the system is still chaotic.</p><p>Yesterday, we saw that the number of people homeless in the State reached over 10,000.  Other figures suggest the number is much greater.  Three thousand seven hundred and eighty-four children have no home to go to tonight.  We have become immune to increasing numbers of people with no place to call home.</p><p>I want to nip something in the bud.  Homelessness is not an ideological battle with Sinn F&eacute;in on one side and the Government on the other.  On RT&Eacute; radio last night, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, had to remind the programme's host that when it comes to homelessness, there are no sides.  We want to offer solutions in opposition and are more than happy for Fine Gael, backed by Fianna F&aacute;il, to implement them.  We have a Bill that would make it illegal for a landlord who benefited from a buy-to-let tax break to evict tenants and families in order to sell the property.  The landlord would have to sell it with the tenants <i>in situ</i>.  Eviction is the main cause of family homelessness.  The legislative proposals should be made law urgently but on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, showed that he simply does not get it.  He said Rebuilding Ireland is working, even if the homelessness figure continues to increase.  That is completely contradictory.  He refused to answer directly the question on how many homes Dublin City Council built last year.  He also could not give a timeline for ending child homelessness.  The message from the Government is that the policy response is working, and this is all happening because Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and his party, Fianna F&aacute;il, are facilitating budgets and refusing to express no confidence in the Minister.  It is time that action was taken.</p></speech>

Addressing this issue will not solve the housing crisis but at least if the proposal is implemented, it will result in approximately 5,000 new homes in the Dublin area.  This is much more than what the Minister has achieved in his term of office.</p> <p>There is genuine concern about evidence-based policy on housing across the country.  Senator Craughwell was correct to comment on the number of cranes on the skyline.  Most of the developments in question have traffic management plans.  One has to submit a traffic management plan for a major development but an accommodation plan is not needed.  The Taoiseach's Department is heading up a project for an innovation centre in the south inner city that will employ approximately 10,000 people.  Of those, 7,000, will come from abroad and will need accommodation.  Is there an accommodation plan?  No, there is not.</p> <p>The Minister stated this morning the issue is one of supply.  I fully agree with him but the problem is that his policies are worsening the supply problem because he calls for review after review.  There is a review of apartment sizes, a review of car parking spaces, and a review of the height strategy.  Let us examine what these reviews have meant.  They have meant withdrawals of planning applications from An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the city council to increase the numbers of units on sites and produce new applications.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That was fine.  The target is to increase the density, but then he changed the height strategy and we had a further withdrawal of planning applications and no build starts.  We then had a review whereby planning applications could be made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la if they were for more than 100 units.  We had another withdrawal of planning applications but the outcome was that nothing was built.<br/><br/>An example of that is the strategic development zones, SDZs, three of which are in the Dublin area.  Pressure was put on Dublin City Council and the Department, which was well covered by <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, by a certain developer and now we have an announcement of a review of the North Lotts strategic development zone.  We have sterilised the planning applications for accommodation there because they will wait for the review in respect of the height.  We could probably survive one strategic development zone review but we may be led now into reviews of three strategic development zones, which is the North Lotts, the South Lotts and Poolbeg West.  Poolbeg West could probably provide 3,500 homes.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has not made a decision yet on whether it will give it the go-ahead but I bet the Minister &euro;1 to &euro;100 that when that decision is made it will seek another review because of the Department's change to the height guidelines.  The end result of all of that is that nothing has been built.  It is review after review.  That is not good policy. <br/><br/>I want to be associated with the remarks about Donal Hickey.  I will conclude on this point.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, announced the MetroLink but there is a marked difference in the way various groups were dealt with regarding the review of the NTA's proposal on MetroLink.  That is down to political pressure.  I hate to say it but I believe that because residents in the south inner city are probably socially disadvantaged, they did not have a proper input into the alignment of MetroLink.  I fully accept that we need a station in the city centre.  Proposals were put forward on that and I believe they were ignored because members from the south inner city did not have the same access to senior Ministers and the Taoiseach.  It is the case that because of their social and economic backgrounds they have been very much ignored in the entire process.</p></speech>

John Browne was nominated to this Seanad in 1983 and was a Deputy from 1989 to 2002.  Any time I met him I found him to be a very decent man who imparted of his knowledge.  His son Fergal was a colleague of mine in the Seanad from 2002 to 2007.  Our sympathy and condolences go to his wife, Nancy, his daughters Carmel, Deirdre and Geraldine, and his son Fergal.</p> <p>We saw in Westminster last night the Members of Parliament negotiating with themselves again.  It is nice to see that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has diminished somewhat but I would be very concerned that Brexit has created huge divisions, certainly in Northern Ireland and on this island.  I read a news item recently about Trevor Ringland, who played rugby for Ireland.  At the height of the Troubles, he and Hugo MacNeill were champions of co-operation and breaking down barriers on the island of Ireland but I am very concerned that Trevor Ringland has stated that there is no space in a very nationalist Ireland for even moderate unionists.  I know the work that Trevor Ringland, Hugo MacNeill and many in the British Irish Association have done since the early 1970s in Oxford and Cambridge every second year but I am very concerned about that kind of rhetoric about a Border poll and nationalists being emboldened because of Brexit uncertainty.  Nationalists have every right to aspire in that regard but these are difficult and dangerous times when we see somebody like Trevor Ringland, who was at the vanguard of cross-Border co-operation, coming out with a statement like that.  We have to be very careful to ensure that we do not send out the message that we do not care what happens as a result of Brexit.  We have to work very closely together on that.  I was very concerned to see someone with the pedigree of Trevor Ringland coming out with a statement like that.</p></speech>

Although it is not conclusive on any strategic plan, what they did achieve was to clearly demonstrate that a no-deal Brexit or crash out for the UK is well and truly off the table.</p> <p>As I indicated to this House a number of weeks ago, reading between the lines of the discussion that was going on at Westminster and the language that was used, the supremacy of Parliament over Government was key, and last night clearly demonstrated that.  The outcome of last night's vote indicated that the favoured proposition is a close alignment with Europe, a softer Brexit and support for close management of this situation.  Interestingly, even though the vote on a public vote to approve a Brexit deal was lost, the margin was tight at only 27.  It must be remembered that only 563 votes were cast so that position could evolve next week.</p> <p>I am disappointed that a number of key individuals are changing their position on a daily basis to achieve Brexit at all costs.  It begs the question about the integrity of the argument they have made and their motivation.  Furthermore, to put the head of a prime minister on the block to satisfy the baying pack serves no purpose, especially at this point when she has already given a commitment to vacate her position at a later stage.  </p> <p>I listened to the argument about respecting the result of a referendum but I would like to clarify that by a process of discussion, negotiation, dialogue, debate and public engagement, as well as the UK, Irish and European discussion, we have already completely respected a referendum.  What we have done is interrogate the information, have the negotiation and demonstrate that the ideology that was sold to the British people was undeliverable, and it is still undeliverable.  The past two years have proved invaluable.  They have challenged the process of democracy and will give the UK Government an opportunity to re-establish its position as a full member of the European community.</p> <p>Due process is taking place and, as I urged this House previously, we must give it space to do so.  The statutory instrument to change the date for withdrawal from today's date was passed last night.  Ireland and the EU have done all they could be expected to do in this discussion.  It is now in the hands of the elected representatives in Westminster.  For Ireland, this is now a waiting game, with next week determining the next steps.  I therefore urge the Government to refrain from commenting too much at this stage and not to distract from the debate that must take place within Westminster.</p></speech>

This is a symbolic moment and I use "symbolic" for want of a better word - 10,000 people in homelessness.  The Minister also said on "Morning Ireland" that rent caps have led to rents falling but Dublin rents have increased by 8% since 2017 according to the RTB.  We can do something about this.  Members of the other House will have an opportunity to vote for a Bill that, if passed, would prevent many families from losing their homes - families at risk of homelessness.  The Bill, which is based on a Focus Ireland amendment, would prevent buy-to-let landlords from issuing vacant possession notices to quit to tenants when they are selling their property.  This is the single biggest issue and cause of family homelessness so I call on Senators to talk to their colleagues in the other House, particularly Fianna F&aacute;il, which blocked this measure in 2016, to support this very small but important measure that would help people facing imminent homelessness.</p></speech>

He was also a former primary school teacher.  He was a man who gave public service of the highest quality in the classroom, Seanad and D&aacute;il for many years.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.  I am very happy to second the call by Senator Feighan for the House's sympathy to be conveyed to his family.</p> <p>I want to raise an issue related to our conversation this morning that would go a good bit towards solving the housing problem.  Could we have a debate on remote working incentives and people working from home?  With advances in technology, it is easier for employees to accomplish work and communicate with their employer from home.  There is accessibility everywhere with the Internet.  I know there is an issue with some rural areas but, hopefully, that will be resolved.  We need to deal with the areas that have it at the moment and get people working there.  Video chatting is easy.  Cloud computing makes accessing company data handy.  The costs associated with transportation, commuting, fuel and work wardrobes would be reduced.  Of course, it would make a big dent in the housing problem.  It would leave workers free to create their own schedule and give people the choice to live outside the city, which is so relevant here.  It would bring about better local communities and cut down on the need for office space and possibly free up some of that for housing.  Getting people to work in their local communities is a win-win situation and should be incentivised.  I ask the Acting Leader for a debate on that issue.  We should look at where a Government function could be sublet in that regard.  We could show leadership because we could allow people to fulfil some Government functions by working from home thereby creating space in the city.  It is one of a menu of solutions to the housing crisis but in itself, it is the right thing to do.  I ask the Leader to take this up.  I am convinced that this is the way forward and must happen.</p></speech>

Earlier this week, ten Afghan children from one extended family were killed - murdered by a US air strike in Kunduz in Afghanistan.  There is no doubt that this country is complicit in that killing and the range of killings by US forces in Syria, Iraq and the aforementioned Afghanistan.  I have asked for a debate on this issue countless times.  It has been denied each time.  I can understand why it is being denied.  It is because the Government has no defence for our complicity in handing over our airport.  I raise it this morning because on St. Patrick's Day, two US veterans made a peaceful protest at Shannon Airport -  Ken Mayers, who is aged 82 and Tarak Kauff, who is aged 77.  They were arrested, put in prison and denied bail the next day and they remain in prison.  These are two elderly men making a peaceful protest who are no threat to anybody.  They were making a peaceful, legitimate protest about the appalling use of our airport in Shannon and this is how our State has treated them.  They have a High Court appeal regarding bail this morning.  I am calling for their release and hope that everyone here would join me in calling for their release so that they would be allowed to return home.  The idea that our State would victimise these peaceful protesters in this way should be abhorrent to all of us.  It just goes to show the lengths to which this State will go to threaten anyone who stands up to speak out about the atrocities that are being supported through Shannon Airport.  I am calling once again for a debate.  I wonder whether Fine Gael will hide as a party throughout the full length of this term rather than confront the shameful use of Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his retirement.</p> <p>I refer to the issue of housing.  One of the issues that is being missed in this debate is the reason we have a significant demand for housing is because there has been a significant increase in the numbers of jobs delivered.  A total of 2.28 million people are now working, which is the highest level of employment in this country.  I remind Senator Mark Daly that when Fianna F&aacute;il left office, there was net outflow from this country of over 50,000 per annum.  There is now a net inflow because the jobs are here.  It is interesting to see the economic analysis.  I was at a presentation at the economics society in UCC on Monday night.  Seamus Coffey, chair of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, was there.  He presented some very interesting figures.  One statistic was that earnings per capita in real terms in this country are ahead of other European countries because there has been growth in jobs and areas that are very specialised and that generate higher income.  Therefore, there is a demand for housing.</p> <p>A total of 25,000 new units will be delivered this year.  In addition, a significant amount of new student accommodation will be completed, which is extremely welcome because it will take students out of dwelling houses and into proper accommodation.  This needs to continue.  Yes, there are challenges that must be met.  Likewise, I agree to an extent with Senator Craughwell about where office space is built.  It just shows how Cork is developing.  The 1 Albert Quay complex was built in the past two years and 1,700 people now work there.  A further three commercial units are being built that will accommodate an additional 8,000 to 8,500 people.  Yes, there will be a challenge regarding providing housing for the people who work there but these offices are within five minutes walking distance of the train station, therefore, people could live in Mallow, Cobh or Midleton and get to work by train without having to drive.  A lot of good work is being done.</p> <p>We must deal with the challenges posed by housing but we must deal with them in a progressive and constructive way.  It is interesting how some people speak about housing yet people in those same parties have objected to housing projects and local authorities proceeding with housing projects in their own local authority areas.  We do not hear them talking about that.  Let us look at it.  We all have to work together to resolve the problem.  A lot of work is being done.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many new dwelling houses are being delivered and that process will continue.</p></speech>

I hope he will enjoy good health and be able to spend both time and money <i>ad multos annos</i>in his years of retirement.  I also wish to be associated with the expressions of sorrow for the former Member, Mr. John Browne.  My sympathies also go to his son, Fergal, and the family.</p><p>I was listening to Ms Arlene Foster on the radio this morning.  Given her position and the goals she wishes to protect and obtain, I was quite struck by the reasonableness of her tone and perspective.  The history books may be kinder to the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, than many of us have been tempted to be.  Many people calculated some time ago that a no-deal Brexit would not take place, and if the party made that calculation, it would have the best of both worlds in staying with Brexiteers while being quite comfortable in the knowledge that way end up with a much softer Brexit than even Prime Minister May's plan entails.  I am hopeful of that but time will tell.</p><p>One of the Brexiteers, Mr. Jacob Rees-Mogg, used the term &quot;terminological inexactitude&quot; recently, although he was not the first to use it.  This was when the word &quot;lie&quot; was considered to be unparliamentary.  It struck me while listening to my friend and colleague, Senator Warfield, that perhaps terminological or even &quot;opinionological&quot; inexactitude might serve his purposes in describing the Taoiseach's characterisation of Sinn F&eacute;in policy.  I listened to Senator Warfield yesterday speaking about conversion therapy, an area into which many people fear to wade.  With issues such as that, the highest value comes from what people want, provided it does not do harm.  I do not know enough about it at this stage but if it can be demonstrated that this is harmful to people, there is a very good case to make it unlawful.  If it cannot be shown to be harmful to people, we are back into the realm of individual choice.  I say this because in these Houses we do not speak enough about the importance of an evidence base for proposals.  I hope that if it is in the area raised by Senator Warfield or the very fraught and difficult area of transgender persons' rights and needs, we look honestly at the current evidence.</p><p>Many parents who I know are quite concerned about what is taught in schools in the name of equality with respect to transgender issues and they question whether children's best interests are being served by what is now often proposed.  I do not know the answers to those questions but we have a better chance of getting those answers if we insist that anything we call for has a sound evidence base.  As legislators, we have a particular responsibility in this respect.  Perhaps we could make progress in this House on such matters by using the Seanad as a forum to establish a precise evidence base.  I am not sure that our committees are serving us sufficiently in considering issues from an actual evidence base.  The Seanad could have a solid and significant input in that space.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-28a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032800002#L00300"><p>We are all very aware of the fragility in the negotiations regarding the United Kingdom and Brexit.  I remind Senator Feighan that his party and Fianna F&aacute;il are picking the leftovers of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP.  It has been that party's continuous position that there should be a poll after Britain withdraws from the European Union, which could happen two weeks from now.  There must be a nuance in being careful about these matters but we must hold our side as well.  This debate has been popularised on the entire island of Ireland like never before in the two or three years in which we have heard the Brexit discussion.  It is important for our confidence as a nation that we can have such a debate in a meaningful manner among ourselves and decide what we want.  We should not shy away from it.  It is not about keeping quiet so the debate in Britain can continue as we must look after our country and citizens as well.</p> <p>I attended the launch of the justice and equality committee's report on community and rural policing.  I am delighted because two of the recommendations are associated with health, particularly mental health and vulnerability.  They relate to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na being used as front-line or first responders, which is inappropriate in cases where vulnerable people are having episodes and the community or mental health services cannot cope.  The only recourse for the professionals now is to call in the Garda.  Mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder, ASD, have been told to call the Garda.  I have been dealing with a case like this where the child is as young as four.  I know that is exceptional but children grow up with symptoms of ASD and they can have difficulty finding treatment.  The difficulty is we are criminalising people with a vulnerability, with many ending up in the prison system or Garda stations.  A Seanad team visited a hub last Monday in Derry that is dedicated to a multidisciplinary approach to the matter.  I will put down a Commencement matter on the subject at some stage in order that we can learn more about it.</p></speech>

I extend my sympathies to the family of the former Member, Mr. John Browne, and, in particular, his son, who was also a Member of this House.  I wish Mr. Donal Hickey well in his retirement and he is an absolute gentleman.  I hope he has a very happy and healthy retirement.</p> <p>Senator Mark Daly referred to the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2016, which he introduced in July of that year.  As he knows, a number of issues required further consideration to ensure the best approach to the provision of a criminal law response to the type of fatalities that are the focus of the Bill.  At the time, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, wrote to the Senator indicating that, having considered the Bill, a number of specific issues arose.  The Senator is aware of all this but I am just putting it on the record.  Those issues need to be clarified or addressed.  They include the range of bodies to which the Bill would apply, the range of unincorporated bodies to which the Bill would apply, the legal ingredients of any offence, including who would be liable within an organisation, exemptions to any offence, etc.  Those matters continue to be considered and they have wide-ranging implications for all organisations, as the Senator noted, including voluntary bodies providing a service to the public.</p> <p>Detailed scrutiny of the Law Reform Commission report is required by all invested in this process and officials in the Department of Justice and Equality are continuing to consider the contents of the report in the context of examining further amendments to the Bill.  It is also worth pointing out that witnesses from the Law Reform Commission appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on 26 February to discuss the report.  Officials have agreed to meet the Senator to discuss this matter and the Leader's office will write to the Department to facilitate a meeting involving the Senator in the very near future.  I hope that will be satisfactory.  The officials have already indicated they will be happy to do it so I can ensure that it happens sooner rather than later.</p> <p>The Senator also referred to homelessness, as did almost everybody else who contributed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Noone:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2354"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2354&amp;amp;pid=CatherineNoone&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It goes without saying that the increase in homelessness in February is hugely disappointing.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke made an interesting contribution on the jobs that have been created.  I know that it is no comfort to people who do not have a roof over their heads but we are victims of the recovery in that sense.  It is more expensive than ever to build housing and housing supply is obviously at a critical level.  I am not trying to defend the homelessness figure because it is extremely unsatisfactory.  However, compared with 2017, the number of new homes built in 2018 increased by 25%, with more than 18,000 new homes completed.  Roughly one in four of the new homes built was for social housing.  The latest report from the Residential Tenancies Board also shows that average rents fell at the end of 2018.  It is not a fabrication to say there are indicators that things are moving in the right direction but this glaring figure for homelessness is seriously concerning.  </p><p>The housing assistance payment, HAP, will continue to play a vital role in providing families with a place to live until supply catches up.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will continue to work with families to demonstrate the benefits of this scheme compared with emergency accommodation.  The Minister is in constant contact with the local authorities.  I have come across numerous cases in my area of politicians objecting to housing developments.  This underlines the difficulty of the problem we are dealing with.  We have politicians from all parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, objecting to housing in Dublin city.  How are we supposed to fix the housing crisis when Members of this House and the other House rightly complain about the housing figures and or the fact that 10,000 people are homeless when, later on the same day, the same politicians submit objections to housing plans?  Councillors from all parties are objecting to planning being given in areas throughout the city.  We must have integrity when we speak about this issue.</p><p>It will take time to solve the housing problem.  I ask Members to look into their hearts when we talk about homelessness.  To give a glaring example from my area, one individual politician has objected to between 1,000 and 1,300 new homes.  We need to consider this matter in a holistic way.  The figures that underpin Rebuilding Ireland continue to improve in many areas.  I suggest that we invite the Minister to the House to discuss this issue in the near future.  I am in no doubt that he would be happy to discuss many of the issues that have been raised today.  Such a debate would be timely in the context of these figures.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of officers in the Defence Forces.  I suggest that he table a Commencement matter on the issue.  He also raised an interesting issue about non-commercial and commercial housing in the context of homelessness.  That issue could be discussed during the debate I mentioned in response to Senator Mark Daly's contribution.</p><p>Senators Conway-Walsh and Devine raised the joint committee's report which deals with rural crime.  It would be worthwhile to arrange a debate on the issue.  I was interested to hear Senator Devine's remarks on the mental health aspects of the report, which are positive.  Senator Conway-Walsh also raised the issue of smear tests and cervical cancer.  A discussion with the Minister for Health would be timely because, more than anything, we need to restore confidence in that process.  Women who have been through that process understand where other women are coming from on the issue.  I had a repeat smear test done because I was concerned when I heard about the issue, even though I knew logically that I did not need one.  Such concern has, however, created a backlog, which is a natural consequence.  We need to encourage people to continually engage with the process.  I agree that we need a tangible statement from the Minister on the matter to help restore confidence in that area. </p><p>Senator Humphreys raised the issue of Airbnb and housing.  I addressed housing when I responded to the remarks made by Senator Mark Daly.  Senator Humphreys made an interesting point about the innovation centre being established in Dublin which will create 10,000 jobs.  It is a difficulty when the economy is improving so much.  We have to house people and strike a balance in all areas of housing.</p><p>Senator Feighan, as always, raised the issue of Westminster and highlighted the fairly depressing issues that are unfolding daily.  It is sad to watch one of the oldest Parliaments in the world, if not the oldest, tear itself apart and show itself up in the way it has done.  </p><p>Senator Marshall made some insightful comments in his assessment of what is happening.  I take from what he said that we must be careful not to inflame the situation.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, he has been excellent in that regard.  Where possible, as Senator Feighan said, we have left the British to fight it out and debate Brexit among themselves.  We have done our negotiations.  It has struck me in recent days that many politicians in the UK seem to be changing their minds yet they will not countenance the possibility that the British people could also change their minds.  It seems fine for Prime Minister May, who was a remainer, and various other politicians to change their minds, yet a different approach is taken when it comes to the people.  The British people voted in circumstances where scaremongering messages were displayed on buses.  The referendum was fraught with inaccuracies, yet there is still no real talk of holding another referendum.  It is hard to relate to such a situation. </p><p>Senator Warfield raised the issue of homelessness, which I addressed.</p><p>Senator Joe O'Reilly raised the interesting issue of incentivised remote working.  Many employers would probably be concerned about that at an instinctive level because there is a perception that people will be at home in their pyjamas and not working.  A shift in mindset is needed to get employers to buy into the idea of remote working.  It is an excellent idea, particularly as the M50 is absolutely packed.  I wonder how many of the people who use the M50 could potentially work from home on at least a couple of days a week.  We should consider innovative ideas that would reduce the number of people on the roads and reduce demand for accommodation in the bigger cities where we are obviously struggling to provide housing.</p><p>I suggest the issue raised by Senator Gavan would be suitable for a Commencement debate.  I genuinely do not know the particulars of the case he raised and I am not trying to be evasive.  It would be good to discuss Shannon Airport in the context of a general debate on airports.  I will suggest such a debate to the Leader, which would give Senator Gavan an opportunity to raise the issue.  As I do not know anything about the case he raised, I do not wish to comment on it.</p></speech>

I thank my colleagues in Fine Gael for allowing me bring it forward.  I also thank the Minister for being present and for his advice in my discussions with him.  I thank my work colleagues in the office, Fintan and Adam; the various groups with which I consulted such as the Irish SME Association, ISME, the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, and the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, VFI; and the legal personnel to whom I spoke about this legislation.  I must also acknowledge the work the Government has been doing on this.  The former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, set up the cost of insurance working group and, following this, the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, under Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns, was established, which brought forward a telling report.  The cost of insurance working group made a number of recommendations as well.</p><p>I will relate a couple of stories.  James is a young driver.  He is 22 years of age.  He has his own car valued at &euro;1,800.  He goes to look for insurance on it.  He cannot get fully comprehensive insurance.  All he is offered is third-party fire and theft insurance.  The first insurance payment he was supposed to make was &euro;4,000.  He eventually got this down to &euro;2,000.  A small publican living in the locality saw his insurance rise from &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000 over four years.  Lately I have met people who own play centres.  Rachael is a woman who has a business in which she ensures that everything is done properly.  She has had a couple of claims against her, which she contested.  On one occasion the judge mentioned the fact that she was not negligent in the business she had run and that what happened was purely accidental.  The claimant, a young child, received &euro;26,000.  Her insurance has risen to in excess of &euro;15,000.  There must be some cases in which personal responsibility is carried.  Some play centres have experienced insurance increases of 300% in recent years.  A number of them have had to close because of this insurance increase.</p><p>When I started doing research on this, I inquired as to why premiums are so high and there are a number of reasons.  I refer to insurance companies' profits, which in recent years have been excessive.  The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, said insurance companies must pass on some of the profits they are making back to premium holders and reduce premiums.  Levies are another reason premiums are so high.  Government levies on motor policies are currently 7%.  This is associated with failed insurance companies in the past, such as Quinn Insurance.  We will all be paying 2% <i>ad infinitum</i>to recoup the money the State paid into that.  Fraud is another reason.  Insurance fraud is probably at an all-time high.  The Judiciary, in fairness to it, is starting to recognise this and is working with insurance companies to reduce the volume of fraud.  Claims, future claims and awards happen to constitute the most costly part of an insurance premium.  Up to 70% of one's insurance premium, whether it is for one's car, one's home or one's business, is associated with awards.  The awards that have been made can be broken down as follows: of the awards paid out through the courts or the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, 90% to 95% are for under &euro;50,000.  This has increased by 42% since 2011.  Most of these awards come through the courts and they are mostly small claim awards.  Regarding PIAB, a body that was set up in 2003 to try to reduce insurance costs, the average payout for a whiplash claim in 2018 was &euro;18,581.  According to PIAB, 70% of all claims concern whiplash.</p><p>I then looked at comparisons with other countries.  The PIC under Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns found that insurance awards here are 4.4 times higher than in the UK.  I refer in particular to whiplash claims.  In the UK, a green book is used, whereas here we use a book of quantum.  The green book pays out between &pound;500 and &pound;3,000 for small injuries.  In the book of quantum, this can rise to up to &euro;15,700 for similar claims.  The cost of insurance across Europe for small, minor injuries, general damages ranges from zero in France and Finland up to &euro;6,000 in Germany, so our awards are way out of line.  As a result of this, the cost of insurance here is higher.  The average car insurance premium in the UK is &pound;477 for all motor vehicles, in comparison with the average premium for car insurance here, which, according to AA Ireland, across all age sectors, was &euro;998 in 2018.</p><p>PIAB was established to remove as many cases as possible from the courts.  As a result, the cost of insurance dropped for the next ten years.  However, PIAB is currently basing its awards on the book of quantum.  The book of quantum is based on historical awards made through the courts.  Sixty per cent of all cases with which PIAB deals are motor-related.  Of these, 80% of the cases dealt with relate to whiplash.  The PIC report makes ten recommendations, key among which is the Judicial Council Bill 2017, which will come before the Seanad next week.  The PIC recommends that guidelines be instrumental.  However, are guidelines strong enough, and do the courts have to take the guidelines on board?  The key is consistency of awards.  When a case is taken before a court, it depends on the judge as to how much is given out as an award.  Judge A could award &euro;20,000 while Judge B could award &euro;10,000.  There seems to be no consistency in awards.  The Law Reform Commission, LRC, has been tasked with looking into legislation which may be robust so as to be able to reduce these awards.</p><p>I have considered whether or not this legislation is constitutional.  The Supreme Court, in Sinnott <i>v</i>. Quinnsworth, put a cap on awards that can be made under general damages.  This was done in 1984 to the tune of &pound;150,000.  Section 49 of Civil Liability Act 1961 provided for a cap of IR&pound;1,000 on certain types of damages.  Since then, various Ministers have increased this to &euro;35,000.</p><p>The Bill itself is straightforward and simple.  The first section deals with the definitions and interpretations of the various terms used throughout the legislation.  The key definition relates to &quot;general damages&quot;.  This means &quot;compensation for non-monetary damages for pain and suffering incurred by a claimant and which is sought to be recovered as part of a claim for personal injury&quot;.</p><p>Section 2 deals with the maximum level of damages for personal injury.  This requires the Minister to make regulations.</p><p>Section 3 concerns considerations to apply to the making of the regulations, that is, what the Minister must take on board.  He or she must take on board what is fair and proper and right for each claimant.</p><p>Section 4 states that the regulations laid down by the Minister must come before both Houses of the Oireachtas and be passed.  The purpose of this is to ensure we scrutinise the regulations.</p><p>Section 5 deals with a review of the regulations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Anthony Lawlor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Section 6 deals with the fact that the book of quantum must be brought into line with the regulations the Minister makes.</p><p>Section 7 deals with the operation of the Bill, allows for a review when it is eancted and takes into consideration those people who should be considered with regard to the review.</p><p>Section 8 sets out the Short Title.</p><p>I have outlined some of the many factors that must be taken into consideration as we seek to deal with high insurance premiums.

Even though Senator Lawlor has been a Member for just a few months, he has introduced this Bill, which has its finger on the pulse.  I consider the level of payouts that are being made as insurance compensation to be a national scandal.  There are three elements to this scandal, the first of which is the level of compensation that is being given in certain cases.  Senator Lawlor went into minute detail when he provided international comparisons.  Ireland is among the most generous countries when it comes to compensation in the insurance sector.</p> <p>The second element of this scandal is the exceptional profits being made by all the insurance companies.  If one visits the website of the Companies Registration Office, CRO, one will be able to see the extraordinary profits that certain companies are making.  They are in the business of making money and - fair dues to them - they are well able to make it.  Unfortunately, they do not seem to have a sense of social responsibility that would cause them to be fair to those who support their profit-making ventures.  People often talk about vulture banks and vulture funds, and they are right when they say that what is going on with vulture funds is appalling.  I suggest that what is going on with insurance companies is also appalling.  A young driver can be charged up to &euro;6,000 to get insured for the first time.  That is discrimination against young people.  We are trying to encourage young people to stay in Ireland.  We often give out about nurses who go abroad.  Some of them want to see the world, but many of them go abroad because they simply cannot afford things like rent and car insurance.  Where will a recently qualified nurse who is starting off in the profession come up with &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,000 to pay for insurance?  When I was knocking on doors in Corofin, County Clare, two weeks ago, a lady who answered one door told me that she runs a business in Ennis and that her insurance premium increased by an incredible 60% last year.  It is difficult for businesses to keep sustaining that type of increase.  Who is to say that her premium will not increase by a further 60% next year?  There is nothing to stop that from happening.  It is difficult for people to keep their staff employed and keep their businesses going in such circumstances.  It is difficult to support the economy and to support jobs when this is going on.  I have great regard and respect for people like Pat McDonagh who faced down what was going on with the insurance industry a number of years ago when a number of fraudulent claims were made.</p> <p>That brings me to the third element of the scandal in the insurance industry, which is the number of fraudulent claims that are made.  All citizens have a responsibility to call out people whom we suspect of submitting fraudulent claims to insurance companies.  Everybody suffers when such claims are made.  When we watch advertisements on television and listen to them on the radio, it is pointed out to us that everybody ends up paying as a result of fraudulent claims.  The three issues I have mentioned are interwoven into one.  Senator Lawlor is reflecting the desire of the people of Ireland for us to deal with the vulture insurance companies and to cap the outrageous claims.  Anybody who gets injured deserves to be compensated.  There is no question or doubt about that.  However, it has to be fair, respectful and appropriate.</p></speech>

I hear all the time from people who are facing significant premiums for their businesses or their own cars.  It is outrageous.  However, the Bill does not represent the way to go in this regard.  It is probably unconstitutional.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether the Attorney General has looked over it.  If not, why not?  If the Attorney General has not given the green light to this Bill, why are we debating it?  I am highly dubious that this Bill would get the green light by him.  It is curious that we are wasting time debating this Bill when we could take measures that would help to tackle the high premiums people are facing.</p> <p>Senators Lawlor and Conway referred to fraudulent and exaggerated claims.  The way to tackle this issue is to have a dedicated Garda fraud unit.  We all know of fraudulent claims that are being thrown out of the courts but are not being tackled thereafter.  Why are these criminal matters not being systematically reported to the Garda and investigated?  People are chancing their arms because they know there are no consequences.  This is a very real issue.</p> <p>If this Bill had been introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il Senators, we would have been accused by those on the Government benches of being populist and irresponsible.  Instead, this irresponsible and populist Bill is being introduced by the Government.  I am completely baffled about that.  Fianna F&aacute;il genuinely wants to tackle high premium costs.  We have been to the fore in tackling high insurance premiums.</p> <p>The fact of the matter is that people who are involved in accidents deserve to be compensated fairly for any injuries they incur.  If we scare people away from the courts and blacken the name of everybody who brings a personal injuries claim, we will not serve the cause of ordinary people who are injured through no fault of their own and deserve proper compensation.  The PIC has recommended that when the judicial council is established, the Minister for Justice and Equality should ask it to compile guidelines for appropriate general damages for various types of personal injuries.  It is completely outrageous to think that the Legislature could put a cap on general damages.  It is a bonkers Bill, to be honest.  It is populist.  I know it will get Senator Lawlor the local headlines he is looking for.</p></speech>

We should set up a dedicated Garda fraud unit to deliver some results.  We need to tackle the anti-competitive practices of the large insurance companies and the outrageous profits they are making.  We should stop targeting ordinary people who are injured through no fault of their own.</p></speech>

There certainly will be different views on its intent and its constitutionality, and on whether better and more effective and practical proposals could be brought to this House.  I wonder about that but we are where we are.  It is no mean feat to get a Private Members' Bill to the floor of this House.  Senator Lawlor has been successful in that regard and fair play to him on that.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and to speak to the topic of insurance more generally.  The Bill is one that we in Sinn F&eacute;in will lend its support to on Second Stage, although not without reservations.  We would bring forward amendments were it to progress further.</p> <p>As has been stated by Senator Clifford-Lee, questions arise as to the Bill's constitutionality and how workable it is more generally, given that damages and personal injuries are more complex and specific to the person than may appear on the face of it.</p> <p>I have concerns about section 2 and the limiting of any claim that can be made for general damages as defined under the Bill.  While in theory it may seem a logical proposal, it does not take into account what may be considered as general damages more broadly, and how these may be fluid and how the nature of any injury incurred may change or develop with the passing of time.  For example, in a case of someone who incurred life-limiting injuries and whose life expectancy had been estimated at 18 months taking a personal injury claim and the court settling on the amount there and then but two years later he or she is still alive and requires further expensive medical care, where does his or her claim sit?  It is unclear in that regard.  Section 2(3) appears to make an attempt to give scope to the Minister but that could become burdensome and tedious in time, and it may undermine the intention of the Bill in its totality.  The same may well apply to sections 3 and 6, respectively.</p> <p>On section 7(4), it should be a mandatory requirement to consult such groups rather than leaving it to the discretion of the Minister, with all respect to him or her, and I am not quite sure why such a requirement is not provided for.  Either way, my party's concerns may well be unfounded, and addressed by section 3.  A High Court case in the middle of last year reiterated the binding principles laid down by the Court of Appeal and by the Supreme Court, which must be applied in calculating the appropriate level of general damages for any personal injury.  The case concerned a claim by a Garda for compensation in respect of a soft-tissue injury to his hand.  Counsel for the applicant, in reliance on the book of quantum, suggested an award of &euro;21,700.  The court ultimately concluded that the appropriate compensation was &euro;5,000.  While this case related to the Garda compensation scheme, the judgment expressly referred to all personal injury cases.  It was determined that in assessing damages the court is obliged to be "fair" to both parties and that any award must be "proportionate" within the scheme of awards for personal injury damages, and, further, that any such award must be objectively "reasonable" in light of the common good and social conditions.  As I stated, the general principles of the Bill are fine and I understand the good intentions of An Seanad&oacute;ir Lawlor but I hope the Bill progresses so that we could tease these matters out further.</p> <p>On the insurance issue more generally, the motor insurance industry and the Central Bank have been accused of throwing consumers to the wolves over the cost of car insurance, in particular, in years gone by.  I am not sure whether this trend has continued but I am aware, at least anecdotally, that many drivers are still experiencing increased premiums despite no change to their driving history.</p> <p>In a hard-hitting report in 2016, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach stated that the motor insurance industry had deliberately been hiding key information from public view and engaging in cartel-like behaviour.  The report stated that all witnesses who appeared before the committee, except for the insurance industry itself, had highlighted the absence of data-sharing and a complete absence of transparency across the sector as a serious problem.  The absence of this information meant it was impossible to get to the root cause of motor insurance price increases, according to the committee.  The report also suggested another cause of the spikes in the cost of motor insurance which have resulted in some drivers' premiums going up by more than 100% in just two years was insurance companies had been using their motor insurance books to bolster shortfalls in investment income in other areas.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Central Bank also came under fire in that report.  The committee stated that the CCPC had insisted its remit was economy wide and limited to enforcement of competition law, something which "is of little comfort to suffering motorists who feel exploited and abandoned".</p> <p>In regards to insurance fraud, Sinn F&eacute;in received documents under the Freedom of Information Acts last year, which documented a series of missed deadlines by Insurance Ireland since early 2017 to progress the proposal to set up an insurance fraud unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na funded by private industry.  The independence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is essential, and a direct funding relationship with private interests undermines that independence.  This is in a context where the insurance industry is under investigation by the competition authorities, in the State and at EU level, over anti-competitive practices.  Any such unit should be funded by the State and, at a cost of approximately &euro;1 million, this is more than within the capacity of Government.</p> <p>It is clear now that Insurance Ireland has, despite protestations that fraud is a cause of increased premiums, decided instead that tackling fraud is not an important part of its agenda.  This unit would now be up and running were it not for such delays.  It is probably a conversation for another day, but an important and worthy one nonetheless.</p></speech>

I am not a legal expert and I cannot speak on the constitutionality or anything else.  The general thrust and principle of it is without doubt.</p> <p>It is unacceptable that the personal injury payouts continue to increase at a phenomenal rate and are totally out of line, as Senator Lawlor outlined in his contribution, with the rest of Europe.  As for why this is the case, there probably are other factors.  I am not aware of the minutiae.  There is no doubt insurance companies have many questions to answer because of the spiralling premiums.  We all have plenty of examples of that.  The insurance companies are not losing money but are making handsome profits.</p> <p>Other factors have been mentioned, such as levies and fraud.  My observation on the fraud issue is that more cases seem to have been thrown out in recent times.  I very much welcome this because previous awards were mind-boggling - not only their amount but the fact that awards were made in certain cases at all.  I welcome the fact that more fraudulent cases seem to have been thrown out in recent times.</p> <p>I was interested in the contribution of Senator Clifford-Lee, who has left the Chamber.  She accused Senator Lawlor of being populist and seeking headlines.  There is a saying I will not repeat here because it might be unparliamentary.  The Senator herself is certainly a dab hand at both of those topics.  As somebody who observes headline seekers in both politics and sport, I note that the Senator has starred in that area.  Perhaps she has left the Chamber to seek a few more headlines.</p></speech>
