I acknowledge that the Minister of State, who has responsibility for disabilities, has come here to take this important Commencement matter.</p> <p>World Down's Syndrome Day was last Thursday and we all wore odd socks.  This Commencement matter arose as a result of an engagement I had with the parent of child who has the condition on World Down's Syndrome Day.  We spoke at length about the challenges that children with Down's syndrome come up against.  One of the significant challenges is in terms of communication and speech.  The Minister of State will be fully aware of the unique set of challenges that children with Down's syndrome in particular encounter when it comes to speaking.  Every one of us, as a result of our involvement in the business of politics, appreciates the value of being able to communicate.  If one is in a situation where one cannot articulate properly as a result of difficulties with speaking due to having Down's syndrome, then the basic premise of communication is compromised.</p> <p>Down's syndrome children are beautiful and have a huge amount to offer.  We have a responsibility to assist them and provide the necessary supports to enable them to develop their communication skills.  It is one thing if one will never be able to communicate but if one can communicate with proper interventions and supports, then that is where the State needs to step in.  Last week, I was informed by the parent to whom I refer that the State only provides six sessions of speech therapy a year.  The child involved had six sessions of speech therapy in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  In 2018, there were still six sessions even though our economy has benefited enormously from a recovery and despite the fact that the Government has prioritised the issue of disability and support structures for people with disabilities.  In 2019, the allocation still is six sessions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This parent, through hard work and dedication, is funding speech therapy privately for her child.  The child gets two sessions a month.  That works out at about 24 or 25 sessions a year.  That parent uses the six sessions available from the State to complement these.  We need to do more and we need to do better.  Perhaps there is a mechanism whereby this can be improved.  Perhaps there is a plan.  The provision of speech therapy is a critical intervention for children with Down's syndrome because of the unique challenges such children face and because speech therapy has been proven over and over again to be successful and to work.  All children with Down's syndrome in our society and our State should be able to reach their potential in terms of communicating.  Through hard work, the parent with whom I engaged has the resources to provide speech interventions and therapy privately, but what about the parents who cannot?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-27a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032700002#B00200"><p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this very important issue.  I totally acknowledge his own great work in pushing and campaigning for all children with disabilities and, in this debate, for children with Down's syndrome in particular.  I thank him again for raising this very important issue.  I absolutely agree with most of the sentiments he expressed.  I accept the point that we need a plan, but we have a plan.  I will deal with that in my response.</p> <p>Timely access to speech and language therapy services is important and I understand that delays in accessing the service are a source of concern for patients, their parents and their families.  The Government is committed to improving access to services through investment and improvements in how services are provided to enable children to reach their full potential.  In 2019 we are going to spend &euro;1.9 billion on disability services under the HSE service plan.  That is an increase of 7.5%.  Anybody who comes into this House to say that cuts are being made to services should look at the statistics and information and get his or her facts right.  </p> <p>The overarching principle governing the planning and delivery of health services and supports for adults and children with disabilities is that they should be integrated, as much as possible, with services and supports for the rest of the population.  The Government&rsquo;s agenda, and mine, in this regard is clearly set out in the national disability inclusion strategy, the steering group of which I chair.  The strategy is based on a non-condition specific approach to the delivery of public services and the mainstreaming agenda.  I take the Senator's point.  I did a number of events myself on World Down's Syndrome Day.  I spent a lot of time with parents and talking to children on that day. </p> <p>As Senators will be aware, speech and language therapy is mainly provided through the HSE&rsquo;s primary care service.  Overall funding for primary care has increased in the HSE&rsquo;s national service plan for 2019, with more than &euro;50 million in additional funding being made available.  An extra &euro;50 million is being put in in 2019.  This represents an increase of 6% on primary care for 2018.  I make that point very strongly.  Of course, we also have to look at individual cases.  Each individual that presents to the HSE&rsquo;s speech and language therapy service has an initial assessment to determine the individual&rsquo;s presenting need and requirements for therapy.  The therapist, in conjunction with the parents or carer, will then determine the severity of the individual&rsquo;s difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinical policy, age and presenting need according to diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment.  The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs. </p> <p>Speech and language therapy staffing levels in primary care have increased significantly in recent years with an additional 76 whole-time equivalents appointed between January 2015 and January 2019.  Further increases are anticipated in line with funding in 2019.  I accept the Senator's point; we need to increase and expand services further, but we have started.  The HSE anticipates that almost 280,000 speech and language therapy patients will be treated in primary care in 2019.  That is a lot of speech and language services.  In addition to this increase in staff numbers, the HSE has established service improvement groups to develop new standardised models of service provision for speech and language therapy and other therapy services to support service delivery.  We accept the point the Senator raised in his introduction.  We are increasing staff numbers to expand this service.  Measures under these models include providing structures, training and support to parents or carers so that they can work to help improve the individual&rsquo;s speech and language.  In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate. </p> <p>The HSE and I are committed to working in partnership with other service providers to achieve maximum benefits for children and adults requiring therapies and aim to ensure that the available resources are used in the most effective manner possible.  On the Senator's general point, we have started the work and the reforms, but we have a fair distance to go yet.  I accept that argument, but we have started, we have increased spending, and we are expanding the services.  We have to make sure that every child with Down's syndrome has access to proper speech and language therapy.  That is the objective of my plan under the national disability inclusion strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-27a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1381" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032700002#B00300"><p>I accept this is a very worthy cause.  I have a grandchild with Down's syndrome of whom I am very proud.  I am also the godfather.  I will give Senator Conway 40 seconds to conclude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-27a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1416" speakername="Martin Conway" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032700002#B00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  I agree with him in respect of the increased resources but I would like to see these increased resources orientated specifically towards speech and language therapy for children with Down's syndrome.  Perhaps there could be a greater level of increase for that specific group of our citizens for 2020.  It is probably too late for 2019 at this stage.  Perhaps the Government could direct the HSE to ring-fence the great majority of whatever increase in funding is provided for speech and language therapy for 2020 for children with Down's syndrome.  At the end of six sessions over a year there will be an obvious improvement in the child but can the Minister of State imagine what would happen if the number of sessions were to be doubled and if the child was to have an intervention of 12 sessions?  I know it is a doubling of resources but perhaps the Government could look at a specific increase in funding for speech and language therapy for 2020 as a once-off intervention for children with Down's syndrome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032700002#B00500"><p>I will make three short points.  First, I recognise what the Senator has said about delays in accessing speech and language therapy being a source of significant concern for parents.  We are trying to act on that.  Second, as Senators including Senator Conway may be aware, funding for additional therapy posts for children's disability services was announced in budget 2019.  As I speak, these posts are being rolled out.  These posts will support the completion of the assessments of need and will increase the number of therapeutic interventions provided.  I am confident that the additional resources committed by Government and the HSE's reform programme will lead to significantly improved services for children requiring speech and language therapy.  However, I cannot isolate one sector of society, even though I am a parent of a daughter with Down's syndrome and was chairperson and treasurer of the Dublin branch for many years.  We have to treat everybody, right across the disability sector.  People with speech and language difficulties should be given priority.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-27a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032700002#B00600"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to the House.  I will be brief.  This matter relates to the Rebuilding Ireland home loans scheme, of which the Minister of State will be fully aware.  He will also be fully aware of the controversy around it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is an element of misunderstanding or misinformation out there.  It is important, therefore, that clarification is provided on the current status of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which is a very effective and important scheme.  It is one of the many initiatives we need to address the issue of providing housing, including affordable and social housing.  There is a broad spectrum of routes that must be pursued.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution but this is a particularly good scheme that I welcome.  </p><p>I hope the Minister of State will be able to clarify some issues related to the status of the initiative.  An internal document released by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to "Morning Ireland" under freedom of information legislation revealed that the scheme had been put on hold because it had run out of funding.  That was subsequently denied but I have seen documentation that confirms that is the case, so I do not think that is in dispute.  In the D&aacute;il recently, the Minister indicated that he was seeking a second tranche of funding to address these issues, which I welcome.  The Taoiseach confirmed in the D&aacute;il that 575 people had availed of the scheme.  A further 1,000 applications had been approved but funding had not been drawn down.  There may or may not be issues with some of the 1,000 applicants concerned.  I have been in touch with a number of local authorities, five of which have confirmed that they have run out of money.  That is not to say that the scheme has ended.  However, the capacity of local authorities to grant further funding is on hold until there is clarification.  That is somewhat different from saying the scheme is closed, which is encouraging.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to set out how the negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are proceeding and how it is intended to bring this scheme back into line.  When that information is crystallised and clear, can a new public awareness and information campaign be launched to provide clarity, encourage people and ease their fears?  This is an important initiative because it offers some people the only chance they will get of acquiring a home.  I know the Taoiseach is conscious of people getting up early in the morning, putting their shoulder to the wheel and doing a day's work.  These are people who want to purchase a home.  They want to provide a home for themselves and their families.  We should pursue this scheme but it would be helpful to get clarification about its future funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-03-27a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1241" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019032700002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this issue and quite rightly seeking to bring additional clarity in an area that might need more clarity.  When the Rebuilding Ireland home loan was initially being developed, it was estimated that the drawdown of loans under the scheme would be approximately &euro;200 million over three years.  However, thankfully, the scheme has proven to be far more successful than originally anticipated.  Officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government have kept the Minister informed regarding the progress of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan on a regular basis and have been engaging with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the scheme since October 2018 when it became clear that the rate at which loans were being approved was higher than was originally anticipated, thus highlighting the success of the scheme.  The Minister had made a commitment on launching the scheme that he would seek further funding for it at an early stage, if necessary, given his belief in its potential.  By the end of January, &euro;106 million had been drawn down, which accounted for some 53% of the available funding, at which point &euro;66 million would have been more consistent with the expectation of funds being drawn down over a three-year period.</p> <p>The Minister informed the D&aacute;il on 29 January 2019 that the scheme had proven to be more successful than initially anticipated and would require a further tranche of funds.  He further indicated that his Department was in discussions with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance with regard to an extension of the scheme.  A meeting with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform was scheduled for 4 February 2019.  However, this had to be rescheduled and took place on 5 March 2019.  At no time was the first tranche of funding depleted and following the meeting on 5 March 2019, the Minister informed the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government that local authorities could continue to accept applications as discussions had commenced on further funding.  As of the end of January 2019, &euro;106 million had been lent supporting 575 individuals and families to buy their first home.  The Minister is in discussions with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform regarding further funding for the scheme.  The Central Bank is also being consulted.  Specific allocations to local authorities for 2019 will be finalised when those discussions have concluded.  However, in the meantime, the scheme remains open and all local authorities should continue to receive and process applications up to and including drawdown of funding, as appropriate.  </p></speech>

I am a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I am aware that at least five local authorities do not have any money to hand out under the scheme.  While it makes sense to put in applications and prepare, we must be fair to people because this might be their only hope of funding the purchase of a home.  The sooner we see the specific allocations for the local authorities in 2019, the better.  Next week, we are into April, which is the fourth month of 2019, so there is a certain urgency here.  I am not suggesting the Minister or Government is not treating this matter with urgency but it would be helpful given the importance of this issue and the fact that it will be raised on the doors by many people in local election campaigns.  It would be very helpful if the details of the scheme could be released as soon as possible.  I thank the Minister of State for his very helpful information.</p></speech>

Thankfully, it has been a very successful scheme.  I have been fortunate to be able to assist a number of constituents in making applications, which have been successful.  It is an indication of the ambition of our people to build or acquire their own home.  This is a very important tool in the arsenal of opportunities we offer in securing permanent housing for the future.  The message I would like to see go out loud and clear from this discussion is that it is not a case of whether local authorities will receive funding.  It is a case of when they will receive funding and what the scale of it will be.  I would tell anybody contemplating making an application that the scheme remains open, all local authorities have been instructed to continue to receive and process applications and people should not have any doubt as to the Government's commitment to sustaining the scheme in the future.</p></speech>

I have been involved in this matter for the past few years.  This vibrant school has nearly 550 students, a teaching population of just over 40 and a history on the site going back to 1941.  It is a unique campus in many ways.  It also had a boarding element, which ceased in 2005 and, as a result, one building has been left idle.  This building is the reason I have raised this Commencement matter.  It is a unique structure in the middle of the campus that is unfortunately lying idle.  It dates back many years and it is planned to redevelop it.  The building has great potential to meet the educational requirements of Clonakilty, particularly those of Sacred Heart secondary school.</p> <p>This State has a history of having prefabricated buildings on site.  Prefabs have been on this site for more than a decade.  Approximately &euro;1 million has been spent on prefabs in Clonakilty over the past 12 years.  This is unfortunate when one considers that this money could have been put to much better use redeveloping the old boarding school building in the heart of the site.</p> <p>I am trying to get movement on this project, which is part of the ADAPT programme.  It will involve having outside consultants run the redevelopment of the boarding school campus.  Progress is needed on the project.  Clonakilty is a busy and thriving town.  Population growth has been immense in the past decade.  The county development plan has predicted many more thousands of people will move to this vibrant town.  We need an education campus that will meet the town's future population needs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The need is there and the building is there.  The funds to redevelop that unique building should be advanced in order that the Sacred Heart school in Clonakilty can develop and flourish as it needs.</p><p>I ask the Minister of State to provide an update on the ADAPT programme, where the school fits into the programme and when a project manager will be appointed.  The external project manager who will run the project is a key element in ensuring it is delivered.  This redevelopment has been talked about for generations.  In the light of &euro;1 million, unfortunately, having been spent prefabs for the school over the past decade, the need for movement on this project is very evident.  We cannot just put money into a dead end such as prefabs.  Rather, we must reinvest in this beautiful campus such that the school can flourish as it has since 1941.</p></speech>

It provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Seanad the current position in regard to the major building project for the Sacred Heart Secondary School in Clonakilty.</p> <p>A building project for the school is included in the Department of Education and Skills six-year construction programme.  That is a significant first hurdle to get over.  A project brief has been finalised and will provide an extension with refurbishment to cater for 600 pupils in the long-term projected enrolment.  As the Senator stated, the project will be delivered via the ADAPT programme, which is an innovative delivery programme first introduced by the Department in 2016.  It uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the respective design teams on each project.  In this regard, a tender competition is in train to establish a project manager framework, which is essentially a list of potential project managers with the skills and capacity to deliver on the project.  That framework is expected to be in place shortly.  Tenders have been returned by potential project managers and are being evaluated.  Once established, the framework will be used to appoint a project manager for the ADAPT programme following a further tender exercise specific to ADAPT.  The Department of Education and Skills wrote to the school on 19 March 19 to provide an update on the status of this project.</p></speech>

It is a very vibrant space of which we are very proud.  It is important that there be movement on this project.  The update by the Minister of State is very helpful.  It is about trying to keep momentum behind the project.  As soon as the ADAPT project manager is appointed, we will see significant movement.  It is very important that we get a project manager in place in the next few weeks or months in order to be able to drive this very important project forward.</p></speech>

These are two super clubs and it is unfortunate that they have been pitted against each other due to the development of lands at Dolphin Park.  The real issue is that the Kevin's club has genuine concerns that it will not have access to pitches it currently has access to.  The club was set up in 1903 or before that because the records go back quite a long time.  The club provides services to inner city kids, who are the most disadvantaged kids in the country.  The club does not have its own home pitch so must rely on the Templeogue Synge Street GAA Club with which it has a very good relationship.</p> <p>A row is brewing and I appeal to the president of the GAA to get involved and find a meaningful way to resolve this issue.  This is very serious and the local community is very upset but I believe a solution can be found if there is a bit of pragmatism and the powers that be get involved.  Ultimately, the Kevin's club seeks a home site.  It is probably the biggest parish in the country in terms of the number of young people that does not have its own pitch.  Club members always have to travel outside of their home grounds and use other people's pitches as their home pitch, which is a real travesty as the Kevin's club is probably one of the only hurling clubs in the inner city.  These youths should be encouraged and supported but at the moment, as politicians, we have really neglected them.  I would like this issue put on the record of the House.</p> <p>I wish to draw the attention of Senators to the fact that this is Organ Donor Awareness Week.  I appeal to people to talk to their families and friends about organ donation and urge them to have a discussion.  I am an organ donor and it is on the record of this House that I would like all my organs used if anything happened to me.  If anyone wants to get an organ donor card he or she can contact the Irish Kidney Association.  It is vital that we all have a conversation about organ donation.</p> <p>When will the newly established Legal Service Regulatory Authority issue guidelines on limited liability partnerships, LLPs, for solicitors?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many solicitors have spoken to me about this.

Chonaic m&eacute; tuarasc&aacute;il &oacute;n Economic and Social Research Institute.  The ESRI published a report on small and medium size enterprises, SMEs, in the past couple of days.  Short-term loans are decreasing in number, the number of credit rejections on short-term loans is increasing, lending conditions are tighter and interest rates are increasing.  Large companies face an interest rate on new loans of 1.92%, which is 60 basis points higher than the European average.  Large Irish companies are paying higher interest rates.  I am passionate about SMEs and I know everybody here believes in business, particularly small and medium size enterprises.  SMEs constitute the cro&iacute; or heart of Ireland.  The ESRI survey shows that Irish firms face an interest rate of 4.29% compared with a European average of 2.24%.  This is captured by data by loans of less than &euro;250,000.  The interest rate being paid on loans by SMEs in Ireland is almost double the European rate.  The euro interbank offered rate, EURIBOR, is negative.  This means that the amount of money in loans given from one bank to another is negative.  One bank is paying another bank to take the money.  That means there is roughly 4% profit for the banks.  I remind the House that during the days of the Celtic tiger, banks were making a margin of between 1% and 1.5%, not between 4% and 4.5%.  I applaud the Government for its efforts to help SMEs, particularly with the Brexit loans, but we need to review how effective that is.  The direction is good.  It is positive and great effort is being made.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland published its report yesterday agus is fi&uacute; &eacute; sin a l&eacute;amh.

It is a great initiative and I thank Treasa and C&aacute;it for organising it.  It is hugely important that we can all speak our native tongue.</p> <p>I want to challenge the remarks made by the Taoiseach at the weekend when he dismissed out of hand the idea that the ESB and existing infrastructure could be used to deliver broadband.  I want to know if his colleagues in this Chamber share his views in this regard because I believe that not only is he wrong about this, his arrogance and dismissal of the proposal, which is getting increasing support, shows that the Taoiseach was never in touch with rural Ireland in the first place.  I know he mentioned Belmullet in his speech but he needs to do more than namecheck places to make us believe he has an understanding of the issues in rural Ireland.  Why can we not use ESB poles for fibre broadband?  What does the Taoiseach think is already hanging from the poles?</p> <p>The Taoiseach has also said that broadband simply has to be underground.  This is nonsense.  Households and businesses in Mayo are incensed by this statement.  We cannot see how the Taoiseach can be so dismissive of a workable solution while in the very same interview he openly admitted that the project will cost many multiples of the original &euro;500 million.</p> <p>A large number of Government Deputies used the broadband issue when asking for votes in the previous general election, claiming that only a Fine Gael-led Government could deliver such a key element of business.  Come the next election, there will be a very quick test to see if that promise has been delivered upon.  The Government cannot claim credit for any private companies because we must also take affordability into the supply of broadband.  People will have a very easy test.  When they turn on their computers and try to download a design plan, upload agricultural forms, get a map or do whatever needs to be done on a computer with Government Departments, they can see how fast that happens and how long they must wait.  I am asking for the Minister to come to the House with an open mind to listen to all options for delivering this plan.  That is the only solution.  At the weekend, the Taoiseach effectively told rural Ireland to wait and trust him but we can wait no longer and I do not think many people believe him, never mind trust him, on this issue.  Broadband will be judged on whether it is delivered.  Promise after promise for decades is just not good enough any more in rural Ireland.  This Government will stand or fall on the issue of broadband, particularly in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I would like to move an amendment to the Order of Business, that No. 15 be taken before No. 1 today.  No. 15 is a Bill I am proposing on the preparation and award of contracts by public authorities and utility undertakings.  This Bill will help put quality and joined-up thinking deeper into the procurement process in Ireland.  In recent months and years, we have seen a number of controversies that have highlighted the problems with current procurement practices and culture.  However, this Bill is not simply about those problems.  It is also about the immense positive potential our procurement has.  When we spend public money, we have the power to get great public benefit and to ensure that any moneys spent give us not only the best economic return but also social, environmental and other benefits.  My Bill will address the current practice of lowest cost bidding.  Lowest cost bidding is one option that any procurement official will face.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My Bill will include price-quality ratio in the designing of contracts so that their administration on the basis of both price and quality will be the default option, and that while lowest cost will still be an option, it will require sign-off from a senior official and the publication of a rationale.</p><p>The national development plan, NDP, through which the Government is spending billions of euro, involves once in a generation, sometimes once in a lifetime, projects.  I am setting a target of 50% quality on any NDPs.  Exceptions can be made, but those exceptions must be justified.  The Bill will empower procurement officials to deliver more for the public from how its money is spent.</p><p>The Bill also empowers the Minister to set out guidelines which bring together our commitments on climate change, the rights of persons with a disability and all of the established policies and existing obligations, and encourages procurement officials to think about that bigger picture when they are designing a procurement contract.</p><p>I believe this would be a positive and constructive contribution that would make a tangible difference.  Public procurement affects the most intimate parts of people's lives here in Ireland as well as shaping the way that we design our future.</p><p>I am hopeful that all parties in this House will be supportive of the Bill.  I hope to bring it forward to Second Stage on Wednesday next and I will be asking for the Senators' support at that point.

I met a group of parents in north Dublin this morning regarding class places for children with special needs, in particular, autism.  This is something that this House could do some work on.  It is a topic I raise frequently.  The issue partly is that it falls between the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health, and children and parents are falling between those two stools.  Perhaps the Leader could facilitate a debate with the Minister for Education and Skills to discuss the availability of places for children and the entire process that parents go through.  Once they get a diagnosis at an early age, they are given a list of schools to apply to and it is pot luck as to whether they get a place.  In a spirit of co-operation and bipartisanship, we could facilitate that discussion and talk about not only the immediacy of the issue for these particular parents but how the system could be enhanced and improved.  There are lengthy waiting lists as well for early intervention for children across north Dublin and I am sure that is replicated throughout the country.  While we have made advances in this area, there is much more to do.  I would appreciate the opportunity to have that debate.</p> <p>I would also appreciate the opportunity to have a debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport regarding the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, although this important issue is up for discussion at an Oireachtas joint committee meeting in two weeks.  The House should have a say on how the public money is being spent by the FAI.  I am fast coming to the conclusion that a change will only happen if the Government decides to withhold funding from the association.  That would be the nuclear option but when one thinks of how important this game is for many people in Ireland, and when one thinks of disadvantaged communities that love this game, the power of the game and how poorly it is being run, the question marks over the financial arrangements within the FAI, and the fact that the former CEO can be given a new position within the organisation, significant corporate governance issues need to be addressed.  I am not sure whether the Oireachtas joint committee can get to the bottom of everything because there are many matters on its plate.  If we were to have a discussion in this Chamber with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I would suggest that perhaps it is time for the State to do what it can possibly most powerfully do and threaten to withhold funding from the FAI on the basis that it does not justify the funding that it gets.  If they were to get their house in order and put a new regime in place to put children and players at the centre of what they do for the betterment of the game in Ireland, they would justify their funding and, in fact, they would justify much more funding in future.  I ask for that debate as well.</p></speech>

NASRA, which represents more than 600 ambulance personnel, currently falls under the umbrella of the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA.  This group of workers within the healthcare system want to have their own union and the HSE does not want them to.  They have held two strikes in the past couple of months and the issue needs to be dealt with.  Ambulance service workers are an integral part of the health system.  They not only provide an emergency response service and deal with the most gruesome situations on some occasions, but they also provide an essential service on a daily basis for the health service.  Many of these workers are highly-trained paramedics and highly qualified.  I urge the HSE to do the right thing and recognise their union.  They have unique issues to themselves which set them apart from other interests of workers within the health service.  I have spoken with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, regarding the issue and I have pressed him to resolve it.  I have every confidence that he will take this issue by the scruff of the neck with a view to having it resolved in the short term.  I look forward to meeting some of these workers later.  It is a worthwhile ask that they are making and they should be supported.  It is a reasonable request.</p></speech>

I will not name him in deference to the House's rules.  He is being kept on in the FAI in another role and it is my belief that he is being kept on in that role to facilitate him getting a position on UEFA.  The FAI must not allow this to happen while a cloud hangs over this man's head.  I do not say that the man has done anything wrong but let us know exactly the full story before Ireland is represented at UEFA level by somebody who we may not want in the position.</p> <p>I have spoken on many occasions in this House about the use of cybertechnology in bullying Trump-like or, to a certain degree, childish behaviour and I was deeply disappointed last weekend to find the Government party using an image of the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il wagging his finger.  It is beneath politics.  It is all good for us to have a robust engagement in this House with one another but when one starts using images, it brings us down to the level of schoolchildren.  It is the epitome of cyberbullying.  It is wrong, in every sense of the word.  I am not saying it because it is the Fine Gael Party, which I hold in great esteem.  Nobody in politics should ever use images like that to criticise somebody else in politics.  One can get up and say all one wants.  One does not have to use these images.  We do not have to go to the extremes that we complain about members of the public going to when they refer to us.  It is beneath us.  It is beneath politics.  The Taoiseach should come out and apologise, not necessarily to the Fianna F&aacute;il Party but to the country for stooping to the levels that we would not expect of any decent citizen in this country.</p></speech>

It is interesting that we now have more savings than borrowings, which is a good.  The question arises as to how best to use the savings to benefit those who require money to buy their own homes or apartments.  I am not sure we are doing sufficient work in this area, particularly for those on lower incomes who need access to local authority funding.</p><p>I had a case recently concerning somebody who applied to Cork City Council in February 2018 for a loan to buy a house in which they had already been living for 17 or 18 years.  They are now nearly paying more rent because of their earnings than what they would pay on borrowings.  It took until October 2018 before they got a reply about their loan application.  That was eight or nine months later.  That is not the way to deal with a loan application.  I have heard of a number of other cases in which there are considerable delays in the assessment by local authorities of applications by people who are genuinely trying to move on and take the step to look after their own affairs and who are prepared to buy and look after their own property.  Our local authorities are not doing enough.</p><p>It is about time we had a debate in this House on how we can improve circumstances for those in the middle income group who cannot borrow from the private sector but who should be supported through the local authority system.  I ask that we have a debate on this matter to determine whether we can bring about some changes.</p></speech>

This morning, there were 45 patients on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  That is a relatively good result.  Last week, the number was 76.  It was last week that management in University Hospital Limerick announced it was closing another ward, containing 17 more beds.  It beggars belief when the hospital consistently has the highest number of patients on trolleys in the country, day after day and week after week.  What makes it even worse is that hospital management insists it has been inclusive in talking to staff about these matters.  One can see from statements from the INMO and SIPTU that, far from being included, they have been disregarded.  At a meeting on 9 January, it was confirmed to union officials that University Hospital Limerick had a deficit of 59 nurses, who would be required to reach the minimum nursing staff complement.</p> <p>Since 9 January, things have got worse.  My colleagues in the hospital have told me that, week after week, more nurses are resigning and voting with their feet because the conditions are absolutely intolerable in the hospital.  The optimum capacity of the hospital is 85% but it is currently working at 110%.  It is operating at a capacity of 110% although there was a shortfall of 59 nurses in January.  The hospital believes the best idea is to close another ward.  It is an absolute disgrace.</p> <p>I have been raising the incompetence and poor management of University Hospital Limerick for well over a year here.  I have asked for ministerial intervention and have written to the Minister, and I have received absolutely nothing in reply.  My colleague, Deputy Maurice Quinlivan, always tells me how frustrated he is because when he puts parliamentary questions to the Minister, he does not even turn up to answer them.  I call again for an urgent debate on this issue and ministerial intervention before matters get even worse in our local hospital in Limerick.</p></speech>

I regard them mainly as an extension of the abuse of power in the first place.  It was well over a year ago that I asked for a debate on the abuse of power within the workplace.  Having come from the launch of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission's dignity and respect policy, I believe some of the issues associated with non-disclosure agreements being used and sexual harassment and bullying in the workplace could be discussed as part of a debate on that policy.</p> <p>I am working on legislation banning the use of non-disclosure agreements.  It would be positive to have a debate before it is introduced.  The Cathaoirleach, in his contribution, talked about raising awareness to understand how one&rsquo;s behaviour affects others and whether it falls into the categories of bullying and harassment.  Having a debate on the policy would be a good place to start.  Will the Leader consider scheduling a debate on the policy of the Oireachtas?</p></speech>

These doctors were prevented from doing so by the HSE.  Why are we allowing circumstances in which we keep throwing away much-needed money?  There are doctors willing to ensure continuity of care for patients but the HSE prefers to employ locums at a large cost.  I read yesterday in <i>The Medical Independent</i>that the national average annual cost to the HSE for GMS GP locums is &euro;262,000, and that last year the HSE employed at least 11 GMS GP locums nationally as part of an effort to provide cover for 22 vacant GMS GP panels.  According to the article, the HSE stated 176 GMS GPs were awarded contracts under the scheme in 2018 while 101 GMS GPs retired.  I would like the Leader to call on the Minister to come to the House to explain why we are not using common sense.  I will most likely be told by the HSE that it is struggling to fill vacant GMS panels with a permanent GP following Government cuts but I urge the saving of money where an offer is made to take on a list.  I want the Minister to come to this House.</p><p>We have heard reports of people on trolleys again and of wards closing.  I have even heard people tell me that they cannot get an extra pillow because there are none in hospitals now.  It is now at the stage where one is lucky if one has a pillow.  If one asks for another, one is told there are none.  We need to have the Minister in here and make the HSE accountable for decisions it is making.</p></speech>

It is a beautiful park in Salthill between the two hotels at the end of the promenade.  It is really worth a visit.  It was initiated by parents whose only child, an organ donor, was killed in an accident.  I certainly endorse what was said about organ donation.  We should all be donors.</p></speech>

It is a vile practice designed to suppress, change or eliminate a person's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression.  The practice has been condemned and discredited by the UN Committee Against Torture, European Parliament and Irish Council for Psychotherapy.  On 6 March, the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy released a statement that condemned the practice of so-called conversion therapy.  This was in the aftermath of a screening of "Once Gay: Matthew and Friends" in Townsend Street Presbyterian Church in west Belfast.

In recent days, I have been contacted by a number of business owners in Clones, County Monaghan, who have received documentation relating to the revaluation of the rates for their properties.  Unfortunately, it has come as a great disappointment to and caused concern among them that many of them will face substantial increases in their rates bills, possibly for next year.  They are so concerned that they held a meeting in Clones last night to discuss the matter.  I understand that staff of the Valuation Office who are currently operating in County Monaghan are available to meet business owners.  That is a positive development and the process is ongoing.</p> <p>Senators know only too well that there are many towns and villages in which small shops, bars and restaurants are closing their doors.  The problem is particularly acute in the Border counties.  I am concerned that the Valuation Office uses a methodology to calculate rates that is based on the rental income of particular properties.  That might be a useful tool and a barometer for a large provincial town but it is not for a small town such as Clones and many like it throughout the country.</p> <p>We all have concerns about Brexit.  Stark reports are coming out on a daily basis about fears over what might become reality for many of us after Brexit, no matter what kind of Brexit we get.  No counties will be more affected than those in the Border region.  I call for this process of revaluation of commercial properties throughout counties Monaghan and Cavan, and indeed the other Border counties, to be suspended until we know where we are going in the context of Brexit.  Many business owners in Border areas have serious concerns over what the future will hold for them and the last thing they need is a rate increase on top of the uncertainty of Brexit.  For that reason, I respectfully request that the Valuation Office suspend the process until we know what Brexit is going to look like.</p></speech>

I am conscious that many of us wonder whether to talk about this and how to do so.  I am mindful of the many people who are suffering as a result of a family member taking his or her own life.  This is a serious problem and we must talk about it and keep it on the agenda.  In <i>Mayo News </i>lately, the coroner for north Mayo, Dr. Eleanor Fitzgerald, commented that the number of suicides she was dealing with was alarming.  She said:</p><blockquote>The suicide increases in Mayo, including young people, is alarming.  Up to 50 percent of inquests held are because of self-inflicted injuries and suicide ... It is disheartening to see young people give up on life.</blockquote> <p>The Galway coroner, Dr. Ciaran McLoughlin, reported in <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>earlier this month that a recently held inquest dealt with five suicides, including that of a young teenage boy.  There are often suicide attempts in the waterways of Galway city and suicides late at night when people who need support and may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol take that final, tragic, utterly mistaken decision.  Indeed, every few days there seem to be reports of people entering the waterways in Galway, with a number of tragic and untimely deaths in the past few weeks alone.</p><p>There is an initiative in Galway whereby local people are asking Galway City Council to take proactive steps to increase the chances of survival for a person who jumps into the River Corrib in Galway or someone who falls in accidentally.  We know that many people who attempt or commit suicide can change their minds.  The reality is that if that person has entered a certain part of the river in Galway, even if he or she instantly regrets his or her course of action, his or her chances of getting to safety are low given that the river is so fast-flowing.  A petition has been signed by nearly 30,000 people asking Galway City Council to introduce some measures including safety nets along the walkways along the river and ropes across the river that a person being swept along at speed might be able to reach out for.  The petition calls for safety ladders at regular intervals and sensors.  There are a good number of life rings along the walkway, I am talking about the section of the river from the Salmon Weir Bridge to the Wolfe Tone Bridge in particular.  The council is to be commended on the provision of those rings but more must be done.  Nets and ropes can be implemented at minimal cost.  I urge the council to address this as a matter of priority.</p><p>Organisations such as Limerick Suicide Watch deserve huge support and credit.  The National Suicide Prevention Office and the Connecting for Life programme, which seeks to reduce suicides by 2020 via seven goals, are good but more focus is needed.  Our colleague, Senator Freeman, has led the way in providing support services for persons contemplating suicide through Pieta House and many of us are involved in the Darkness Into Light event in May.  I raise this matter in the knowledge that colleagues will agree that suicide prevention and constant attention to providing more and better support services must be a priority for Government and at local authority level.  I worry about the impact of recent cost excesses in other areas of the national budget.  I am calling on Galway City Council in particular to take heed of the people who are calling for further safety features along the River Corrib.</p></speech>

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing our generation.  Schoolchildren were marching last week about this issue and it is as much about current generations as future ones.  I attended a public meeting, along with many others, in the South Court Hotel in Limerick regarding an incinerator being built in Mongret by Irish Cement.  There was a large turnout.  This is something I feel strongly about and I do not think the incinerator should go ahead.  I am more interested, in the context of climate change, in the fact that the particular licence application for the incinerator is before the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  I am really concerned about the reform of the latter.  The planning permission for the building of the physical structure is given by the local authority prior to the matter being looked at by the EPA for the granting of the licence.  That is putting the cart before the horse.  The licence for the operation of any form of incinerator or facility of that nature should effectively be adjudicated upon by the licensing authority for the operation of such a facility, which is the EPA, prior to the grant of planning being given by the local authority for the physical structure.  Furthermore, it is my understanding that the local authority, Limerick City and County Council, would be unable to give permission for the physical structure if they have any environmental concerns.  There is a contradiction there.  A local authority is unable to grant permission for a physical structure if it has any environmental concerns and yet it can give that grant prior to the licence being applied for with the EPA which is involved in the operation and adjudication on the environmental concerns.</p> <p>I want to see a number of things happen, the first of which is reform of the EPA whereby if a facility is in any way burning alternative fuels, the EPA, as licensing authority, would have to adjudicate on it before the application goes before the local authority, like Limerick City or County Council, for planning permission.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Second, the monitoring side of the EPA's remit is important.

I suppose it is a legacy of the past, when the banks gave out too much money.  Now there is the threat of Brexit.  It is important, as Senator Colm Burke stated, that we hold a group of people in our minds and allow them to access finance, whether for home improvement or home loans.

Let me inform the House that 1.73 million people have access to broadband, which represents an increase of 2.2%, and 1.43 million, or 87.4% of those, have access to fixed broadband.  We are all conscious of the fact that there is a group of people who have poor broadband or no broadband at all.  Under the national broadband plan, the Government is committed to delivering broadband, but it is important we understand that there are parts of rural Ireland where the procurement and installation of broadband will raise a significant challenge because of the remoteness of those areas.  We cannot deny that.  As politicians, we need to stop being populist about everything and instead be real with people.</p> <p>I would be happy to have Senator Higgins's Bill accepted today.  I congratulate her on the matter and look forward to having a debate on it.  The Bill, to be fair to the Senator, has much merit.  We might not all agree on everything in it, but there is a lot that is positive in the Bill.  I hope the Government will support it.  I will certainly advocate for it.  Again, we have this illusion that the lowest price paid for everything represents the best option when that is not the case.  We need to have that conversation as well, and I look forward to a debate in the House in that regard and thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised the very important issue of school places for special needs children and young children on the autism spectrum.  Students are falling between both parts of the education system, and services need to be improved.  I would very much welcome a debate on this and will be happy to facilitate it.</p> <p>Senators &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Craughwell referred to the FAI and corporate governance, if I may use that phrase.  I note that the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport met this morning and I think it is now 10 April that Sports Ireland and, subsequently, the FAI will come before the committee.  I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to have a debate on corporate governance and value for money in sport.  I will make one comment to Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in response to his comment on the withholding of funding.  I served on the marketing committee of Croke Park and I was a chairman of my own club and a county board officer.  In withholding money, one penalises the grassroots of the FAI, the men and women, the volunteers in particular, and those who work at low-paid-----</p></speech>

I am a little worried in this case that one would hinder the work being done in the FAI.  However, I think the overarching point being made by Senators Craughwell and &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in is one we all support, that is, that proper answers need to be given to questions that have been asked in the public domain.  The committee will have its opportunity to discuss the matter and we can have a debate on sport in this House.

We all commend him on his Bill, and we commend the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, on working with him and with all of us to ensure that conversion therapy is outlawed in our country.  It has no place, it is of no value and, as the Senator said, it leads to difficult health outcomes.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher mentioned the Valuation Office and the issue of revaluation.  He will find commonality with me on this.  The office must explain its work.  It has been going on since 2001.  I checked before I came into the Chamber and found that by last year fewer than two thirds of local authorities had completed their rates evaluation process.  The Senator is right.  There is an obligation on local authorities and on Valuation Office to work with small and medium enterprises, shopkeepers and retailers to ensure that added pressure is not put on them.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter. </p> <p>Senator Mullen raised the sensitive and important issue of suicide.  He mentioned the efforts being made in Galway and many other parts of the country to work with people and ensure that there is someone to meet or to talk to at key points.  In the city of Cork, where I live, street pastors go out to talk and engage at very unusual times of the night, visiting places where people gather and where some have been known to end their lives.  It is a very valuable service.  I would be happy for the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to come to the House to discuss this matter.  It is something on which the National Office for Suicide Prevention has been working.  The HSE has been very proactive in the matter at both local and national level, but it is something we can never take for granted.  We must pursue and advance this issue. </p> <p>Finally, Senator O'Donnell raised the issue of climate action.  We will have a debate on this when the committee report is published.  I will also have the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment come to the House to discuss reform of the EPA.</p> <p>I would be very happy to take Senator Higgins' amendment to the Order of Business. </p></speech>

I have worked closely with the Minister to bring this Bill before the Oireachtas and I look forward to our discussion of its provisions here today.</p> <p>The principal objective of this Bill is to provide further protections for homeowners in mortgage arrears who are facing the prospect of repossession proceedings.  It does so by broadening the range of matters that a court must take into account when deciding whether to grant a possession order to a lending institution in respect of a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence.  For this purpose, the Bill proposes to insert a new section in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013.  This Bill, which has its genesis in a Private Members&rsquo; Bill I initiated prior to my appointment as Minister of State, will, I believe, prove to be an important addition to the suite of Government measures to protect those who find themselves in mortgage arrears and are facing the prospect of court proceedings for repossession of their homes.  I am sure everyone in this House will agree with me that repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence should be a last resort when all other possible remedies have failed.  </p> <p>This Government remains committed to helping borrowers in mortgage arrears to remain in their homes wherever possible.  Moving to the main provisions of this Bill, I want to stress that the Government&rsquo;s objective is to broaden the range of matters that a court must take into account when deciding whether to grant a possession order to a lending institution in respect of a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence.  The court may also take this broader range of matters into account where, for whatever reason, efforts to secure a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, have failed or where, despite the borrower&rsquo;s participation in a scheme designed to enable borrowers with mortgage arrears to remain in their home, the court repossession proceedings have continued.</p> <p>As required by Articles 127(4) and 282(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Central Bank, ECB, has been consulted on the Bill&rsquo;s proposals.  The ECB published its opinion of 18 February on its website.  Section 1 contains a definition of the Act of 2013, which is required for technical reasons, while section 2 makes a number of technical, consequential amendments to section 2 of that Act.  Section 3 is the key section of the Bill and inserts a new section 2A, containing nine subsections, into the Act of 2013.  Subsection (1) defines the scope of this new section.  </p> <p>The Bill&rsquo;s provisions will not only apply to those cases in which the court has previously adjourned proceedings under section 2 of the 2013 Act in respect of the borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence.  It will also apply in cases where, prior to or following commencement of the proceedings the borrower has already engaged the services of a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, to assist in the resolution of his or her mortgage arrears, or the borrower has participated in good faith in a scheme designed to enable indebted borrowers to remain in their homes.  </p> <p>This means that section 2A will apply in the following: proceedings where the court had already adjourned the proceedings of its own motion under section 2(2)(a) of the 2013 Act but notwithstanding such adjournment there is no resulting PIA; where the court refused to adjourn proceedings in response to a request of one of the parties under section 2(2)(b) of the 2013 Act, or did adjourn them and notwithstanding such adjournment, there is no resulting PIA; and proceedings which have not been adjourned under section 2 of the 2013 Act but the borrower has, prior to the court hearing, participated in good faith in a scheme to assist borrowers in mortgage distress to remain in his or her home or engaged the services of a PIP to assist him or her to resolve his or her mortgage arrears difficulties and despite such engagement, there is no resulting PIA.  </p> <p>Subsection (2) provides that when considering whether to make, or refuse to make, an order for possession in repossession proceedings in respect of a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence, a court must take account of the matters referred to in subsection (3).  The court may also do so when considering whether to grant any other order it considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case, for example, in an adjournment, or further adjournment, of the proceedings.  Subsection (3) specifies the matters that the court must take account of in considering whether to make or refuse to make a possession order.  The court must take the following into account.  </p> <p>Subparagraph (a) provides that the court must consider whether the making of the possession order would be proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.  In providing for this matter, the legislation recognises the essential role of the court in balancing the interests of both the borrower and the lender when considering whether to make or refuse to make an order for possession.  Subparagraph (b) provides that the court must always take into account the circumstances of the borrower and any dependents.  Subparagraph (c) provides that the court must take into account whether the lending institution has made a statement to the borrower of the terms on which it would be prepared to settle the arrears problem in such a way that the borrower and his or her dependents could remain in their home.  Subparagraph (d) makes it clear that the court must consider the details of any proposal put forward by or on behalf of the borrower, whether prior to or following commencement of the proceedings, which would enable him or her, and any dependents, to remain in the home or, alternatively, to secure other accommodation. </p> <p>The Minister for Justice and Equality has asked me to stress that consideration of proposals which would allow the borrower to remain in his or her home will include examination of any proposal for participation by the borrower in a scheme to assist persons in mortgage distress to remain in his or her principal private residence.  Subparagraph (e) provides that the court must take into account the response, if any, of the lender to the borrower&rsquo;s proposal to remain in his or her home.  This will place an onus on lenders to engage in a constructive manner with any proposals made by the borrower.  Finally, subparagraph (f) relates to the conduct of the parties in any attempt to find a resolution to the borrower&rsquo;s mortgage arrears difficulties.  The provision makes it clear that the court must take account of a lending institution&rsquo;s refusal or reluctance to engage in attempts to find a resolution of the mortgage arrears problem, and also of any borrower&rsquo;s refusal to engage in a meaningful and constructive manner with the lending institution in order to find such a resolution. </p> <p>Subsection (4) specifies certain additional information that the court may take into account when considering whether the making of an order for possession would be proportionate in all the circumstances of the case.  These include the overall amount of debt outstanding on the mortgage concerned, the level of arrears due on foot of the mortgage concerned and the advised market value of the principal private residence at the date on which the legal proceedings commenced.  I should add that the Minister has provided a definition of &ldquo;advised market value&rdquo;, AMV, in subsection (9).  This definition, based on the corresponding definition in section 2 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, will ensure that the market value of the property is valued in a professional, objective manner.  This AMV must be provided by the holder of a current licence issued by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, under that Act.  Subsection (5) has a technical purpose; it clarifies that the fact that there is no PIA in a case may arise because a proposal for a PIA has not been made, or such a proposal has been made but the procedure has ended without a successful outcome.</p> <p>Subsection (6) identifies the circumstances in which, under the Insolvency Act 2012, the PIA procedure is considered to have ended.  The procedure will be considered to have ended: where a PIP has prepared a proposal for a PIA and the debtor has consented to that proposal and the calling of a creditors&rsquo; meeting, but that meeting does not take place before the expiry of the protective certificate as set out in section 106(3) of the 2012 Act; where, under section 108(8)(b), at the taking of a vote at a creditors&rsquo; meeting regarding a PIA proposal, the proposal is not approved by a majority of creditors in accordance with section 110 or deemed to be approved, and the PIA procedure has terminated; and where, in a case under section 11A, there is only one creditor and the creditor does not approve the proposal under section 11A(8), or the personal insolvency practitioner fails to give the creditor a written notice of the proposal before the expiry of the protective certificate under section 11A(9).<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2454"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2454&amp;amp;pid=KevinBoxerMoran&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will also be considered to have ended where the court upholds an objection to the PIA under section 120 and the process is deemed to come to an end in accordance with section 114(3); where, under section 115A(9), the court refuses to make an order confirming the coming into effect of the proposed PIA following a court review under section 115A; or where the debtor is in arrears with his or her payments for a period of six months of the PIA and it is deemed to have failed under section 123.</p><p>Subsection (7) permits the Minister for Justice and Equality to designate a scheme for the purposes of subsection (1)(c)(i) and subsection (3)(d)(i).  Any such scheme would have to comply with the following conditions: the objective of the designated scheme must be to provide those borrowers with mortgage arrears difficulties in respect of their homes with assistance that is reasonably likely to enable them to address these difficulties and facilitate, as far as possible, their remaining in their homes; and that it is reasonably likely that such assistance will, in fact, be provided under the scheme.  Subsection (8) provides that an advised market value must be set out in a statement provided by the licensee under the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011.  Subsection (9) is a standard provision containing a number of relevant definitions for the purposes of this new section.</p><p>Finally, section 4 contains standard provisions relating to the Short Title, collective citation and commencement provisions.</p><p>On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I wish to underline again the importance of this short Bill.  When enacted, it will provide important additional protections for borrowers by broadening the range of matters that a court must take into account when deciding whether to grant a possession order to a lender in respect of a borrower&rsquo;s home.  The position of the Government has been and continues to be that repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s principal private residence must always be a remedy of last resort.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

It is happy to support any measures that will, in principle, help distressed mortgage holders.  It is welcome that the purpose of the Bill is to broaden the scope of matters that courts must take into account.  We believe that loans should not be sold to vulture funds.  Such practices are causing great distress to people across the country.  Apart from this Bill - with the greatest of respect to the Minister of State, I believe Fine Gael is advancing it to appease him - the Government has practically abandoned distressed mortgage holders across the country.  All Members are aware of such situations from people in our constituencies and hearing awful stories of people in great distress.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il brought forward legislation to regulate vulture funds for the first time in this country which was signed into law in late 2018.  However, more progress needs to be made on the insolvency regime side.  In the absence of a fair and functioning regime, it is the courts and not the Government which offer some bit of protection to distressed mortgage holders.  Fianna F&aacute;il has brought forward a Bill which would remove the veto which banks currently hold and establish a mortgage resolutions office which would provide fair and sustainable solutions to mortgage holders and allow those making a real effort to pay their mortgage to stay in their home.  That is the only solution in the absence of proper social housing building across the country.  That is the real nub of this issue.  People are staying in their homes and trying to work through their mortgage distress because they have no alternative; they do not want to be out on the streets with their children.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes the Government needs to make substantial progress in that regard.</p></speech>

He has become a regular visitor here.  As far as I am aware, although I am open to correction, he is the only Minister or Minister of State in my eight years in this House to have initiated a Bill prior to entering office and then come to the House to bring it over the line.  This is the second time in a matter of weeks that the Minister of State has had that unique distinction.  That is a phenomenal achievement because it comes from having a finger on the pulse of the people who need the help of politicians and the Government more than anybody else, those who do the right thing, engage, embrace the system, talk to banks but find themselves in the awful position of not being co-operated with.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Clifford-Lee in regard to vulture funds.  What went on in this country was appalling whereby we allowed banks to sell to vulture funds which had no compunction whatsoever in terms of how they dealt with people.  They lacked any kind of decency or humanity.  The vast majority of people who end up in such situations want to do the right thing as best they can.  The Bill proposes giving them the protection of the State when they try to do the right thing.  It certainly does not accommodate those who refuse to engage or are trying to circumvent the system in some way.</p> <p>It is not a large Bill, but, as I often say, small is beautiful.  It will potentially make a phenomenal difference to people's lives in real terms.  I am delighted that Fianna F&aacute;il is not opposing the passage of the Bill on Second Stage.  I suspect none of our other honourable colleagues will do so either.  If there are issues that need to be looked at, that can be done on Committee Stage.  However, the genesis of what the Minister of State was trying to achieve in his Private Members' Bill and which the Government is now trying to achieve through this Bill is what we all should want to do as politicians.</p> <p>Irish people are very proud of their homes.  We have one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world per head of population.  People invest most of their hard-earned money into acquiring and maintaining a house which becomes a home.  Most people want to hold onto their home at all costs.  Financial institutions should not be allowed to unilaterally disregard the genuine efforts of decent, honourable, hardworking people who find themselves in a difficult situation.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to its passage through the House in the not-too-distant future, becoming law and being signed by the President.  There is not much more to say except that it is excellent legislation and I sincerely hope that it does not fly under the radar of the public and the media.  The media are discussing the work being done by the Government in responding to the needs of people.  Yes, we have a lot to do, but this legislation is responding to the needs of the most vulnerable in our society, those who could become homeless as a result of a lack of co-operation by financial institutions.  I wish the passage of the Bill every success.  I will certainly endeavour to ensure that there is no obstacle on the Fine Gael side to its passing through the House in as swift a time as possible.</p></speech>
