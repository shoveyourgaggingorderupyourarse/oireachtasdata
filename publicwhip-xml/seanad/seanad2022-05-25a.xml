    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#A00600"><p>I also welcome the Minister of State.  I thank her for taking the time to come in and deal with this issue.  For the record, the question is to ask the Minister of State whether the rate of pay for those who use their homes for the HSE boarding out scheme for elderly people under the boarding out regulations of 1993 could be increased in light of the increasing cost of living and associated costs of running this type of accommodation.  It is pretty self-explanatory from the conversation we have on a daily basis in every sector of society with the increased cost of living.</p> <p>I ask this question this morning specifically on behalf of Lisa and John Corroon in Ballinagore, who have a boarding out home that facilitates six residents.  Their residence is somewhat rural and would be five miles from the nearest town.  The cost of ferrying their residents to chiropody, physiotherapy and medical and dental appointments has, with the increase in diesel alone, not to mention those relating to food, heating the residence, etc., gone through the roof.  This is something of which we are all very much aware.</p> <p>The regulations were reviewed in 1993.  While they have been reviewed since, there has been no change to them.  The Corroons rate of pay from the HSE went nine years ago from &euro;90 per week to &euro;110 and then three quarters of the pension.  They are getting somewhere in the region of &euro;270 to &euro;280 per person per week.  That is one night in an average hotel with breakfast and none of the facilities they are covering.  They are unable to survive and continue.  That is evident by the fact that very limited numbers of people have availed of the boarding out scheme in recent years.  The numbers have dropped off.  These people take the maximum six residents, but some very quick and simple sums will tell the Minister of State that the saving by having those six people in this environment as opposed to in a nursing home is approximately one eighth of the cost, depending on what calculations one does.  We are looking at a difference of somewhere between &euro;8,000 to &euro;9,000 to &euro;50,000-odd per annum.  When you go to look this up, and when I was doing my research this morning, you find there is either very limited or very little information on the HSE website.  It is as if it is a secret.  It is almost as if it is not wanted because one must go trawling and scratching way below the surface to even find out the basic information.  It is as if it is not being promoted or literally not wanted.</p> <p>Another issue I encountered when I was doing my research is the fact that different community healthcare organisations, CHOs, have different policies and different payment rates.  This can cause a major issue for people who are on the borderline and maybe have residents who fall under the jurisdiction of two different CHOs.  They will actually be on different rates in the one residence or house.</p> <p>The kernel of the issue and the key question is that there would be a review of the payment structure.  As I said, there is a saving to the State.  The fact that it is a smaller facility with a maximum of six residents is very beneficial for our elderly people to be in those kinds of environments.  The people who approached me in the case I am using as an example are just one example of this kind of well-run, tight ship.  Their residents remain Covid-free.  That has been the acid test in all such environments over the last couple of years.  They are doing their very best.  As I said, they actually kept Covid-19 out of their residence.  That is how tight a ship they run.  For less than &euro;300 per week, however, they are finding it very hard to survive.  They are not making any money out of this; some of their own money is actually going in to keep the show on the road.  The matter needs to be reviewed.  I hope the Minister of State can look on my request favourably.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#B00100"><p>I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, who sends her apologies for not being here this morning.  I would like to thank the Senator for raising this issue, which is a key priority for the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and for the Government.  It will allow more people to engage in services that will allow them to remain independent and to live in their own homes with dignity and independence for as long as possible.  Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to quality long-term residential care, where this is appropriate.  We will continue to develop and improve health services in all regions of the country to meet this objective and to ensure both quality and patient safety.</p> <p>The 1993 regulation provided a framework for the operation of a boarding out scheme.  The regulation included specific conditions relating to maintenance, care and welfare of an older person in a private home.  The intention of the scheme was to provide social and personal care to older people who did not want to or who were not able to live on their own but who wanted to remain living in their community.  The phrase that is important here is &ldquo;local community&rdquo;.</p> <p>Under the regulations, the HSE must be satisfied that the house is suitable and that the householder is fit to look after the person who is being boarded out.  The householder must provide suitable and sufficient care, nutritious and varied food and adequate attendance, having regard to the needs of the person.  The householder must also respect the privacy of the person who is being boarded out.  Not more than six people can be boarded out in one house.  The regulation also sets out standards as to the suitability of the accommodation, including cleanliness, safety and other related matters.  I am reading all this into the record because perhaps not too many people know about this.  I genuinely believe that this, until I read it before the House morning, was one of the best kept secrets.  I personally also thank the Senator for raising this issue.  </p> <p>The regulations provide that the HSE may pay to the householder an amount not exceeding half the weekly rate of the non-contributory State pension which is payable at the time in respect of each person being boarded out.  In addition, the person who is being boarded out must pay to the householder an amount which is agreed between the HSE, the householder and the person who is being boarded out.</p> <p>The boarding out scheme has diminished over time.  It is now only available in a limited number of areas across the country.  At present, it is understood that there are only 17 boarding-out facilities across three community healthcare organisations.  The HSE completed a review of the scheme in 2017, which concluded that an expansion of the scheme was warranted.  While the use of the boarding out scheme by the HSE has traditionally been small, there is value in exploring it further.  I would go so far as to say that this relevant not just for older persons, but that we could also look at within the area of disability.  </p> <p>The pandemic has highlighted the continuing importance of the need to support older people living in our community who wish to remain in their communities where they may otherwise be accommodated in residential care.  I am pleased to advise the House that my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older persons, Deputy Butler, has requested that officials in the Department consider this model of care and the regulation for the scheme, as well as the rate of pay and implications of the raising costs associated with running these accommodations in the context of our overall commitment to enhancing opportunities for older people to stay in their homes and in their communities for longer.</p> <p>What the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has committed to doing is very welcome.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  </p></speech>

I appreciate that she is here on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  I welcome in her statement the commitment by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to review this.  However, my specific question was about pay rates, which should be addressed sooner rather than later.  The regulations were introduced in 1993.  In her statement, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said that is now being recommended that we would look at enhancing this model.  The numbers are dropping off.  She mentioned that there are only 17 registered care homes at the moment.  Why is this so?  It is because people are not able to financially to maintain them.</p> <p>In theory, we might be saying that this is a brilliant model that we would love to expand but if we are not rewarding the people who are providing these fantastic facilities, there will be more and more dropping off.  If the pricing model alone is not dealt with immediately, the next time we are back before the House having this conversation, I can guarantee the Minister of State that the figure of 17 that she quoted will have decreased and not increased, irrespective of how the Department or the HSE may value the model or think that it needs expanding.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#B00300"><p>I thank the Senator again.  It is important to say the Government is committed to trying to establish schemes which are focused on prevention and early intervention in respect of appropriate care settings.  The point that the Senator has just made is fair.  The cost of this scheme is one eighth of the cost of going into a nursing home.  It is also keeping people in their community.  What the Senator described to me is a family network.  However, at the end of the day, costs are rising.  I will discuss it further with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  There is also the fact that within the gift of the HSE locally we do not need to stand behind legislation.  There is a word called &ldquo;discretion&rdquo;.  If there is a need to support that particular house or any of the 17 houses, it should be looked at in the light that we look at all other providers in the areas of disability and older persons.  We treat all equally.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1658" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#B00700"><p>At the outset I thank the Minister of State most sincerely for her recent visit to Monaghan, which was very well received.  The feedback has been extremely positive.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank her for her ongoing work within her portfolio.</p> <p>This morning, I am urging the Minister of State to get the HSE to reconsider the transport charge that is being levelled at several juniors who are attending HSE day services in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, 1 area, which includes the counties of Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.</p> <p>As the Minister of State will know, disability is unfortunately strongly associated with poverty in this country.  Among people who are unable to work due to long-standing illness, one in three live on an income below the poverty line.  Among those who are able to work, many people with a disability are unemployed.  This is a classification where more than four in ten people live in poverty.  People with a disability are twice as likely to be unable to afford to heat their home.  Much help is needed in that regard with rising inflation costs.</p> <p>In fact, a study that has recently been compiled by Indecon on behalf of the Department of Social Protection has found that the cost of having a disability is between &euro;9,482 and &euro;11,734 extra per year, on top of everyday expenses.  As the Minister of State will be aware, disabled people and the households that include people with a disability have to spend more on items such as fuel and light, transport, therapeutic equipment, medical expenses, domestic services, equipment aids and appliances, mobility and communications, daily living costs and care and assistance. </p> <p>It therefore seems inexplicable that a transport charge has been applied to service users who are attending HSE day services at &euro;4 per trip or &euro;20 per week, particularly when this levy is being applied exclusively to the CHO 1 area, which includes the counties that I mentioned earlier.  These five counties are arguably the most isolated counties with regard to transport infrastructure in the entire country. </p> <p>The daily charge of &euro;4 amounts to a total of &euro;960 per annum for a person with a disability.  Naturally, there is now a genuine fear in families that their loved ones may not be able to avail of the service simply because of the cost.  That would be heartbreaking.  I am aware of one case locally where there are two attendees in a family.  That will cost them almost &euro;2,000 per annum, which is a huge amount of money.  On top of that is the aforementioned cost of living with disability.  I feel that this charge is very unfair.  Apparently, the charge has been levied because the routes are deemed to be closed routes or exclusive routes.  People who are using an open route can use their free travel pass, for example, on Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Unfortunately, this does not apply to this particular service.  The problem with the CHO 1 area is that the routes are deemed to be closed.  </p> <p>The simple answer would appear to be to extend the free travel pass to include these particular routes.  Maybe that is too simple and I await the Minister of State&rsquo;s response on that.  There is no issue with the service.  The service is top class but unfortunately, it is now getting to the stage where many families simply cannot afford it.  I acknowledge that since the Minister of State has come into office, she has been a champion for people with disabilities.  I now ask her to champion this cause on behalf of the service users of Monaghan, Cavan, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#C00100"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and there is no pressure attached.  It is important to state that the HSE has no statutory responsibility for providing transport to day services and that transport to day services is not usually provided for service users.  At the same time I would preface that by saying that the HSE, under disability, spends in excess of &euro;40 million every year on transport, while it provides no transport.  I am trying to work that out myself and that is why I have taken ownership of the chair of the transport committee where I have put everybody around the table to look at all available routes.  It is not only that but it is also to look at the primary medical certificates, the blue badge and everything.</p> <p>There is an inequality in CHO 1.  It charges &euro;4 per day and the Senator is right that it is a closed route option.  It is not part of the open routes and if it was part of that, there would be no charge whatsoever on it.  On the other hand I have to compliment CHO 1 for doing this.  It meant that no service user lost a day service.  In other CHOs they have paid for the transport and reduced the service users' attendance at the day services whereas in Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan they came up with the &euro;4 per day charge in order that people would not lose access to their day services, which was a balancing measure.  I do not think that was right and transport is being provided for people attending day services in other CHOs, so why would it not be provided equally and on the same basis in all CHOs?  It is the only CHO in the country where you have to pay &euro;4.</p> <p>In Leitrim, the Local Link has been running a pilot, which has been positive, and we need to see that expanded.  We need to move away from closed routes to open routes and those open routes have a benefit for the climate and the locality.  Such a HSE open routes model could be used for older persons as well as for persons with a disability.  It could also possibly be used for people who need to access a medical appointment.  They could all be accommodated within the same running time as opposed to running the bus first thing in the morning just for the disability service, then running it later on in the day to go to the day centre with older persons and perhaps running it later on in the day for people who need hospital appointments.  A little bit more collaboration and joined-up thinking is what is required in order that we can have open routes, which would be funded through the Department of Transport.  The Department of Transport needs to do that because there needs to be equitable access to all routes, regardless of location.  To be fair to the Department of Transport, it has done phenomenal work since I have come into office in expanding its Local Link service and in making its fleet far more accessible and better integrated.  Perhaps this is something I will take further.  One of the reasons I have had these conversations is to see how we can address the inequality of the &euro;4 charge in CHO 1 versus the other eight CHOs that do not have a charge.</p></speech>

I join with the Minister of State in complimenting all those involved in the Local Link service.  It is a fantastic service and there is serious potential to expand that even further, as the Minister of State outlined, and I look forward to that.  I am heartened by the Minister of State's comments on her input into having a look at the charge being applied in CHO 1 only.  It is unfair to the service users involved and I would welcome, that on their behalf, the Minister of State would do all in her power to ensure that citizens living in CHO 1 are treated no differently to citizens elsewhere and that this unfair charge will be removed as soon as possible.</p></speech>

That was the decision that was taken at an executive level and within the HSE at a local level a number of years ago.  The Senator clearly outlined the challenge this is putting before families that have more than one family member who needs to attend a day service.  It is on my agenda, I chair that committee and I work closely with Edel Quinn, with whom I have had those conversations.  I compliment the local HSE as it did not remove the service for the service users and it did not find other ways of trying to pay the bill.  It was totally upfront and it has been transparent but at the same time it is allowing people to have their full five-day service, as opposed to giving a five-day service where only four days can really be provided because the fifth day is being used to pay for the bus.  As that goes on too, it is important to have an open conversation on this but I do not like the fact that we pay for it in one CHO and we do not in others.  That is an inequality and the solution is to have more open routes.  By having more open routes we have more accessibility for the inclusion of other people, not just disabled people, to access the service.  Older people and people who need to go to appointments could access these routes as well.</p></speech>

I am proud of Ireland's response to the crisis in Ukraine and to the invasion by Russia.  We can also be pleased that there has been a cross-continental and global response to that and as members of the European Union, we can be proud of how our political Union has responded.  In Ireland the Government deserves credit but so do communities and at the local level people deserve credit for how they have welcomed Ukrainians into this country and done whatever they can to assist them.  There is still a lot of work to be done on that front and there are a number of actions that need to be taken.</p> <p>I am conscious of Resolution 2436 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and what it has set out as a checklist of things we should be doing.  First is legislating for the crime of aggression, something that is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and something that was part of the Kampala amendments to the convention in 2010, led by Liechtenstein and which Ireland signed up to in 2018.  That followed the UN General Assembly resolution which stated that aggression includes, for example, the bombing of another country, invasion and the blockading of ports, all of which we see happening in Ukraine.  It would be appropriate for Ireland, therefore, to legislate for that crime as well.  Other measures would include a universal civil jurisdiction that would allow us to freeze and confiscate foreign assets, particularly Russian assets in Europe and Ireland, to allow them to be put towards the reconstruction of Ukraine after the invasion concludes.  Now that Russia has essentially been put out of the Council of Europe, we have a limited window within which we can bring a suit against Russia for breaches of the convention under Article 33.  That window closes on 16 September and Ireland should be looking at that as something to do in order to put down a clear marker.  I am also conscious that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Government have earmarked &euro;4 million of support for the International Criminal Court, ICC, which I support.  Some &euro;1 million of that has been delivered and &euro;3 million is yet to be delivered.  I wonder if consideration should be given to that remaining &euro;3 million going to the Ukrainian prosecutor on the ground.  As counsel before the ICC but also as somebody who has spoken to the prosecutor in Ukraine, I believe they have a greater ability to affect that on the ground.</p> <p>In following the recommendation of the European Commission on the recognition of professional qualifications, this is a key area where Ireland can deliver for Ukrainian professionals who have come here and to any other European state.  It covers education, healthcare, engineering and law and includes people who come here with a particular qualification or skill set.  In accordance with the 2001 directive on the minimum standards for people enjoying temporary protection, for example, we must facilitate them in working here, either in an employed context or in a self-employed context.  Although the recommendation may not be legally binding, it sets out a clear statement and in the first instance I would like Ireland to confirm if we are totally in accordance with that recommendation.  What are we doing as a State to say to professional regulatory bodies that we must implement this recommendation, facilitate Ukrainians coming here and ensure that they can work and be part of the community for as long as is needed?  They should be able to integrate into a professional environment here with the greatest possible ease and the least possible bureaucratic resistance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What this is about is facilitating people who do not particularly want to be in Ireland.  They are here because a conflict has exploded in their home country.  When they come here, they should be facilitated in continuing their lives in as normal a way as possible, however perverse that might be in the current circumstances.  That involves the Government putting pressure on those regulatory bodies to ensure that the recommendation of the Commission is followed.</p></speech>

The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and his Department are committed to providing every support possible for Ukrainian citizens who are seeking the recognition of their qualifications in Ireland, be it to further their education, to pursue employment opportunities or to practise a profession that is regulated.  Through the National Academic Recognition Information Centre, NARIC, Ireland, a service hosted and operated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, advice can be readily obtained, free of charge, on the academic recognition of foreign qualifications.  This service compares foreign qualifications to major award types and levels on the Irish national framework of qualifications, NFQ, which sets these foreign qualifications clearly into an Irish context.  QQI's NARIC database currently lists 18 Ukrainian qualifications, comparable to levels 3 to 10 on the NFQ, which includes general professional, further and higher education qualifications.  NARIC Ireland is working with the wider NARIC network across Europe to continue building the list of Ukrainian qualifications, and this is a current priority.</p> <p>When NARIC receives a request for the recognition of a previously unlisted qualification, once it is assessed, it is added to the list of published qualifications and is made readily available online.  A guide to NARIC has been translated into Ukrainian and has also been made available in a wide range of other languages spoken by Ukrainians.  The service provided by NARIC Ireland helps to inform employers if an applicant holds the academic qualifications necessary for a particular job or employment opportunity.  Where a profession is unregulated, there is no formal barrier to prevent someone from continuing to practise his or her profession in Ireland.  However, where a profession is regulated, such as the professions of doctor, nurse or teacher, for example, the decision to recognise qualifications rests with the national regulator or competent authority in question, such as the Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland or the Teaching Council.  In these cases, the competent authority compares qualifications against the Irish regulatory standard to ensure the holder has the necessary skills and competencies to practise in Ireland.  Ireland has over 45 such authorities covering a range of professions.  A list of these professions, alongside the relevant contact information for each authority, is available on the Department's website.</p> <p>Any Ukrainian citizen who wishes to practise a regulated profession in Ireland is advised to engage with the relevant competent authority with responsibility for that profession to seek the recognition of his or her professional qualifications.  This is crucial to ensure Ukrainian people can pursue opportunities in their profession of choice.  Indeed, many of these authorities have already reached out to engage with the Ukrainian community in Ireland and have published dedicated material on their websites to assist Ukrainian applicants.  The Department has been providing critical support to the work of these competent authorities by sharing best-practice material supplied by the European Commission on recognition of Ukrainian professional qualifications.  This includes working with and supporting these authorities as they implement the recently published Commission recommendation on the recognition of qualifications for people fleeing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  This Commission recommendation was published last month and provides competent authorities with guidance and practical advice to ensure a quick, fair and flexible recognition process for Ukrainian refugees. In addition, these competent authorities have been advised of further information resources from NARIC Ireland that will assist in their work, alongside toolkits and resources developed by the EU and UNESCO to assist in dealing with cases of where refugees do not have complete evidence or documentation of their qualifications.</p> <p>The Minister and the Department are continuing to work with our national competent authorities, their parent Departments, the European Commission and other member states on the recognition of professional qualifications of Ukrainian people and the implementation of the Commission recommendation to ensure an appropriate EU-wide response.  I will bring the Senator's points regarding the Council of Europe and the International Criminal Court to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, as well.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that progress is being made in this area.  I also welcome the fact that some professions are specifically moving in this direction to facilitate Ukrainian refugees.  Others are not, however, and I am aware of specific individuals in Ireland who are having difficulty having their Ukrainian professional qualifications recognised here.  The Minister of State is quite right to say that each professional regulatory body has to deal with that in the way that is appropriate.  That is included in the recommendation from the Commission.  However, it is also important for the Government to send out a clear message to all professional regulatory bodies that this is important and is something that must be pursued and advanced in a concrete way in the coming weeks and months.  It is not something they can wait for many months to implement.  Let us implement the recommendation from the Commission and ensure that Ukrainian nurses, doctors, lawyers and engineers who come to Ireland can make use of their professional qualifications and skills, work here and contribute here in the way we know they want to.</p></speech>

I am raising the issue of rodenticide poisoning of raptors, particularly barn owls.  Our bird populations are collapsing due to habitat loss but also as a result of deliberate and accidental poisoning.  There is no need to tell the Minister of State that our native birds of prey are key indicator species of the health of our ecosystems and they are a critical part of our natural heritage.</p> <p>The recording and addressing persecution and threats to our raptors, RAPTOR, protocol, which was introduced in 2011, was welcome.  It set in place a formal procedure for investigations of bird of prey deaths and it has allowed us to build up a database of information on the causes of death of raptors through the collection and handling of carcases and evidence, toxicological testing, post mortems and X-rays.  The most recently available report I could find is from 2019.  What is very worrying about that report is that it shows the highest number of deaths of birds of prey.  Rodenticide poisons were the most prevalent poisons found in birds of prey.  The RAPTOR protocol 2019 report clearly states that the protocol includes the monitoring of incidents of poisoning in species vulnerable to secondary poisoning by rodenticides.  There is particular concern about the barn owl, the kestrel, the buzzard, the red kite and the long-eared owl.</p> <p>The reason I raise this today is that those who are involved in wildlife rehabilitation and the Barn Owl Project are concerned that testing for secondary poisoning is not happening or is not happening at a consistent rate.  In Britain, where monitoring for secondary poisoning is taking place, it has been found that 88% of barn owls are likely to have been affected by rodenticide poisoning.  Ireland has a much higher rate of use of rodenticide so if it is 88% in our nearest neighbour, it is more than likely much higher in Ireland.  Can the Minister of State confirm that the RAPTOR protocol is being fully implemented in terms of testing for secondary poisoning?  Could he consult with his colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the broader issue of the use of rodenticides?</p> <p>We have dealt with this general issue previously.  I have spoken in the House about metaldehyde in slug pellets.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The real issue is that members of the public can get their hands on very dangerous chemicals.  I do not doubt for a second people are doing this deliberately.  In the vast majority of cases, people put out poison to kill slugs because they love their garden plants or to reduce the number of rodents about the place.  However, these poisons have serious implications for wildlife.  Can the Government arrange a public awareness campaign about the damage that can be done by using these poisons?  For example, one cannot buy a box of cigarettes without an image on the box that shows the damage that cigarettes do to one's health.  When people walk into a hardware store, we need them to know full well the possible implications of using these chemicals and offer alternatives.  We know that barn owls can eat up to 1,000 rodents a year, so it would be far better for farmers to have one on their land than use rodenticide.  Of course, there are inconsistencies in terms of the use of rodenticide and farmers' obligations under the Common Agricultural Policy.  I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

It is always good to talk about biodiversity in the Seanad even if it is a negative issue.  It is important to highlight important points, particularly the poisoning of raptors.  I take on board the specific points she made about testing and a public awareness campaign, which I will address in a follow-up response.</p> <p>Ireland is home to more than 14 species of breeding raptors.  Some species are largely resident, for example, the kestrel and the barn owl, with others visiting Ireland largely in winter, such as the snowy owl, or on passage in early spring and late summer, such as the hobby or osprey.</p> <p>Various natural, environmental and anthropogenic factors lead to mortality incidents within the populations of Ireland's raptor species and can affect their conservation status.  These include: sub-optimal prey availability and habitat suitability that is compounded by prolonged periods of inclement weather; collisions with traffic on road and rail networks, wind turbines, etc.; disease, including avian influenza; persecution via direct shooting or deliberate poisoning; and environmental pollution, for example, by their feeding on dead or moribund rodents that have ingested rodenticide, which is the issue being discussed here today.  This particular factor can lead to what is known as secondary poisoning as the bird does not feed on the poison itself directly.</p> <p>Since 2011, my staff have worked collaboratively with the regional veterinary laboratory service of the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, and the State Laboratory, to determine the cause of death of raptor carcasses that have been recovered from around the country under the RAPTOR protocol, which is the Recording and Addressing Persecution and Threats to Our Raptors protocol.  The protocol already includes testing for secondary poisoning in raptors.</p> <p>As part of the protocol, liver and stomach samples are routinely taken from each viable carcass.  The samples are subjected to a range of toxicological testing to identify and quantify, where possible, the concentrations of particular analytes or components in the samples.  These analyses allow for the detection of substances that are used to deliberately target raptors and also substances that may be prevalent in the wider countryside such as second generation anticoagulant rodenticides, SGARs, that are used to control rodents.  As the Senator mentioned, rodents constitute part of the diet of many raptor species such as barn owl.  The suite of substances that are routinely tested for include those used to deliberately target raptors such as carbofuran, alphachloralose, methiocarb as well as a whole suite of SGARs, which are rodenticides, including brodifacoum, flucomafen and difenacoum.  It should be noted that raptors are the most effective way to control rodents.  The Senator rightly said that many farmers are now seeing the benefit of having barn owls on their farms in terms of bringing a balance both to nature and habitats.</p> <p>With relevant stakeholders, my staff are looking at the breadth of potential testing concerning the current monitoring of contaminants in raptors.  Furthermore, my staff are working to update the existing service level agreement with the State Laboratory and the regional veterinary laboratory service.  This will allow the current RAPTOR protocol to continue to operate, and allows us to effectively detect and monitor a range of environmental contaminants, including rodenticides, which are prevalent in the organs and tissues of these top predators.  It is vital to have this information not just for national purposes, so that we understand the impact of such poisoning on our raptor populations, but also in the European-wide context, with the aim of reducing chemical risks to raptors,   to the wider environment and to human health.  Reports on the protocol are prepared annually and made available on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p></speech>

I welcome the confirmation that the protocol will continue and that the service level agreement is being updated.  I ask him to confirm a timeline for the completion of that process.  I ask him to confirm also whether testing will be expanded so that we can have a complete picture of the current state of the raptor population and thus address the issue of poisoning.  I ask him to touch on my idea of the Government arranging a public awareness campaign that informs people who may be unaware of the damage that is done to wildlife due to people having access to these very dangerous chemicals.</p></speech>

I must advise that any such campaign would need to be led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned that these toxins are available on the shelves of garden centres and other stores.  Another issue is the storage of carbofuran and other toxins that have been banned because they may still be available on farms.  Perhaps a call for people to deposit these products at a secure facility would be a really useful way to address the amount of toxins that are out there.  We will raise the issue of a public awareness campaign with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I will get back to the Senator about a timeline for the service level agreement.</p> <p>Finally, I reiterate that it is illegal to persecute or poison a raptor either directly or indirectly.  My Department takes wildlife crime very seriously and in a number of instances there has been a successful outcome to cases that were brought to court over the direct poisoning of raptors.  We take the issue very seriously and I welcome the fact the Senator raised this issue today.</p></speech>

This morning, she and I have both come from the gates of Leinster House on Kildare Street where we joined with fellow Senators, Deputies, activists and the National Women's Council of Ireland to celebrate the anniversary of the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, which took place this day four years ago.  Many of us were involved in that campaign.  I feel I got involved at the 11th hour because the campaign began 35 years before that date and many of the women involved then are still involved today.</p> <p>We envisaged that there would be some difficulties in implementing the will of the people and ensuring equality of access for women across the county to these legally available services.  Some of those problems persist today and they are part of what we will be looking at in the review of the legislation to ensure we get it right for the women and girls of Ireland.  We stand with fellow Members, activists and women across the country in once again pledging our support to ensure the legislation is properly and fully implemented, there is equality of access and we address any additional and outstanding concerns.  We will work with colleagues across parties on those issues in the coming weeks and months.</p> <p>I also want to speak about the horrific mass shooting that happened yesterday in a primary school in the United States.  It is the 27th such shooting this year.  My heart goes out the families of the victims, to the other students who witnessed it, to the two teachers lost and to that community.  I have no doubt that people across the United State are heartbroken at what has happened.</p> <p>It is with utter disbelief that we listen to the commentary from some public representatives, both Congressmen and Senators, suggesting that the issue is not gun control.  They have moved on from wanting to arm teachers and some are now suggesting they should have armed police on school grounds.  I listened to Larry Murphy on the radio this morning.  His views were very strong and I concur with his remarks.  It is abhorrent to suggest putting an armed police force in schools rather than changing the gun laws in the United States.  There is a majority view among the public that there should be tighter gun controls, as well as from many public representatives, yet the National Rifle Association seems to have a vice grip on a majority in American politics.  I concur with the remarks of President Biden on this.  We hope these representatives will act and that this will be the straw that breaks the camel's back, but there is pessimism across the United States that anything will actually happen.  There will be an outpouring of grief and solidarity and then people will just move on and it will be forgotten about and consigned to the history books.  It is shocking.</p> <p>President Biden was correct in pointing out that lots of countries have mental health issues and other challenges, such as civil unrest and different issues that pop up from time to time, but no other country in the world is dealing with mass shootings in schools like the United States is.  The issue is gun control, not those other issues.  I extend our support, solidarity and deep sympathies to the families and communities of those who have lost loved ones this morning, those very young second, third and fourth graders.  It does not bear thinking about but it is important that we speak about this issue, highlight it and advocate for change. </p></speech>

As the Senator has pointed out, it is an unnecessary loss.  This is a failure of politics at its worst.  This is a world superpower.  If it cannot protect its own children then the solution is not more police; it is more politics and people working together to make sure they protect their children.</p></speech>

By all accounts, it was an amazing and historic day.  It was a great privilege to be here and to share in the exchange.  Based on the media coverage last night, it resonated with a lot of people.  I know it was a personal choice of the Cathaoirleach's and something he wanted to see happen.  I also thank the administration here in Leinster House that dealt with all the security issues and other matters that come with such a visit to this House.  We were greatly privileged and I again thank everyone involved.</p> <p>I raise the issue of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am conscious that there is litigation going on that would not be appropriate for me to talk about.  That said, An Bord Plean&aacute;la plays a very important - indeed, critical - role in our planning process and the public must therefore have every confidence in the governance procedures of the board and how it and its members conduct themselves.  We in these Houses are all aware that the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government commissioned a report called the Mulcahy report, which I will address in a minute.  We are also very aware that our current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage appointed Remy Farrell SC to provide his opinion on a number of planning decisions and a report is awaited.  As I said, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on his work or any ongoing issues around An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A report by Rory Mulcahy SC into alleged corruption in County Donegal remains unpublished almost five years after it was sitting on the desk of the then Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy.  He said the report was on his desk and that it needed some consideration.  There were many issues of alleged serious misconduct in a planning authority, which gave rise to questions.  We are going to talk about confidence in the planning authority, in local government planning procedures and in our appeals board, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Let us not waste money and time commissioning reports unless we are also committed to putting them in the public domain.  I have already issued a statement today calling on the Minister to publish the Mulcahy report and lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas, so we can at least tease out the issues and learn from the recommendations.  Having reports that spell out wrongdoing, but not learning from them, is simply and quite frankly not good enough.  I ask the Acting Leader for a debate at some point on planning, planning governance, confidence in planning and how we can instil greater confidence in the planning process.  I will leave it at that because these reports will hopefully be forthcoming.  Today, my call is on the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to publish Rory Mulcahy SC's report.  Let us look at it, see about it and let us debate those issues in these Houses.</p></speech>

As Senator Chambers pointed out, it is now four years after that momentous day when we repealed the eighth amendment of the Constitution, but we know that there is still a lack of provision, which affects in particular people living in rural areas, people with disabilities, the working class, migrants and people living in direct provision.  The three-day waiting period is also an issue.  Quite frankly, it is paternalistic nonsense.  I am concerned that this House has passed the legislation on safe access zones, yet we still do not have any progress from the Minister for Health on the issue.</p> <p>This morning a very worrying interview was carried out on the fact that not all maternity hospitals are offering abortion services.  More damning is the fact that only one in ten GPs is signing up to provide abortion services.  It is very concerning for one community where a GP has had to stop having any clinics whatsoever on a Saturday morning because of protests that were occurring on Saturdays.  Now, not only are the women who are in need of healthcare for abortion services affected, but also the wider community cannot get access to their GP on a Saturday because some people think it is appropriate to protest outside a GP's office and prevent women from getting the healthcare access they need.  We need safe access zones.  If it is not Senator Gavan's legislation, which has been supported by many Members across this House, then the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, needs to act fast so that women are not prevented from accessing the healthcare to which they are entitled and that we fought hard to achieve.</p> <p>The second piece of legislation that we are awaiting is my own Bill that was brought to the House in February on jury selection, in particular in connection with the Stardust inquest.  We know that the coroner, Myra Cullinane, wants the inquest to proceed in September.  These families have been waiting for decades for justice.  She wants no further delays.  We already had a judicial review in the High Court, which has delayed proceedings.  It is essential that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, brings forward legislative proposals and fulfils the commitment she gave to the families who were in this House.  She said that she was aware that their concerns were warranted, that we must have independent selection of jurors and that their income must be protected in some way to allow them to sit for a number of months on jury service.  We have a matter of weeks left before the summer recess.  If the Minister does not bring the legislation before the two Houses before the summer recess, we will not be back here until late September, which means the inquest will not be able to proceed then, as the coroner wants it to.  It is completely in the hands of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, to prevent any further delays and hurt to the families of the Stardust fire.</p></speech>

It is the second time in just over a year that "RT&Eacute; Investigates" has disclosed horrific allegations of sexual abuse of patients by medical professionals who were working in the hospital.  In last night's case, it was outlined that a doctor who worked at Naas General Hospital was removed from the Irish medical register in 2015 after two patients alleged they were sexually assaulted by him.  The allegations relate to a doctor who was found guilty of professional misconduct by the Irish Medical Council.</p> <p>Naas General Hospital has apologised for the way it communicated with the two patients in the aftermath of their complaints.  In a statement to "RT&Eacute; Investigates", Naas General Hospital said on the day it received the first complaint the hospital convened a serious incident review meeting and decided to suspend the doctor from duty with immediate effect, pending the outcome of a trust-in-care process.  The hospital went on to say that the doctor has never returned to work since his suspension.  Last night's programme outlined that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is currently carrying out an ongoing criminal investigation and it is co-operating with Interpol and other police authorities.</p> <p>Last year, "RT&Eacute; Investigates" also revealed three separate investigations were under way into a series of complaints of suspected sexual abuse of unconscious patients by another doctor at Naas General Hospital.  Those allegations involved up to four patients.  Again, I thank Aoife Hegarty and "RT&Eacute; Investigates" for their work in highlighting these important and very worrying matters.</p> <p>I want to pay tribute as well to the young man referred to in the programme last night as "Ryan" for his bravery in coming forward in what must have been a very difficult investigation and a very difficult time for him and his family.  I ask the Acting Leader to arrange a debate in this House with the Minister for Health on hospital safety.  We must be able to assure patients that when they are at their most vulnerable from a health point of view, the professionals treating them care for them as they are supposed to do.</p> <p>I welcome the news from yesterday that the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, has been allowed to affiliate with ICTU, albeit on a temporary, two-year basis.  This is very good news for the members of PDFORRA, allowing its representatives to partake in the forthcoming pay talks.  This opportunity must also be extended to the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO.  I hope we all get the chance to raise this important point again with the Minister for Defence when he is next in this House.  We have all called for a debate on the report of the commission.  The Acting Leader and colleagues throughout the House have done so.  I ask that such a debate would be convened in the quickest possible time.</p></speech>

I said that it was part of a pattern of Israeli violence and repression employed to suppress the voices of those highlighting human rights abuses in the region.  I called for accountability and meaningful repercussions of the violation of international law.</p> <p>There is an update to this saga.  A European Parliament delegation to Palestine, which includes Irish MEPs, Chris McManus and my good friend, Grace O'Sullivan, has been blocked by Israel, making it necessary for them to call off their visit.  Israel created this situation by refusing to allow the delegation to travel to Gaza, and by refusing the leader of the delegation, Manu Pineda MEP, access to the country, when he arrived in Tel Aviv on Sunday.  Impeding the delegation in this way is outrageous behaviour which warrants a robust response.  There are precedents to follow here.  In the past, when Russia and China took actions against MEPs, diplomatic and trade repercussions were imposed on them.  The suspension of a massive EU-China trade deal is evidence of how seriously these matters should be taken and it is clear that the same standard needs to be applied in this case.  This is what Mr. Pineda and my former Civil Engagement Group colleague, Grace O'Sullivan, have called for.  Whenever calls are made in this Chamber for action against Israel, in light of its human rights abuses, the standard response is that maintaining diplomatic relations between Ireland and Israel is important so that Ireland can press for better treatment of Palestinians and the importance of upholding international law.  I do not doubt the sincerity of this argument, but it is becoming increasingly untenable.  It is very clear that Israel refuses any kind of meaningful scrutiny of its treatment of the Palestinian people.  It refuses to be held accountable for its crimes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The only diplomacy that Israel is interested in is a stage-managed version, where criticism is muted and figures who express solidarity for Palestine's struggle for freedom are excluded.  Ireland must stop validating this sham.  If Irish and European diplomacy are unable to highlight the real issues on the ground, then it is not worth engaging.  The restrictions that are being imposed on Members of the European Parliament who are carrying out their duties warrant a response from the European Union.  I want this House to be briefed on what the position of the Irish permanent representative to the European Union will be on this issue.  Will he echo the calls from Grace O'Sullivan MEP and Manu Pineda MEP for material consequences for Israel's restrictions on the work of the European Parliament?  </p></speech>

I compliment the Cathaoirleach on his ongoing engagement with the United States.  Yesterday's interaction was important.</p> <p>I also welcome the decision to allow temporary associate membership to PDFORRA of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  It is important that members of our Defence Forces have a voice in the forthcoming pay talks.  I appreciate that this is only a first step but it is welcome.  I think that should be communicated.  I congratulate the executive of PDFORRA for its work in that regard.</p> <p>I am conscious that we have often debated China in this House.  Yesterday saw a leak of police files that further prove the appalling treatment of the Uyghur minorities in Xinjiang by the Chinese Communist Party.  We know that China is continuing to engage in systematic abuse and in a genocide against the Uyghur minorities.  While our attention is rightly focused on what is happening in Ukraine, we cannot avoid what is continuing to happen in China.</p></speech>

Yet, the images that have now emerged of the Uyghur community are particularly frightening.

We are all very much aware of the inflation in prices.  This morning I got a quote to rent a car for ten days.  The sum of that, if I were to take it up, would be &euro;1,800.  That is quite extraordinary to see the inflation in the rental car trade.  Some 20% of visitors who come to Ireland use rental cars.  This inflation imposed upon our tourism market will have a huge knock-on effect on our credibility as being an affordable place to go on holidays.  We need to look over the next few weeks at how we can ensure that our rental car trade will be competitive.  That would require engagement with the motor trade and with the Minister.  I respectfully ask the Leader of the House to organise a debate with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, on how she will move in the next few days and weeks to curb the inflation that is being seen at present in the rental car trade.  More importantly, how will she make sure that our tourism industry will not be grossly affected by this inflation?  This could undermine our entire tourism industry, as 20% of tourists use cars.  They go to rural locations, such as Kerry or west Cork.  They will not go to west Cork unless they have the opportunity to get an affordable rental car.  We need to have a real, genuine debate in this House on how we will solve this issue as otherwise, the tourism industry unfortunately could be undermined.</p></speech>

However, it is outrageous that RACO has not been granted the same permission.  I call today on the Minister for Defence to immediately address that.  There are pay talks ongoing right now and they need to be there.</p> <p>There has been much talk recently about mental health for children and mental health issues for children.  One wonders about the way business is done in this country.  I brought this report before this House last week.  It is 415 pages in length and is the Air Corps's pitch to take part in the search and rescue, SAR.  This would result in &euro;378,661,302 in savings to the Exchequer.  I guarantee the Leader that no Minister has read this or has been asked to read it.  Furthermore, the critique of that report is three pages in length.  There is not one technological, empirical or statistical piece of evidence to support this piece of nonsense.</p> <p>The Secretary General was invited before the Oireachtas joint committee on a number of occasions to discuss this process and has refused to come.  If the Departments are not answerable to the Oireachtas and the Ministers appear to not be in control of their Departments, where the hell do we go?  It is outrageous there is no way to question this process.  This process is banging ahead like a steam engine.  There would be almost &euro;400 million in savings over ten years and nobody will explain why it is not happening.</p> <p>We talk all the time about the pride we have in the Defence Forces in this House.  There is no pride in the Defence Forces.  This weekend an RAF aircraft was called in to do top cover without the knowledge of the Air Corps.  I am told it was RAF, but it was English and that is for sure.  This fits neatly into the desire of the Irish Coast Guard to have top cover provided by somebody other than the Air Corps for the next three years. </p> <p>Who is running this State?  Is it the faceless civil servants who are so God-damned powerful at this stage that they are answerable to nobody, not even to the Houses of the Oireachtas?  To compel a Secretary General to come before an Oireachtas committee, you need the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight of both Houses to agree.  That is way too cumbersome, as far as I am concerned.  This is an outrage.  I understand that the tender will be going out today.  That tender will be going out in contempt of this House, of the Lower House and of the Oireachtas joint committee.  That is simply not good enough.  </p></speech>

The Minister of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, visited Limerick.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell will be interested to know that Limerick College of Further Education made an announcement on the purchase of three buildings for a digital and media hub.  That is most fitting, given their expansion by working with the likes of Troy Studios.  Limerick is now becoming one of the biggest areas for film studios in the country.</p> <p>We also learned about the retrofitting programme through the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, LCETB.  There we met many trainees and apprentices who are almost ready to go out and work in the workplace on the retrofitting programme.  </p></speech>

We also had a visit to the University of Limerick.  It was a very productive day for education and for training.  That is important to note.  The more positive days and the more collaboration we see between education and industry, the better.</p> <p>Finally, I visited members of the Ronald McDonald House in Buswells Hotel today.  I pay compliment to them for the wonderful work that they do with families.  I would encourage anyone who has not been there to go and visit them.  They had three asks.

Economists have for months now been warning of the prospect of a recession in late 2022, an assertion echoed earlier this month by the UK's National Institute for Economic and Social Research.  The chief executive of Citigroup, one of the world's largest banks, said on Monday that she believes Europe is sliding into recession as it grapples with the consequences of war in Ukraine and a resulting spike in energy prices.</p> <p>Headline inflation in the eurozone hit an all-time high of 7.4% in April, even by measures which account for volatile food and energy prices, which still point to inflation far exceeding the ECB's 2% target.  We do not need to be reminded of the role that is played in the global financial markets by the economy of the United States.  Much will depend in coming months on how the US Federal Reserve conducts its rate-hiking strategy as inflation soars even higher.  Wall Street has been voicing its concerns for months.  Since the 1940s, every time inflation has exceeded 5%, a recession has soon followed.</p> <p>There are, of course, things in life which matter more than money.  At a material level, money often buys us the essentials of clothes, food and shelter.  Shortages in those materials are more immediately noticeable than percentage point downturns in GDP.  While many a debate has been had in this House on our shortage of shelter, food could be worth keeping an eye on.</p> <p>The economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, heard on Monday that the anxiety about access to food at a reasonable price globally is hitting the roof.  We were warned of the spectre of global food shortages in the coming months.  The UN estimates that in the past year, global food prices have risen by almost one third, fertiliser by more than half and oil prices by almost two thirds.  Globally, more than 500,000 people are experiencing famine conditions, an increase of more than 500% since 2016.</p> <p>Today's Ireland is highly interconnected and heavily interdependent.  No longer does each household have a potato or cabbage patch.  The supermarket shelves are the sole source of food for most of our population.  A discussion on national food security could reveal some steps we should be taking.  We need regular updates from both Ministers on these pressing matters.</p></speech>

It is extraordinary that we made a decision about PDFORRA but did not include RACO in that reimagining.  I hope we can change that and that RACO can be included in those pay talks.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne referenced the issue of Ronald McDonald House, which briefed us interestingly and informatively this morning.  Those of us who have been in the existing Ronald McDonald House and have seen the benefits of the support, love and infrastructure, and the warmth of the people there, should be prompted to support the new facility in the national children's hospital.  "The house love will build" is the name of the campaign.  It is about ensuring that the families of young children receive support away from home.  That is a cause we should all support.</p> <p>The Cathaoirleach might not have heard me at the beginning of my contribution.

I welcome the kids from Longford and acknowledge their local Senator and the work he does for education in this House.</p> <p>It is timely because my question relates to my own primary school in Grange.  I would like a debate with the Minister for Education.  Schools around the country have been lucky in terms of the funding available for extensions and the building of new primary and secondary schools.  We in Grange made a successful application to the Department of Education.  However, because of rising costs, the expense involved in the application have increased.  The school went back to the Department of Education with a small increase and have been waiting some time for a decision to be made.  By the time the decision has been made, costs will have risen again.  The principal, Marie Keating, along with the board of management, has done phenomenal work.  The teachers are phenomenal in the work they do and the commitment they give.  This is an important extension for the school in Grange.  I ask the Minister to speed up that process in any way possible.  I know there are schools across the country that need funding but it is important that it is done as quickly as possible.  It would be timely to have a debate with the Minister for Education on that subject anyway.</p> <p>I have asked in the past for a debate with the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, about all the schemes she gives to rural areas across the country, including my county of Tipperary.  Those schemes include CL&Aacute;R and the town and village renewal scheme.  Those schemes serve an important purpose for areas such as mine in Tipperary.  To give one example, the village of Drangan in Tipperary has put forward a CL&Aacute;R application to do up bits of the playground and to resurface the road.  It is an important application.  My colleague, Councillor Mark Fitzgerald, has been working hard on this issue.  People in the community, such as Ailish O'Brien and others, have done an awful lot of work on this application.  It is important to get decisions made as quickly as possible on those applications.  We are lucky that we are able to fund so many of these kinds of playgrounds and community projects but we need decisions to be made as quickly as we can to get those projects over the line.  That was a very good playground and it needs to have work done to fix equipment and things like that.  I would be very grateful if we could get a decision as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I welcome the principal, Ms Glynn, sixth class teacher, Ms Lavelle, and all the students to the House.  I hope they enjoy their trip to Dublin.  I concur with the Cathaoirleach's comments that there is a homework pass for this evening and perhaps for the rest of the week.  It is a fantastic school in south Longford.  Senator Ahearn mentioned the CL&Aacute;R scheme.  I know St. Sinneach's was successful in getting a grant last year through that scheme.  Those schemes are invaluable throughout the county.  I have been involved in a CL&Aacute;R application this year on behalf of a neighbouring school in south Longford, Lenamore National School, which I hope is prioritised.  It has applied for funding to provide a sensory area for kids with needs.  There are a significant number of kids with those needs in many schools throughout the county.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, will look favourably on the application.</p><p>I concur with the comments made by Senator Buttimer and I apologise to him as I was giving someone details while he was speaking.  I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach for inviting Congressman Neal here yesterday.  It was a fantastic day for this House.  The United States of America has made a massive contribution to the Good Friday Agreement and, ultimately, peace in this country.  It was an honour for me to be here when Congressman Neal spoke and to be in the presence of other members of his committee.</p><p>I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach on the work he has done for Irish-American relations.  It is extremely important that we create links, which he spoke about, with, say, local authorities and state legislators throughout the US to make sure Ireland is always at the top of the agenda in America because many people in the House of Representatives and Senate have strong Irish-American links.  If we do not maintain those links, they will weaken over time.  We see how important those links are every St. Patrick's Day.  Ireland is one of very few countries that gets the opportunity to meet the US President and we want that to continue.  I pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach for the work that he has done, and continues to do, to foster links.  I look forward to working with him to create links with my own county of Longford and, in particular, I wish to mention state of Maryland as it has very strong links to County Longford.</p></speech>

I know Senator Carrigy's wife, &Uacute;na.  The latter group has a link to Ballinasloe as &Uacute;na Boland is from the town of Ballinasloe.  We must give all of the children a big wave because we need them to come here.  They will be here in a few years' time.  Do they know that women only make up 40% of Senators?  We need a few more girls to join us.  What do the girls think?  Can I have a thumbs up?  Yes.</p> <p>I invite everybody to Ballinasloe because the Heritage Boat Association is hosting an event to showcase barges, including a barge that dates back to 1847.  Many barges will come from Dublin and Kildare.  The River Suck branch of the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland is newly established in Ballinasloe.  I wish to thank the IWAI branches in Kildare and Athlone for donating money and gifts to help the new branch get started.  As a member of the new branch, I can say we need new members and I encourage everyone to join.  The event will be a special occasion because the marina in Ballinasloe is a wonderful amenity.  The River Suck is the largest tributary of the River Shannon so people can rent a boat at Athlone, Shannonbridge or Banagher and sail to Ballinasloe.  If people come to Ballinasloe this weekend, they will see numerous barges or really long boats.</p> <p>On Saturday, 28 May, the fleet of boats will arrive in Ballinasloe between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.  The barges will transport barrels and kegs just like in the past along the Grand Canal into Ballinasloe.  They will transport kegs of very nice stuff that children, unfortunately, cannot have yet.  On Saturday, 4 June, as part of the Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g national events, there will be children's celebrations and family activities between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.  Of course children are very welcome to come along to that event and perhaps their muinteoir, Ms Boland or Carrigy, might bring the schoolchildren to Ballinasloe for that day.</p></speech>

I am not surprised because Galway County Council has been one of the most under-funded councils for a number of years.  Unfortunately, it is official that Galway County Council has reached the bottom of the table.  Galway County Council was second last for a number of years but Meath County Council has now overtaken us but is still in the relegation zone.</p><p>Galway County Council is way behind comparable counties of the same size such as Mayo, Donegal, Tipperary and Kerry.  This situation has been known for some time and the Department officials have been very aware of same.  Many promises have been made at Department and ministerial levels to rectify the situation, yet we still await a solution.  We are being fobbed off with the excuse that a review of the local property tax is taking place.  While recognising the situation in Galway and providing a certain amount of additional funding through the former Minister of State at the Department, Deputy John Paul Phelan, the current Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the current Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the situation has not improved and it is increasingly difficult to get budgets passed.  I call for a debate on local authority funding to be arranged because we need to find solutions for counties like Galway which have huge ambitions in terms of the delivery of services by local authorities, and there is a huge demand for services by residents.  For years it was debated whether the local authority would be amalgamated with Galway City Council.  Whether right or wrong, the option to amalgamate is off the table.  We still need to arrange a stable level of funding for Galway County Council to enable it deliver services that the residents, taxpayers and local property tax payers in the county deserve.</p></speech>

I am well aware of the efforts the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, have made to solve this situation but we need a general debate in this House.</p> <p>Today, I want to concentrate on the N5 route from Strokestown to Ballaghaderreen that, unfortunately, has seen huge loss of life over the years.  As a result of the war in Ukraine, the roads contract has fallen through due to the fact Roadbridge is no longer functioning.  I am confident, having met the Taoiseach and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, that the project will be up and running.  However, in the meantime, there are huge concerns about safety in the town of Strokestown, on the outskirts of Tulsk village and in Ballinagar.  I understand Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, may do something about part of the route at Frenchpark after many politicians made representations over many years.  People are really worried about safety on these roads.  I ask the Acting Leader to ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Transport and arrange a debate so we can discuss the route, particularly the fact that the present contract has been held up due to the worsening situation in Ukraine.  I reiterate the case for inviting the Minister to attend a debate in this House to discuss many roads issues, particularly issues with the N5 route.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#L00600"><p>Earlier I tabled a Commencement matter in respect of Ukraine and the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.  There are many other things we need to do at a legislative level to support Ukraine.  I refer to Resolution 2436 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and to a number of points it made about actions that can be taken to support Ukraine at a legislative level.  For example, the first is legislating for the crime of aggression, something that is recognised now in the European Convention on Human Rights through the Kampala amendments, to which Ireland signed up in 2019.  There is an avenue there for us to talk about what is happening there, with the blockading of ports being the most simple one.  The bombing and invasion have been recognised pursuant to the Kampala amendments.  That is something we could do.  Other measures include the creation of a universal civil jurisdiction that would allow us to say that we know there are Russian assets, not just Russian state assets in Ireland but personal assets of people who are and are not the subject of sanctions.  A universal civil jurisdiction would allow us to start to seize those assets and put them towards the reconstruction of Ukraine or provide Ukraine with assistance rather than allow a situation to continue where assets are merely frozen here by actions of the Government.</p> <p>We now have a window in which we can take action against Russia.  Yes, Russia has been excluded from the Council of Europe but until 16 September we have a small window within which we can take an action against Russia in the European Court of Human Rights for breaching the European Convention on Human Rights.  Ireland should step up to the plate and make sure that we take this action.</p> <p>Finally, I welcome the fact the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, put forward &euro;4 million towards the International Criminal Court to help in the prosecution of war crimes that have been committed.  Some &euro;1 million has been delivered but I wonder if better use can be made of the remaining &euro;3 million.  Can that sum be directed specifically to the Prosecutor-General in Ukraine?  I have met her staff in Ukraine and they are very together.  As Members will know, this week they have achieved a conviction or a guilty plea in respect of one tank commander.  I think the remaining &euro;3 million might be better directed at the people on the ground who are doing this work.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As counsel before the International Criminal Court, I have nothing but praise for it but it takes time and it seems that it could be more effectively directed on the ground in Ukraine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#M00300"><p>I find myself in the unusual position that I am directing my response only to the Government side of the House.  Senator Chambers opened proceedings and spoke of the anniversary of repeal.  It is hard to believe that it is four years since we had the referendum on repeal.  She noted that it actually started 35 years ago.  We as legislators need to ensure that the will of people around equality of access is upheld and we need to ensure that there are safe access zones and that legislation is brought in.  Senator Boylan also addressed that issue.  I was pleased to stand with other Members of the Oireachtas at the Kildare Street gates to commemorate that day.</p><p>Senator Chambers also raised the mass shooting in the US.  We were all shocked last night and this morning to hear the testimony as it broke on our newspapers, radio and television about 19 children and two teachers.  It is just shocking.  That is the 27th shooting there this year.  On behalf of the House I wish to express all our condolences to the families, teachers and the communities and the people of America.  Some of responses from public representatives were abhorrent.  They said that guns were not the problem.  It was people that were the problem and we should teach teachers to use guns.  They said there should be armed police at schools rather than dealing with the whole area of guns and the fact that a young man could walk in on his 18th birthday and buy two guns, shoot his grandmother and then go on to the school.  </p><p>One of my brothers was in Texas for work last week.  He sent a photograph to the family WhatsApp after he walked into a shop and saw guns for sale because he was shocked.  Little did I think we would see something like this happen in Texas a little over a week later.  We have to do everything we can to condemn the attack and stand in solidarity with the devastated community in Texas.  We are lucky that we have very stringent controls on firearm certificates and conditions here and that is how it should be.</p><p>Senators Boyhan, Buttimer and Malcolm Byrne spoke about Congressman Richard Neal's visit here and what a historic day is was in Leinster House.  It is the one day that I was jealous that I was not here.  I was abroad on Council of Europe business.  From everything I saw and heard it really was a very significant day so I add my congratulations.  I believe that Miriam Lord covered it very well in her piece.  I did not read it but I heard something about it on the radio.  It is really important that we do everything we can to commemorate and celebrate those connections.</p><p>Senator Boyhan also raised the issue of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There are issues that are <i>sub judice</i>but he is correct in saying that people need to have confidence in the whole system.  We should certainly look for the publication of the Mulcahy report.  It is five years since its completion.  Money and time are spent on reports.  They must then be published and debated and we must look at the recommendations.  I agree that we need a debate on planning.  I would like to include in that the matter of unauthorised developments and how our planning laws deal with them because we need to do far more.  I raised that here two weeks ago.  We will certainly look for that debate.</p><p>Senator Boylan spoke about the jury selection for the Stardust inquest.  She referred to the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, having made a commitment that she would bring forward legislative proposals to ensure that the jury would commence.  That is important and we will write to the Minister on that issue.  </p><p>Senator Wall raised Naas General Hospital and the &quot;RT&Eacute; Investigates&quot; programme about sexual misconduct by doctors there.  He spoke of garda&iacute; carrying out the investigation.  We listened to the testimony of &quot;Ryan&quot;, which is not his real name.  I was struck by his bravery and integrity in talking about what he went through.  We must be very mindful of the anguish he has suffered as a result.  We do need to have a debate on patient safety and the procedures in place because part of Ryan's story was what happened when he did speak to other hospital staff.  We are very conscious of how overworked hospital staff are but we need to have proper procedures in place and to ensure they are followed.</p><p>Senator Wall also raised the welcome news yesterday for PDFORRA as did Senators Byrne, Craughwell and Buttimer.  I agree that RACO should be included but to be fair, PDFORRA started this campaign a long time before RACO joined the debate.  I want to compliment Ger Guinan and Mark Keane.  They have done excellent work in a very respectful way.  Many of us would have had meetings with them over the years.  It is high time this happened and it is really important.  I want to compliment them in particular for their sustained campaign and I add my voice to those calling for RACO to be involved.</p><p>Senator Black spoke of the shocking scenes at the funeral of the Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and how Israel has refused access to MEPs.  I think that is wrong.  They should be allowed in.  The Seanad should ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to write to the Israeli ambassador.  Diplomatic relations are important, as Senator Black said, but there are areas where we must take a stand.  This is one.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne also spoke about the leak of police files about the Uyghur community in China and the systemic abuse and genocide being carried out there.  He is correct that sometimes when things like Russia's war against Ukraine happen we can lose sight of other human rights abuses happening around the world.  We just cannot do so.  What is happening to the Uyghur community is absolutely shocking.  We will write to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to share our shock about the abhorrent human rights abuse by China against the Uyghur community.</p><p>Senator Lombard spoke about car rental for tourists.  He mentioned how he got a quote of &euro;1,800 for ten days.  Coincidentally, I spoke to an official coming here next week for a Council of Europe meeting where representatives from 48 countries will come to Dublin.  He has a connection with Ireland and he wanted to hire a car for four days.  He was having a problem finding a hotel for two days.  I had recommended hotels in Kildare to him previously.  He was quoted &euro;1,500 for four days.  For that he could have bought a car, sold it on and made a profit.  Now he is not renting a car and is staying with a friend rather than staying in a hotel outside Dublin.  It is shocking.</p><p>One reason for this situation, and I do not know why, is that the car rental fleet is 40% of what it was in 2019.  Why?  Is it because the price of second-hand cars has gone up?  I really do not know.  It must be investigated, I completely agree, because it is important that Ireland has a reputation for value for money.  For the first time in three years we are able to open our country and our world-renowned hospitality to people.  We want to ensure that they have easy access to accommodation and car hire and not at exorbitant prices.  We cannot have our tourism undermined.  We should look for a debate with the Minister on that issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Craughwell also raised the matter of the tender process and said the Secretary General had refused to meet the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  He also spoke about the Air Corps being slighted.  We will certainly write to the Minister regarding that and will request the Secretary General attends the committee.<br/><br/>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about Limerick College of Further Education, UL and the expansion of courses there around film apprenticeships and retrofitting, in addition to Ronald McDonald House.  Senator Buttimer also attended the presentation this morning.  The fact a new 52-bedroom house for families has been opened is phenomenal.  The emotional and financial stress on families when they have a very sick child is huge on so many levels.  It is wonderful to see the extra supports that are being given.<br/><br/>Senator Keogan raised the spectre of inflation and the issue of access to food and food security that is being discussed in Davos.  While she is correct that for far too long a lot of food in this country has been sold below cost, which has caused a major problem for producers, we should also be doing everything we can to encourage allotments and community gardens for people to grow their own food where they can.  Maybe we could look for a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that.<br/><br/>Senator Ahearn spoke about the primary school in Grange, Tipperary, and rising costs.  My understanding is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made an announcement about two weeks ago that due to inflation the Department will step in, rightly so, on capital grants.  Following that, I received a number of phone calls, as I am sure Senator Ahearn and many Members did, to see if the sports capital grants could be included in that.  I contacted the Minister's office and, while they will not be included, it is looking at doing something.  I agree that when extensions are needed, they are needed immediately, generally speaking, because we are playing catch-up all the time in this regard.  The Senator asked for a debate with the Minister for Rural and Community Development on CL&Aacute;R schemes.  Tipperary is very lucky to get CL&Aacute;R; I wish Kildare could.  It is important to have clarity on timelines relating to decisions and when funding can come through.<br/><br/>While welcoming the visitors in the Gallery from Longford, Senator Carrigy spoke about the importance of the Irish influence in American politics.  I remember a book I read by Conor O'Clery, <i>The Greening of the White House</i>, which was an excellent book on the influence Ireland brought to bear on the White House.  In that context, it is important to mention Ms Trina Vargo, who was foreign affairs adviser to the late Senator Ted Kennedy.  She set up the US-Ireland Alliance based on that premise because the late Senator Kennedy felt there would be a time when Ireland would not have the influence it has and he wanted to ensure young people on campuses across America would have the opportunity to learn about and understand Ireland, with the hope they would one day be influential in their own country and in politics.<br/><br/>Senator Kyne spoke about Galway being bottom of the league for <i>per capita</i>council funding and looked for a debate on local authority funding.  We need that debate and I will certainly write to both Ministers involved in that.  That is where key funding is needed in all our county and city councils throughout the country.  We need a sustainable level of funding for all our local authorities to be able to carry out the very important and significant work they do.  We should look for that debate and for accountability and transparency in funding.  I have often heard from executives in Kildare County Council that it is one local authority but has two D&aacute;il constituencies, and it certainly does not get enough funding either.  I agree with that.<br/><br/>Senator Murphy asked for a debate on the N5 route from Strokestown to Ballaghaderreen and spoke about the major safety concerns that are there.  Road safety is absolutely an issue but he has spoken to the Minister and the Taoiseach specifically on the N5 issue and the Senator believes the project will be back on track.  Maybe it is worthy of a Commencement debate also.<br/><br/>Senator Ward spoke about mutual recognition of qualifications from Ukraine.  I completely agree.  There was a Commencement debate in the House last week, during which this matter was asked about in respect of pharmacists, for example.  Pharmacists will say otherwise, but I have no doubt there is a shortage of pharmacists in this country.  Ukraine is not one of those countries that is allowed a fast-track into pharmacy here and I believe it should be.  I agree with the Senator that we should certainly look at that mutual recognition.  He also addressed the avenue through the Council of Europe declaration in respect of how we can support Ukrainians and that small window where we could look at Russian assets that are in Ireland, and the possibility of seizing them and using them to finance for the reconstruction of Ukraine.  His final suggestion related to the &euro;4 million given to the International Criminal Court by Ireland and the suggestion the remaining &euro;3 million might be of better use on the ground.  I do not disagree.  We certainly will write to the Minister and make that suggestion.</p></speech>

This Bill provides for significant enhancements to the statutory framework for the protection of whistleblowers in Ireland.  It updates the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 to provide for the transposition of the EU whistleblowing directive into Irish law, the establishment of a new office of the protected disclosures commissioner and to strengthen and clarify a number of areas of the 2014 Act where issues have arisen since enactment.</p> <p>There can be no dispute about the importance of providing robust statutory protections for whistleblowers.  Freedom of speech, including the freedom to speak up about wrongdoing without fear of retaliation, is the one of the cornerstones of an open, fair and democratic society.  We are all aware of a whole range of matters of vital public interest that would not have come to light were it not for the bravery of those who spoke up.  Sadly, there are still too many instances where raising a concern has come at a great personal cost to whistleblowers and their families.  This Bill represents a big step in the right direction in this regard.</p> <p>The Protected Disclosures Act was innovative legislation for its time.  When it was enacted in 2014, Ireland was only the sixth country in the EU to introduce comprehensive legislation for the protection of whistleblowers.  The Act remains highly regarded internationally as one of the strongest laws of its type in the world.  Many of the provisions of the EU directive are in place in Ireland courtesy of the 2014 Act.  The Act provides for multiple channels to report wrongdoing so that if one channel fails for any reason, there are other options for workers to speak up in safety.  The Act also prohibits any form of retaliation against a worker who makes a protected disclosure and provides protection from any civil or criminal liability for any disclosure of confidential information necessary to report a wrongdoing.</p> <p>The directive goes a number of steps further, however.  It significantly widens the scope of persons entitled to protection for speaking up.  It requires medium and large enterprises to establish formal internal reporting channels for their employees.  It sets out very clear steps that must be taken within clear timelines in respect of following up on all reports that are made.  All of these changes are to be welcomed as they will further strengthen our legislation and ensure that Ireland remains a leading country in terms of the legal protections we provide to whistleblowers.</p> <p>The publication of the initial proposals for the EU directive coincided with the statutory review of the 2014 Act, which was published in 2018.  A decision was taken at that time that any recommendations for legislative change would be addressed during the transposition of the directive and this is what we are doing.  Development of the legislation has also been informed by the public consultation on the transposition held in the summer of 2020.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The statutory review found that the 2014 Act was broadly operating as intended but a number of implementation issues were identified.  A key finding was the need for clearer direction for recipients as to what to do with the reports they receive.  The new requirements in this regard, arising from the directive, go a long way towards addressing this.</p><p>The statutory review also raised significant concerns about how disclosures made to Ministers under section 8 of the Act should be handled.  The Bill proposes a number of changes to the operation of the ministerial channel to address these issues, and the concerns raised in the third interim report of the disclosures tribunal.  Key to this is a proposal in the Bill to establish a new office of the protected disclosures commissioner who will, among other things, take on responsibility for directing reports to the most appropriate persons to address the matter concerned.  This will ensure an independent and thorough follow-up of all disclosures made to Ministers.  The commissioner will also take on the role of a prescribed person of last resort, ensuring there is always an independent external person for workers to report to, if needed.  This role will be taken on by the Ombudsman. This is in line with trends in other jurisdictions where national ombudsmen have been given similar responsibilities in this area.</p><p>The general scheme of the Bill was published May 2021 and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, published its pre-legislative scrutiny report in December 2021.  The committee, which includes a number of Members from this House, clearly put a significant amount of time and effort into hearing submissions from witnesses and into preparing the report.</p><p>The pre-legislative scrutiny process has proved very valuable in bringing all parties together in supporting the development of the Bill.  This will be a model for how the pre-legislative scrutiny process adds value to the legislative process.  I commend all members of the committee in this regard.</p><p>The Bill was published in February 2022, and it took on board many of the recommendations in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  On Committee Stage in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, a number of amendments to the Bill were made to implement a number of outstanding recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  These included: a provision allowing persons who made protected disclosures prior to the coming into force of this legislation to request and obtain feedback on the actions taken or envisaged to be taken on foot of their disclosures; a provision allowing reporting persons to request and obtain further feedback at three-month intervals, in addition to the initial feedback required under the directive; an amendment to the conditions for reporting to a prescribed person under section 7 of the principal Act to ensure no conflict with a non-regression clause in Article 25.2 of the directive; a provision requiring that when a prescribed person or the protected disclosures commissioner needs to transmit a report to another prescribed person for action, that this be done in a secure manner and in accordance with data protection law; a provision requiring that a statutory review of the legislation be carried out five years after enactment; and a provision for the protected disclosures commissioner to make an annual report on the operation of the legislation.  All of these amendments arose from the recommendations in the pre-legislative scrutiny report, or from suggestions made when the Bill was debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>I will now turn and main provisions of the Bill.  As this is amending legislation, some sections need to be read in conjunction with the principal Act, which is the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  Some sections of the Bill are also quite technical, and in this regard I will make my officials available to any Member if any further technical briefing on this Bill is required.</p><p>I will outline the Parts of the Bill.  Part 1, comprising sections 1 to 3, inclusive, contains a number of standard legislative provisions concerning the Short Title and commencement and, as amending legislation, identifies the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 as being the principal Act being amended.</p><p>Part 2 comprises six chapters, each of which in some way amend or extend the principal Act.  Chapter 1, comprising sections 4 to 7, inclusive, sets out the scope of application of the legislation.  Of particular note in section 4 is the amended definition of "worker", which provides for the expansion of the scope of the Act to include volunteers, board members, shareholders and job applicants, as these are required by the directive.</p><p>Section 5 is a standard provision concerning the making of orders and regulations under the Act.  Section 6 amends the definition of a "protected disclosure" to explicitly cover any breaches of the EU laws specified in the directive and for the insertion of a new section 5A into the Act, which provides that the Act does not apply to personal employment grievances, in order to address last December's ruling of the Supreme Court in the Baranya case.</p><p>Section 7 provides that persons who make anonymous disclosures are still entitled to the protections of the Act if their identity is deduced and if they suffer retaliation.</p><p>Chapter 2, comprising sections 8 to 13, inclusive, concerns the design and operation of internal and external reporting channels to employers and prescribed persons.  Section 8 provides that private sector entities with 50 or more employees must establish formal whistleblowing channels.  A derogation until December 2023 is provided for medium-sized enterprises with between 50 and 249 employees.  This section also provides that the Minister can lower this threshold in certain sectors where there is a high risk of serious wrongdoing, if required.</p><p>Section 9 sets out how the internal channels should operate and requires that all reports be acknowledged within seven days, the manner in which reports should be followed up, and that feedback be given to the reporting person within three months.  These rules are at the core of the directive and, therefore, are restated and reaffirmed throughout the Bill.</p><p>Section 10 similarly requires prescribed persons to establish reporting channels for workers in the sectors they regulate and section 11 provides, again, that prescribed persons must acknowledge, follow up and give feedback to reporting persons in respect of the reports they receive.</p><p>Section 12 concerns reports made to Ministers of the Government and sets out new conditions for making these reports.  It requires that Ministers shall transmit all reports they receive to the new protected disclosures commissioner.</p><p>Section 13 amends section 10 of the principal Act and sets out new conditions for the making of public disclosures.  These conditions are significantly simplified compared with the original provision in the principal Act.</p><p>Chapter 3 concerns the office of the protected disclosures commissioner and comprises sections 14 and 15, inclusive.  Section 14 inserts six new sections, sections 10A to 10F, inclusive, into the Act after section 10.  Section 10A provides for the establishment of the new office of the protected disclosures commissioner in the Office of the Ombudsman.  Section 10B provides for the commissioner to have formal channels and procedures for handling disclosures in the same manner as apply to prescribed persons.</p><p>I can continue or come back in later.</p></speech>

I welcome his work on the Bill.  It is great to see the legislation updated.  It has been there since 2014.  The Bill is very important.  Of late, we have lots of experience of whistleblowers, what they can and cannot do, and how their lives are destroyed.  Sergeant McCabe, of course, comes to mind, as well as others.  I really welcome the Minister of State's work on the Bill.  It is very important.  We have seen the huge importance that protected disclosures legislation has had in Irish life since it was introduced.  We think of all the big cases but it is also important to remember that hundreds of disclosures about issues big and small have been made in the years since the legislation was enacted.  The improvements and protections in this amending Bill are hugely welcome and would have made a huge difference to people in the past, including Sergeant McCabe, if we had had them sooner.  It is great that the Minister of State is the one who saw the need to do this and has improved it vastly.  It was badly needed.</p> <p>Just last week I met Ms Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur for human rights defenders - I am an ambassador with Front Line Defenders - and she raised a few interesting issues.  An element in this Bill might be very good for what she was looking for.  One provision of the Bill extends the scope to volunteers, unpaid trainees, board members, shareholders and job applicants, none of whom had any protections before.  This is a huge one.  Front-line defenders are, in most cases, volunteers and it is very important that we have included them.  As a person who has volunteered a lot, I am aware that there are often no protections for volunteers in this regard.  It is very important that the Minister of State has included this.</p> <p>Cases have been documented around the world by Irish companies.  In one example, Moneypoint power station changed a supplier as a result of a complaint made about it accessing coal from the Cerrej&oacute;n mine in Colombia.  That mine was absolute carnage when it came to human rights abuses.  Thanks to the legislation, the ESB is not getting coal from there now.  Unfortunately, it is still getting coal, and we are working on that as well, but at least it is no longer from the most inhumane coal mine in the world.  It just shows the importance of this type of legislation.</p> <p>Thankfully, the EU has been looking at this and has released a draft directive on due diligence, about which I have also been having meetings.  It is looking at the supply chain, ethics, and human rights abuses on the supply chain.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State indicate if there is anything we can do to strengthen provisions in our national legislation with regard to whistleblowing that could help people to draw attention to abuses in the supply chain by Irish companies?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is just something to think about taking further.  We import goods from companies that have very questionable human rights and pay standards.  I will not mention any in particular - or I might.  Fair trade was one thing, but now we also have images of sweatshops, child labour and so on.  We have not yet gone far enough in Ireland to look at that and at what we allow in.  I know that the Minister of State is doing lots of good work on the circular economy, carbon emissions and much tighter procurement, but we have to look at the ethics around procurement and what we import as well.  If we have this really good legislation here in Ireland, we should demand the same of Irish companies working abroad.  I will give the House two examples.  There is the case of Smurfit Kappa.  It has scored zero on Trinity Business School's human rights due diligence indicators.  That is worrying because we expect Irish companies to have the highest standards not just in Ireland but everywhere else as all humans are equal, so it is important we look at that.</p></speech>

This is not <i>Animal Farm</i>.  We are all equal.  If people are to be paid properly in Ireland, they should be paid properly in other countries as well.  We have to have proper standards in the workplace on pay, clean air etc.  We have to take care of the workers no matter where they are in the world.</p><p>This is outside the scope of the Bill, but I wish to put one case on the Seanad record.  It relates to an Irish citizen in Togo who has been in prison without trial for the past three and a half years.

This links into it, if you will just let me finish, Acting Chairperson.  Mary Lawlor is the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders.  She highlighted to me the need to include human rights defenders as stakeholders in the EU directive.  I think this Bill will help us strengthen the EU directive.  As a country, since we have this strong improvement to the law around volunteers being protected, perhaps we could look at bringing that to EU level.  I will probably work with our MEPs on this as well.  This law will help us to bring the case to EU level to make sure that the directive is watertight in protecting people such as the front-line defenders, who are volunteers and who are now protected in the amendment the Government is bringing in.</p> <p>This is very relevant in some ways because we are talking about human rights.  We all know that if one puts one's head above the parapet, often one gets into trouble.  In Ireland we are very lucky in some ways because, as countries go and protest goes, it is a very safe place for freedom of speech, speaking out and calling out issues around employment and companies, whereas in other countries one sees people such as the girl in Togo who has been in jail for the past three and a half years.  She is an Irish citizen and nothing is happening.  There are no supports for her at all.  That would not happen in Ireland.  We can give out about this country all we want but it is a really safe place to be a protestor and to be a worker who stands up for one's rights, compared with other countries, where people get jailed just for asking questions.</p> <p>That is why this Bill is so important.  If we want to set the standards, as we are doing today with this legislation, improving Irish law to protect volunteers, including people such as front-line defenders, we could take that to the EU directive and maybe look at strengthening the wording of this directive to make it watertight for people.  As someone who has never been able to keep her mouth shut in calling out problems from a very young age, I feel the need to speak up for others who do so on much more serious cases.  The human rights abuses that go on in other countries are appalling, as we know.  We do not always think about it when we spend our money, unfortunately, but it is really good that we have this in place today.  I hope we can set the standards higher for the EU.  I am sorry for mentioning one Irish company, but I hope that all Irish companies, no matter where they are in the world, be it Russia, Colombia, Togo or South America - Irish companies are very successful - see all the humans they deal with as equals and treat them as we would want our own to be treated.  This legislation makes it such that everybody is treated well and their human rights are respected.  We should expect the same from every Irish company anywhere in the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#Q00800"><p>The Minister of State is welcome to the House.  I thank him.  It would have been good to hear his presentation in full.  This is a very comprehensive piece of work.  Clearly, the Minister of State has engaged right across all sectors to try to bring forward the best possible legislation in this area.</p> <p>Protected disclosure is something that has bothered me quite considerably since I came into this House because I think there is a massive misconception out there as to what precisely protected disclosure is and how one should go about making a disclosure.  Members of this House and of the D&aacute;il constantly receive blanket emails from members of the public who have an issue with an employer, a public service or whatever else.  They always front up such submissions as protected disclosures.  They have contacted everybody in the world to tell them they are making a protected disclosure, thereby doing away with any chance of protecting their own good names.  Very frequently the issue that is raised with Members of the Oireachtas is not really conducive to protected disclosure.  I am delighted that the Government is putting a commissioner in place and that that will allow people who are uncertain as to how to go about making a disclosure to go through the office of the commissioner, who will then direct them to the correct place.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Garvey, made reference to people on the front line and voluntary groups.  There is no doubt, from recent evidence that has come to Oireachtas joint committees and to Members of the Oireachtas individually, but that there is a desperate need within the voluntary sector for an avenue through which to pursue a protected disclosure where people believe their personal safety or the safety of their colleagues is at stake.</p> <p>Moreover, when it comes to improving organisations, all of us - none of us are immune from this - when we are in management positions in organisations sometimes believe that the protection of the organisation is more important than the protection of the individual worker.  I think that that is addressed in the Bill.  Workers will have an avenue to go down to make their disclosures and, because of the reporting mechanisms that have been built in, once a disclosure is made there is a feedback sequence that can be followed.  From that point of view, this will be really important.</p> <p>Section 16, which protects the individual's identity, is an excellent piece of work.  We have all come across situations that needed rectifying.  I have done so, particularly in my trade union background, in my teaching background and in industry before that.  Sadly, the tendency is to isolate the person who identifies the problem and to make him or her seem to be the demon rather than somebody who is trying to improve the workforce for everybody.  From that point of view, the Bill will go a long way, particularly with the use of the commissioner.</p> <p>Employers need a bit of education here.  Not everybody who makes a protected disclosure does so for malicious purposes.  Even as a trade unionist, I can appreciate that some people will be malicious in seeking to use this legislation in order to inflict some sort of pain on their employer.  Protections are needed for the employer or for named people, shall we say, such that the legislation is not used for malicious purposes.  In fairness, I think 99 out of 100 people would never do that, but the important thing is that we look at the person making the disclosure as having given an honest and fair disclosure and that it is up the employer to prove that that is wrong.  From that point of view, the Bill is really welcome.</p> <p>Alongside protected disclosures, and in the same general area, is bullying in the workplace.  One of the real problems for somebody making a disclosure is that he or she will be subjected to bullying in the workplace.  By its very nature, bullying in the workplace is a cowardly one-on-one act that most people are not aware of.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Most people will know that bullies have a street image and a private image, and in the private image they are horrible people who attack others, not personally but psychologically or mentally.  There are several instances of people who have taken their own lives as a result of bullying in the workplace.  It is something we have to examine in the context of protected disclosures because the release of a person's name can lead to that person being identified, even by colleagues.  Consider a situation where there is a safety issue and the safety issue has been brought to the management.  Everybody has been happy enough working with it, but there is one guy who insists that, for example, the safety rope is in place before the job starts or the like.  He can be seen to be a crank when, in fact, he is trying to protect everybody else.  There is an opportunity with this legislation to ensure that such information gets back.</p><p>I have three suggestions for the Minister of State.  One is that we educate employers with respect to their responsibilities for protected disclosures.  Having the legislation in place is one thing but to educate people as to how to process it is vital.  Second, we should educate the general public.  A member of the public should be able to make a protected disclosure against an organisation about a particular thing he or she observes without fear of reprisal of any sort.  Third, we must get into the public domain what is not a protected disclosure, more importantly, than what is a protected disclosure.  If we do that, we will go a long way.</p><p>I compliment the Minister of State for bringing this legislation forward and I am grateful to him for his decision to make his officials available as this Bill goes through the House.  If there are issues that we wish to query or on which we want to have more information, his officials will be available to us.  I hope the Bill passes through the House smoothly and that we get it implemented as quickly as possible.  I thank the Minister of State for his time today.</p></speech>

I am conscious that we have a Member of the House who, 21 years ago, disclosed a very important issue and it is only recently that it was vindicated, so I look forward to hearing what Senator Clonan has to say.  If one thinks it is difficult for people to make a protected disclosure now, can one imagine what it was like 21 years ago in that particular organisation?</p></speech>

The 2014 Act has afforded vital protection to whistleblowers, but it is not perfect and we have learned much since the Act came into operation.  There have been a number of high-profile cases in recent years, as has been mentioned by colleagues, which showed that we can never be complacent about the protection of those who are reporting wrongdoing by either public or private sector organisations.  It is important that we take the opportunity now to improve our legislative framework to continue to deal with protected disclosures in a fair and proper manner.  The implementation of the EU directive and the amendments proposed in the Bill before us will further strengthen protections for whistleblowers and maintain Ireland's position as a leader in this area.</p> <p>The Bill will extend the scope of the legislation by providing protection for volunteers, and I cannot understand why they were not protected initially under the 2014 Act, shareholders, board members and job applicants by transposing the EU whistleblowing directive into law.  Are there any other job titles that are not protected under the legislation?  I realise that it is difficult to legislate for everything in a list form, but I am concerned about what professions are not protected.  The legislation will lead to the establishment in private sector organisations with 50 or more employees of formal channels and procedures that will permit their employees to make protected disclosures, as is currently the case in the public sector.  This will mean that employers and prescribed persons who receive protected disclosures will be required to acknowledge them, follow up on the allegations made and give feedback to the reporting person within three months of the disclosure.  These changes will be monitored and enforced by the inspectorate of the Workplace Relations Commission.  This will give greater certainty to both employers and whistleblowers as to what will happen when a protected disclosure is made.</p> <p>The establishment of the new office of the protected disclosures commissioner in the Office of the Ombudsman to support the operation of the new legislation is to be welcomed.  It will allow the commissioner to direct protected disclosures to the most appropriate body when it is unclear which body is responsible.  It will thus ensure that all protected disclosures will be dealt with appropriately.  The commissioner will also have responsibility for transmitting all protected disclosures made to Ministers to the most appropriate authority for assessment and thorough follow-up.  A further change that I welcome is that in civil proceedings the burden of proof will be reversed so it will fall to the employer to prove that any alleged act of penalisation did not occur because the person made a protected disclosure.</p> <p>We have a comprehensive whistleblowing law in place in the form of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, and the transposition of the whistleblowing directive will require some amendments to that Act.  As I said, the other points I had intended to raise have been dealt with by my colleagues and I look forward to the Minister of State's reply to them.  However, I have some brief questions.  What protections are there for employers, be they State or private, from vindictive complaints?  There is no doubt that they will occur.</p> <p>I also have a concern about anonymous complaints.  I can understand why they are anonymous due to the reality of the situation, and I have experienced it with people who are related to me.  When one makes a protected disclosure one becomes a whistleblower, which is a term I do not like to be frank, and one is targeted.  I can understand why people would wish to make anonymous complaints, but there is a danger in that as well.  I am concerned about it, in that anybody can make a complaint about anybody and the person does not have to put his or her name to it.  There is a difficulty in that.  I can understand the reason for it, but I believe it could be open to abuse.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Diarmuid Wilson:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2017"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2017&amp;amp;pid=DiarmuidWilson&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I would be interested in seeing what job titles are not covered by this legislation and what the reasons for that are.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.</p></speech>

It is always important that legislation be reviewed and improved as time goes on, given that situations change.  Even though 2014 was not that long ago, the Act was groundbreaking legislation for the time and, as the Minister of State mentioned, one of the strongest Acts on whistleblowing across the EU.  However, it is important that we always consider how to strengthen it.</p> <p>"Protected disclosure" or "whistleblowing" can have an array of meanings.  Widely defined, it applies to the following: the commission of criminal offences; a failure to comply with legal obligations; endangering the health and safety of individuals; damaging the environment; a miscarriage of justice; a misuse of public funds; oppressive, discriminatory, grossly negligent or grossly mismanaged acts or omissions by a public body; and the concealment or destruction of information about any of the above wrongdoings.  This array is important to note.</p> <p>The original Act covers employees, former employees, trainees, people working under contract for services, independent contractors, agency workers, people on work experience and garda&iacute;.  For whatever reason, it does not cover volunteers, although public bodies can, if they wish, investigate reports of wrongdoing from volunteers.  The new amendments to the Act will include protections for board members, which is important, shareholders, volunteers, unpaid trainees and job applicants who make protected disclosures.  Board members do an important job and they come across information on which they have a responsibility to act, so being brought under the protection of whistleblower legislation is important.</p> <p>One of the foundation stones of whistleblowing is the retention of anonymity.  Our problem is that we are in a small country.  While I will not say that everyone knows one another, people know, people hear and people talk in local authorities and State agencies.  Gossip is currency.  No matter how anonymous a protected disclosure is, it will get out there.  We have seen this in high-profile cases and how the impact is not just on the whistleblower, but on his or her spouse, partner and children.  If the State closes ranks on a person, it can be a lonely place for the whistleblower-----</p></speech>

We have all seen instances where someone in a company or public body is not even whistleblowing, but is instead just challenging or looking for improvements.  That can be unwelcome at times, and it can be a very lonely place for a person in those circumstances.</p> <p>I note the protections as regards information.  Information leaks, so it is important that there are safeguards relating to encryption and so on within the Bill.  Once upon a time, one would have had to hand someone information physically.  Nowadays, it can be done electronically, for example, by copying something on one's phone and sending a WhatsApp message.  I am not in any way an expert on encryption security, but I am concerned about how easy it is to pass on information.</p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned a threshold of 50 to 249 employees, with some leeway for companies to improve their data protections and so on.  What responsibilities do companies with fewer than 50 employees have?  While I appreciate that we do not want to overburden any employer with costs, what would happen with a protected disclosure in such cases and what responsibility would the employer have to ensure privacy?</p> <p>It is important to note that grievances may also be protected disclosures.  If someone has a concern or complaint about selection criteria or a promotion and feels that there are questions to be answered &ndash; I have concerns following questions raised with me about a certain public body &ndash; such issues need to be examined.</p> <p>Regarding the formal channels and procedures for making protected disclosures, it is important that workers know what they have to do and how to do it, and that the information they provide is protected and secure.</p> <p>It is important that the protected disclosures commissioner be located within the Office of the Ombudsman.  We do not need a new body.</p> <p>Section 8, which amends section 6 of the principal Act, relates to a person employed by a public body who makes a protected disclosure prior to the enactment of the Bill.  This is important and welcome.</p> <p>Section 17 inserts section 16A in the principal Act and relates to the protection of the identities of persons named in the report.  In a situation I am dealing with, an anonymous complaint was made and received in a certain Department.  It led to an investigation and the suspension of the person.  I have received follow-up letters from employers within said organisation &ndash; again, anonymously &ndash; naming people even though they are under investigation and stating that the Garda would be investigating the matter in the coming weeks.  I am concerned about the level of confidentiality.  This comes back to how we are a small country.  Be they all in one building or scattered around the country, employees in public bodies talk and know what is happening, so the level of privacy in such cases is not as high as one would imagine.  Legislating for this is difficult, though, because gossip is currency and everyone loves a bit of gossip.  When a complaint is made in the fashion we are discussing under this legislation, it is a serious issue and needs to be investigated seriously.  People need to be confident that, when they make such a complaint, the information is secure and they and their anonymity are protected insofar as possible.</p></speech>

He is welcome.</p> <p>The Bill is to be welcomed for the most part.  My colleagues in the D&aacute;il have played a key role in terms of amendments to the Bill.  Improving the existing legislation is long overdue.  Down the years, we have heard all too often of the horror stories and treatment of whistleblowers when they came forward and spoke out.  Attempts by authorities to protect their reputations have often resulted in destroying the whistleblowers' reputations.  There is usually a circling of the wagons and a casting of aspersions on the characters or motivations of the whistleblowers.  However, whistleblowers play a vital role in our society.  It is well known that whistleblowing is one of the most effective ways of stopping wrongdoing.  Many cases of corruption and fraud are exposed by workers reporting same to their employers, regulators or the press.</p> <p>It needs to be said that the Bill only came about because of the EU&rsquo;s whistleblowing directive and its mandatory reporting requirements as opposed to a desire by the Government to improve our existing legislation on protected disclosures.  However, from what we have seen in the D&aacute;il debates and the extensive work completed by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the Minister has worked well with all parties and none and has taken on board some of the issues raised by academics and groups such as Transparency International and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was engagement with bodies representing the legal profession and those working within mental health services.  All of this engagement played a valuable role in helping to shape the 60 recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  I would also like to acknowledge all of the work my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues, Deputies Mair&eacute;ad Farrell and Buckley, have put into this Bill.  They worked as constructively as possible with the Government parties at each stage.  They had introduced legislation to amend the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 last December and, I believe, many of Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell's proposed amendments were accepted.  However, there are still a few concerns I would like to raise with the Minister of State.</p><p>Removing the right to make protected disclosures directly to a Minister under section 8 is a retrograde step.  Experts who appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach were also of this view.  The Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser had similar concerns.  There are legitimate concerns that this could violate the non-regression clause in the directive, which states that the transposition must not be used as an opportunity to lower existing standards.  New restrictive conditions are introduced which must be met before a public service worker can make a disclosure to the Minister.  This means that these workers will generally have to exhaust the internal procedures in their workplace before making a protected disclosure to the Minister.  Our amendments in this regard propose the deletion of the entire section on the new stepped procedure.</p><p>I differ with my good colleague, Senator Wilson, on explicitly exempting relevant organisations from accepting anonymous disclosures because there are very real reasons why someone may need to make an anonymous disclosure.  In the case of an instance of child abuse or something of that nature, a person may wish to hide his or her identity.  Certain organisations should not be able to refuse to accept such disclosures.</p><p>On rejecting protected disclosures that can be characterised as interpersonal grievances, if a protected disclosure can be characterised as deriving from an interpersonal grievance, for instance, if bullying was involved, the employer would be able to channel this complaint down the road of a respect and dignity complaint rather than a protected disclosure.  This would lower protections for someone making a genuine protected disclosure which has been misclassified as a bullying complaint.  If there is serious wrongdoing that someone wishes to reveal, the motivation of the discloser should not be grounds to prevent acceptance as a protected disclosure and to deny the worker the protections he or she would receive as a result of having made one.</p><p>My fourth concern relates to the introduction of criminal penalties for knowingly making false reports.  This is likely to be used as a deterrent by employers to discourage people from making protected disclosures.  For example, as part of the information employers must provide to employees, a warning that employees could face criminal sanction could be included, which could have a chilling effect.</p><p>I have a couple of other points to make.  On the resourcing of the new office, some concerns have been raised with regard to making sure this resourcing is adequate.  There has been talk of this new office having three staff members, which would clearly not be adequate.  I would welcome any assurances the Minister of State can give in that regard.  I support the point Senator Garvey made with regard to including human rights defenders and front-line defenders.  I wonder if the Senator would consider submitting an amendment on this matter on Committee Stage and how the Minister of State would feel about such an amendment.</p><p>There is an opportunity here in the Seanad to look at these issues further before the Bill goes back to the D&aacute;il, which it will as the Minister of State has indicated that he proposes amendments to it, which are also welcome.  I acknowledge that there are difficulties with the issue of the retrospective application of the Bill but, if anything can be worked out in order to expand protection for whistleblowers who fall through the cracks, that would be very worthwhile.  Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the passage of this Bill.  We hope the Minister of State will continue to engage constructively with us, particularly with regard to the amendments we intend to table on the points I have raised.</p></speech>

I very much welcome this Bill.  As has already been alluded to, the Government is late in transposing the directive.  The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach carried out really good pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, however.  I understand that the Minister of State has signalled in the D&aacute;il that he is very much open to amendments proposed in the Seanad.  That is to be welcomed.  I will put on the record that we owe great thanks to a number of groups that came before the committee during its meetings on the pre-legislative scrutiny.  I refer to Transparency International, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the journalist Mick Clifford and others who contributed.</p> <p>Any of us who have dealt with, advocated for or represented people who hold information about wrongdoing will know the frustration and the enormous personal, physical and mental toll those individuals and their families face in trying to vindicate their allegations, protect their own integrity and, ultimately, protect the public interest, or a private interest, as the case may be.  The broadening and deepening of the scope of this Bill is very much to be welcomed.  It is very important that Senator Clonan is here in the Chamber.  I am delighted to have him as a Senator and I look forward to his contribution because listening to personal experiences is extremely important.</p> <p>It has already been said that Ireland is one of a small number of countries that has legislation in this space.  Of course, it was my colleague, Deputy Howlin, who brought forward the legislation in 2014.  I am glad that we are updating and reforming that legislation now.  I will talk about some of the concerns in a second but first I will note that it is positive that we are seeing the protected disclosure legislation extended to unpaid trainees, volunteers, shareholders, board members and job applicants.  These are people who may be on the margins of organisations but still very much part of them.  It is also positive that we are putting in place more defined timelines and that a protected disclosures office is to be established.  I have dealt with two cases of protected disclosure.  Any of us who has personal experience of dealing with individuals who have lodged a protected disclosure or who have listened to Michael Clifford will know of the exceedingly and excruciatingly long time it can take for a protected disclosure to be processed.  I was struck by something Michael Clifford said, which was that it was only when he published information surrounding a protected disclosure that an investigator was appointed, often after the investigation having been delayed for months or longer.  In that respect, establishing a protected disclosures office is really important.</p> <p>Others have mentioned the need to resource that office.  That will be absolutely crucial given the public agencies and Departments that new office will be up against.  I am struck by one case in particular I know of in which the buck has effectively been passed between two Departments.  They both have responsibility for this particular issue but neither is willing to take it on.  This new office is going to come up against very powerful forces so we need to see it adequately resourced when it is established.</p> <p>With regard to concerns about the Bill, an issue that came up as very important during pre-legislative scrutiny, and which also came up in the D&aacute;il, is the issue of retrospective application of the Bill for investigations that have been commenced but left uncompleted.  The very nature of many of the protected disclosures is that they have been left hanging for a long period.  I am reassured that the Minister of State is going to table amendments in this regard in the Seanad.  We look forward to the detail of those.  It is really important that we see as wide a scope as possible with regard to that retrospective application.</p> <p>My second main concern relates to the organisations to which the provisions will apply.  I have read the arguments justifying the minimum threshold of 50 but I must say that I do not buy them.  It is important to say that the responsibilities imposed by the Bill are to ensure that a process is in place for an event which is usually rare but which is very important.  There seems to be a presumption that the making of a protected disclosure is very common or frequent but we know that it is not.  There are many people who decided previously not to make a protected disclosure when they should have but, by and large, this is not an everyday occurrence.  When we talk about the costs to businesses, we need to put things in perspective.  Particularly for smaller organisations, it is precisely because they are more informal and less structured that the potential for victimisation and penalisation is all the greater, as is the deterrent to making a protected disclosure.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is for that reason we need to have formal processes in place in all organisations and that staff are made aware of them.  I am struck because Transparency International talks about how only 30% of private sector employers have some sort of process in place.  To me, it is not necessarily about the process itself; it is about the clear message that is sent to every member of staff that there is a facility to be able to lodge a protected disclosure if they see wrongdoing.  It has been said that the absence or presence of an internal process does not diminish a worker's right to report wrongdoing.  I recognise that there is a distinction between the right of a worker to report versus the mandated responsibility of a firm to have systems in place but again, we must go back to what kind of message is sent if there is no formal process in place within an organisation.</p><p>I also note that four sectors have been expressly excluded from that minimum threshold provision.  It is too narrow.  I do not think it is good enough that we name some sectors and then say we are going to take a risk assessment in the consultation with regard to others.  I would like to see evidence as to why a professional services firm like an accountancy firm has to be treated differently from, let us say, a financial services firm.  I would very much urge the Minister of State to broaden that list and ensure it is hardwired into the legislation.</p><p>The last issue I want to raise in the few seconds available is the lack of civil legal aid to whistleblowers.  Many of us on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach are very frustrated by the cap on compensation for penalisation.  We know that a person who takes his or her case to the higher courts does so with a very significant element of personal risk.  Given that a protected disclosure is being made in the public interest, which is why we have this legislation, and not in the personal interest, it is incumbent that we do as much as possible to ensure that we protect and look after those who have gone to considerable risk in making a protected disclosure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#U00200"><p>As the Minister of State outlined, the context of this legislation is the transposition of the EU whistleblower directive and the amendment of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  There are many positive elements within this legislation but there are also concerns.  Given that we are entering the period of legislative scrutiny, I will highlight some of the concerns.</p> <p>I know Transparency Ireland will have contacted the Minister of State outlining its belief that there are elements in the way and manner that the transposition of the directive is proposed in the current Bill, which could directly or indirectly weaken some of the existing protections for Irish whistleblowers.  That would be in violation of Article 85.2 of the EU whistleblower directive.  There is a requirement under the whistleblower directive for a progressive strengthening of protections whereas there are certain components within the legislation, as proposed, that could constitute a weakening, again, either directly or indirectly.  Therefore, we really hope that as the legislation goes through the Seanad, this can perhaps be addressed and strengthened so that we are not putting forward legislation that could face legal challenge either in Ireland or the European courts.</p> <p>There are a few core areas in terms of weakening this, one of which is the limitation or removal of the right to make protected disclosures directly to a Minister.  The standard for the legislation to protect under section 8 is reasonable belief.  Under section 8, it is proposed that public servants would be required to report to their employer in most circumstances, thereby removing the automatic right of public servants to make a public disclosure directly to a Minister.  Again, we have the danger whereby disclosures are getting captured within the hierarchy of an employment system and, indeed, within the power dynamics of that system, when it may be an issue of quite significant national concern that should be allowed to be disclosed directly to a Minister.  This also dilutes existing legal protections for public servants in terms of prosecution, penalisation or detriment if they choose to make a disclosure directly to a Minister.  The danger is not just in terms of that route not being open, therefore, but that many people will not be aware there are a set of steps they need to have taken.  As we have heard very eloquently across this House, many people who are motivated to make a disclosure in this regard do so out of public concern and for the public interest.  In doing so, and there are other measures within this Bill, they should not face a situation whereby they effectively find themselves excluded from the provisions and protections of this legislation.  Many of them will never read this legislation.  They will see an issue in their area of expertise or area of concern and look to highlight that to the person they see as the key decision maker.  Therefore, it is a real concern if, effectively, those who go directly to a Minister may end up not activating the protections under this legislation and somehow fall outside the loop.</p> <p>Another very significant concern is the exemption in terms of relevant organisations accepting anonymous disclosures.  At the moment, there is an exemption for organisations for an obligation to accept or follow up on disclosures that are made anonymously.  Again, it allows that the recipients may do so if they give appropriate notice but that requirement is really a big get-out clause in having to follow this up.</p> <p>I will point out that the 2014 Act did not say anything about anonymous disclosures.  The current legislation explicitly states that anonymous disclosures can be disregarded.  That is a regressive step and, again, brings us back to that concern around Article 25.2 of the EU directive.  It is a really important issue because this is not to say every single anonymous disclosure needs to have a full investigation.  There are already filters and mechanisms within the Bill whereby if a disclosure is made, there is an examination as to whether it is, in fact, relevant under the Protected Disclosures Act and whether it merits an investigation and so forth.  The point is that the Bill at the moment basically allows for a summary disregard, so the issues that have been raised anonymously do not have to be thought about at all rather than examining the issues on their merits, which, bear in mind, are issues for the public concern - they are not issues for the individuals involved.  The issues should basically just be examined and then organisations can say they have been told about this concern and they can see if that is a valid issue.  If it is, they can proceed through the process as such.  In fact, it is an immediate get-out clause and, again, we know the levels of penalisation that have been experienced by whistleblowers.  People should not have to choose, as many whistleblowers have had to do, between their personal well-being, the next ten years of their life and what that will look like, the security of their family and doing something they believe to be in the public interest or that raises a flag of concern.  I am really worried about that provision with regard to a summary right to disregard anonymous disclosures.</p> <p>I am also concerned about the interpersonal grievances piece because I think there is a blurring of the line.  Yes, of course, we need to guard against the blurring of the line but we also know there are situations where people who complain, and who many times will complain long before they make a protected disclosure, can be targeted within their workplaces.  Therefore, they may well have interpersonal grievances or be subject to grievance procedures or other actions from, for example, a manager against whom they have complained or challenged at the same time as they may also wish to make protected disclosures.  It is really important that it is made clear that if it is an interpersonal grievance, then it is not a protected disclosure, because at the moment it is very vague.  It needs to be made very clear to people that they can do both.  At the moment, there is a danger of a chilling effect on protected disclosure for anybody who may separately be involved in an interpersonal matter with his or her employer.</p> <p>There are quite strong criminal sanctions for false reports.  There are not similar sanctions for false information with regard to those against whom a complaint is being made.</p> <p>Finally, there is another really big issue, which has been discussed, about retrospective complaints.  In a way, I do not even like using the word "retrospective" because for many of those who have been involved in these processes, I would regard them as being current procedures.  The effects and impacts they have suffered in terms of penalisation are ongoing.  Many of them, in fact, have never received anything in terms of payments in respect of penalisation or other payments.  They basically never had that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many of them have never received information about what the resolution or outcome of the disclosure they made was.  I would regard a large number of those past protected disclosures as current protected disclosures and I believe these people should be entitled to any protections, measures or compensation available under this legislation.  When we look to the people who have done that public service, it is vital that that be reflected and that they be included.  It is retrospective in terms of when someone made the disclosure but the process, the penalisation and the lack of resolution is ongoing.  This legislation is a chance to address that.  I also support the points made by Senator Sherlock about the threshold of 50 employees.  Someone could have a very small company, sometimes a brass plate company, and that company may be the window into quite a significant issue of public concern.</p></speech>

I have some concerns about the legislation.  I am delighted to see another whistleblower, Peter Behan, here.  I am sorry Antoinette and Noel McGree and other whistleblowers cannot be here.</p> <p>My first concern is about section 8, which removes the right to make protected disclosures directly to a Minister.  This applied to me back in 2000 when I finished my PhD.  It was not a solitary act of whistleblowing but a piece of research supervised by Dublin City University, right up to the level of its registrar and its solicitors at the time, Arthur Cox.  I was also supervised up to the level of Chief of Staff within the Defence Forces and had to seek written permission to continue the research.  What I found was the systematic and systemic sexual assault and rape of female soldiers.  You can make a moral argument for theft, lying, even killing.  That is the premise upon which we use force in the armed forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, there is one thing we as a species cannot tolerate and that is sexual assault, sexual abuse and rape.  That organisation did everything in its power to destroy me as a person and my family.  It sent the military police to my house to intimidate me, my wife and our young child.  This was not Shanghai or Myanmar or Beijing.  This was D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, a place the Minister of State is familiar with.  Removing the right of a person to approach the Minister is a retrograde step and reduces protections for whistleblowers. </p></speech>

The 2014 Act, for example, contains within it the assumption that the person who calls attention to wrongdoing will lose his or her job.  We need to think about that.  There is no mention in this legislation of those who engage in reprisal against whistleblowers.  My sin or crime was calling out sexual violence and sexual assault.  If that is a crime, take me out and hang me.  The people who actively engaged in that reprisal have now been promoted to very senior rank in our Defence Forces.  They have never faced any scrutiny, questioning or interrogation about their actions.  There has been no sanction, only reward.  In Ireland, if you tell the truth and speak out about wrongdoing you will be punished.  If you defend the organisation, whether in health, the voluntary sector or any other area of Irish life, you will be rewarded and promoted, perhaps even given a big job in Europe.  That sends a very mixed message to our children and our youth.  If one of my children or a neighbour came to me and said he or she had experienced wrongdoing, my advice would be to see a solicitor immediately and protect himself or herself, notwithstanding what is contained in this legislation.</p> <p>Back in 2001, I was threatened with criminal prosecution for breaching the Official Secrets Act.  I was told by my former comrades that a file was being sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions and that I would face criminal prosecution.  Press statements were released saying I had fabricated the research and falsified its findings.  Ireland is not a safe place to tell the truth.  I have to disagree with the honourable Senator who said so.  It is not a safe place.  Ask Maurice McCabe, Peter Behan or Noel McGree.  Ask their families about the suffering they endure.  The people who engage in the reprisal face no sanction.  There is nothing in this legislation to deal with that and there ought to be, instead of criminalising people for making allegedly false disclosures.  What saved me was Michael Smith, the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Defence at the time.  When I approached him directly, he put in place an independent Government inquiry.  He did not allow the Defence Forces to investigate themselves.  That is something every person who brings forward a disclosure should be able to rely on.  Such people should be able to talk to the Minister .  What else are we here for?  Why is Deputy Smyth a Minister?  Why would anybody be a Minister, save to take responsibility for what happens within his or her Department?</p> <p>The other provisions I have concerns about are those exempting relevant organisations from accepting anonymous disclosures in the proposed new section 5A(1).  After what I have said, and after what my good friend Maurice McCabe experienced, where they not only tried to destroy him existentially but tried to destroy his relationship and his family, the Government expects people to dispense with their anonymity?  The Government must listen to whistleblowers and to Transparency International because we are the people who know what we are talking about, notwithstanding any advice the Government may have been given, legal or otherwise. </p> <p>By removing wrongdoings involving interpersonal grievances, organisations will be able to use these as a stick to beat people who bring forward disclosures.  Whistleblower reprisals involve a very personalised, systemic and systematic attack on a person to completely destroy his or her character, reputation and identity.  In my case, they tried to destroy my reputation as an ethical researcher, as an officer with service overseas for my country and as a citizen.  They tried to take my job as a lecturer on probation in the institute of technology sector away from me.  I was informed that because I had fabricated my research, I was going to lose my job.  I thought I was going to lose my job and my liberty.  That is personal.  Consequently, by putting in a clause removing anything involving interpersonal grievances, the Government is providing organisations engaged in wrongdoing with a defence and a stick with which to beat vulnerable whistleblowers.  That must be removed.</p> <p>Introducing criminal penalties for knowingly making false reports will also be used as a mischievous way of targeting whistleblowers.  It is, by definition, what constitutes whistleblower reprisal.  Irish organisations will accuse the person who brings forward disclosures of wrongdoing of making false allegations.  That was the case for me.  Katie Hannon's documentary, "Women of Honour", which was broadcast on 11 September 2021, showed that, 21 years after I made my disclosures, there is still the same problem in our armed forces.  That is even though oversight was imposed on them.  This is typical of Irish organisations.  I have been contacted over the past two decades by whistleblowers from all aspects of Irish life, including the Law Library, charities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, religious orders, hospitals, the ambulance and fire services, corporate entities and banking.  It is everywhere in Irish society.  This legislation does not provide people with the proper protections to make a disclosure and be free from the type of reprisal I experienced.</p> <p>While I welcome this Bill, I urge the Minister of State to listen to whistleblowers and to Transparency International and other international whistleblowing expert groups.  I ask him to please remove the provisions I have mentioned because I am still experiencing the existential harm of reprisal 22 years later.  In the aftermath of the "Women of Honour" broadcast, over 30 young people - mostly women and some young men - made fresh disclosures to me of the full spectrum of sexual harassment, assault and rape in the Defence Forces, that is, in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.  The level of pushback is indicative and symptomatic of a culture that has a problem with truth-telling and naming harm.  We have to change the culture and the narrative.  The four issues I have raised breach Article 25.2 of the EU whistleblowing directive, in that they reduce the level of protection already afforded by member states in the areas covered in this directive.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tom Clonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=TomClonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I thank the Acting Chair for giving me leeway.

I will continue my contribution where I left off by describing some of the main provisions of the Bill.</p> <p>I had been discussing Chapter 3, section 14, which inserts the new sections 10C and 10D into the principal Act.  These sections concern the handling of disclosures made or transmitted to the commissioner.  In the first instance, the commissioner shall attempt to identify either a prescribed person or another suitable person with the competence to follow up on the matter reported and transmit the report to said person for further action.  If no person can be found, the commissioner shall apply the standard rules as regards acknowledgement, follow-up and feedback, as required by the directive in respect of prescribed persons.</p> <p>It also inserts section 10E, which provides that where a report is transmitted to a third party who is not subject to the requirement to have formal reporting channels, that person shall follow the standard rules as regards acknowledgement, follow-up and feedback.  It inserts section 10F, which provides for powers of investigation for the commissioner in the event that direct follow-up of a report is required.  </p> <p>Section 15 inserts a new schedule to the Act concerning a number of standard provisions regarding the keeping of accounts and the staffing of the office of the protected disclosures commissioner.</p> <p>Chapter 4, which comprises sections 16 to 20, inclusive, transposes a number of provisions of the directive that are applicable to internal reporting to employers and external reporting to prescribed persons and the commissioner.  </p> <p>Section 16 obliges persons responsible for handling protected disclosures to keep the identity of reporting persons confidential, overhauling a similar provision in the principal Act.  Section 17 introduces a new requirement to similarly keep confidential the identities of other persons named in a disclosure.  Section 18 provides for the restriction of certain data subject access rights to prevent these rights being abused to out a whistleblower or to frustrate or to impede effective follow-up on a report.  </p> <p>Section 19 specifies how records of protected disclosures shall be kept.  Section 20 imposes a similar restriction on the Freedom of Information Act as that provided for in section 18.  Again, it is intended to protect reporting persons&rsquo; identities and to prevent attempts to impede or frustrate follow-up.  </p> <p>Chapter 5 comprises sections 21 to 25, inclusive, and it concerns the enhanced protection measures that are required by the directive.  The key changes are introduced in this chapter.  They include, first, the extension of interim relief to acts of penalisation other than dismissal.  Second, there is the reversal of the burden of proof in civil cases concerning penalisations, so that employers will have to prove that the alleged act of penalisation was not taken because the worker made a protected disclosure.  Last, there is the provision of a set of offences for contraventions of the Act.  </p> <p>Chapter 6, which comprises sections 26 to 33, inclusive, provides for a number of incidental and supplementary measures, including the removal of the restriction on public disclosure of taxpayer information for certain types of records; the provision for the Minister to issue statutory guidance to assist public bodies, prescribed persons and the commissioner in best practice in the handling of reports; the provision of freely available information on how to make a disclosure and the protections afforded by the Act; enhanced provisions as regards the provision of statistical information to the Minister on the numbers of protected disclosures made and for the publication of said information; and finally powers for the Workplace Relations Commission inspectorate to monitor and enforce compliance with the requirements on employers to have internal reporting channels. </p> <p>Finally, the Bill inserts two schedules into the principal Act.  These are Schedule 5, which is a set of standard provisions as regards the keeping of accounts and staffing at the office of protected disclosures commissioner, and Schedule 6 reproduces the annexe to the directive, listing all of the EU laws that lie within the material&rsquo;s scope.  </p> <p>I will now address some of the points that have made by Senators here today.  I thank them all for their contributions.  I thank all Senators who support the strengthening of the legislation and who have engaged with it.  I want to thank Sinn F&eacute;in for sending representatives to my office to discuss the amendments, for tabling those amendments and for working constructively to try to advance this legislation.  I know it is difficult to do that.  </p> <p>Before I wrap up, I also want to mention one issue that was raised during the debate of the Bill in the D&aacute;il that remains unresolved.  The pre-legislative scrutiny report recommended that the new protections of the Bill be extended retrospectively to persons who reported wrongdoing prior to its enactment.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, gave a commitment to the House that he would examine the issue in consultation with the Attorney General.  The Minister had hoped to bring proposals in this regard before the Bill passed in the D&aacute;il, but this did not prove possible.  Work in this area is now at an advanced stage.  Amendments will be brought before this House for consideration when the Bill moves to Committee Stage.  </p> <p>In closing, I reiterate my thanks to Members of both Houses who worked on the pre-legislative scrutiny report on this Bill, which has greatly influenced its development.  I also thank the various stakeholders who have contributed to the development of Bill, including those who took the time to make submissions to the public consultation when the general scheme of the Bill was being developed, as well as those who attended the pre-legislative scrutiny hearings at the committee.  Their input has also provided great help in the preparation of the Bill.  Finally, I thank all Members of this House for their attention.  We had a positive debate on the issues in the D&aacute;il and I hope that will continue in the Seanad.  I commend this Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the views of Members on Committee Stage.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#CC00300"><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House for another round of debate.</p> <p>Amendment No. 123, which is in the grouping under discussion, aims to broaden the scope of the provision that the coimisi&uacute;n would effectively ban the marketing of salts and sugars by adding infant milk formula.  We are asking that this amendment would apply to all children and not just those who have digital access.  There is an inconsistency because the provision we are seeking to amend recognises that there is a harm in the marketing of fats, trans fats, salts and sugars, but there is a failure to recognise that there is a harm in the very aggressive marketing of infant milk formula.  I referred on the previous occasion to the fact that there has been much research into this, the most recent coming in the form of a report published by the WHO and UNICEF earlier this year.  That report refers to formula milk companies using manipulative marketing tactics that exploit parents anxieties and aspirations by purporting to be a trusted friend and advisor.  It also refers to formula milk companies distorting science and medicine to legitimise their claims and push their products.  The report argues that these companies are making false and incomplete scientific claims as to the health benefits of their products and that formula milk marketing undermines parents' confidence in breastfeeding.  As I said previously, anybody who has a newborn, especially a first child, knows all about the anxiety of trying to feed a baby.</p> <p>On the last occasion, Senator Lombard asked whether it would matter if the Minister were to accept this amendment.  We believe that it would matter because the research suggests that the choices of families are being undermined by aggressive marketing tactics.  We can also point to countries like Norway where there have been positive changes in breastfeeding rates.  The key issue here is the choices families make.  This is about not inflicting a viewpoint on any family around how they want to feed their child.  It is about helping families who have decided they want to breastfeed their babies and to allow them to do that without being aggressively targeted.  Maternity health data from the Department of Health shows that in 2020 some 62% of babies were breast fed at birth but that fell to 58.5% upon leaving hospital.  We know that within six months the rate falls to approximately 15%.</p> <p>I want to respond to some of the other points Senator Lombard made.  He talked about the other supports that need to be put in place.  He is absolutely right with regard to lactation consultants and peer to peer support.  Interestingly, the day he spoke marked one year to the day that the Government announced funding for 24 new lactation consultants to work in communities throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We put in a Commencement matter last week and the Department of Health confirmed that none of those lactation consultants has even been recruited yet, let alone begun working in the community.  The full complement of 10.5 lactation consultants announced in 2020 has yet to be appointed.  I say this to the Minister as a member of the Cabinet.  While making this argument about marketing tactics and how to improve breastfeeding rates, we must also look at those other issues.  Commitments have been made and they have not been followed through on.</p><p>As a last point on this issue, I am conscious there was correspondence from the Minister's office to the Baby Feeding Law Group Ireland about these amendments.  As we see it, it effectively seeks to hide behind the regulation of the  quality of the product itself as opposed to addressing head-on the issues of the marketing of the product as well as saying this is a Department of Health issue.  If the Minister's Department believes in the importance of outlawing the marketing of fats and sugars in the public health interests of children, I do not see why it would not include outlawing the marketing of infant formula to babies up to the age of 36 months.  It is interesting because in the question I posed last week about the lactation consultants, we also got a reply back from the Department of Health about regulating the marketing.  That Department hides behind the EU regulations governing the content and quality of the product itself and not the marketing.  That is simply not good enough.</p><p>We ask that the Minister consider the amendments we are putting forward.  We believe they are reasonable and that they would have an impact.  My final word on it is this is about giving public health messaging a fighting chance.  In the face of enormous money from companies whose only interest is profit, that messaging does not stand a chance.</p></speech>

I think Senator Sherlock mentioned it.  There is a little bit of a red herring at play in some of the responses we have been having in this debate with this reference to the EU regulations.  Regulation (EU) 2016/127, which supplements Regulation (EU) No 609/2013, relates to the compositional and information requirements for information on infant formula and follow-on formula.  That regulation specifically relates to the product and how it is composed, such as what the acceptable level of pesticide is.  That was one of the debating points when the regulation was being debated, because apparently there is an acceptable level of pesticide.  It deals also with other information requirements having to do with packaging.  It is absolutely not related to the area in question, namely, online promotion, marketing and commercial activity around breast milk substitutes in all their forms.  We must be clear we do not have a red herring thrown in here.  Even if it was an EU directive, it would not have prohibited us from having appropriate standards in many areas.  We see many countries in Europe are often ahead of each other when it comes to health and safety standards.  Certainly, it in no way constrains us from regulating here.  I worry this debate would send a signal to an incoming commission that it was constrained from regulating or, indeed, prohibiting breast milk substitutes in whichever form.  It is important we are clear on that.</p><p>It is important to focus on the relevant piece of international guidance, that is, the WHO code.  It has been there since the 1980s and has a number of very specific provisions the WHO highlighted as being not applied and not respected.  Again, this is not simply around the content but also the content delivery.  Some of the provisions in the WHO code are really clear.  They state things about not seeking direct contact with pregnant women.  They mention not having commercial communications presented as information.  Some of the things we know about are directly in breach of the WHO standards.  I refer to the baby clubs and the online chat with an expert mum who is employed by a company promoting a commercial product.  There are also the advertising campaigns people are encouraged to enter before they even give birth and where they then must give permission for follow-up emails to come in week by week encouraging them to engage.</p><p>We need to be clear that this is not an opinion.  It is not about the choice issue that everybody agrees with.  The question is about what is getting promoted and what the impacts are.  The WHO has been clear to the point it has stated that it believes that if there is not regulation of the advertisement or promotion of breast milk substitutes, then states are breaching the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  We have in the Bill a provision that mentions high-fat and salty foods as something with a direct effect on children.  We know breast milk substitutes, and certainly their promotion, has an impact on children.</p><p>On the argument this is providing some kind of service, we must be clear, as Senator Sherlock outlined, that we absolutely need greater supports, not just in the form of lactation consultants but also midwives.  The latter group needs to be better supported and resourced within our health system in general.  Many other supports are needed there, including longer follow-on times for those who might need that.  There are many supports that should and could be offered, including, as I mentioned, something available in the North of Ireland that we do not have here, namely, a public breast milk bank.  That does not get promoted as an option for those who cannot breastfeed because it makes nobody any money.  What it does is support women who need support at that time.</p><p>There are many public health measures we should be doing better but the core point is that does not argue against this regulation because they should not have to compete with a huge commercial advertising budget.  Marketing happens for a reason.  Companies do not commercially promote and advertise for no reason.  They do it because it increases sales.  It literally has a direct effect.  Internationally, about 10% of global sales, about $6 billion, is spent on promoting breast milk substitutes and formula milk.  That is equivalent to the entire budget of the WHO.  The WHO and, indeed, our own health service should not be up against that level of competition over who can reach people with those messages and who can give those supports.  That is key.  I wanted to bring in the WHO aspect because we were focusing a lot on Ireland because we have such extraordinarily low levels of breastfeeding.  Only 6% of women are breastfeeding to six months exclusively.</p><p>I will finish on the international responsibility because it is important.  This is not just about what we do here and how we give supports and things.  This is around the message we send internationally.  <i>The Lancet</i>estimated 800,000 infant deaths could have been avoided internationally if the WHO's code had been respected and applied with respect to formula milk.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is an industry which uses a lot of very inappropriate practices.  It can create situations where people use water that is contaminated.  Its advertising has very serious consequences.  Precisely because Ireland is one of the world's largest manufacturers of formula milk it is important that we get it right.  It being such a big industry in Ireland is not a reason for us not to regulate it but to regulate it and outline very clear constraints and, where necessary, prohibitions around how it is advertised and promoted.  Ireland exports one third of its formula milk to China where breastfeeding levels have halved in the last ten years.  There is a global health responsibility on us too.  We are a country that could send a signal that we recognise that this is a product which is sometimes needed and should be available for those who need it but it is not a product where profit maximisation and commercial promotion at all costs is appropriate.  This is the chance for us to send that signal.  It must be reflected in the Bill.  There have to be some amendments that send that clear signal and put addressing that issue clearly on the agenda.  We cannot simply leave it to the discretion or potential discretion of a commission in the future.</p></speech>

I thank Alcohol Action Ireland for its diligent work in this area and its support in drafting this amendment.  The regulatory impact analysis for the Bill stated that alcohol marketing is dealt with under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018.  However, this is not the case.  That Act does little to protect children in the media realm.  The Minister has the chance to remedy that in this ground-breaking legislation.</p> <p>Section 14 of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 is quite narrow on advertising.  It prohibits the advertising of alcohol in certain public spaces only.  It does not relate to a large amount of advertising.  It contains restrictions on the content of alcohol advertising.  Furthermore the content of the legislation is far from being enacted and that is my concern.  We need joined-up thinking on this which means that regulations governing public spaces, conventional media and the digital sphere are coherent and consistent.  I believe this Bill would be an excellent place to achieve that.  The amendment reflects the recommendations in the report on the pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media which included a ban on the advertising of alcohol to children.  That should be uncontentious.  It is a way to combat the increasing budgets of alcohol producers that saturate our media and endanger children's health.</p> <p>On 10 May the World Health Organization published a report which highlighted glaring gaps in regulation of alcohol marketing across borders.  Young people and heavy drinkers are the major targets.  The report highlights the increasing use of sophisticated online marketing techniques for alcohol and the need for more effective regulation.  It shows that young people and heavy drinkers are increasingly targeted by alcohol adverting often to the determent of their health.  The WHO noted that, "Reducing the harm from alcohol &ndash; by regulating cross-border alcohol marketing, advertising and promotion is the first report from WHO to detail the full extent of the way that alcohol is today being marketed".  </p> <p>I work in the field of addiction when I have my other hat on.  I see the impact in particular on parents of young people who have alcohol problems.  We have to face the reality.  Three people today will die from an alcohol-related issue.  We have a really unhealthy relationship with alcohol in Ireland.  This is a really important amendment that reflects the recommendation in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  I hope the Minister will consider it because I believe it is extremely important.</p></speech>

I hope there is recognition that when the Bill includes sugar and salt it must be broadened to other public health matters.  I will not go over old ground because I spoke extensively on the impact of advertising on breastfeeding rates in this country and that it is no surprise that we have a large export industry that is reliant on formula milk.</p> <p>Senator Higgins mentioned the large quantities of formula being exported from Ireland one way or another, even to be made in other countries.  Fundamentally it comes from Ireland.  I do not think that those things are coincidental when we look at the lack of regulation around the advertising of formula.  There is no level playing field here but that is not really the issue.  It is not the case that if we had equal amounts of advertisements for breastfeeding and formula milk we would be fine: no, we would not.  What has been clearly pointed out by the WHO is that advertising of formula has a public health impact.  That is why it needs to be regulated and, I argue, should not be advertised at all.  We should ensure that the product is available and those who need support in order to use different products have that support and that they have that choice and are supported.  However, that is not what these companies do when they are advertising.  They are there to make money and to have that share of the market moved from breastfeeding into something that creates profit for them and we can never, as a nation, compete.</p> <p>I wanted to come back in because I heard the comments from Senator Lombard last time around the importance of support for those who are breastfeeding.  That is not what this is about at all.  I have been involved in breastfeeding support through Cuidi&uacute; and the La Leche League.  I have spoke at an Association of Lactation Consultants in Ireland, ALCI, conference and at a conference of the Friends of Breastfeeding.  I know the work that those who are volunteering do.  They do it because there are no proper supports in this country and professional support through lactation consultants.  I am delighted that under this Government we have funding for 24 new lactation consultants but they need to be put in place and we need to go far beyond that.</p> <p>However, that is not what we are talking about today.  Even if we had everything else in place, what do we think is going to happen?  Are we to have more and more spending by these large companies to combat and counteract it and get their share of the market?  We need to ensure that does not happen because those are the kinds of insidious tactics that are used.  I have outlined previously what I think is a great concern for online advertising because in the times when one is most vulnerable, the quiet moments in one's own home with one's tiny baby and is Googling, it is then that one finds something that hits one in the face as a solution when it may not be.  </p> <p>I do not think the Bill can achieve everything that we want to achieve.  I hope that everyone would recognise that.  It is about enabling the possibility of advertising regulations and that would ultimately have to come from the Department of Health.  This would open the door to that.  I also pointed out that I would amend some of the amendments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not just about marketing to babies and children, it is also about marketing to their parents in this particular instance.  That is possibly different from sugar and salt.  It should be taken into account.</p><p>I know the Bill is not going to achieve everything.  I am realistic about that.  However, we also need to then look beyond, and it is the Department of Health I would be looking at in this regard.  We also must consider the fact that the World Health Organization guidelines are not being implemented fully across the board, and I have studied this, in many European countries.  That has to be addressed.</p><p>I will conclude with that as I do not want to go back over old ground.  Those are the important things to put on the record.  I will not say it was disingenuous but it was straying into other fields to say that if we put all the money in the world into breastfeeding supports, it is not going to change the fact that people are making massive profits.  They are doing it in large part through advertising.  That is ultimately where they are making that money.</p></speech>

Collectively, the Government has to take responsibility for that and to make sure both that people are recruited to fill those positions and that the numbers are increased.  We need to put further investment into the Department of Health and into an advertising campaign to promote breastfeeding.</p> <p>I fully support Senator Black, and I am a member of the Oireachtas committee.  We put forward in our recommendations a proposal to ban the advertising of alcohol.  There was a group of students in the House today and they are the young people of 13 and 14 years of age who are on social media.  They are being bombarded with this advertising and it is assumed to be cool to be drinking.  Another issue which is not part of our recommendations but is one that I have been made aware of is the issue of vaping.  I believe it will turn into a serious issue.  There are people of 13 and 14 years of age now purchasing these vapes and they are going to be addicted to something that is as bad as cigarettes, yet it is not properly regulated.  That is something to be examined.</p> <p>I support the comments, particularly those of Senator Black, regarding the ban on alcohol advertising online.  At a minimum, there should be a watershed of 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. for any advertisement on the main media channels or even on radio.  However, I strongly believe we must fill the positions that were committed to, and put further investment into employing more lactation consultants and into an advertising campaign on the national and local media promoting breastfeeding.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 123 and 125 would specifically insert references to substitutes for breast milk or milk-based formulae into section 46N(5).  This would make explicit the power of coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n to prohibit commercial communications relating to infant and follow-on formulae in the context of media service codes.  I recognise the intention of the amendments and understand the concerns the Senators have regarding the advertisement of infant and follow-on formulae.  The public health advice is clear that there is considerable evidence to demonstrate the importance of breastfeeding for the health of both mothers and infants.  Data from the World Health Organization indicate that Ireland has lower breastfeeding rates than the global and European average.</p> <p>Members will be aware that the information requirements and advertising standards in respect of infant, meaning a child under 12 months, and follow-on formulae are currently set out in EU regulations.  These regulations set out detailed composition and labelling requirements for infant and follow-on formulae intended for use by infants in good health and recognise the importance of the World Health Organization international code of marketing breastmilk substitutes.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for implementing these information requirements, while policy responsibility rests with the Department of Health.  Under the extant Broadcasting Act 2009, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has issued the general commercial communications code, which provides that commercial communications for infant and follow-on formulae shall comply with all relevant Irish and European legislation and with rules, regulations and codes of practice issued from time to time by a relevant public health body.  This is appropriate, as the BAI ultimately must rely on public health advice issued by the appropriate bodies as regards public health matters.</p> <p>Following the enactment of this Bill, it will be an coimisi&uacute;n that will be tasked with making media service codes.  The general commercial communications code will continue in force until superseded by any code that an coimisi&uacute;n will make.  I can see the merits in setting out explicitly in legislation that an coimisi&uacute;n may prohibit commercial communications relating to infant or follow-on formulae through media service codes, subject to considering the appropriate health advice on the matter.  As the marketing of infant formulae is the policy responsibility of the Minister for Health, I will ask my officials to consult with officials in the Department of Health in the first instance.  While I do not accept these amendments today, I will return to the House on Report Stage to set out the next steps.</p> <p>I am not willing to accept amendment No. 103.  It would appear to immediately ban the advertisement of breast milk substitutes on broadcasting and certain video on-demand services.  As I said, primary policy responsibility lies with the Department of Health and other public health authorities, and rules providing for information and advertising standards are harmonised through the EU regulations.  It is best to allow an coimisi&uacute;n to consult with public health authorities before any decisions are made regarding the prohibition of commercial communications for infant or follow-on formulae.  This both respects the regulatory independence of an coimisi&uacute;n and allows for the advice of public health authorities to be considered.</p> <p>Amendment No. 124 would make explicit the power of an coimisi&uacute;n to prohibit commercial communications relating to alcohol through a media service code.  The advertisement of alcohol has primarily been addressed through the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018, which contains strong measures to limit the exposure of children to advertising.  Sections 15 and 16 of the Act, which are in operation since November 2021, restrict alcohol advertising and sponsorship promoting alcohol products and include a ban on alcohol advertising and sponsorship at events aimed particularly at children or at which the majority of participants or competitors are children.  These measures help to ensure that children can grow up in circumstances where they are not regularly exposed to alcohol products and alcohol advertising.</p> <p>Section 19 of the Act provides for a broadcast watershed on radio and television stations.  Prohibiting alcohol advertising during times when children might be in the audience will reduce children's exposure to such advertisements.  The Department of Health is working with my Department, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the environmental health service of the HSE with regard to the commencement of this provision.  Policy responsibility for alcohol advertising rests with the Minister for Health within the framework of the public health legislation on this issue.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act contains a suite of measures specifically designed to protect children from exposure to alcohol advertisements.  I am committed to engaging with the Minister for Health and his Department to facilitate the early commencement of the remaining sections of the Act.  I expect that any media service codes issued by an coimisi&uacute;n will set out the requirement on broadcasters and video on-demand services providers to fully comply with the Public Health (Alcohol) Act.  This Bill already provides an coimisi&uacute;n with sufficient power to do so, and I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p> <p>Regarding amendments Nos. 120 and 128, as a matter of principle I cannot accept amendments which would unduly limit the discretion of an coimisi&uacute;n in the creation of regulatory codes.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept them.</p></speech>

The Public Health (Alcohol) Act says nothing about online advertising.  Section 14 of that Act prohibits the advertising of alcohol, but in tiny places.  It has nothing to do with online advertising.  Again, the content element of the legislation has not been implemented.</p><p>While I am on the subject, I will return to the WHO report.  I must put on the record today that the report states: </p> <blockquote> 	One of the biggest changes in recent years to alcohol marketing is the use of sophisticated online marketing.  The collection and analysis of data on users&rsquo; habits and preferences by global Internet providers has created new and growing opportunities for alcohol marketers to target messages to specific groups across national borders.  Targeted advertising on social media is especially effective at using such data, with its impact strengthened by social influencers and sharing of posts between social media users.<br /><br />One data source quoted in the report calculated that over 70% of media spending of leading alcohol marketers based in the USA in 2019 was through promotions, product placement and online advertisements in social media. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Minister to reconsider this amendment.  It could change lives and it could save lives.  The report continues:</p><blockquote>	&quot;The rising importance of digital media means that alcohol marketing has become increasingly cross-border&rdquo;, said Dag Rekve of the Alcohol, Drugs and Addictive Behaviours Unit at the World Health Organization.  &quot;This makes it more difficult for countries that are regulating alcohol marketing to effectively control it in their jurisdictions.  More collaboration between countries in this area is needed.&rdquo; </blockquote><p>I ask the Minister to consider this.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act does not deal with online marketing.  I need the Minister to think about that.  Every day I work with families who are absolutely devastated by their children being impacted.  I am asking the Minister to reconsider the amendment and to just think about it.  Let us have a conversation about it.  Let me bring in representatives from Alcohol Action Ireland to talk to the Minister about this.  It is absolutely vital.  Given that it could save lives and change lives, it must be considered within this legislation.</p></speech>

If fat, trans fats, salt and sugars are named, it would be consistent.  Formula milk and breast milk substitutes clearly meet the criterion of things that have a general public health interest for children.  While references have been made to the Department of Health in terms of advertising and so forth, this is the legislation in respect of online marketing and promotion, and the regulation of these spaces and actors.  The Bill already rightly makes reference to general public health interests.  If we are referencing general public health interests without specifying the marketing of breast milk substitutes, one of the key items is being excluded.</p> <p>The EU directives on the labelling of the composition of breast milk substitutes is not relevant to this which relates to the provisions that may be made for prohibitions.  Alcohol should also be named either here in terms of a potential prohibition or in terms of something which has relevance to the general public health of children and should either be prohibited or restricted.  As the Minister outlined, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act is designed for events but it is not an event world when dealing with online broadcasting and communications.</p> <p>Watersheds work for radio and television as we have them now but not for an on-demand media space.  In this new space we need to be tackling either prohibition or regulation of how alcohol advertisements are targeted.  What kinds of measures are being used in terms of how they reach people?  I know that other amendments address this later and Senator Black has spoken eloquently about it.</p> <p>I appreciate the Minister has indicated potential engagement in respect of the media codes.  However, I believe we should have a straight prohibition on advertising as the World Health Organization has called for.  I will press amendment No. 103.  Regardless of the outcome of that vote, I would be happy to continue to work on the media codes recommendations.</p></speech>

As set out in the Bill, I would expect that an coimisi&uacute;n will have a strong role to play in providing for standards and practices to ensure that commercial communications protect the interests of the audience and, in particular, the interests of children.  An coimisi&uacute;n will do so through the making of binding media service codes.  The existing general commercial communications code which applies to broadcasters will remain in force until amended or revoked by an coimisi&uacute;n.</p> <p>In making media service codes related to commercial communications, it is important that an coimisi&uacute;n takes advice from other public bodies with the appropriate expertise.  In the case of infant and follow-on formula and alcohol, the appropriate experts would be relevant public health authorities.  It is important that we do not through this Bill inadvertently introduce overlapping functions on the regulation of advertising, for example, between an coimisi&uacute;n and public health authorities.  I am confident that an coimisi&uacute;n will take the best advice from the relevant public bodies and reflect them in the media service codes.</p> <p>I understand the intention of Senator Black's amendment on the advertising of alcohol because alcohol abuse inflicts terrible damage on individuals, their families and wider society.  That is why the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 is such important legislation.  It provides the appropriate base in law to regulate alcohol advertising.  However, as I have said, I expect an coimisi&uacute;n will require in any media service code it makes addressing commercial communications that broadcasters and video on-demand services online will fully comply with the Act and any other public health provisions that may be advised by the Department of Health.</p></speech>

However, this is legislation.  We want this to become some of the legislation the commission takes on board rather than the alcohol Act that was not designed for the online space as we have outlined, and indeed other provisions such as the EU directive which do not address this issue of online marketing.  While accepting that public health advice is important, one of the things the commission will take on board is legislation which is why we wanted the legislation to send a signal as we prepare for Report Stage.  We cannot outsource our responsibility as legislators solely to future public health advice.  There is new legislation all the time.  We co-create it and we should ensure it does what it needs to do.</p></speech>

As she said, amendment No. 106 was not discussed in the Chamber.  This amendment raises an important issue.  Conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice and the programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to ban that therapy.  My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has been leading on this issue.  My intention was to reject the amendment today but consider the matter before Report Stage.  I intend to speak to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in advance of that.</p></speech>

I appreciate and accept the bona fides of the Minister.  I understand that she intends to address this issue but it would be good if the Government brought its own proposals in respect of it . It is the right of any Member of this House to bring amendments on this.  There is a general strong view, shared across the House by both Government Members and Members of the Opposition, that conversion therapy and measures that compromise or invalidate a person's sexual orientation or gender identity are regressive and must be addressed and blocked.  I co-signed legislation brought forward by Senator Warfield relating to this and I look forward with great interest to the legislation the Government may bring on this issue.  However, I also believe we should seek to address or at least signal an intention to address it in this legislation.</p></speech>

I appreciate that Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has work ongoing in this area around conversion practices.  LGBT Ireland launched a campaign last week in the Museum of Literature Ireland on St. Stephen's Green.  I commend it for its work in this area.  I also commend the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on his work in respect of this matter.  As Senator Higgins mentioned, there was a Bill in the Seanad in 2018, a specific section of which banned the advertising of conversion practices, which happen in Ireland, in the jurisdiction in the North and overseas.  Irish people and youths have found themselves overseas for this reason.  It would be beneficial to have a reference to conversion practices in this Bill in addition to the outright ban that I hope the Government will legislate for.</p></speech>

This would ensure there is a legislative requirement on the commission to make codes rather than simply giving it the power or option to do so.  Given the extensive debates we are having about media service codes, it is very clear that this will be one of the core functions of the commission and there is an expectation that it shall make media service codes.  This is a protection against a potential minimalist approach.  I know that is not the intention of the Minister and that it will most likely not be the intention of the commission either, but it should be guarded against with good legislative practice.</p><p>Amendment No. 110 would insert a new subsection into section 46N requiring that the media service codes be approved by a motion of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  The issue previously mentioned is likely to arise with regard to the title of the committee.  The Minister may also have concerns about whether it is appropriate to have every individual media service code approved by a motion of the committee, which is a reasonable question.  However, the committee should have some form of oversight and input into the general direction of media service codes as they go forward.  There is cross-party expertise there that would be beneficial.  Under this amendment each code would need to be approved but there may be some other mechanism for appropriate consideration.</p><p>Amendment No. 111 would again replace the provision that media service codes &quot;may&quot; provide for standards of practices with a provision that they &quot;shall&quot; do so in the context of the matters addressed in sections 46J, 46K and 47L.  This would ensure the commission has a legislative requirement to act.  Wherever possible, it is appropriate for legislation to give clear guidance as to the expected functions to be performed.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 110 provides that the media service codes made under section 46N shall be subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.  I cannot accept this amendment because it would represent undue interference in the regulatory independence of the commission.  It is a key principle that the commission should be able to make regulatory decisions free from external interference, particularly from political bodies, as is required by the audiovisual media services directive.</p> <p>By compelling an coimisi&uacute;n to make media service codes covering all matters within section 46N(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, amendments Nos 109 and 111 would have the effect of limiting the discretion of an coimisi&uacute;n in when and how it exercises regulatory duties through the creation of media service codes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The purpose of establishing an independent regulatory body, an coimisi&uacute;n, under this Bill is to delegate the exercise of powers from the Oireachtas to that body, in accordance with Article 15.2.2&deg; of the Constitution.  That a body delegated such powers has discretion in the exercise of such powers within the strictures of legislation is appropriate and in the spirit of the provisions on the independence of regulatory bodies in the revised audiovisual media services directive.</p></speech>

The provisions we are providing would not interfere with the commission's independence with respect to how the media service codes may be made or the standards and practices for complying with relevant sections.  It simply suggests that they will.  The Minister described them as duties.  This is not simply about powers; it is also about duties.  By inserting the word "shall", we make it clear that it will be a duty of the new commission to provide media service codes and to ensure that those codes provide for the relevant standards and practices.  Again, I do not believe this crosses the line into the discretionary space.  If we have regulators, then the idea of whether you regulate is not one that is up for grabs.  We give independent powers in terms of the forms of execution.  On the fact of the performance of certain functions, however, if we are going to the trouble to put legislation in place with regard to certain functions being performed, it is important that we know they shall be performed.</p> <p>I accept the Minister's point on amendment No. 110.  There is probably an excessive potential for political intervention, certainly in the context of individual media service codes.  I am not going to press the amendment, but I reserve the right to suggest that, periodically, it may be useful for the relevant joint committee to discuss media service codes in order that if a concerning pattern develops with the codes, the issue could be addressed.  I will withdraw amendment No. 110 because the Minister is correct in respect of it.</p></speech>

The codes are designed to protect the interests of the audience and prevent harmful or offensive material.  We see it as being important here, as we do in other areas of the Bill, that we use the codes to promote certain outcomes.</p><p>We have an especially significant issue with gender bias and a lack of diversity, intentional or otherwise, across Irish radio stations.  The reality is that current affairs in particular - and all of us in the House tune into current affairs programmes - are very much anchored by the male voice, even though the listenership for mid-morning talk shows is composed of a higher proportion of women than men.  A number of studies have been conducted by the Why Not Her? collective, by Dr. Kathy Walsh and Dr. Jane Suiter of DCU and by Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  They show that across all current affairs programmes, with respect to both presenters and contributors, the male voice is represented to the tune of 70%; only 28% of time is given to the female voice.  We see that as a significant issue that could be overhauled and changed by inserting a quota within the legislation.  It specifies not just gender but also sexual orientation, disability, colour and socioeconomic status to ensure the broadcast material reflects the participation and interests of the audience.  With regard to current affairs programmes and broadcast news, we propose that there be equal participation of men and women.</p><p>There is also a significant issue dating back a number of years with not just the spoken word but also with the time given over to musical content and how much of it features female performers relative to male performers.  We believe there is a need for a quota in that regard and that it should be 50%.</p><p>The final quota we are trying to insert concerns reserving broadcast time for compositions composed or performed by persons living on the island of Ireland.  This goes back to a Bill which former Deputy Willie Penrose put forward a number of years ago and which received enormous support, especially from the traditional music sector.  We believe that with traditional music, or any other genre of music that is under-represented in terms of airplay time across the radio stations, a threshold or quota needs to be inserted.</p><p>There has been a greater awareness of these issues and of the lack of diversity with respect to whose music is being played, who is presenting programmes or who is participating.  To be fair, some radio stations have made efforts in recent years.  We must again give credit to the Why Not Her? collective that has done so much work in this space to try to bring attention to that imbalance.  It is important to highlight the likes of Tipp FM, SPIN FM, 2FM, 98FM and WLR FM, which I will be killed if I do not mention. These have made significant changes to both spoken word and music content.  Other radio stations need to follow suit, but we do not believe those changes will happen organically.  Something needs to be inserted into legislation to ensure that we can nudge radio stations along to ensure we have greater equality in what we are listening to.</p></speech>

I wonder if this would not be better serviced in the area of codes that can be drawn up.  Part of it is also going to be about encouraging radio stations to take action.  As she mentioned, quite a number of them have done that.  One of the difficulties is in the area of classical music, where there is a big challenge about getting more women performing.  I was at a wonderful piece in the concert hall last Friday where they matched Clara Schumann with Brahms.  We are seeing more efforts being made there but part of the problem for, say, Lyric FM, is that there is not a sufficient amount of work by female composers being performed and there is not a large number of female artists being encouraged.  It is a bigger challenge that needs to be taken on board.  I agree with principle of quotas and they have their place but there may be a difficulty here for small local radio stations if we are too prescriptive.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Radio stations may use the quota and see it as an excuse rather than a way to encourage more voices to come along.  I get the point that was made about Irish music.  We need to think about areas like classical music where there is a much bigger challenge in terms of what needs to be done.  The principle makes sense.  Would it be better, even if quotas are involved, for the commission to draft a code and to do so as part of a broader programme?  As has been said, it is not that the radio stations just introduced a quota.  They have actively sought alternative voices.  Similarly, there is a challenge within certain sectors of the music industry to ensure that more female voices come through while in other sectors of the arts there are challenges in terms of getting more male voices.  I see where the Labour Party group is coming from but is this amendment a blunt instrument?</p></speech>

I am aware of the work done by former Deputy, Willie Penrose, in the area who brought forward an alternative Bill in the last term.  We put it on the Order Paper because of the concerns about the quota and the impact of EU rules on defining Irish music.  We copied the French example and focused specifically on Irish language works.  Obviously there is a smaller percentage on that proposal but we thought it might encourage artists to create music through the Irish language and, therefore, keep royalties in this country.  That proposal is on the back of any quota.  For this Bill, we did not propose that but we proposed in amendment No. 73 that the commission could bring forward a report "detailing the breakdown of representation in terms of gender, race, and ethnicity, on television and radio".  That amendment does not concern the quota at hand but it does concern talent.</p> <p>Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned radio and FM broadcasting, which I think will be around for a very long time, and that is underpinned by a licensing system and legislation here in these Houses.  All of us are conscious of their competition in terms of music and video streaming,  While linear television broadcasting might eventually be replaced by streaming over the Internet, radio and the licensing system will be around for a very long time.</p> <p>This year many festivals will have a more local line-up.  That will make a difference in terms of gender balance and the income from artists.  Similarly, that situation applies to on-air talent.  As Senator Sherlock mentioned, stations are committed to improving gender representation in their playlists but I think that the commission needs to study that aspect.  I was disappointment that Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 73 was ruled out of order on the basis of excessive cost to the Exchequer.  Calling on the commission or legislating for the commission to report on these issues is the least that we could have expected but, unfortunately, the amendment was ruled out of order.</p> <p>I commend the Why Not Her? collective campaign that has compiled data in recent years that shows 85% of artists in the top 100 chart were male, which is a huge figure in terms of radio playlists.  I know that in Britain female acts make up 20% of the top 50 British artists played and non-binary artists, who are represented by Sam Smith, made up 2%.  We all know that radio stations are one of few places where artists can make money from royalties.  So if there is unconscious bias in the industry, or in the radio playlists, then coimisi&uacute;n na me&aacute;n should explore that aspect whether we outline it in legislation or not.</p> <p>I confirm that I support the amendment.  I apologise for going around the houses with my comments but I was trying to speak to the many amendments that have been ruled out of order.  I also had expected to speak to section 31 that deals with reporting.</p></speech>

I am hopeful that either the Minister will accept this amendment or will bring some of its components forward on Report Stage.</p><p>The reason this amendment is important is because the section in which the amendment may be inserted is the media service code section.  At the moment we have the very good values, which I think many of us across the House agreed on and sought to strengthen under the powers and functions section of the legislation in terms of the different principles that were addressed.</p><p>In the media service code section there is a second positive piece.  There is a protection role and the promotion or participation directive.  So the audiovisual, AV, directive has protective functions, and participative, positive and proactive measures that it seeks to do to promote participation in cultural life and so forth.  As things stand, under section 46N, the focus by it nature, and I presume that is where the concern goes, is very much on the protective measures.  So that is protection of the interests of the audiences and provisions against those issues of concern.  We have all highlighted the different kinds of issues.</p><p>It is nice that amendment No. 112 seeks to show that media service codes can be positive tools that promote positive social goals.  Again, that is a power under the AV directive.  This is not solely about commercial regulation.  The AV directive mandates that there is inclusion and participation, which are good public goals.  This is an example of what could be done in terms of the positive potential within media service codes so that they do not just become a constraint, something forbidden, prohibitive, protective rules or close things down, which is necessary in many ways.  The codes also have a positive role, can mandate public duty, and reflect equality and human rights.  These are a number of practical proposals that could reference and give effect to the second mandate that comes from the AV directive.</p><p>Senator Sherlock elaborated very well so I shall not do so.  I was a member of the National Women's Council of Ireland around the time that some of the research was done, which the Senator referenced.  I wish to make one textual point and I reserve the right to table an amendment on this on Report Stage.  The research was very interesting, not simply in terms of the quantity of time given to male voices versus female voices on radio stations and in broadcasting, but also the nature of that time.  For example, the research showed that women were asked to talk about their experiences and men were asked to explain what happened.  I mean that the first person experience was sometimes used for women and then a male expert was brought in to explain the actual story.  That is another example of why women were not being given the same quality of time.  Perhaps there is scope to address a couple of these issues not just through section 46N, as suggested here, but through section 46L, which is the section on news and current affairs.  That space should be considered.  I, therefore, make the constructive suggestion that a gender equality provision is inserted in that section.</p><p>On quotas, these are hard quotas.  The question of giving the power at least to, potentially, set quotas is something that could and should be considered.  These quotas would represent a leap forward in terms of the broadcast of musical compositions.</p><p>On promotion, there is a mandate for <i>l'exception culturelle</i>or cultural participation and cultural representation.  That is one of the goals of the AV directive.  The spirit of section (ba)(iii) in the amendment is important and its percentages would be great.  If the Minister does not feel inclined to accept those specific percentages then the potential for the commission to set quotas would be constructive and represent a hard tool.  Let me explain why I think a hard tool is needed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was referenced that certain radio stations are doing better than others.  One of the reasons that some radio stations are doing better than others is because from time to time, radio stations have to go and seek licences again, so they are conscious that they are effectively having to seek airspace, be it digital or otherwise, but there is that question of being given bandwidth and there is a dynamic whereby the State gives licences.  However, the broadcasters regulated by this legislation do not have that tool of constraint.  The State does not have that lever to exercise in relation to the issuing of licences, so in that context it would be good if there was some form of hard tool that might be given to the commission which it could choose to exercise if it so wished in respect of a media service code.</p></speech>

I just happened to look up the Top 10 charts at the moment and they are predominantly dominated by men.  Harry Styles is in it and Elton John is even in there.  The difficulty is that if we enforce a rule to the effect that radio stations must play 50% of female artists - I am very much in support of playing more female voices - or we put in a requirement, the danger is that the listener will then go to Spotify, or somewhere else, to listen to what they want.  I have yet to be convinced that this is the best way to encourage more female voices to be heard.  I am not saying I am opposed to it but we may be inhibiting local radio stations in particular if the requirement is to meet a specific quota, rather than looking at other ways of encouraging female voices in particular or, in some areas of the arts, encouraging male voices.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the intent behind it.  The amendment sets out that an coimisi&uacute;n may, through media service codes, set air play quotas in relation to music content composed or performed by women or persons living on the island of Ireland.  In this regard, I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music on our broadcasting services, and in particular the promotion of Irish music composed or performed by women.  Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world, and I am keen to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to further nurture and protect this sector.</p> <p>I recently announced an additional allocation of &euro;10.5 million to the sound and vision scheme.  That included &euro;2 million to support live music projects.  I have asked the BAI to ensure that the application criteria seek to ensure that 50% of both the performers and the creative team involved in these projects should be women.  I have also asked that a similar requirement would be included in another forthcoming round of the scheme, which will provide &euro;2 million for Irish language broadcasting projects.  This will add to the BAI's existing strategy of ensuring funding decisions have regard to increasing diversity in programme content, including gender equality and inclusion, as well as the extent to which the creative team includes women in a leadership role.</p> <p>Moving from using supports to promote balance in programming to using legislative instruments presents challenges, in particular when airplay quotas are involved.  I am conscious of the legal factors which must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing any kind of airplay quotas.  Ultimately, the introduction of airplay quotas would need to be consistent with European Union law, in particular those provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guaranteeing freedom of establishment and free movement of services.  I am advised that any quotas in respect of airplay imposed on the basis of nationality or residence would be considered to restrict the free movement of services by placing music that is performed by persons of a particular nationality or living in a particular member state in a more advantaged position.  Airplay quotas on the basis of gender might be permissible under EU law if it could be demonstrated that such quotas could be justified by overriding reasons in the general interest.  The question is whether setting binding gender quotas in legislation would have the desired effect.  If airplay quotas based on gender are permissible under EU law, I would be open to further exploring this issue.  However, all of us would want to be certain that any legislation would have its intended effect.</p> <p>The amendment also provides that an coimisi&uacute;n may make media service codes in relation to broadcasters to provide for the appropriate representation of all groups within the community, on broadcast programme material and on equal representation on broadcast news and current affairs programmes.  I am absolutely committed to supporting diversity, inclusion and the full and effective participation of women across the sectors for which my Department is responsible and across wider society.  The question is whether media service codes, which are binding on broadcasters, are an appropriate mechanism to achieve this objective.  While I do not propose to accept the amendment today, given the importance of the issue raised, I will ask my officials to consider it further with a view to resuming the discussion on this matter on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I very much hear her strong commitments on gender and in terms of music.  I look forward to Report Stage, but there is an issue as to whether we are going to hardwire something like this into legislation or otherwise.

I am not sure how I can bring that back on Report Stage but at the very least, we should ask the media commission to report on these issues.

It was useful and positive that she correctly identified that gender quotas are something that can be done and there is a lot of EU legislation in respect of them.  That is positive, but on the issue of reporting in regard to music in particular, again, as Senator Warfield says, his amendment would not have placed a requirement for blocking, but it would have allowed a monitoring of what is happening in respect of music and other areas.  There are certain areas where the Government has more freedom to bring amendments than we as Senators have.  When we table an amendment and raise an issue, we are engaging in good faith.  It is not simply that we might get a "Yes" next time.  There is an expectation on this side of the House that the Minister may bring proposals and amendments.  That is something which is very constructive because then they are the Minister's amendments, and she has the control.  We would all be interested to see those.  I say that to indicate that we should not simply come at the discussion again on Report Stage, but that in fact the Minister might potentially bring amendments in this area.  The example Senator Warfield gave was about reporting, which is an area where we have been blocked from tabling amendments in respect of what gets reported on, but the Minister has the freedom to table such amendments.</p> <p>On the question of gender, it sounds like that is an amendment the Minister is considering.  I want to indicate that it would be useful so that we do not just come back to the topic but that there are proposals on the table.</p></speech>

In some ways, there are very specific known concerns backed by research and facts which are not addressed in the Bill, while it also includes wide provisions that can be interpreted.  This amendment looks to the question of protecting audiences from offensive materials.  The phrasing in the Bill is very widely framed.  It is not clear how the term &quot;offensive&quot; is to be defined.  For example, does it allow for the blocking of works of art which may include depictions of violence, sexuality, gender diversity or any other legitimate forms of artistic expression?</p><p>It relates somewhat to the previous debate we had on terms such as &quot;harmful&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot;.  It is appropriate that we try to address damaging and harmful communications, in particular those targeted at persons covered under equality legislation, the ECHR and other areas.  The phrase &quot;offensive&quot; is quite loose and the amendment is an attempt to amend that.</p><p>Other amendments deal with harmful content and we will debate this issue in more detail.  As was mentioned in our previous debate, the phrase &quot;harmful&quot; is quite wide.  Does it mean harmful to interests or at a financial level?  How is something harmful in that context?  The Minister will be aware that in this amendment we are suggesting that the term be removed.  I have tabled other amendments regarding the question of harmful or offensive content where I suggest caveats that might be added.  I want to be clear that I am not against the principle of us trying to tackle materials that are harmful or offensive, but there need to be caveats around how that is defined.  It should not be left in an extraordinarily loose way which could, in effect, end up being used by those with significant power to silence or diminish those with more marginalised voices or who are vulnerable within society.</p></speech>

I cannot accept this amendment as I am of the view that the principles and policies set out in section 46N must reflect the need to protect audiences from harmful or offensive content being broadcast.  This is, in part, due to the requirement in the revised directive that member states shall take appropriate measures to ensure that audiovisual media services which may impair or harm the physical, mental or moral development of children are only made available in such a way as to ensure that children will not normally hear or see them.</p> <p>I understand the point the Senator is making.  That is why I am examining this issue more generally in the context of amendments Nos. 92 and 93.  They concern a proposal by the Senator to amend similar wording regarding the duties of broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services.  My examination of amendments Nos. 92 and 93 will address her concerns.</p></speech>

Those amendments relate to harmful content, whereas this amendment relates to the media code.  I imagine a similar solution can be found.  I appreciate what the Minister has said.  I sympathise with the fact that there need to be measures in this regard, but it is just a matter of having better caveats and clarifications.  In that context, I will withdraw the amendment.</p></speech>

At the moment, the Bill states, &quot;With due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience,&quot;.  Again, if we talk about the fear that terms like &quot;harmful&quot; or &quot;offensive&quot; could be interpreted widely, the convictions or feelings of the audience are very amorphous and widely framed.  For example, as I mentioned there are those with very strong religious or other convictions in respect of people's existence in terms of LGBT rights, or feelings in respect of issues.  It is very subjective.  Somebody who was, for example, very financially well resourced but had a particular, and perhaps very narrow and specific, set of convictions or feelings could push on these matters.  I am concerned about that.  </p><p>I have suggested that we instead use the phrase &quot;with due sensitivity to the subject matter and the audience&quot;.  That recognises that there are subject matters that are extremely difficult for people.  For example, there are subject matters which should come with trigger or content warnings.  That is good practice on the part of individuals online, that is, the idea that when something is to be shown that may have a particularly significant impact it is signalled properly and appropriate.  There may be vulnerable persons who are impacted by subject matter.  </p><p>A phrase like &quot;due sensitivity to the subject matter and the audience&quot; recognises that difficult subjects may need to be addressed and also recognises that an audience may contain persons who are sensitive or vulnerable or, for example, have been personally impacted by an issue.  I understand that needs to be addressed.  It is not that I am against feelings <i>per se</i>because we do need to think about that.  Broadcasting has an impact.  Whenever a new show or prime time programme is broadcast, some people get upset and are impacted by that.  This amendment might be a slightly better way of wording this.

It is noted that the text that is proposed to be deleted and-or replaced reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act which has not, to date, been flagged as an issue in any public or stakeholder consultations carried out by my officials.  In my view, the proposed wording seems to broadly achieve the same effect as the original wording and, therefore, I propose to reject the amendment on that basis.</p></speech>

We need an acknowledgement that we are not dealing with the exact same thing.  Simply taking the fact that a previous piece of legislation exists in terms of the 2009 Act, we should legislate for what we know to be the world and its concerns rather than simply following through on measures from a previous piece of legislation.  I am concerned by a general pattern of, in effect, transposing measures developed in terms of broadcasting and not considering whether they apply relevantly and are as good as they could be.  Legislation is improved all the time, otherwise we would all still be dealing with UK directives from the 1800s.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is new legislation and I think we can and should do better.  My amendment is particularly important because it allows for a sensitivity to the subject matter as well as the audience.  The measure, as currently set out, only looks to the convictions or feelings of the audience.  Many can speak to the embedded prejudice in Irish society.  I am sure my colleague, Senator Flynn, has spoken to it on many occasions.  We have many deep-seated prejudices and convictions within Irish society.  If that is what the broadcaster has to respond to, then how do we move on and deal with a sensitive new subject?  How do we deal with something that might allow us to move forward?  I regret that the Minister is not able to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

In regard to the text of the amendment, the subject matter at hand in this provision is set out in section 46N(2)(c) which states "that in programme material audiences are protected from anything harmful or offensive, and in particular that programme material relating to gratuitous violence or sexual conduct is presented ... with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience".  I do not believe that a further reference to subject matter is necessary.  Furthermore, I do not believe that the proposed changes from referencing the media service providers having "due sensitivity to the convictions and feelings of the audience" to just having "due sensitivity to the audience" would change much as what would having "due sensitivity to the audience" mean in practice other than considering their convictions and feelings?  I am not accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

I refer to how LGBT rights have been treated in our media and in the media of our neighbouring country.  Due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience is one thing but what has happened is that the convictions of persons who do not really recognise the rights of transgender people have been given an equal footing with the feelings and sensitivities of persons who are transgender.  That is why I do not think convictions in this space should be given the same weight as the feelings and sensitivities of a person.</p> <p>I will withdraw the amendment and engage further with the Minister on this issue.  However, I ask the Minister to consider that particular fact because sexual conduct can be encompassed in that.  There are many bad examples whereby a person's desire or feeling that somebody else's identity is invalid is given a similar weighting to the feelings and genuine vulnerabilities of a person whose identity that is.  I am going to withdraw the amendment but I urge the Minister to think about that matter.</p> <p>I did not want to go into specific examples.  I do not like to have conversations that are around inflammatory topics but this is an example of a concern I have.  I am proud that Ireland has good gender recognition legislation.  Ireland has had a constructive and positive public debate on it but I sadly look to our nearby neighbour and the way that broadcasting has been framed in that regard, and that is the example I had in mind.  I will withdraw the amendment and reserve the right to come back to the issue.</p></speech>

At a debate some were saying we should remove moral development because they were concerned at how moral development might be construed.  However, I think moral development is quite good in terms of the ethics of respect and consent.  I had considered the removal of moral development in that regard but I believe it is very valuable.  When we talk about moral development, we are not just talking about somebody else's morals or a moral code - for example, from religious institutions or otherwise - so we need to add the phrase "emotional development".  That makes it clear that while something may come from a moral code, but it is in fact emotionally damaging or impairing to children.  That is why I seek to add "emotional" rather than remove "moral".</p> <p>Amendment No. 117 seeks to guard against an over-reach by media outlets but I am not going to press amendment No. 117.  My preference is amendment No. 116 which is the addition of "emotional" rather than the removal of "moral".  A very strong argument was made to me by persons who are concerned about the word "moral" and how it might be interpreted.  That is why a counter-balance is needed.  That is where amendment No. 117 came from, so that we do not have a situation where there may be, for example, vexatious complaints from those with particular moral convictions or perspectives.  When you combine the "convictions of the audience" with "moral development", there is a danger there which I believe should be counter-balanced.  </p> <p>Amendments Nos. 142 and 143 replicate amendments Nos. 116 and 117.  These are the same two approaches in respect of the provisions amending section 71 of the principal Act, which uses the same language as section 46(N).  They are the same points.  I included both of them because I tried to think of what this will look like when it is happening for people and what will happen in terms of the complaints or measures that might be taken and what the effect will be.  I would appreciate the Minister's thoughts in terms of those two approaches to the issue.</p></speech>

The term &ldquo;physical, mental and moral development&rdquo; is a transposition of the text of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive - for example, in Articles 6(B), 9, and 28(B).  The use of that terminology is required to properly transpose the directive and therefore I cannot accept these amendments.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister is bound by the Audiovisual Media Services Directive.  I may reserve the right to find another way to look at perhaps an additional point in regard to protection from emotional harm.  However, in a context where moral development is inserted and the convictions of an audience are referred to, there is a concern of a possible situation whereby there may be vexatious or worrying dynamics where media broadcasters are encouraged to filter out content that may receive complaints or not address issues that are important for certain elements of our community in Ireland because of a risk that by discussing very real and important sexual issues, for example, that they may risk complaints and we may have invisibility in regard to certain issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A negatively balanced and framed debate is one danger and invisibility is another.

I accept what Senator Higgins is trying to do.  She touched on a number of issues.  The Future of Media Commission held extensive debates on this and I participated in them.  They were about making sure broadcasters reflect on content.  There were debates on gender, the visibility of disabled people and how children are protected.  There was a special half-day discussion on this point alone.  The Senator is trying to enshrine it in legislation.  The Future of Media Commission was trying to ensure its reflection through a carrot approach rather than a stick approach.  As Senator Higgins quite rightly acknowledged, when it was assessed and a review was done it was found there are certain areas where improvements need to be made in Irish media but on the whole it is quite good.  I want to make this interjection to note there was quite an extensive debate during the discussions.  It should also be reflected.</p></speech>

Senator Cassells mentioned persons with a disability.  Persons with a disability have found that many people seem to be offended by discussion of their sexual activity, for example.  Persons with a disability have really had to push for visibility of their right to have relationships and be sexually active.  There have been wonderful films and productions that have tried to address this.  It is a subject that many people are very uncomfortable with and say they do not want to see it reflected in society.  It is a different example.  Given the context of the directive I will not press the amendment.</p></speech>

It is for the avoidance of doubt and makes it very clear that when we speak about sexual conduct, the limitations on the reflection of sexual conduct should not be construed to include educational materials that feature discussion of sexual content and seek to provide education on topics such as consent, sexual health and relationships.  This is so we do not have a situation whereby the convictions and feelings of an audience about matters of sexual contact are weighed against a constructive role in educational materials or educational broadcasting.  I say this in context of discussions with the Minister, Deputy Foley.  The gender equality committee had a very detailed discussion on the absolute importance of relationships and sexuality education in schools.  It is also relevant to online content on sites such as <i>SpunOut.ie</i>.  Sometimes it has been through online broadcasting that people have accessed information when there has been very uneven information provision in our schools.  It is to make sure we do not have an inadvertent consequence of the wording whereby it would be inadvertently construed as suggesting the impeding of educational materials.</p></speech>

It is not the intention of the section, as drafted, to preclude the provision of programme material related to sexual conduct for educational purposes, particularly on important topics such as consent, sexual health and relationships.  Instead the provision intends to protect audiences, and children in particular, from sexual content that may be considered offensive or harmful to their well-being.  I can certainly see the merit in the proposed clarification and I have asked my officials to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to returning to the House on Report Stage.</p></speech>

In that respect, I suggest in the amendment some of the areas the commission should have regard to in the preparation of the codes.  The commission is not simply regulating a business or sectoral area.  It has a positive role in the context of the promotion of participation and inclusion, all these principles of diversity and everything else we discussed in respect of the section dealing with the powers and functions of the commission.</p><p>Other amendments in this vein, including Senator Sherlock's, suggest specific measures concerning equality, participation, etc.  This amendment pulls back a little from that approach.  I leave scope for the commission to interpret its remit.  I suggest, however, that it should have regard to section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014, which is concerned with the public duty on equality and human rights.  The commission is, effectively, required to have regard to this legislation anyway in the performance of its duties, but this would be a reminder that the preparation of codes is one of those functions in which that public duty regarding equality and human rights should be reflected.  This aspect has been discussed in the context of procurement as well.  I refer to the public duty in respect of equality and human rights perhaps being present at a top level in an organisation but not being reflected in the key tasks such a body might be performing.</p><p>Turning to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability, UNCRPD, which Ireland has now ratified and which is, therefore, an international law that we have signed up to, this is another aspect that this amendment would ensure the commission should have due regard to in the preparation of codes.</p><p>The amendment also deals with the need to promote the Irish language in the State.  These are all existing commitments, but this is intended to be a reminder that the commission should seek to think about how they can be appropriately reflected in the media codes.  In the same context, I refer to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the need to support participation in art and culture in Ireland, which reflects the <i>exception culturelle </i>and the principles of cultural diversity and participation in the AV directive, and Ireland&rsquo;s national and international obligations in respect of climate change.</p><p>Many of these factors are reflected in the part of the legislation that deals with the general powers and functions of the commission.  I am concerned, however, with the tone in the media service codes, which seems concerned with what to avoid and the mistakes and pitfalls not to make.  It does not have a sense of a positive promotional duty.  This is why it would be good to indicate to the commission, in the context of the media service codes, that there is an expectation that it will consider these positive, acknowledged and existing policy goals of the State and the mandates of the AV directive.</p><p>I do not need to dwell much more on amendments Nos. 130 and 132.  I have suggested many things, but the fundamental one, and that which perhaps encompasses many of the others, is the public duty in respect of equality and human rights.  Again, this is a public duty to not simply protect equality and human rights but an obligation to promote equality and human rights.  This is what is in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  In amendment No. 130, I suggest - even if the other factors are considered too wide - that the Minister strongly consider inserting this measure into the section dealing with media codes.  Amendment No. 132 simply echoes the same provision in respect of media service rules.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#SS00400"><p>I thank the Senator for tabling these amendments.  Amendment No. 129 sets out several matters to which an coimisi&uacute;n should have regard when making media service codes, while amendment No. 130 sets out that an coimisi&uacute;n should have regard to section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 when making media service codes.  The objective of media service codes is to provide for standards and practices that are binding on broadcasting and video-on-demand services.  The Bill ensures that such standards and practices apply to commercial communications, including advertising, programming and the coverage of news and current affairs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that any standards and practices set out are not overly prescriptive, to the point that they are perceived to direct what types of content should be covered or to impinge on editorial independence.  I cannot accept the amendments, as they may contain the implication that media service codes may direct broadcasters or video on-demand services to prioritise particular types of content.  However, I understand the intention of the Senator's amendment in seeking to draw attention to the matters set out in the amendments.</p><p>A more appropriate place for some of those provisions would be section 7, which provides for powers, functions and duties of an coimisi&uacute;n.  Many of the subjects set out in the non-exhaustive list suggested in amendment No. 129 are adequately captured in section 7 in a way that ensures they inform the totality of the work of an coimisi&uacute;n.  For example, section 7(3)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, provides that an coimisi&uacute;n shall promote and stimulate the development of programmes in the Irish language and programmes relating to climate change and sustainability.  Section 7(4) provides that an coimisi&uacute;n shall have regard to the policies of the Government in respect of climate change and sustainability.</p><p>As regards the reference to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, IHREC, 2014, in amendments Nos. 129 and 130, as I outlined previously in the debate, section 42 of the IHREC Act provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights.  As a public body, an coimisi&uacute;n will be subject to the provisions of that Act.  I agree with the Senator's point that public bodies should comply with section 42 of the IHREC Act as a matter of course.  I would expect that an coimisi&uacute;n would not only simply comply with the Act but, as a public body, would show a culture of respect for human rights.</p><p>As regards references to international legal instruments such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, I would expect that an coimisi&uacute;n will, as a public body, have regard not only to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but all international conventions, which have been ratified and entered into force here.  I am not sure of the rationale for listing some international legal instruments and not others.</p><p>Amendment No. 132 requires that an coimisi&uacute;n should have regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 when making media service rules.  It is important that in making media service rules, the legislation is sufficiently precise as to the nature and content of the rules.  The points I have made regarding amendments No. 129 and 130 would apply to this amendment.  The requirement to have regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act is too broad for this provision and therefore I cannot accept this amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#TT00200"><p>I accept some of the points, but I note that equality and human rights have not been specified in section 7.  Again, that is an area where I have indicated an intention to table an amendment.  I acknowledge that I have had constructive engagement with the officials in the Department on the matter.  It would be appropriate for equality and human rights to be referenced because it is not a matter of it just being in the code; it is important that it is in taken into account in the preparation of the codes.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned a culture within organisations, but one of the problems that has been recognised in terms of section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act is that some Departments and public bodies believe that it simply applies to them internally in terms of their internal equality or human rights policies rather than as it does to them in the performance of all their functions and what they do in the world.  The reason I seek to copper-fasten it is because there is a gap and an uneven understanding of the public duty on equality and human rights.  I do accept that if it was addressed properly in section 7, which is an issue I have discussed with the officials, that it could be a potential way of dealing with it.  It may not be necessary to name the Act, but it might be useful to refer to the principles of equality and human rights being properly reflected in the section.</p> <p>One of the ways I have sought to address the issue in respect of my procurement legislation recently is that because I could not create a new legal obligation because, as the Minister rightly says, it is already there in terms of section 42 of the IHREC Act, but what I could provide, and which was within appropriate bounds, was that there would be a reporting on how that had been reflected.  Again, that was around a culture shift within procurement.  I am not creating it as a new obligation, because it is an obligation, but I was requiring that it would be reported on and that requires some element of reflection on it within a public body.</p> <p>It is a strange ruling on reports, but I accept it is not the fault of the Minister.  Some concerning decisions have been made on amendments in relation to issues being included in reports being found to be out of order.  That is wrong and it is an issue for us to tackle in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP.  In the interim, while that issue is being resolved within the CPP, when I engaged with the officials my understanding is that where I might be constrained in tabling amendments is in terms of reporting, but that might be an area where the Minister could table an amendment to make sure that when a body reports on what it has been up to that it reports on that matter as well.</p> <p>There may be two ways that it could be tackled, for instance in section 7, in terms of powers and functions, as the Minister outlined, but perhaps also in terms of reporting, so that it is not just there in the picture but in how the commission thinks about itself, and that would embed it that little bit more.  In the context of the constructive engagement I have had with the Minister's officials in respect of section 7, and in the hope that we might have constructive engagement around the issue of reporting, I will not press the amendment.</p></speech>

I hope that form or manner would include consideration such as the public duty on equality and human rights.  The report should be made not later than one year after the coming into operation of this subsection.  Currently, it states three years after the coming into operation of this subsection and every three years thereafter.  This is a very new area.  It is incredibly impactful.  In effect, it is an entirely new architecture of regulation and so it is very important that we get it right.  I am concerned that a three-year delay in terms of signalling how this has been put into operation may not allow the Minister for example, as the Minister who has put this measure in place and is familiar with it, to review the operation of the media service rules.  It would mean it would be another future Minister who might be coming new to the topic.  That is in terms of the first amendment, the specific one.  Again, we need to see how it is working and if we are getting it right and doing this the right way.  It is complicated and new.  The amendment would say that in not later than one year there would be a report on the operation of the media service rules.  Of course, it may not be perfect, and concerns may have been flagged.  The report does not have to say that everything is working fantastically.  In fact, if the report says there is an unforeseen consequence, obstacle or a problem that has arisen, that is fine, because that gives us an opportunity in this Oireachtas to amend and fix it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why it would be constructive to have a report within one year.  As I stated, it is not simply to kind of cheerlead the report; it is to ensure that everything has happened as we all hope it will and that it is working well.</p><p>I subsequently suggest that every three years thereafter is too long and propose that it be done every year.  I am more flexible on that.  I know it may be unduly onerous to report every year.  I was seeking to be consistent.  The important point is that the first report is produced after a year.</p><p>As regards the other amendments in this grouping, similarly, there is a proposal that it be done annually rather than every three years.  Again, this is the idea of an annual report.  In a very fast-moving area, that would allow for the recognition of trends or concerns, as well as action in an expeditious and effective way on those trends or concerns.</p><p>Amendment No. 136 seeks to ensure that the period of public consultation on the draft media service codes would be specified as being at least 30 days.  At the moment, the provision refers to "within such period as the Commission specifies".  The concern is that may end up being a very short period, such as a week or two weeks, on something that is very significant - a media service code that affects a large number of persons.  It seeks to ensure that people are not on constant watch.  There needs to be a reasonable period to allow word to get out that a consultation is taking place.  I suggest a minimum of 30 days.</p><p>Amendment No. 137 proposes that the draft should be available for inspection for at least 30 days, while amendment No. 136 proposes that persons should have at least 30 days in which to make a submission.  These amendments are to make sure there is a minimum period rather than a very short period.  I know it is not the intention of anybody to have a very short period but, unfortunately, the legislation does provide for that at the moment.</p><p>As regards amendment No. 138, which is the final one in this grouping, it proposes a period of four weeks.  I am ambivalent in respect of whether it is four weeks or 30 days.  The amendment proposes that a draft be available for inspection for "at least four weeks prior to the period designated by the Commission".  These amendments all relate to time periods.  It is about ensuring that we are giving people adequate time to engage with the media service codes and that the Minister or her successor are being given regular opportunities to engage with issues that may have arisen.</p></speech>

The requirement for review every three years, as proposed in the Bill, gives effect to Article 7.2 of the audiovisual media services directive.  As the current timelines in the Bill reflect the requirements of the directive, I will not be accepting this amendment.</p> <p>Amendment No. 135 would have the effect of specifying that an coimisi&uacute;n should make a draft media code or rule available both online and in a public place.  I do not agree with inserting the proposed level of detail into the Bill and, accordingly, do not propose to accept the amendment.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 136 and 137 both require that the period in which a person may make a submission to an coimisi&uacute;n regarding a draft media service code or rule shall be a minimum of 30 days.  The Bill, as initiated, provides that the period shall be as specified by an coimisi&uacute;n.  I do not think that circumstances would arise where an coimisi&uacute;n would run a public consultation process with a very constrained time period for responses.  Accordingly, I do not accept the amendment.</p> <p>Amendment No. 138 requires that a notice issued by an coimisi&uacute;n setting out that availability of a draft media service code or rule for inspection and public consultation period shall be published at least four weeks prior to the public consultation period commencing.  I do not see the merit in providing for a period of four weeks in legislation.  It would be more usual for a public body to give notice that a public consultation was commencing, rather than that a public consultation would commence in a specified period.  Accordingly, I do not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

This is a substantial set of new provisions.  While I am happy to accept the proposal in the audiovisual media services directive in respect of three years rather than annual reporting, I believe an interim report or some other mechanism that allows for proper scrutiny within a year to 18 months following the introduction of these media service codes would be appropriate and I may bring further amendments in that regard.  I say this as a vote of confidence in the Minister and her Department in having brought forward the legislation.  However, it would be appropriate to make provision that is not counter to the provision or requirement in the audiovisual media services directive for regular three-year reviews but may, in fact, be complementary to it.  I reserve the right to come back on that initial point in particular.</p> <p>As regards the consultations, unfortunately, there has been inconsistent practice in the context of consultation periods.  We know, for example, that consultation periods have happened at Christmas or in other holiday periods.  Many consultations happen in August and December.  That can create situations where persons are not given adequate opportunity.  I sought notification in advance because, having previously worked in civil society for 15 years and made a lot of submissions, I know it is arduous.  It takes time.  It is a significant burden to give opinions.  For civil society, NGOs and members of the public to engage in processes is, in itself, quite burdensome.  People need to find time on Saturdays or Sunday evenings and things like that.  That is why I think it is good to put this in context.  This is in no way to impinge the bona fides of the Minister or the intentions of the commission, but I need to press those amendments because they relate to good practice and consultation and, unfortunately, we do not currently have consistent good practice in terms of public consultation in Ireland.  Again, that is not a reflection on the Minister.  I know that her public consultations have been appropriately timed but, unfortunately, that experience across the public sector is uneven.</p></speech>

I spoke on the consultation periods, but I also believe there should be more regular reviews of the media service codes.  I will be bringing amendments requiring that media service codes would be reviewed on a regular basis in order we do not have, for example, imbedded poor practices that are ineffectual or loopholes.  We should not have a situation whereby certain actors end up with far more lenient media service codes than those who may be subject to later media service codes.  In that regard, I will table amendments in respect of when media service codes and media service rules might be reviewed.</p> <p>I also will indicate that in terms of public consultation, it is important that we clarify where the information on that public consultation might be, particularly as we are dealing with an online space.  It would be important that it is not a situation whereby people have to check the commission&rsquo;s website, for example, or others.  There should be other proper measures in terms of how it would be communicated, possibly through the media services, which are regulated by the codes.</p> <p>Lastly, I regret the fact that our amendments in respect of the use of algorithms profiling and microtargeting were not found to be in order.  I again challenge this.  It is important that we address conduct and processes that impact on minors, including the microtargeting, profiling and the gathering of the data of children.  Yet another new example was given to me today in respect of educational services that children access, which harvest their data and are then perhaps open to commercial targeting.  It is another example whereby it should not be the fact that an online educational service targeted at an age group of minors should be able to in any way, commercially or otherwise, share that information.  I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to how this is an issue that Senator Ruane and I successfully addressed in the Data Protection Act, one of the provisions of which has not been commenced.  This would be an opportunity for the Government to address any concerns it may have concerns in relation to the wording of that section of the Act, which was agreed by the Oireachtas.  It is a section of the Act but it has not been commenced.  This is the opportunity to address that issue properly and appropriately in this legislation. </p> <p>Again, I wish to indicate my intentions in relation to addressing these issues further on Report Stage.</p></speech>

This is to ensure that complainants can seek to end harmful patterns in broadcasting over time.  The current wording of the Bill is ambiguous in terms of the definition of &ldquo;related&rdquo; or &ldquo;unrelated&rdquo; broadcast might be.  It seems to suggest that there might need to be an explicit link between broadcasts, for example, if they are part of the same television series, in order to benefit from a provision whereby they are only limited by the date of the latest broadcast.  However, what about situations where, for example, a broadcaster permits problematic content in a clear pattern over time, which may come on over multiple shows or even channels?  It may amount to a framing of an issue or a person.  That content may be replicated in new debates, in debates about the debates, and debates about the responses to the debates.  We have seen that and we know how it can happen.  That is the concern.</p><p>At the moment it is not clear if situations where a topic, for example, or an issue that has been framed in a particular programme, with that framing then becoming a predominant frame that is then replicated across other programmes, would they be considered related broadcasts or not?  Similarly,  if, for example, we have a documentary one week that shows something inappropriate, a quiz show a week later that then follows up on it and then there is a phone-in show that chooses it as its topic of the day, are these programmes deemed to be unrelated, even though it is the same pattern of material?  The current wording would suggest that the complainant would be forbidden from identifying an earlier broadcast if it was outside the time limit, which may be insufficient and lead to a large gap.  We know that in actual effect, when something that is kind of harmful or offensive happens, the big dilemma everybody faces all the time is whether you should just ignore the bad thing because you do not want to give it oxygen and you hope it will just not happen again.  In multiple instances, we all know that when something that is problematic arises, you know that if you respond, that will become another story.  Therefore, you do not respond so it does not get engaged.  Yet, sometimes when you ignore something and it is not addressed or made a subject of a complaint, then it happens again and again.  The concern I have is that, for example, something that happens that a person chooses not to make a complaint about in the hope that it will not happen again, but then after sometimes even a considerable period of time, it gets dragged up and used again, thereby becoming a problem again.  There is a concern that, as it is framed at the moment, that earlier instance, let us say, the spark that started a particular heated debate, topic or framing of an issue is deemed to have fallen outside of the period of relevance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#VV01100"><p>Section 11 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, primarily to extend the complaints process to video on-demand services.  It is important that the complaints system operated by an coimisi&uacute;n contains some provision to limit the time period to which complaints relate in order that an coimisi&uacute;n is not receiving complaints relating to broadcasts that took place years prior to the complaints.  That is why section 11 of the Bill maintains the existing provision in section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 that a complaint must be made not more than 30 days after a broadcast in the first instance.</p> <p>I cannot accept amendment No. 140, as it would have the effect of enabling a complainant to complain about a broadcast for months or even years in the past, as long as the complainant groups the complaint with a complaint about a more recent broadcast.  Addressing historical complaints about broadcasts from years gone by would not be the most effective use of the complaints procedure.</p></speech>

There may be a short video that very few people saw and was not very highly viewed.  It is an unfortunate and sometimes very unfair practice where there is a lot of trawling of people&rsquo;s pasts, finding something and then using it in a negative way to try to use it and frame it against them or, indeed, to frame it in a different context or suggest a new interpretation.  Unlike broadcasting material, television, radio and so forth, which tends to be there and then goes by the wayside or is there on the player for a while or wherever else or in the archives, effectively much of what is broadcast online remains very much effectively current, searchable and findable for a very long time.  Presumably it is not a vexatious situation.  If somebody is going to complain about everything, they will complain when it first happens.  However, they may also not be aware of it having happened.  I do not look at most things and I imagine most people do not.  However, you may only become aware of something when it becomes amplified, increased or when a broadcaster with a much wider reach decides to take it up and give it airing.</p> <p>It is appropriate that there be consistency in this regard.  I do not accept that it is not an appropriate use.  It is an unreasonable constraint in relation to a person making a complaint.  Also, I would be worried that the provisions as set out at the moment could in fact increase the volume of work.  If the concern is the volume of work the commission faces, I would be worried that the provisions as currently worded and suggested to be worded in the Act may increase the volume of concerns, because there is a situation whereby you must complain.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is because you have a situation whereby people must complain.  If someone does not complain, he or she loses the opportunity to do so.  People in most instances will either just let something go or, because they will lose the opportunity to make a complaint later if they do let it go, will err on the side of complaining.  In terms of time and volume of work, we might be creating more work in a situation where people feel that they must make a complaint every time there is something that may be of concern and where they cannot, for example, see if the matter is going to prove to be problematic in the long term or if it is going to escalate.  For those who err on the side of not complaining because complaining is, in itself, so onerous, the Bill as currently worded penalises them.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to ensure that we do not see situations whereby complainants are left waiting for months to hear back about their complaint being dismissed where a decision may already have been made swiftly.  It is to ensure that even if one's complaint is unsuccessful and the commission disagrees with the complaint, that it at least notifies a person, so as not to leave him or her in a limbo that a complaint has been dismissed.</p></speech>

However, I believe that the term &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; should be retained so as to avoid &ldquo;30 days&rdquo; becoming a standard time in which a complainant would be notified rather than an absolute limit.  Although I do not accept the amendment today, I intend to return to the matter on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I am happy that the Minister accepts the principle behind the amendment whereby if a complaint is dismissed that the complainant knows that and is not left waiting.  Perhaps we could have an approach that simply mirrors the provisions where there is a different outcome to a complaint.  That may be a way of addressing this matter as well.

I have had some constructive engagement with the Minister's officials on this matter.  There is potential for harmful content to be clarified so that it includes, for example, content delivery and that there are mechanisms around how the content is purveyed and that that may be encompassed by the definition of harmful content.  Amendment No. 144 sought to add harmful "conduct" alongside harmful "content".

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#AAA00300"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I am very pleased to propose this Bill to ban unpaid internships.  We are all a product of the circumstances in which we were born and grew up and we all have our own stories about the chances and opportunities we got in life to get us to where we are now.  While many of us would like to think that merit alone has brought us to where we are, research suggests that the opportunities and earnings we have at the early stage of our working lives go on to have quite a significant impact on our lifetime earnings and career progression.  While for some young workers, unpaid internships are feasible because they can fall back on their parents' support or the support of another, for most workers - and I remember quite clearly my own experience when I graduated from university - working for free is simply not an option.</p><p>This is why the Labour Party wants to create a more level playing field in the world of work - a more level playing field for young people seeking work.  This is why we are proposing this legislation.  It is what we see as a long overdue step to ban what are called open market internships.  It would follow the example of the UK, France, Australia and other countries that have legislation in place to tightly regulate and restrict unpaid internships.  What we are proposing follows on from the call of the European Parliament in 2020 when it passed a motion calling for a ban on unpaid internships across all EU member states.  This was in the context of a wider set of calls for supports for young workers and jobseekers.</p><p>Ultimately, we believe that all work undertaken must be recognised, respected and, at the very least, paid for at the level of the national minimum wage.  That is why this Bill is called the National Minimum Wage (Payment of Interns) Bill.  We have known for years that networks and connections are crucial to opening the doors for young workers to access work experience and employment opportunities.  This is not a bad thing, but, of course, when those doors being opened is contingent on someone taking up an unpaid internship, that is when we have a fundamental difficulty.  In particular, we know from research conducted by the International Labour Organization, ILO, that young workers from higher socioeconomic class backgrounds are more likely to access paid internships.  It is interesting that the Social Mobility Commission in the UK observed in 2016 that work experience and internships are seemingly essential to getting a job.  It states that nearly half of recruiters indicated that graduates with no previous work experience would have little or no chance of receiving a job offer.  If those from less advantaged backgrounds are unable to access paid internships and cannot afford to do an unpaid internships, the odds are very clearly stacked against these young people before their careers even get started.  It is for this reason that we are bringing forward the Bill.  We believe that unpaid internships reinforce privilege.</p><p>We also believe that unpaid internships reinforce a lack of diversity across some sectors.  We know that in some sectors in this country and many other countries, unpaid internships are a rite of passage.  We think of the media sector, some parts of the arts sector, fashion, NGOs, the charity sector, law and even the world of politics.  Plenty of Members take on interns and trainees.  It is not quite clear whether all of them are paid.  When the question gets asked about why we do not see greater diversity in certain sectors, we need to look at the route into those sectors.  Unfortunately, we do not have in-depth research into internships in Ireland.  We can look to the experience in the UK, however.  Research there by the Sutton Trust found that while just 7% of the population is privately educated, some 51% of the leading print journalists and 74% of the top judges were privately educated.  We obviously do not have comparable data for Ireland.  While the figures in this regard may not be as high here, there is an important lesson in those from the UK.</p><p>Overall, there is limited international research on the impact on employability and earnings from what are termed open market internships, but we know from the ILO and other research that, on average, the research on this area does indicate that paid internships tend to lead to better outcomes.  There is a chicken-and-egg effect here.  When employers have to pay, they tend, on average to provide a better quality work experience, which is in their interest and the interest of the intern.</p><p>There are no reliable figures as to how many internships are undertaken here each year.  However, I am struck by the words of Ross Perlin in his book <i>Intern Nation: How to Earn Nothing and Learn Little in the Brave New Economy</i>where he states: &quot;it is striking that so much of our evidence for apprenticeships, in every period, is gleaned from legal records.  By contrast the meteoric half century rise of internships has barely left a trace in official records.&quot;  That is as true for Ireland as elsewhere because we do not have a comprehensive legal definition of internships and as I understand it, the CSO does not or effectively cannot pick up unpaid internships in its earnings surveys because the interns are not working to begin with.  However, we know from the GradIreland annual survey of graduate employers, from our conversations with the Charities Institute, which I want thank for providing its insights into what is happening on the ground, and, most importantly, from talking to young workers, that internships are most definitely a major feature of early work life in Ireland.</p><p>When drafting our Bill, we carried out a survey.  More than 200 young workers responded.  A clear and recurring message from the responses was the exploitation experienced by young workers on unpaid internships.  These are workers who have the same responsibilities as full-time workers and of whom there are the same expectations but whose employers do not feel compelled to pay them.  Some people will ask whether this Bill will apply to every training internship.  The answer is &quot;No&quot;.  We have set out a very narrow number of scenarios to which this Bill would not apply.  If somebody is shadowing somebody in a workplace, that is very different to coming in the door on Monday morning to be told: &quot;This is your desk.  Be grateful you are here in the workplace at all.  We don't need to pay you because you should be grateful to be here.&quot;  That distinction is important.</p><p>I spoke earlier about the lack of diversity in certain sectors.  One person we surveyed recalled that in his internships, he was surrounded by people exactly like him - middle-class and educated.  This person said he could work unpaid and rely on his parents for financial support.  He said that unpaid internships only serve in the context of gatekeeping corporate or public employment while using interns as free disposable labour.  We often hear that companies might not be able to afford to take on a trainee yet on the ground, we know this is often not the case.  One young lady told us that she interned for a well-known radio station for seven months and was not paid for the entire period.  She did two full days per week, working 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.  She was doing the work of a full-time employee - researching, booking guests, editing, etc. - and she was not getting paid.  The station would not even consider paying her travel expenses.  She stated that its top talent were getting paid absurd amounts of money.  Most of us here have probably been on that radio station.</p><p>We know that the business model of some companies relies on unpaid labour.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Another person said that internships helped them gain experience in a field where it would have been difficult to get work experience otherwise but they said their experience was that their internship was one in a long line of free labour availed of by their boss.  They were unpaid for nine months in an entry level job that did not require expertise.  Importantly, a paid employee was let go while they were on an internship there and the person took over their duties.  This issue of the displacement of existing and paid employees to make way for an intern is a key one.  The other key point we found in our survey is that unpaid internships are endemic in certain sectors.  A young trainee solicitor told us that they had to beg someone to let them work for them unpaid.  They worked for just under two years unpaid, never missing a day.</p><p>For us this is a simple Bill and it sets out a comprehensive definition of what an "intern" or a "trainee" is.  It is somebody working more than 30 hours per week within a period of four or more weeks and somebody who does not necessarily have a contract of employment but who is referred to as a trainee or an intern.  I spoke earlier about the narrow set of exemptions to this, which is important and which includes somebody working in a family business or somebody volunteering in the context of a charity.  There is a distinction to be made between somebody volunteering and somebody working within a charity or another philanthropic organisation.  If somebody has to undertake a traineeship in the context of their educational qualifications then that internship has to be linked to that specific educational qualification.  There is a check and balance in the Bill such that if there is displacement of an employee then that is grounds to bring a case to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.</p><p>More than 75,000 people are due to graduate from third level institutions this summer.  We want to ensure that each can compete for jobs on a level playing field.  We want it to be based on their skills and ability and not on whether their parents or others can afford to pay their rent that they will take up these jobs.  Our Bill is not about shutting down volunteering, the stuffing of envelopes for an hour or shadowing to better understand how a job is done; it is about ensuring that all work is paid and that there is an end to unpaid internships in this country.</p></speech>

I am proud to speak on this Bill and in doing so I want to thank my colleague, Senator Sherlock, for bringing forward such legislation and for all her hard work on it.  She has been championing legislation to improve the quality of life of all workers in recent years, from paid sick leave to paid leave for pregnancy loss.  I am also glad that the Bill provides for the needs of students, as they are more than deserving of the minimum wage for all the work they carry out.</p> <p>This Bill is simple yet effective and would bring unpaid internships within the remit of the minimum wage, which after all, is only right and fair.  Unpaid internships are often billed, advertised and promoted as incredible opportunities, learning experiences and exposure, when in reality we all know that unpaid internships are used by companies, employers, and even sometimes public bodies, to plug gaps in their workforce.  It is simply unpaid labour and it is unfair.  It is truly sad to realise that in 2022, as Labour Party Members of this Seanad, we still need to repeat the old honest refrain and mantra of a decent day's pay for a decent day's work.  Unpaid work not only makes it harder for individuals to make ends meet but it undermines the value of work across the board.  It also undermines the value of the skills, commitment and ability that people bring to this work.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the existence of internships may be a recent development in Ireland but the growth of their popularity should tell us a lot about how they are being used.  As Senator Sherlock mentioned, the responses from the interns to the survey conducted by the Labour Party on this are stark.  I was particularly taken aback by a response from a woman in the county that I live in, Kildare, whose internship was unpaid.  For her, it did not contribute to an academic qualification and it lasted longer than one year.  How have we reached this place in a modern and wealthy economy?  According to recent reports, the rich spent the global pandemic increasing their share of the pile, yet we still have people so badly in need of the experience demanded by companies and employers in Ireland that they have to work unpaid for more than a year.  It completely undermines the value of work.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Sherlock and her team, including Senator Wall, for bringing forward this Bill.  We are happy to engage with the Senator to get behind what it is that she genuinely wants to achieve and to see if it threatens the legal position or not.  We need to deal with her on that more.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill from the Labour Party on the national minimum wage, which addresses a concern around internships that are either unpaid or paid at less than the national minimum wage.  The Bill seeks to ensure that those performing work as interns are paid appropriately in cases where work has been undertaken by the person concerned.  The Government is not opposing the Bill and we are happy to engage in more detailed scrutiny of it to see what we can achieve together on this.  The Government believes that genuine internships, based on a training opportunity, can be mutually beneficial for interns, who gain first-hand and real world experience, and for employers, which gain from having another individual to perform tasks, often with a fresh perspective in the case of current students and recent graduates.  It will be important to protect those genuine internships that involve training and in that regard we have to be careful with any legislative changes we make with this Bill.  That is our concern and we will work with the Senator on that.</p> <p>This Private Members' Bill is particularly concerned with arrangements where a person is undertaking work that is of benefit to an enterprise or another host organisation and the danger that such internships could be exploitative.  We will all agree that should not happen and I am happy to work with the Senator on some of the cases she has put forward.  I accept her point that there should be a level playing field for those who can access internships.  If they are unpaid, that means they are not equal opportunities but we are clear that if interns are doing work then they should be paid and if it involves training in the Government-backed scheme, that involves payment in line with the minimum wage.  However, other internships that are not on a level playing field and I am happy to work with the Senator and the various sectors on those.</p> <p>The reference to performing more than 30 hours of work over a four-week period as a threshold has been put forward in the Bill.  At present, the term "intern", as Senator Sherlock said, is not legally defined in employment law.  A person is either a trainee, volunteer or employee under our law and employees, with some exceptions, are protected by the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and, therefore, while the Government acknowledges the intent of the Bill, it needs to be scrutinised to determine whether it provides any additional or enforceable rights to interns not already available in current legislation.  That is slightly different from the equal opportunity that the Senator spoke about.  That might not necessarily need to be in legislation and it might be possible to deal with that outside of legislation.  I am not sure, on reading the Bill with my team, if it brings in any new protections for existing interns but we are happy to tease through that with the Senator.</p> <p>Internships have increasingly become an integral part of the school to work transition for many young people.  A 2018 paper from the International Labour Organization, ILO, found that internships can be associated with better post-internship labour market outcomes and that there is overwhelming evidence that paid internships are associated with better post-internship labour market outcomes in the short term than unpaid ones.  That would match up with what the Senator is saying about her research; that they should be paid.  The Government actively supports and encourages the use of internships and work experience programmes at secondary and tertiary level and throughout all stages of further education.  We have an attractive scheme available, pathways to work, which is not being utilised.  It has corrected errors in the past and it is set at the right pay level but I would like to see it more greatly used.  I am sure from listening to Senator Sherlock's speech and from reading the Bill that there is no intention to change the status of such arrangements as part of this Bill.  We are at one in trying to encourage proper internships that give training, enhance the person and give them an opportunity for the future.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They give training in order to enhance a person and give people an opportunity for the future.  If I am wrong about that, please let me know, but I assume there is no intention to change that.  With the four or five cases set out, I just want to be absolutely clear we are on the same page in that respect as well.</p><p>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is also responsible for overseeing the processing of work permits, including internship employment permits.  One of the criteria for this permit is that the level of wage must be at the national minimum wage or higher.  Again, I mention this to illustrate that the Government actively supports genuine internship that involve training and we want to continue to support these types of internships as part of our labour market policy.  I assume we are all at one on that.</p><p>The Government believes that all workers should be rewarded for the work they perform and no individual should be exploited by performing work and not being rewarded fairly.  The Senators cited some cases that do not seem fair to me.  I am consciousness the employers are not mentioned but those are not something any of us would agree with.  The Bill appears to propose and to formalise a notice issued by the Workplace Relations Commission in May 2019 in connection with the application of the national wage to contracts of employment and what constitutes such a contract of employment.  It may seek to go beyond that.  If it does, we must scrutinise it in detail to ensure that what is being proposed has merit and, ultimately, is enforceable.  It is important that with whatever we put forward, we can monitor and enforce any provisions.  That is why I differentiated the matter of a level playing field for those people who cannot afford to take on an unpaid internship.  That might not be needed in legislation but it is certainly we can look at together.</p><p>As clarified in the Workplace Relations Commission notice from 2019, all individuals engaged under a contract of employment are covered under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 and are thus entitled to the national minimum wage.  That is clear in black and white.  An important point is that a contract of employment is defined as any contract; however, it is described whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or personally perform any work or service for that person or a third person.  There is no exemption in law from the obligation to pay the rates laid down in the National Minimum Wage Act when actual work is being performed.  That is very clear.  Therefore, the national minimum wage rates apply to work experience placements, work trials, internships and any other employment practice, regardless of the duration of the engagement.</p><p>The right to receive the minimum wage when work is being performed cannot be waived in a contract because any provision in an agreement to do so is void as a matter of law.  The Government believes that all workers should be paid fairly for the work they perform, which at a minimum level would be equal to the current rate of the national minimum wage.  This rate is designed to assist as many low-paid workers as is reasonably practical and to be set at a point that is both fair and sustainable.  Since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission in 2015, there have been six successive increases in the national minimum wage rate, from &euro;8.65 originally to &euro;10.50 in January 2022.  This represents an increase of 21.4%, which compares with an increase in consumer prices of 7% in the six years from December 2015 to December 2021, with much of this increase occurring in the second half of 2021.  We are all conscious of what has happened in the past few months with inflation but I want to make the link that the Low Pay Commission has consistently been ahead of the consumer price index over those years, which is right.  It is the case that we must look at what has happened in the past six months.</p><p>In addition to these increases in the national minimum wage, the Government is also committed to achieving its programme for Government commitment to progress to a living wage during its term of office.  In January 2021, the T&aacute;naiste requested the Low Pay Commission to examine this request and in March this year he received the living wage report.  He is currently reviewing the recommendations contained in that report and intends to bring these to the Government shortly.</p><p>Another point to note in respect of this Bill is that since the establishment of the Low Pay Commission in 2015, not only has the minimum wage increased much faster than inflation but the share of workers on the minimum wage in Ireland has also fallen consistently.  That is positive but we are conscious there is more work to be achieved.  The share of workers on the minimum wage or less as a percentage of the total labour workforce reduced from 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020.  However, the Government also acknowledges there are too many workers on low pay in Ireland, and this is something the T&aacute;naiste addressed in the Lower House quite recently.  It is clear that this is something we intend to address in a wider series of reforms.</p><p>The Low Pay Commission will continue to look into all areas of low pay, including effects on employment and the impact of youth rates.  That is in addition to the ongoing work of examining universal basic income.  Again, the Government is happy to engage in detailed scrutiny of this Bill and it agrees with the principle that all workers should be rewarded for the work they perform.  The Government is not opposing the Bill, but feels further scrutiny is required to assess in detail what additional enforcement rights it would provide to interns that are not currently provided for in the existing legislation.  I commit to working with the Senator on this, as I have done with previous Bills.</p><p>The workplace and experience programme is operated through the Pathways to Work strategy by the Department of Social Protection.  It is a scheme I have highlighted to many employers to the best I can, as well as people on the live register for more than six months, including time spent on the pandemic unemployment payment.  It is not being utilised to the level I hoped it would.  It is a demand-led scheme and we have set aside positions for into the thousands but fewer than a couple of hundred have applied for it.  Again, there is a combination of employers and a real shortage of talent.  They are looking to take on workers full-time.  In addition, unemployment levels have gone back down to approximately 5% much quicker than any of us thought would happen, which is really positive.  This workplace and experience programme would still be of benefit to some sectors and people.  I ask people to give consideration to that scheme.</p><p>The scheme has been changed and adapted in comparison with other schemes over the years and it is a very fair scheme that guarantees nearly 60 hours of training during a six-month placement.  Everybody gains, and it is well-monitored and co-ordinated.  I encourage people to look at it.  The current basic payment for participants in the scheme is just slightly under the minimum wage because it was set before the minimum wage change in January 2022 and we will deal with that and bring it into order.  It is practically the same as the minimum wage but it should be the correct level so we will correct it.</p><p>The people on the scheme continue to receive social welfare payments in respect of qualified adults and children.  In our view, it is set at approximately &euro;311, which is above social protection and correct.  It comprises 30 hours per week and is only for six months.  I encourage people to look at the scheme because it is a genuine internship programme with training.  It is well-monitored and it should lead to positive outcomes for those who need assistance getting back to work with an activation measure.  It is also important for companies out there who want to try to create new jobs but may not be in a position to take on somebody full-time.  This is a chance for a person to learn on the job and get the training before, we hope, getting a full-time job in the company.  The work experience is certainly important and all the research indicates that genuine internship schemes, which I believe the Senator is in favour of, can work and be a benefit to those who take them on.  That is only right and it is an area we want to continue to work on so we can deliver better programmes, if we can, along the way.</p><p>I thank Senators and look forward to further engagement on the Bill.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State outlined, the Government will not be opposing it.  Having said that, there are a number of matters which need to be examined.</p> <p>This Bill seeks to ensure that those performing work as interns are paid for their work and if they do more than 30 hours of work within any period of four weeks for another person they would be an employee for the purposes of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  The Bill will need to be examined in detail to determine whether it provides any additional and enforceable rights to interns not already available in existing legislation.  All Members across the Houses realise there is an issue and would be supportive of the idea.  Nevertheless, I am concerned about the finer detail.</p> <p>A key point in this regard is that existing legislation provides persons engaged in meaningful work for another person with full protection under employment law, including the rate of national minimum wage, irrespective of whether a written contract of employment exists or whether the engagement is described as an internship or anything else.  Arrangements that may be described as internships are not defined, really, by Irish legislation and it should be noted that the designation "intern" by itself has no bearing on the determination of the employment status of an individual.  I am sure Senators Sherlock and Wall are well aware of that.</p> <p>Once it is clear that an individual is undertaking meaningful work, as opposed to merely shadowing another worker or engaging in other training activities, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees.  Apart from the employment of close family relatives and in the case of apprenticeships, there is no exemption in law from the obligation to pay the national minimum hourly rate of pay when work is being performed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Therefore, the national minimum wage rate applies.  It is possible that the only effect of the Bill would be to clarify existing law and this matter needs to be further examined and explored as part of detailed scrutiny.  I will leave it at that for now and possibly will come back in.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Sherlock and the Labour Party for tabling this Bill.  It is important to have a good discussion about it.  It comes at the right time to increase workers' protections and rights.  As most of us who are on the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment know, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister of State are progressing much legislation to protect workers' rights, whether it relates to sick pay, remote working or the right to disconnect.  Much of what the committee is doing, which the Government has committed to, relates to workers' rights.  As has been said, the Government, including Fine Gael, is not opposing this legislation, but it is important to discuss it further.</p> <p>Senator Sherlock is obviously not saying that every single person should be paid, including people who are shadowing others for experience.  We sometimes find that people who are shadowing are behind a desk for another part of the day.  There is vagueness about who is an intern and who is not.  It is subjective, with employers possibly stating that they think people are only interns who are shadowing people, when they could be doing some work as well as shadowing.  We need to tease through that.  In her contribution, Senator Sherlock said internships can be a disadvantage depending on people's social backgrounds.  I get that and entirely agree with the Senator.  She said that not enough research is done on internships in Ireland, though there is sufficient research in the UK and elsewhere.  We probably need more research to be done.  It is logical to say that what Senator Sherlock said is true.  If people are not from a background where they have the advantage of their parents paying for their accommodation or upkeep for a while when they are doing an internship, they are at a disadvantage.</p> <p>The existing law was clarified by the Workplace Relations Commission in May 2019, which stated that the National Minimum Wage Act applies to all individuals engaged under a contract of employment.  The law defines a contract as employment as a "contract whereby an individual agrees with another person to do or perform personally any work or service for that person or a third person".  The law exists for someone who works.  It is important to ensure that employers are not taking advantage of people.  Young people could easily be taken advantage of.  They might feel that they have a great opportunity or that this is their one chance to get into a big company or a big-name profession to start their career, but they are actually just being used and taken advantage of.  While we might already have legislation in place, law to protect those people is important.  It is an interesting discussion that we can work on in a cross-party way to protect the rights of interns.</p> <p>We are focusing on the point of protecting people and people being used or abused in a certain way at work, but there is a positive element to internships too, which Senator Sherlock focused on in her contribution.  We do not have to look too far.  This House shows the positivity that internships can have.  People see the role of politics and what is involved by spending a number of weeks here, then decide whether politics is a role for them or not.  We see that every week in the Houses.  We know people who have started in internships and now work here full-time.  Members of this House started as internships, then worked, and are now Members.  It plays a key role in determining someone's career.  We should not take away from that.  I welcome the debate.  I thank the Labour Party, particularly Senators Sherlock and Wall.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-25a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1645" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022052500002#DDD00300"><p>I thank my colleagues from the Labour Party.  In the best traditions of the Labour Party, they introduced legislation for workers.  I know Senator Sherlock did a lot of work on this.  I have a difficulty with the proposed new provision in section 1, namely, section 2A(b), which refers to situations where "the worker does not expect and has no reason to expect payment".  I see a loophole there for people to exploit those who might be taken in on work experience or internships, in that they might claim they stated at the outset that the people involved had no expectation of payment.  The words "intern" and "work experience" have been bywords for exploitation in this country for as long as I can remember.  Junior hospital doctors have been exploited by working for many more hours than the ordinary individual.  They are paid, but by no means are they paid the sort of money they should be.  Accounting trainees are exploited to the last, working for 18 hours a day in some cases.  Young legal staff in solicitors' offices work for countless hours.  Devilling takes place in the Law Library and some involved are not paid.  The bottom line is that those particular terms have been used to exploit workers for as long as I can remember.</p> <p>When I was a teacher, I placed students on work experience and instructed them that they are not there to run errands or make tea, but to experience the job.  I placed one young fellow in a company in Galway.  In his time there, he repaired a particular apparatus.  He rang me near the end of the three-week period.  He said the guy he was working for was charging for some of the work he did and asked what I thought he should do.  I said to talk to him and say he wanted to be paid.  He did so and the employer in question paid him.  The employer said he never thought he should pay him but that he was right, since he did work that the employer received income for.  Sometimes it is a misunderstanding, sometimes it is exploitation and sometimes it lies in the grey area that Senator Ahearn was talking about.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn mentioned those who come into political life as interns.  I have not seen it in recent times, but in the early days here, there were interns who got nothing and were sent out delivering leaflets and newsletters for the Member who they were working for.  That was gross exploitation.  It was wrong in every sense.  That was not what they came here for.  They came for what Senator Ahearn talked about, which is to experience political life, to see how legislation moves through the House, and to get involved in research and such.  I do not believe Senator Ahearn or any of his colleagues today would want to engage in that sort of thing.</p> <p>We need to step back and look at how workers are exploited in this country.  We need to look at the terms "intern" and "work experience".  Both of those terms are misused and misunderstood.  Young graduates coming out of college are expected to work in a company for a year, to be grateful for it and to get no income.  That is just nonsense.  It used to be a rite of passage to give all of this time, but times have changed.  Rents are high in Dublin.  Parents are stretched to their collars trying to keep families going.  It is right and proper that work that benefits an organisation is paid for by the organisation.  I know of no intern who is genuinely shadowing another professional all the time.  If they are involved in the professions and are given work, it should be paid.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is work that is quantifiable and verifiable.  I am really anxious that we look at that.</p><p>I understand the question around working with or for family.  Clearly there is a likelihood that someone will inherit into the organisation and that is probably a good thing.  </p><p>I can see no apprenticeship that should not pay.  Back when I was a lad young fellows left school and I think &pound;2.50 a week was what they got when they started an apprenticeship and they moved up the salary scale as they went through it.  I have known the Minister of State for a long time and I do not believe he would want to see any worker exploited.  I see he has accepted this Bill, which is to his credit.  We need to be more serious about what internships and work experience is about.  There is a role here for the Workplace Relations Commission to educate employers.  We are in a new world and we have to educate employers, as well as those who place students into an internship or a work experience programme. </p><p>I was always very careful to advise the students we placed in an internship or work experience programme as to what was regarded as work experience and what was exploitation.  They were not there to make tea, sweep the floors or clean up in the evening.  They were there to learn and part of the learning was working and part of the working was work that generated income for the organisation.  That has to be the key measure.  If there is an income-generating aspect of the work experience, then that has to be paid for although how we quantify it might be difficult.</p><p>I am out of time.  I thank Senator Sherlock.  It is a great piece of work.  We might talk about the little line that I am not comfortable with.  I do not want to leave any room for exploitation here.  I really congratulate her.  It is a great piece of work by both of the Senators.</p></speech>

It has a very simple and clear purpose: to ban unpaid internships by bringing interns under the remit of minium wage legislation.  It is a progressive Bill and something we should all be able to support.  I am pleased to see the Minister of State is not opposing it at this stage.  I hope there is genuine consultation after this evening to see how we can progress this Bill.  It is very important.</p> <p>It is very important to listen to the examples that we have been given this evening about internships that are clearly exploitation.  There has been no end of them.  They have probably reduced recently because the jobs market has changed quite significantly but it is still a massive issue.  We should remind ourselves that it is not that long ago that Ireland's most famous fast food restaurant was taking people in for trials that they would never get paid for and they were never called back in for work.  It was all over Joe Duffy's "Liveline" show just before the pandemic.  It is something that happens all the time.  Hopefully we all agree that exploiting young people is one of the worst things that can happen because it really sets them up very badly for life.  One thing I have noticed is that the entry-level positions for jobs now ask for two or three years' experience.  That is a fundamental change in the jobs market that was not there before.  It puts people, particularly school leavers, at a severe disadvantage because how do they get that experience?  If the only route open to them is unpaid internships that puts a particular problem in front of us.  For wealthy families that might be something their sons and daughters can do and they will be fine but for working-class people, it makes life harder still.  In terms of establishing a level playing field there is real merit in ensuring that people get paid for the work that they do.  Therefore, I very much welcome the Bill.</p> <p>There are some related issues around young people and low pay.  Indeed the Minister of State touched on some of them.  I am glad to hear him acknowledge this evening that we have too many people on low pay.  When the T&aacute;naiste was in here about a year ago, he disputed that with me.  It is hard to dispute, however, because the OECD figures tell us that 23% of workers in the State, one in four, are on low pay.  That is a very stark figure and one of the highest levels in the EU.  It really tells a tale and particularly given the cost of living crisis that we face.  There are workers struggling.  They are at the end of their tether and they simply do not have the means to pay for their bills for their families and their food.  Therefore I have a positive suggestion for the Minister of State.  He always expects me to come up with positive suggestions and that is what I am going to do this evening.  I would like him to take a leaf out of the book of my colleague the Minister of Finance, Conor Murphy in the North.  What we have done in power in the North is make the Government a living wage employer.  Anyone who gets a contract from the Government in the North has to pay their workers a living wage.  Imagine how transformative such a proposal would be down here.  I would really welcome a positive engagement on that topic.  That is a way to really ensure that people who work for a living can earn a living.  That is a major problem at the moment.  </p> <p>While we are talking about young people I want to address sub-minimum rates of pay.  Again, I have a problem with that.  I am lucky enough to have a 16-year-old working at the moment for a summer job.  He is in transition year.  He is getting the minimum wage and I am delighted.  However there are too many young people getting paid &euro;7.35 an hour, which is the legal sub-minimum rate of pay.  They are doing exactly the same work as workers beside them but they are being paid more than &euro;3 less an hour.  I have to ask how is that fair?  How can the Minister of State expect people, even young people, to live off &euro;7.35 an hour?  It is not right.  It is not fair.  The issue of sub-minimum rates of pay must be addressed.  </p> <p>Finally, the Minister of State will not be surprised that I raise this next point.  If we are going to raise low pay, we have to give workers the means to negotiate for wage rises.  If a group of workers in a private company get together and say they want to negotiate collectively with their employer they have no statutory right to do so.  The employer can legally say that they will not negotiate.  If that is the case, then where can they go?  Where do they go for their wage rise?  How do they increase their wages?  You only have to look at the numbers of people who are dependent on working family payments to see that we have a massive problem here with people on pay that is too low.  The solution is to give workers a statutory right to collective bargaining.  It is an issue that the Minister of State and I have discussed many times.  Unfortunately we do not seem to be on the same page.  I believe that people should have a statutory right to collective bargaining.  If workers want to come together and negotiate with their employer, they should have the legal right to do so.  Unfortunately this Government and previous Governments have blocked that right.  We need to have a further debate on that.</p> <p>Returning to this evening's debate, it is very important.  There have been valuable contributions from everyone.  I think everyone acknowledges that there are real issues for young people.  We need to do more.  I would ask the Minister of State to reflect that if Britain, with, let us face it, a fairly backward Government, can pass legislation to ensure interns are paid it surely should not be beyond this Government to do the same.  I hope that there is real engagement on the back of this evening's debate.  I wish the Bill well and congratulate my colleagues in the Labour Party again.  </p></speech>

Senator Gavan touched on a wide range of issues regarding low pay and the living standards of workers in this country.  This Bill is a drop in the ocean in terms of what needs to be done but it is an important one for what we estimate to be a few thousand workers out there.  I am heartened by the support for the Bill.  Support is one thing and enacting it, or something similar, is another.  However, I was struck by the recurring question posed about whether interns are already provided for in existing legislation.  If that is the case, it is hard for me to get my head around a Government standing over a widespread breach of a national minimum wage Act.  We know there are breaches left, right and centre for workers of all ages but particularly in the context of internships because we see them advertised.  We have seen public bodies advertise unpaid internships.  There has been no response by the Government, which believes that this matter is already covered by legislation.  There is a real question about that.  I do not believe that internships are sufficiently covered by existing legislation.  That is why we have this Bill here this evening.</p> <p>To send a message out to employers and workers of all ages, but particularly young workers, it is really important that we would have legislation governing interns.  It is a bit like saying there is no such thing as platform working; everyone is just a worker anyway.  They are either self-employed or an employee.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=25"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->An internship is a distinct form of employment, typically seen as a training period for under or over a year, whatever, and that needs to be accorded a proper legal definition and the rights with regard to pay following from that.</p><p>Senator Ahearn touched upon a very interesting point in respect of the grey area between shadowing and doing actual work.  It is completely true that there are, of course, difficulties in identifying when a situation is shadowing or otherwise but we have to look at the context of where a person is working.  Are they working for a family member or in the context of training that is directly contributing to an educational qualification?  If we look at it through that framework, we resolve the issues in regard to shadowing and the actual work.  I say that with a degree of discomfort because all work should be paid and anybody undertaking an internship in the context of their education should be paid.  We were conscious in putting this forward this evening that we want to try to get as much support for it as we can.  We will be bringing amendments if and when we ever do get to Committee Stage.</p><p>The second thing relates to an issue raised by Senator Craughwell about the proposed section (2A)(b) and to re-assure him, and I am aware that he is not present in the Chamber but he can read the record, that it is important to say where it refers to the expectation of payment that it sets out the three conditions upon which there would be an exemption.  </p><p>I conclude by saying there needs to be more research to arrive at a better understanding of internships in this country and that is something that could certainly be commissioned by the Government.  I am certain that there is a level of understanding out there that internships, for the most part, can often be unpaid and there is an expectation on the part of employers that if they offer an internship, that they do not have to pay.  That is a major loophole in our legislative framework in this country and is something that needs to be fixed.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas.</p></speech>
