    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#B00200"><p>This is a welcome amendment on the notice periods for tenants.  There are significant increases in the notice period protections for tenants: from less than six months up to 90 days; not less than six months but less than a year up to 152 days; not less than one year but less than seven years up to 180 days; not less than seven years but less than eight years up to 196 days; and not less than eight years up to 224 days.  These are significant increases in the notice periods and given the climate we are in and the fact that there is a dwindling number of rental properties in the market, giving tenants an additional period of time to source alternative private rental accommodation is a welcome move by Government, which I fully support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#B00300"><p>I also welcome these amendments.  I suspect that they are probably in response to the increasing numbers of people getting notices to quit.  It is welcome that notice periods are being extended but it will only delay people presenting as homeless; it will not stop notices to quit.  For those reasons it is probably right that I articulate that we need to put a month's rent back into people's pockets and to bring down rents in that way.  We should ban rent increases in addition to extending notice periods.  I do not know if housing rights groups or tenants' groups were notified about these amendments.  As far as I am aware they were not and this move took us by surprise, which is somewhat unusual.  We welcome the amendments and I commend the Minister of State for bringing them forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#B00400"><p>I also welcome these amendments.  They come after other amendments that have been put in place by this Government over the course of the last year or so to protect renters, enhance their protections and increase their security of tenure, which is welcome.  The protections that were put in place are all welcome and include: additional notice periods; caps on rent increases; and the extension of the rent pressure zones.  They go a long way to helping with increasing renters' security of tenure.  The leases of indefinite duration are also important.</p> <p>The reality is that there would be no hope for people if we had not passed Housing for All and if the Government had not committed &euro;20 billion to deliver: improved conditions for renters; a massive increase in the social housing stock; the introduction for the first time ever of a cost rental model; and an increase of affordable and private housing.  For people who are renting and who want to have the security of knowing they are living in a place that is their home, these measures help them in the short term but the only way we can give people real security of tenure is by increasing the housing stock and we all know that.  I welcome these amendments and I encourage the Minister of State and the Government to press on with Housing for All and the housing delivery increases we need to see.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#B00600"><p>I will not get into a big back and forth debate with Senator Warfield but I must make some important points in response to what he has outlined, particularly on banning rent increases.</p> <p>We all want lower rents and that is why the Government is introducing cost rental and why we have moved to a situation where we have indexed rent increases to the consumer price index, or 2%, whichever is less.  We have to point out that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  We do not have to look too far to Germany, where the left-wing Berlin Government introduced a rent freeze and banned rent increases overnight.  What that did within a 12-month period was reduce the rental stock by up to 60% in Berlin, making it far more difficult for people to find the rental properties we are talking about.</p> <p>It is all well and good to put things out there but when one is in government one has to balance all the competing interests.  We have struck that balance and we have to do so on both sides, in favour of the tenant and the landlord.  There are many ways that money can be put back in renters' pockets and one of the ways it can be done is through taxation.  That is why I hope the Government will look at income taxes, particularly for those squeezed middle income earners who work the extra bit of overtime in the factory and end up in the higher tax bracket of 52%.  There are many ways we can address the issue but if we are going to have a debate on it then it needs to an honest and informed debate on what has happened in other jurisdictions in response to what is being touted by some in the Opposition.</p></speech>

On the point raised by Senator Warfield, the results of the review are set out in the legislation, and stakeholders were consulted.  There has been good consultation with stakeholders on this.  A further review of the notice periods is built into this legislation so I want to give assurances on that issue.</p> <p>The points were well made on the issue of supply and cost rental.  There are many elements that are built into Housing for All, which is gaining significant momentum, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has taken initiatives on constraining bulk buying and other elements that distort the market.</p> <p>Senator Cummins is correct that we have to look at the experience of other jurisdictions, which we have done and which has informed our decisions.  Cost rental is based on a similar model to the one that was initiated in Vienna so we are looking to other jurisdictions in how we frame our housing policy, in how we protect tenants and renters and in how we have a vibrant rental market in Ireland.</p></speech>

After centuries of Luxembourg being part of the Netherlands, in 1890 it finally became independent.</p><p>In 1947, the birthday of the Grand Duke or Duchess was declared the national day.  For 60 years Ireland and Luxembourg have had diplomatic relations built upon the shared values of human rights, the rule of law and effective multilateralism.  The close co-operation between our two countries spans multiple areas, including politics, economics, culture and other matters.</p><p>Historically, our cultures go back a lot further.  The patron saint, St. Willibrord, a monk who received his spiritual education in County Carlow and founded an abbey in Luxembourg in the 8th century, is celebrated there.  We also celebrated the 100th anniversary of the publication of James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>this year.</p><p>It would not be appropriate to mark the national day of Luxembourg without mentioning that in 1934, Joyce visited the country and remarked on its rose-growing tradition, which is still celebrated there today.  Our embassy in Luxembourg opened in 1973 to mark our membership of the then European Economic Community.  Many Irish people subsequently moved there.  This led to the establishment of organisations including the Gaelic Sports Club Luxembourg, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann, Irish clubs and even the Rose of Tralee.</p><p>There are 140 Luxembourgers living in Ireland, and 148 students came to study in Ireland in the academic year 2020-21.  We are delighted that Luxembourg has decided to open an embassy here, and we look forward to welcoming the new ambassador to Ireland.  We wish all the people of Luxembourg a very happy national day.</p></speech>

I also welcome their teachers, Mary, Frances and Cathal.  I hope they enjoy the day.  No doubt, Deputy Crowe will look after our guests.  I hope the students get plenty of treats and a few ice creams.</p> <p>Today I wish to raise the issue of the childcare sector.  As many other Members did, I had the opportunity to meet with childcare providers yesterday.  Having done so, I share their significant concerns over the sustainability of the sector.  As we are aware, it is a sector that families across the country rely on and one that is responsible for a significant part of how many of our children develop in their early years, which we know, from extensive research, is incredibly important.</p> <p>We must address the concerns of childcare providers, strengthen the sector and engage with the problems.  If we do not do so, we run the very real risk of a large number of services closing.  Should those closures happen, they will not be easily reversed.  I urge the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to examine the statements of childcare providers, review the core funding and take action as a matter of urgency.  While yesterday's protest was mainly about core funding, having spoken to providers and staff here in Leinster House, I am aware that there is also a wider range of issues that we must address in the short term to effectively guarantee the sustainability of the sector.</p> <p>A large number of staff employed within the childcare sector are on part-time or 38-week contracts.  They have no option but to sign on the live register for the summer months.  Having spoken with people, I know that it is incredibly demoralising and damaging from a financial perspective to be in that situation, given that they do such significant work.  Many of the people working in the sector have got level 7 qualifications and are dedicated to working in the sector because they love the work.  Obviously, they do not go into the sector expecting to get rich, but nor should they have to sign on the exchange for 14 weeks over the summer months.</p> <p>As I have noted, those working in the sector are essentially looking after hundreds of thousands of children across the country.  We must ensure that staff operating in the sector are respected and valued.  Otherwise, the great people working in childcare will inevitably go to another sector that treats them better.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It should be noted also that this Government has begun to address the sector in a more comprehensive manner, with the establishment of a joint labour committee, and it has invested in core funding for the first time in budget 2022.  However, it is clear that the enhanced investment that is required in budget 2023 must address this, and in advance of the budget we must ensure the sector is sufficiently funded to make it sustainable in the short term.  I urge the Leader of the House, Senator Doherty, to request that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, would attend this House and debate and prioritise this matter.</p></speech>

I second his call for a debate on the matter.  There are issues surrounding core funding.  We know the importance of the childcare sector, which is of growing importance in society.</p><p>I have spoken previously and requested a debate on the many positives of greenways, blueways and plans for active travel across the country.  Unfortunately, being up here, I missed the public consultation in recent days in Moycullen and Oughterard and this evening in the Clybaun Hotel in Galway on the Galway to Oughterard greenway, a project that was mooted as far back as 2013 or 2014.  Despite valiant efforts to try to make progress over the years by direct consultation and engagement with landowners, unfortunately, they did not allow for the lodging of a planning application up to now.  Those involved have gone back to the start, as it were, and have begun a process of engagement.  Part of that is because of the recent agreements to which the farm organisations have signed up.  When the former Minister, Shane Ross, was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department initiated a process whereby farm organisations signed up to a protocol on engagement and compensation regarding greenways.  That has been a game-changer in terms of allowing this process to go forward.  More important than that is the result of the south Kerry greenway decision, which was seen as a template for other local authorities.</p><p>I have raised this issue on numerous occasions.  Those two pieces: the result of the court case in south Kerry and the landowners' agreement, have allowed for this process to move forward.  There is a commitment across the political spectrum.  It is important that landowners and homeowners are treated with respect and that we get the best possible route that interferes in the least possible fashion with landowners, but at the same time delivers what would be a world-class piece of infrastructure, which will not only be available for tourists and for locals alike, but would be hugely beneficial in areas like Moycullen, Rosscahill and even as far as Oughterard, in terms of commuting into Galway city.  A lot of people in my area in Moycullen and further on who work in NUIG or the hospital, as well as students who are attending NUIG or the new Atlantic Technological University, would commute this way.  This would be a game-changer in terms of commuting, tourism and local amenity and leisure.  There is a consultation today in the Clybaun Hotel from noon to 9 p.m.  Comments and views are to be sent back by 15 July.  The website for providing information is <i>galwaytooughterardgreenway@aecom.com</i>.  There are a lot of positives happening and it is worthy of a positive debate on such issues across the country.  The Leader might raise the matter with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p></speech>

I speak as someone who has always said on immigration matters that I believe in a policy that is generous but structured, structured but generous.  That applies not just to those seeking asylum, but also to those who are known as economic migrants, who seek to make a better life for themselves - people who are fleeing poverty and so on.  Only a fool would say that there can be no limits to that process.  Globalisation has benefited us financially and it is not surprising that First World countries like ours would have a continual stream of people seeking to make a better life here.  We have plenty of room in this country.  We had 8 million people before the Famine, but the question is whether we have either the plan or the resources.  If we are failing our own citizens badly on housing and health and if we present as if we can take endless numbers of people, that is an irresponsible approach.  Sooner or later, it will generate problems of social cohesion.</p> <p>Yesterday in the D&aacute;il, the Minister seemed to have indicated that there is no cap and no ceiling.  As far as I can see, that is the first time such a policy has been espoused.  What worries me is that there appears to be no plan either.  That is what Deputy Nolan was right to ask about.  What are our plans?  If she is asking quite legitimately if it is intended or foreseen that people will be living on the floors of hotel rooms indefinitely, she is exercising an important responsibility as a Member of the D&aacute;il in challenging the Government about that.  I know the answers to these issues are not easy, but the questions have to be asked.  If our response to issues from gender to immigration in society is to accuse people who ask the hard questions of somehow seeking to foment discord or to stoke up discontent, that is monstrous.  It is always a temptation for politicians, in particular those in power, to try to pretend that problems do not exist, while in fact they may be developing.</p> <p>I often have the experience where people in a taxi or wherever else say that we have to look after our own people first.  I always push back against that, but at the same time I always note it, because it has to be noted.  It is not enough to just educate people to have the right attitudes; we also need to reassure people that the plans are being put in place.  Irish people are generous once they know that there are common-sense plans.</p></speech>

My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and his Department are currently working with the HSE's national women and infants health programme to increase capacity and reduce waiting times for women awaiting general gynaecology through the implementation of the ambulatory gynaecology model of care.</p> <p>This is a very positive development, and I look forward to seeing this model implemented on the ground in the midlands.  First, what is an ambulatory gynaecological model of care?  Essentially, it is a one-stop "see and treat" ambulatory gynaecology clinic.  This model of care is a more efficient and effective use of resources than the traditional outpatient model.  An estimated 70% of general gynaecology referrals are suitable for management in the ambulatory setting, and so I welcome the introduction of ambulatory clinics in the midlands and elsewhere, which will deliver a number of outcomes.  They will improve access to gynaecology services; reduce the requirement for multiple gynaecology appointments; ensure sustainability of service provision into the future, given the very significant waiting lists for this specialty; and importantly, help improve clinical outcomes.</p> <p>Investigations available include pelvic ultrasound, diagnostic hysteroscopy, and endometrial biopsy.  Nine of these clinics are now operational across the country.  A regional hub for women's health, which includes a specialist menopause clinic, was recently opened in Nenagh, County Tipperary.  This is the first ambulatory gynaecology clinic to be operational for women in the midlands counties.  I am conscious that Nenagh is a considerable distance from much of the rest of the midlands.  From my own home in north Offaly, it is more than an hour by car to Nenagh.  Therefore, I was delighted to hear that work is already under way on the recruitment, refurbishment and equipping of an ambulatory gynaecology clinic in Portlaoise, which is expected to be operational later this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pippa Hackett:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=0000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=0000&amp;amp;pid=PippaHackett&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--><font color="#2F2F2F">Budget 2022 funding will facilitate the establishment of further ambulatory gynaecology clinics, including in Mullingar and Kilkenny, thereby completing the implementation of the ambulatory gynaecology model of care, bringing the total number of these clinics to 20 nationally.  These clinics will be associated with each of the 19 maternity hospitals across the country, as well as Tallaght University Hospital.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> On maternity services, specifically in the midlands, funding packages of &euro;223,000 and almost &euro;400,000 were provided in 2021 to Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar and Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise, respectively, for the recruitment of additional staff into maternity services at the hospitals.  This included five clinical midwifery managers for both hospital- and community-based services, a medical social worker and healthcare assistants in Portlaoise and an assistant director of midwifery in Mullingar.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> These developments are contributing, and will continue to contribute, to greatly improved access to and quality of care for women who need to avail of it.  I look forward to hearing from midlands women about their experiences of these services on the ground over the coming months and years.</font></p></speech>

Today another name is being added to that list.  I am really saddened that artists at Richmond Road Studios are effectively being shut out of their place of work and creativity as of today.  We need to hear from the responsible Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, about what she intends to do about the wider issue of the hollowing out of artists&rsquo; spaces across the city.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The report on special needs education, published this week by the Ombudsman for Children, is very important and must be a wake-up call for the whole Government.  The lack of planning by the Department of Education and of joined-up thinking between the Departments of Education and Health are simply terrifying.  They are terrifying because we know that weeks, months and a few short years matter in the lives of children, particularly those with additional educational needs.  What is particularly terrifying is the waiting time for a diagnosis.  In Dublin 7, the local children&rsquo;s disability network team has a waiting time of up to three years, or more, just to access a diagnosis.  That is before access to treatments and therapies.  Getting a diagnosis is the gateway to so many additional educational supports.  The recommendation in the ombudsman&rsquo;s report is really important in that there have to be other gateways to supports.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Waiting lists are because of huge shortages within the health system in respect of therapists and those who can provide diagnostic services.  I call again for the Minister for Health to come to this House to set out in detail his workforce plans.  Throughout the country there is a massive shortage and a huge crisis with regard to recruitment in the health service.  We have not heard detail from the Minister on how he is going to address the problem.</font></p></speech>

The website of the Ombudsman for Children states it is Mr. Muldoon&rsquo;s job to make sure the children in Ireland are treated fairly.  The report, published yesterday, is probably one we all know and have heard stories about.  It is now formally on the Government&rsquo;s record that children with additional needs are being failed by the Department of Education.  The Minister of State in that Department, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley, have spent huge amounts on special educational needs.  They spent &euro;2 billion extra.  They spent 25% extra in the budget.  The Minister of State promised yesterday to speed up legislation to ensure the section 37A process will work more effectively.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  In the report, the ombudsman said we need to be more imaginative when it comes to education for children with additional needs.  It is really welcome that the responsibilities of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be moved to the Department responsible for equality.  This will start in July.  I hope there will be a movement on the therapy side.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  On the education side, however, it is easy to open up a class but it is not easy to support it properly.  If the Minister is to open extra classes, which I hope she will do, we must ensure they receive the right supports, including occupational therapy, speech and language, and psychology supports.  Opening up a class in name will just not work out.  It would entail an appropriate placement and parents and children would be back to square one, having to stay at home.  If we are to move forward by opening up more special classes, it will have to be done appropriately; otherwise, it will just be lip service.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The figures were shocking.  Some 15,000 children were travelling outside their catchment areas and not going to the local schools.  This is so unfair.  They already have additional needs and they must leave their siblings behind every day.  I have heard stories of toddlers being offered transport in taxis to go to cr&egrave;ches.  It is absolutely unbelievable.  The additional-needs environment or framework is all wrong.  If anything, the Government needs to consider the wording that Mr. Muldoon included in his report.  The system needs to be reimagined and recalibrated because the current system, from therapy and early intervention to school placements at primary and secondary levels, is absolutely broken.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  I commend the Leave Our Leave campaign, whose representatives were outside the Oireachtas today.  It is a campaign to ask the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, to amend the maternity legislation to allow women undergoing cancer treatment to defer that treatment until they are ready to take their maternity leave.  Many women receiving cancer treatment may have only one opportunity to have maternity leave, given the nature of cancer treatment.  I ask everyone to support this.</font></p></speech>

While it is late and there is no point in saying otherwise, at least the students now have a date.  As the leaving certificate examinations draw to a conclusion, I wish all the young people involved a very enjoyable summer.  They well deserve it and have it well earned.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Unfortunately and sadly, there have been three suicides of young people in the Traveller community in recent days.  One involved a child of nine in the city of Dublin.  Therefore, I support the call by the Traveller groups for a dedicated mental health strategy for the Traveller community.  Mental illness is a problem in this country anyway.  I am aware that much work is being done and that a lot more needs to be done; however, with the prevalence of mental health issues within the Traveller community, it is appropriate at this stage to have a dedicated mental health strategy involving all the stakeholders.  It should be properly and effectively funded.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  Again, I request a dedicated debate in the House on the issue of long Covid.  A long Covid clinic is to be opened in due course.  It should be open already.  This is a big issue.  Unfortunately, a percentage of our population are now suffering greatly as a result of long Covid.  I do not believe they are getting the intervention they need to address the deteriorating health circumstances related to long Covid.  Unfortunately, as the narrative moves away from Covid and it is not dominating the headlines like it used to, although it still exists in society, I do not want the people who have long Covid to be forgotten about.  Unfortunately, it might not be possible to have the debate this side of the summer; however, certainly in September, we need to have the Minister of Health in here to engage in a detailed way on this issue.</font></p></speech>

I request that the Minister - not a Minister of State but the Minister with ultimate responsibility for health - comes to the House.  It would be remiss of us to adjourn this summer without a dedicated debate, maybe in three or four modules over a half day or day, on the growing concern over our health services.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I respect that Members are in different groupings and parties in the coalition but one thing I can say is there is a genuine concern across all strands of the political groupings in this House.  I, therefore, ask that the Minister come to the House.  I raised a number of issues, including scoliosis, over a period of months.  There has been no progress on these issues.  I do not intend to give the Minister a scalding.  That is not what I am about.  I want constructive debate but I want to look the Minister in the eye where the Leader is now sitting and put a number of questions to him;  I would like if that could be taken on board.</p><p>I also thank the Senators who were here last night and who engaged in a really positive debate around the Patients Deserve Better campaign.  It showed that the House was united.  I thank everyone for their contributions.  I received an email this morning from one of the members of the campaign who tuned in as they did not attend the debate.  We also had visitors in the Public Gallery as well.  This person was highly impressed by the fact that it was a cross-party initiative.  This says something about this House.  We were at our best yesterday so I thank the people who prepared and were involved in that.  </p><p>From 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. tonight, the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage will be discussing the general scheme of the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks Bill 2022.  What a national scandal it is.  No decision has yet been made about whether there will be pre-legislative scrutiny.  This is the committee's attempt to bring these groups from Clare and Donegal and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage together over a series of modular meetings to discuss it.  If anyone has an opportunity to link in or pass on the link to his or her constituents or those who will be interested, I think it will be a lively and interesting debate.  A huge number of people will come to the gates of Leinster House regarding this issue in addition to those coming to the meeting.  It will be a good meeting but let us not suspend our call for pre-legislative scrutiny at some point on this critical piece of legislation.  </p></speech>

Accurate and timely journalism has never been so important in this country.  This was a comment from the Law Society of Ireland as it yesterday awarded its Justice Media Awards for 2022.  I compliment people like Mary Carolan, Simon Carswell, Peter O'Dwyer, Catherine Sanz, Michael Doyle, Barry White, Michelle Hennessey and many more.  In a local context, I was delighted that my former colleagues in Shannonside Northern Sound won the Justice Media Award in the Broadcast Journalism (local radio) category.  I offer my congratulations to Joe Finnegan, Anne Norris, Tommy Stenson, Kevin McDermott, Kevin McGillicuddy and Daniel Considine.  They won the award for series of reports entitled "Making and breaking the law".  The point I want to make concerns the importance of these people.  While we might not always agree with them or might get annoyed with them from time to time, they are the real journalists.  </p> <p>We had a debate here yesterday about the new electoral Bill.  There are outside forces - people we do not know and cannot identify and people in social media circles - who are deliberately interfering with our democracy.  We should laud these awards and the people who produce these programmes be they national or local.  Will Faulkner, Ellen Butler, Sin&eacute;ad Hubble and Robert Fahy from Midlands 103 got a merit certificate.  These people are all doing fantastic work so let us laud them today.  Long may they live and continue to do this kind of work.</p> <p>It is always nice to have a good news story.  I know there is a lot of talk about the cost of living and the hardship people are going through.  We all meet them.  However, we should acknowledge that the Minister for Social Protection has announced the opening of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme worth &euro;58 million.  More than 120,000 families will automatically get their entitlements.  There is increased funding, which is needed.  We should encourage everybody who thinks he or she should get the payment automatically but does not to inquire about it because it will be crucial for families this year.  </p></speech>

It was long overdue. </p> <p>I support Senator Boyhan's call for this House to have a rolling debate on health.  I made a point yesterday about disability matters.  It is not about bringing in the Minister for Health; the Minister for Health, Deputy Butler; the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte; or the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  This House also needs accountability from those charged with the administration of the system of health delivery.  That debate would be useful and timely.</p> <p>In light of the comments by European Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union, Mairead McGuinness, who questioned the energy security and supply of Europe in the autumn, I ask as a matter of extreme urgency that we have a debate with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications on energy security.  I know the Minister was in the House yesterday regarding annual transition statements but given that prior to the Ukraine war, 40% of European gas came from Russia, it would be an opportunity for this House to hear from the Minister about what our plans as a nation are when it comes to energy security and supply.  I know we have 90 days stockpiled but it is important that we give clarity and certainty to people and have this debate as a matter of urgency.  </p></speech>

This year is our first year on the streets since the pandemic so we are looking forward to sharing our love with the city and asserting our right and freedom to be public in this country.  It is a protest so we will march and make demands for healthy conversations we approach with sensitivity, respect and a meaningful voice, conversations that affect our lives instead of being a talking point or reliable media controversy.  As we continue to make our country a more equal place, let none of us pull the ladder up behind us.  Many people are still waiting for their liberation so we must acknowledge that too.</p> <p>Regarding night-time entertainment, I know the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media and the Minister for Justice are committed to overdue reform of our licensing laws and enabling cultural spaces to be better used at night for artistic purposes, events and entertainment.  I call for a debate and I might table a motion on the Order Paper to that effect in the coming weeks.  </p></speech>

The Department of Education approached her in January 2022 to see whether she would like two extra classrooms to cater for pupils with autism.  The school jumped at this expecting that it would be for September 2023.  The Department came back and said it wanted it for September 2022.  Being the professional board it is, the board of management got on it straightaway and got all the information in.  I have the paper trail here.  It shows that the Department is lacklustre to say the least in approving and acknowledging the information the school was submitting within a matter of hours of being asked.  This is something that would be more appropriate for a Commencement Matters debate, which I hope to submit next week because I want to got into the detail of it, but the point I am making is that the Department is coming to a school, asking whether it would like to have extra classroom space for ten children who are already enrolled and nine families come September and then because of bureaucracy and perhaps civil servants not doing the jobs they are supposed to do, they are not getting the proper responses back in time to be able to get this over the line in what is a short period of time in the first place.  A bottleneck exists and I would like to go into greater detail about it with the Minister for Education if that is possible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the &euro;96 million fine levied on AIB as a result of the tracker mortgage scandal, I heard on the radio this morning that this money is set to go back into the Exchequer.  I ask that we have a discussion with the Minister on ring-fencing that money to contribute towards the cost-of-living crisis we are experiencing in this country and across the European Union.  This &euro;96 million should not go back into the general Exchequer to be spread all over; it should be ring-fenced and specifically used to help people with the cost-of-living crisis we are experiencing.</p></speech>

I do not doubt the Senator's sincerity whatsoever but I am from a constituency where this sort of conversation or tone has been happening in recent weeks.  Colleagues might have listened to a disgraceful interview on "Today with Claire Byrne" this morning.  Those are not the views of people in Tipperary but I have been hearing an undertone for weeks that we need to have a cap on refugees coming in because we need to look after our own.  Those are disgraceful comments and they should not be followed but this has been happening for quite some time and the narrative is that the only reason we do not want the refugees is the accommodation they are being given.  That is utter rubbish and it is not true.  All anyone has to do is listen to the contributions of the four Ukrainian MPs who were here last week.  Lesia Vasylenko has been in nine different European countries and she has said that the treatment that Ukrainian refugees are receiving in Ireland is second to none.  They were leaving Ireland to go to the UK to ask the UK to follow what Ireland does to care for Ukrainian refugees.  The narrative that people like Deputy Mattie McGrath and others are using is dividing and worrying people in my community and it is creating a narrative that Irish people are being left behind because we are looking after Ukrainians on a temporary basis.  This is utterly unacceptable and should not be stood for.</p> <p>We have a situation that will develop in the coming weeks.  The House will remember that when we first took in Ukrainian refugees there was no need for visas and they were allowed in; all they had to do was say they were Ukrainian at the airport.  That was the right thing to do and that has been successful.  We have an emerging problem in that people want to go home but they cannot do so because they do not have passports or papers.  They cannot leave Ireland and because we are not in the Schengen zone, they cannot travel through the EU to get back to Ukraine.  We need the EU or the Minister for Foreign Affairs to bring in measures so that people who want to leave Ireland to go home can do so.  We have a crazy situation where they have to apply for passports, which will take six months, or they can get a certificate people would normally get if they lost their passport or something like that.  However, because of the conflict in Ukraine and the challenges we know the embassy is having in Ireland, those certificates cannot be got either.  We have a crazy situation where people want to go home but they cannot leave Ireland.  That needs to be resolved and that would help with all the other problems we have.</p> <p>Instead of talking in a narrative of comments that border on the line of racism, we should look at solutions to help these people, including people who want to return home.  We should do that rather than dividing people and almost saying we should not be looking after them.  If we were not looking after them, who is it suggested should look after them?</p></speech>

Yesterday, together with my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, and other members of the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary party, and with the support of Jason Poole, we launched our policy on tackling violence against women.  The document is written from the perspective of the victims and their families.  It is a comprehensive document that talks about the supports that should be put in place and the responses that are needed from the courts, the Garda and all the other statutory agencies.  It is a commitment from this Government and the Minister for Justice to bring forward a third strategy on violence against women and on gender-based violence.  We know from the research done by Women's Aid that one in four women in Ireland experiences some form of violence.  Typically, that violence is intimate and it is from someone they know closely.  More than 50% of those who experience that violence are under the age of 18.  It is an issue that largely affects women and young women.  I ask that the Leader urge the Minister to bring forward the new strategy.</p> <p>I would also like to commend those who were raising the issue of the early childhood years challenges outside yesterday.  The Minister and the Government have committed &euro;220 million of funding this year, which is welcome, and they have also made a commitment, most importantly, to get to &euro;1 billion in funding by 2028.  We need a childcare service that delivers for children, families, workers and employers.  I urge the Leader to ask the Minister to come back to this House and update us on his strategy for the provision of childcare.</p></speech>

I concur with Senator Murphy's comments on Shannonside and Midlands 103.  We are blessed with quality journalists in both of those radio stations in our area.</p> <p>I concur with the comments of Senator Fitzpatrick and I second her proposal that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth would come in here.  We have a serious disparity in the funding going into the early years sector, where those that are solely in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme are receiving low capitation compared with those that have full day care, making it extremely difficult for them to survive.  Another issue is that those who work in the sector also have to sign on the live register during the summer months outside of the 38 weeks.  Yet, we have a situation where we are struggling to get schools to provide the July provision.  I propose that we look at those workers who are qualified and who have level 5 and level 6 qualifications in childcare.  They should be employed in the summer months and the summer provision should be given to the children who most need it.  I would expand on that and we should look at bringing in third or fourth year students in our third level colleges who are doing speech and language therapy and occupational therapy to do their work experience through the summer months, given the services that are needed and lacking for the children.  I concur with Senator Fitzpatrick's comments and in asking for the Minister to come in to spell that out.</p> <p>I also wish to speak about free legal aid.  In recent days in my county we had a situation where an individual was arrested following a stabbing incident.  They were brought to court, bail was objected to by the local garda&iacute; but bail was granted, as was free legal aid.  They went back to the courts looking for the bail to be relaxed so they could go for a medical appointment in Turkey and proceeded to have a lovely sun holiday at the expense of the taxpayer.  That is giving two fingers to the people of my county and my county town, which is not acceptable.  I have a situation with another young 18-year-old lad whom I know.  He is being brought to the High Court in a case attached to an incident that happened with a school.  He has to go to the High Court to try to defend himself.  He is working part time and because of that he is not eligible for free legal aid.  He is &euro;1,700 over the limit and this situation is not acceptable.  This needs to be reviewed.  We are talking about this for years and it is not acceptable.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that he met senior officials in the HSE yesterday and that he has put together a crisis management unit that is to go to the hospital and work with senior people in the HSE and in the hospital.  There also needs to be some independent people brought into this because it needs an independent eye.  This is going on for far too long.  I sound like a broken record and I am sure the Leader is sick of listening to me harping on about it but it is at crisis point.  An extra 200 beds are needed and procedures are being cancelled and all these issues need to be addressed to make it a safe place, not only for the staff but for the patients in Limerick and in the mid-west.</p> <p>I also support the call for the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to come in.  I recently hosted a meeting on childcare and many of the issues that are being highlighted by the childcare providers.   I met some of the childcare providers from Limerick outside the gate yesterday.  I recently hosted a meeting on childcare and many of the same issues kept coming up with some of the childcare providers and parents who attended my meeting.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a disparity really it terms of provision of funding towards some units.

It is really crucial that we see Ireland as a country, State and democracy that is standing tall on its own two feet.</p> <p>The initial preliminary census data takes into account more than 2.1 million homes, which is an increase of 120,000.  It also gives details on the vacancy rate, which is close to 8%.  I think it is 7.8% in terms of vacant homes, which is approximately 160,000.  It states that is a drop of nearly 9% from 2016, however.</p> <p>I call for a debate on the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe or towns fund, which is separate to the cities fund.  The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe is about above-shop living in our rural towns and villages.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, came to Ballinasloe and visited businesses in the area.  There is such demand because there is real potential for so many shops and vacant areas in our towns to perhaps make those above-shop areas residential and support businesses to give them an incentive to do that.</p> <p>I wish everyone a happy Pride and hope that we all have a great weekend.  The festival is in Dublin this weekend.  The Galway Pride Festival is on in August so we might invite all of our Dublin brethren to come down to the west and celebrate with us.</p></speech>

In that regard, I ask that we have statements on childcare funding with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  It is important that this House has that debate and that we get an opportunity to express the concerns and hear from the Minister about issues regarding the childcare sector.</p> <p>We need to consolidate the services that are in place and ensure that we hold on to those childcare provisions that are essential for the holistic development of the child and also in support of families.  Also in that regard, however, we need to address ensuring that we have a capital fund to attract others into the area and into the childcare sector.  We need to ensure that providers are supported as the employment regulation order, ERO, comes into being to safeguard and protect workers in the industry and the very dedicated childcare professionals who have a right to their rate of pay, and that it is coming very soon.  We need to allay the fears of childcare providers but we also need to look at the capacity.</p> <p>At the moment, under large-scale housing developments and under the previous housing schemes, once there are 75 units, childcare services must be put into the construction.  However, many developers get to sideline that by saying there are a certain number of providers in an area.  They get to set aside the obligation that was in place to ensure that we have childcare places and construction in the provision.  It is really important that we get the Minister to act on that and put pressure on the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to ensure this is not allowed to be excused.</p> <p>We know that childcare places are in very short supply.  If the Minister does not address the concerns of the likes of the ECCE providers, they will continue to be in short supply and may be in even shorter supply in the future.  Ensuring we maximise the construction of cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities around the country is really important.  I ask that we have a debate and statements on that issue in the House.</p></speech>

It is very welcome that we will get significant investment this year, particularly to support subsidies for parents for the costs associated with childcare.  We all know and very much welcome finally an ERO for the sector to make sure there is a proper structured career and payment schedule from a salary perspective for the people who work very hard in that industry, particularly the providers, in order that we will see clarity on the capitation and core funding grants.   Senator Seery Kearney's contribution is actually the first time I have heard it mentioned that developers getting out of providing bricks and mortar accommodation for the provision of services was actually possible; it should not be possible.  I will organise that debate for colleagues.</p> <p>We have an incredibly busy schedule for the next number of weeks.  I will put everybody on notice that after next week, I will probably be telling Senators that we will need to work on a Monday and Friday to get through the amount of legislation we must pass between now and the end of July.  I will try to find some time in our schedule and that of the Minister for this really important debate.  Trying to have it at the end of September would be too late with regard to this year's budget provision.  I will, therefore, try my very best to organise that debate between now and the end of July.</p> <p>Senator Dolan spoke this morning about the census results.  It is lovely to see our country thriving notwithstanding all the difficulties and issues we discuss in here every single week.  It is absolutely lovely to see not only the number of people who want to come to Ireland to live, work and rear their families but, indeed, our own population also growing.  It is very welcome.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne could never be accused of coming in here and boring us.  It is an awful pity that she has to come in here week after week, month after month, to talk about the crisis that exists in University Hospital Limerick, as, indeed, our other colleagues have done.  It is really strange that we had to wait for a HIQA report this week and an announcement to say the hospital is absolutely unsafe in order for the State and the HSE to respond.  That is a real pity but we now have a crisis management team.  I really hope we will get a response and recommendations for change because that is absolutely needed in Limerick very soon.  I thank the Senator for her constant contributions and highlighting of that particular issue.</p> <p>Senator Carrigy asked for a review of free legal aid and pointed out some very glaring and obvious discrepancies and inequalities in the system currently.  We will look into that.</p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick spoke yesterday about the launch of Fianna F&aacute;il's policy on violence against women.  I heard Mr. Jason Poole on my radio first thing yesterday morning, at lunchtime and then on TV3 late last night.  He is one of the most impressive young men I have come across in a long time.  The passion he displays for a topic that is obviously so personal to him and his family is a real credit and will provide a real and lasting legacy for the tragic death of his sister.  I wish him well and wish Fianna F&aacute;il well in its input into the third strategy, which will be launched by the Minister in the next couple of months.</p> <p>Senator Ahearn spoke this morning about refugees, as did Senator Mullen.  The Ukrainian omnibus Bill will be before the House in the next number of weeks, which I believe will resolve the issue he touched on this morning.  Again, I am always mindful that there are always different opinions in debates.  It does not need to be divisive for people to express their views.  What we absolutely need is to have a plan, as we do, but we must also reassure people that looking after our own, which is a term I hate, and looking after and being humanitarian to other people who have needs are not mutually exclusive.  We can certainly do both and we need to reassure people that we can do both.  Irish people are some of the most generous people in the world.  That is not going to change.  It is really time for the State to be generous to refugees, particularly those who are fleeing an awful, horrendous situation in Ukraine.  I thank both Senators for raising that issue this morning.</p> <p>Senator McGahon talked about Monksland National School and the bottleneck of decisionmakers and information flow going back and forward to open those two special classrooms for September.  I fear to tell him it is not the only school that experiences that difficulty.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A school in Donabate is in exactly the same position, but we will keep on plugging.  However, there are some major deficiencies with regard to the responses from the Department of Education.</p><p>Senator Warfield, among others, wished us a very happy Pride.  I am looking forward to a very successful day and good vibes on Saturday, please God.  Hopefully, we will see all the Senators there.  The Senator is also seeking a debate on night life and the pending licensing laws improvements.  I will try to organise that as quickly as possible.</p><p>Senators Buttimer and Boyhan asked for a rolling debate or a significant lengthy debate on a number of modules with regard to the provision of healthcare in this country.  I cannot honestly say I will be able to find time for such a significant debate between now and the end of July.  If I can, I will.  If not, it is certainly something I will organise immediately on our return in September.</p><p>Senator Murphy highlighted the awards that were given yesterday for journalism on justice, the Justice Media Awards.  It was lovely to see some of the significant stories that were broken by colleagues in the media being rewarded.  The overall premise of what the Senator said is that journalism, both locally and nationally, really matters.

At the end of the day, they are only doing their jobs in the same way we are trying to do our job.  However, the transparency with regard to how they report and what they report on is vital to a functioning democracy, so I thank the Senator for raising that.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan highlighted not only the Patients Deserve Better campaign, which he applauded, but also the significant debate taking place in the housing committee for seven hours today to discuss the pending mica and defective blocks scheme.  I remind everybody of that.</p> <p>Senator Conway asked for a debate on long Covid.  He also asked for statements, and particularly a strategy, on suicide in the Traveller community.  I acknowledge, and pay our respects on, the passing of the three people who died in the last number of days.</p> <p>Senator Ardagh spoke about the Ombudsman for Children's report, as did Senator Sherlock, with regard to special educational needs.  For the first time in the history of the State we have a Minister of State who is responsible for the &euro;2 billion we spend on this.  While that is wonderful, it certainly has brought to the fore the challenges we face as a society with regard to the provision of special education.  I have to be honest, however, that there is no better woman than Deputy Madigan to make sure that the issues are highlighted and therefore resolved.  I wish her well in her job.</p> <p>I am sorry to hear from Senator Sherlock that another artists' studio has been closed.  One has to wonder what is going on.  It cannot just be a lack of funding because if it was that simple, it should be very easily be reversed.  I sent a note to the Minister asking for a response when the Senator raised it previously, but I have not yet received the response.  I will follow up on it again today.  I thank the Senator for raising it.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, raised the new ambulatory gynaecology clinic in Portlaoise, which is very welcome.</p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about the humanitarian responses on behalf of the State and said they require planning.</p> <p>Senator Kyne was one of the Senators who requested a debate on childcare.  He is also seeking a debate on greenways and blueways with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I will try to organise that.</p> <p>As I said, Senator Crowe opened the discussion today seeking increased subsidies for parents and an employment regulation order, ERO, and increased capitation payments for providers.  He requested a debate with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to discuss our views on that.</p></speech>

I will speak to this group of amendments.  This is a very important area of the Bill and a very important set of issues have been raised that I am anxious to address insofar as I can.  These amendments concern the retrospective application of the protections of the legislation to workers who have reported wrongdoing prior to the enactment of this Bill.  This is the main item outstanding from the recommendations I have accepted from the pre-legislative scrutiny report.</p><p>The first amendment inserts a new section, section 32, into the principal Act providing that the transitional provisions set out in Schedule 7 shall apply.  The second amendment inserts a new Schedule, Schedule 7, into the principal Act, which sets out how the retrospective provisions shall operate under a number of scenarios.  These amendments fulfil the commitments I gave in the D&aacute;il to provide protections retrospectively to the greatest extent possible.  There is a hard limit on how far retrospective provision in legislation can be applied.  Any retrospective application that goes further, particularly where proceedings in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or courts have been initiated or completed, runs into constitutional difficulties.  Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution states: &quot;The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.&quot;</p><p>The point at which this limit is reached varies depending on: who is reporting; whether they reported before or after enactment of this Bill; whether they suffered retaliation before or after enactment of this Bill; and when proceedings were initiated or completed under the Act.  The amendments make different provisions depending on whether the worker was already protected by the 2014 Act or is to be added to the scope of the legislation by this Bill.  I will refer to persons already protected by the Act as &ldquo;old workers&rdquo;.  These include employees, contractors, agency workers and trainees.  I will refer to persons who are to be added to the scope of the Act as &ldquo;new workers&rdquo;.  These include shareholders, board members, volunteers and job applicants.</p><p>Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Schedule 7 apply to old workers who reported before enactment but suffered retaliation after enactment.  Given that old workers are already protected by the 2014 Act, the additional benefits these provisions confer are reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings at the Workplace Relations Commission and the courts, and access to interim relief at the Circuit Court against penalisation.  Paragraphs 4 and 5 apply to new workers who reported before enactment but suffered retaliation after enactment.  Since new workers had no entitlement to protection prior to this amendment being made, this cohort will receive the greatest benefit from these provisions as follows: protection from penalisation at the WRC, including reversal of the burden of proof; the right to sue for damages in court, again including the reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings; and access to interim relief at the Circuit Court for dismissal and other forms of penalisation.</p><p>Paragraphs 6 and 7 apply to old workers who reported and also suffered retaliation before enactment, provided the worker has not initiated proceedings at the WRC or the courts at the time of enactment.  Given that old workers are already protected by the 2014 Act, the additional benefit this confers on them is they will be entitled to the reversal of the burden of proof during proceedings.  It is possible to provide the protections of paragraphs 6 and 7 to old workers because the 2014 Act already prohibited any act of penalisation against such workers.  There is, therefore, no conflict with Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution.  Unfortunately, it is not possible to extend these protections to new workers because penalisation of this cohort was not prohibited under the 2014 Act at the time the penalisation occurred.  Any retrospective provisions would therefore be in conflict with Article 15.5.1&deg; and, I am advised, would be unconstitutional.</p><p>Paragraph 8 provides that the protections against civil and criminal liability in sections 14 and 15 of the principal Act shall apply to new workers who have reported prior to enactment, provided that at the time of enactment no proceedings have been initiated against them.  Old workers are already protected by sections 14 and 15, so no retrospective provision is required for them here.  Paragraph 9 provides that the obligation to protect the identities of reporting persons and persons concerned under sections 16 and 16A, respectively, and the data access restrictions under section 16B, shall apply to all reports made by both old and new workers prior to enactment.</p><p><b></b>I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 1, 2, 42 and 63.  As I said, there is a hard limit, unfortunately, on how far retrospective provision in legislation can be applied in the context of Article 15.5.1&deg;.  The amendments I am bringing today fulfil the commitments I gave in the D&aacute;il to provide protections retrospectively to the greatest extent possible.  This is something to which the Attorney General has given detailed consideration over a period.  The amendments being proposed by Senators Higgins and Flynn provide for a complete application of all the protections of the Bill to any protected disclosures made in the past.  I am advised by the Attorney General that this would be in conflict with Article 15.5.1&deg; of the Constitution, as I said.  Unfortunately, therefore, I cannot accept these amendments.</p><p>I have examined this issue in great detail.  It was raised during the D&aacute;il debate at considerable length.  I asked the Attorney General to stretch the limit, insofar as possible, to retrospective application.  What we have arrived at represents very significant progress.  The key test is, if somebody has initiated a case before the WRC or the courts, the new protections in the Act cannot constitutionally apply to him or her.  In other cases, however, the protections can be applied retrospectively.  That is the very limit of what we can do within the parameters of the Constitution.</p></speech>

First, I welcome the Minister and his officials to the House.  I thank them for this legislation, which I broadly welcome.  I think it is very positive.  I have tabled amendments Nos. 3 and 6 mainly as a scoping exercise and to have some brief discussion on the matter because there seems to be a conflict in advice being issued.  I have engaged with the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, the representative bodies of city and county councillors.  From time to time, members have raised concerns in respect of how they are covered by protected disclosures.  There is some suggestion that councillors are not directly employed by the councils but elected members, as we well know.  At times, there are issues of concern.  They may fall within the scope of a protected disclosure.  We have heard the terrible stories of people - not necessarily city and county councillors - who have attempted to get to the bottom of an issue that they are not happy about or highlight where they think wrongdoing may have occurred.  We have heard how these people have become victims in that process.  It is a terrible shame for the people who try to do the right thing by the State and bring an issue to attention that requires further investigation.</p><p>The Minister is aware that the city and county councillors work at the coalface of our communities.  They are active.  They are the eyes and ears of many of our citizens, and many issues come to their attention and arrive on their desks.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether the two amendments are necessary.  Does the scope of the legislation protect or include councillors?  That is the assurance that I am seeking.  I do not know what legal advice the Minister has sought or what engagement he has had with the Attorney General on these issues.  I am asking for the Minister's reassurance that the members of the AILG and LAMA, our city and county councillors, are protected by and fall within the scope of this legislation.  If the Minister can confirm that, I will be happy to withdraw my amendment.  I have tabled it to prompt discussion on the issue, get the clarification I am seeking and have the Minister put something on the record of the House that will give the elected members of the city and county councils some comfort.</p></speech>

It is a very practical measure and I hope the Minister will see fit to include it in the legislation.</p></speech>

The Protected Disclosures Act 2014 protects workers from penalisation if they report concerns about wrongdoing or potential wrongdoing in the workplace.  The term "worker" is defined in section 3 of the Act as being an individual who is or was an employee, a contractor, an agency worker, a work experience student pursuant to a training course or a trainee.  The Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill before us provides, under section 4, for a significant expansion of the definition of worker to include individuals who are shareholders, members of the administrative management or supervisory body of an undertaking, volunteers, as well as individuals who acquire information on a relevant wrongdoing during a recruitment process or any other pre-contractual negotiation.  This expansion of the definition of worker means that local authority elected members will be protected under the legislation, once enacted.  Specifically, this is by virtue of paragraph (f).  It covers an individual who is or was a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of an undertaking and includes non-executive members.  The Bill provides a broad definition of "worker" in line with the provisions of the EU whistleblowing directive.  It is not appropriate to narrow this definition by listing specific entities.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments but I am happy to confirm, on the record of the House, that local authority members are in scope and will benefit from the protections of the legislation, once enacted.</p></speech>

As I said, a number of councillors who engaged in the protected disclosure process found it difficult.  I accept the Minister's assurances, which he has placed on the record, that city and county councillors will be fully covered when this legislation is enacted.  That is my understanding.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Transparency International Ireland has also recommended that this measure be included in the legislation.  Through this amendment, the bringing of vexatious proceedings against a worker to keep his or her quiet in the context of a protected disclosure process would be recognised in law as penalisation.</p><p>Amendment No. 5 seeks to clarify that psychiatric or medical referrals without reasonable cause should be recognised as a penalisation where the requirements for having reasonable cause are not met.  Basically, we are trying to protect whistleblowers.</p></speech>

On the proposal to include bringing vexatious proceedings against a worker in the definition of penalisation, it is already a penalty under section 24 of the Bill.  It does not need to be specifically included in the definition of penalisation.</p> <p>My officials gave detailed consideration to the pre-legislative recommendation on medical and psychiatric referrals.  They consulted the Attorney General who highlighted that the proposed amendment is not the language of the EU whistleblowing directive.  The Attorney General advises that there is a risk that such an amendment could be interpreted as narrowing the scope of application of this form of penalisation.  I know that is not the intention behind the amendment but the view of the Attorney General is that it could actually narrow the scope of it.  That would be incompatible with the directive.  I should point out that the issue is not whether the referral is founded or unfounded; it is whether the referral is a form of penalisation for having made a report.  The burden of proof to show that the referral was based on justified grounds will now fall on the employer, as required by the directive.  The employer must show that the referral was not prompted by the making of the report but was made for another reason.  That is a very significant shift that is provided for in the Bill.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments.  We have adequately addressed the issues in the Bill.</p></speech>

This is a technical amendment to remove a reference to subsection 7A of section 5 of the Principal Act.</p><p>Section 5(7A) was inserted into the Principal Act by the European Union (Protection of Trade Secrets) Regulations 2018, which provided for the transposition of the trade secrets directive.  This directive required that a person who made a protected disclosure could only disclose information deemed to be trade secret if he or she acted for the purpose of protecting the public interest.  Article 21.7 of the whistleblowing directive clarifies the legal position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the trade secrets directive, on the one hand, and the protection of whistleblowers, on the other hand, and makes clear that a person who makes a disclosure of a trade secret, in accordance with the rules of the whistleblowing directive, should not be subject to this public interest test.  Accordingly, this provision can and should be repealed.</p></speech>

This is a time-specific amendment and we reserve the right to bring further amendments on Report Stage on the question of timely restitution or timely response.  Many whistleblowers have expressed concern that there are times specified for the commencement of an investigation, but not for the period of time within which resolution or a response is to be given or in which redress should be provided.</p> <p>People who have made a whistleblowing complaint often wait a very long time, as the Minister has heard.  I am glad he gave some acknowledgement in his earlier amendment.  Some people who made a complaint many years ago are still awaiting the information on what happened and the result of that action.  For those who have experienced penalisation or retribution, the consequences have continued year after year and the process of getting restitution payments has been very long.  This is a very specific amendment relating to companies.  I reserve the right to table further amendments on some of the timings in the Bill on Report Stage.</p></speech>

We had some discussion earlier on the retrospective application of the Bill and I am sure we will revert to that on Report Stage.</p> <p>This amendment provides that employers with 50 or more employees shall establish, maintain and operate reporting channels and procedures within six months of the commencement of this section.  The core provisions of the Bill, including the requirement for employers to establish and maintain internal reporting channels of the Bill, are intended to be commenced as soon as possible following enactment.</p> <p>This amendment is in direct conflict with the derogation delaying commencement of this section for employers with 50 or more employees but fewer than 250 employees until 17 December 2023.  Ireland has chosen to adopt the derogation from the EU whistleblowing directive and the date of 17 December 2023 is set in Article 26.2 of that directive.  Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment.</p></speech>

It is a pity for us to seek derogation in any area.  I know there has already been discussion about concerns with other articles of the directive and there will be further discussion later.  We will press the amendment.  The Minister has given his reasons but for those waiting for very long time and for the kind of culture shift that we want to see happen, time is really important.  We hope that even on the back of this legislation happening, a strong signal for early action is sent to companies.  It is always better to keep momentum going.  A longer timeframe may unfortunately lead to the issue falling off the table and many companies failing to deliver on these obligations.  While the heat is on, let us keep it on.</p></speech>

We are anxious to put the Bill into operation as quickly as possible.  Detailed guidance will be issued and there will be an information campaign.  I know we will discuss more of those issues later in the debate.  As a result of the derogation on that aspect, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The 50-employee threshold for the creation of internal reporting channels would not apply.  A company would not have an exemption from the reporting channels just because it had 30 or 40 employees if it is performing a public contract with a value of more than &euro;1 million.  The Minister will be aware that I have taken a keen interest in public procurement and have had constructive engagement with some of his colleagues on how we might strengthen, improve and reform equality in public procurement.  The crucial principle is that the public duty in respect of equality and human rights, for example, transfers on to procurement.</p><p>Extraordinary financial issues have been highlighted by whistleblowers in the past.  With my Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach hat on, I understand there may be an implication for the State with a contract worth &euro;1 million or more.  That the company performing that contract has 20, 30 or 40 employees should not be a reason not to require a reporting channel in respect of whistleblowing.  In terms of due diligence but also in terms of how much public money is spent, it is really important that the companies getting large contracts have internal reporting channels in respect of whistleblowing so that we can be confident they have mechanisms to identify issues early.</p><p>I urge the Minister to consider that practical amendment.  None of us wants to be constantly fixing issues after the fact and reviewing what went wrong.  This means there would be a flagging system for concerns built in for those who are getting contracts above a threshold.  I have specified contracts of &euro;1 million; it probably should apply to any company with a State contract.  I have sought to place it at a reasonably high threshold and close to the thresholds under the EU procurement directives.</p><p>Amendment No. 17 would ensure that the 50-employee threshold for creating internal reporting channels would not apply to a company with an annual turnover of more than &euro;1 million.  In the first case I have specified companies with a public contract worth more than &euro;1 million.  I know that &euro;1 million might not seem like much in the scale of some companies but it is a lot compared with most small businesses.  It is important that they would be required to have accountability.  A company with that scale of business should have the capacity to put in place appropriate reporting channels.  We know of companies in Ireland with very few employees but which have been associated with bad practices.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the international level, the Minister will be aware of the debates that are happening at the moment around due diligence legislation in the EU.  There is a concern that only 1% of companies in the EU came under the due diligence legislation because of some of the thresholds involved.  Companies which have been highlighted in respect of supply chain abuses include the Correj&oacute;n coal mine in Colombia.  It technically has a very small number of employees even though it is linked to substantial human rights abuses.  It is important to highlight big issues that emerge.  There is a capacity issue when we consider the effect on every corner store.  However, a company with major money, and dealing in major money, should be able to include the due diligence of an internal reporting structure.</p><p>I note that during the debate around the Gender Pay Gap Information Act there was some discussion of the fact that size-based thresholds should not be the only measure to determine where scrutiny is needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#DD00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  If I set out our thinking, we can then have a discussion and exchange on these matters.</p> <p>These three amendments propose to remove the 50-employee threshold for employers performing a public contract with a value of more than &euro;1 million and employers that are companies with an annual turnover of over &euro;1 million.  This would mean that any employers in these categories would be obliged to establish formal internal reporting channels and procedures.  I am not proposing to accept these amendments.</p> <p>There was insufficient time since the amendments were received to fully explore how many employers would be captured by these amendments.  However, given that the value of public contracts can be calculated in many instances over a four-year period, I expect that they would lead to a significant expansion of the requirement for formal reporting channels and procedures.  Before I go into the precise reasons I will not accept the amendments, I want to make it clear that the obligation on some employers to have internal channels and procedures is an administrative requirement separate from the rights of workers to report wrongdoing to their employer.</p> <p>Section 6(1) of the Protected Disclosures Act provides that a worker is protected if he or she reports a relevant wrongdoing to an employer.  This applies irrespective of the size of the organisation for which the worker works and the Bill does not change this.  Regardless of whether the employer has a formal reporting channel, all workers, public and private, remain entitled to all of the protections of the legislation.</p> <p>Workers will also have access to supports such as the Transparency International Ireland speak-up helpline to help them to understand how to make a report.  Implementing the requirements as regards internal reporting channels will create a compliance burden for industry.  The European Commission&rsquo;s impact assessment of the directive in 2018 estimated that the initial set-up costs for a typical small to medium enterprise would be &euro;1,374 in the first year with an ongoing annual cost of &euro;1,054 in subsequent years.  That was based on estimates made in 2017.  With inflation, the true cost is now considerably higher.</p> <p>Implementing the requirements is not a simple matter of printing down a generic policy document.  The directive and the Bill are clear that internal channels must be designed, established and operated in a secure manner that protects the confidentiality of the reporting person and the information they have reported.  In practical terms, this will require firms, for example, to appoint and train dedicated staff to operate these channels.  It will also require the deployment of dedicated, separate and secure channels such as mailboxes, encrypted emails or web forms, and dedicated phone lines and voice messaging systems.  Firms will be required to ensure the designated persons have sufficient resourcing and independence to conduct investigations, maintain confidentiality and access to senior management to effect necessary action in response to reports of wrongdoing.  All of these will impose costs on organisations.</p> <p>A wider imposition of the requirement to have internal channels would be disproportionate, particularly given the impact of the pandemic and Brexit on the SME sector in Ireland as well as the pressures they are facing from high inflation.</p> <p>The point is that there are real costs involved in placing this obligation on small businesses.  It is important to underline the point that it does not mean a protected disclosure cannot be made.  There remains an absolute right to make a protected disclosure even if an employee is working for a small employer and the obligations to follow through and so on remain in place.</p> <p>Because of the issues the Senator has raised, and she has made some very fair points, the Bill provides at section 8 by way of the insertion of a new section 6(6) into the 2014 Act for a regulation-making power to lower or remove the threshold for certain firms or categories of firms, subject to a risk assessment and public consultation.  The Senator has made the point that there may well be situations where an employer has a very small number of employees but is strategically important and potentially very high impact.  There is the capacity and facility within the Bill as proposed for them to be brought within the reach of the legislation in respect of the need to have internal reporting channels.</p></speech>

The fact that one can make a report is not the same as being able to make it through that kind of administrative channel.  The Minister referred to the guarantee of confidentiality, encrypted channels and designated email addresses.  All of those things are technical.  They have a reasonable cost for what they do.  It is not enough for people to know they can make a disclosure when all that is available is the capacity for them to email their boss or their boss's boss and hope nobody else sees it.  It is different when a proper channel is available.  The Minister described quite well the kind of small but specific things that go into a proper administrative channel, which is why I think we should be pushing for more companies to have it and why the simple right to make a disclosure is not the same as having a good mechanism to do so.</p> <p>I still believe we should stretch where this applies.  I acknowledge that the Minister has pointed to the fact that there are regulation-making powers under section 6.  There are small areas with implications for human rights and due diligence.  The Minister will be aware of the review of ethics in public life and some of the work that has been done in the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.  We have been looking at areas of particular vulnerability, including lobbying and other areas.  This is something that is considered.  Transparency International Ireland has highlighted that certain sectors have particular sensitivity and vulnerability.  However, I also believe that one of the things that should be looked at through those regulations is an obligation, or at least minimum weighted criteria, around the presence of such structures relating to public procurement and public contracts.  Perhaps that is a space that could be explored.</p> <p>I am going to withdraw the amendments but I might engage a little more with the Minister's office between now and Report Stage around how he envisages those regulation-making powers might be used to address the concerns I have highlighted.  I will, with the leave of the House, withdraw my amendments but reserve the right to come back to these issues on Report Stage having engaged with the Department.</p></speech>

I do not think there is a fundamental difference of opinion between us on this point.  I am concerned about imposing additional costs on very small businesses.  The Senator mentioned the example of a local corner shop or the local plumber.  There are costs involved in requiring these processes to be established.</p> <p>The Senator also mentioned particular sectors that have significant impacts.  It is also provided for within the Bill that the threshold does not apply in certain named areas.  Those exceptions include, for example, financial services, aviation safety and oil and gas safety.  Of course, there has never been a threshold in the public sector either.  It would certainly be our intention-----</p></speech>

It seeks to change the date by which companies with 250 employees must establish, maintain and operate internal reporting channels and procedures.  It proposes a shift in the timeline from 17 December 2023 to 30 June 2023.  It just shifts the time because we have waited a very long time for this.  Something that is 18 months away feels too long and 12 months is more than adequate.  These are companies with 250 or more employees, so they are quite large.  They can do this in a year.  We have seen what companies can do in just a few months under circumstances such as Covid.  It should be possible to establish the kinds of practical steps the Minister has outlined within a 12-month period.  It is more than sufficient.</p></speech>

For countries that avail of the derogation, the date of 17 December 2023 is enshrined in that.  It is the case we have at this point signalled to employers that fall within this category of between 50 and 250 employees that this is the intended date for this provision to come into effect.  Given we have availed of that derogation, we do not have discretion to vary the date in the directive of 17 December 2023.  It is a reasonable lead-in period.  Some lead-in period is needed.  It can be argued employers could do it in less time but some of these are still quite small businesses and they are facing a challenging time.  It is a significant change but a necessary one.  We very much support putting in these formal channels and imposing these obligations on employers.  Giving them that lead-in period is appropriate.</p></speech>

I have to move it because the other amendments in the grouping are attached to it.  Otherwise I probably would not move it.</p><p>Amendment No. 22 seeks to add a condition around the provision that employers with fewer than 250 employees may share resources in terms of the receipt of reports under this session.  While I fully understand the desire to share resources, we do not want to get a kind of outsourcing of the reports whereby lots of companies move to a &quot;problem go away&quot; type of reporting structure.  Everybody has been sent through one complaints structure to another to eventually land in a kind of box somewhere.  We do not want dealing with reports and protected disclosures to become a problem-solving service that is provided for companies.  Alternatively, we do not want to have smaller companies being permitted to say they are not able to do anything about it because they have people who do that and you need to talk to them.  It then becomes a further piece of the labyrinth, which is exactly what we want and need to undo.  We must also bear in mind that where protected disclosures have been made, it is not solely about individuals accessing their rights.  These are matters of concern that are being highlighted in many cases with really significant impacts for society.  It is important, therefore, that they are dealt with in a timely, transparent and trackable way.</p><p>My two amendments seek to add some conditions as I am a little concerned about what the sharing resources might look like.  In the first amendment, I suggest they could be shared resources where it is a linked company or set of companies.  Again, the accountability is there in that if it is with a linked company or there is a way of tracking the same parent company, for example, it will still be ultimately responsible if one of the companies under it may be sharing it.  As such, the chain of accountability will not be lost into a chain of service provision.  There could be an incentive for companies to provide instruction, which would allow other companies to avoid their obligations under the Bill.</p><p>Amendment No. 22 provides that where an employer shares resources and potentially materials around the receipt or investigation of a report with another company, as is provided for here, before such materials or resources are shared, there should be a data protection impact assessment in relation to the sharing of such resources.  If a company receives a disclosure and then has another company deal with that report or disclosure, there are potentially important data protection impact concerns.  This is especially so if we have a company receiving multiple reports from multiple other companies because then the question of firewalls and suitable practices arises.  The amendment simply provides that there would be a data protection impact assessment where resources are shared in respect of the receipt and investigation of reports.</p><p>To make a general comment on GDPR, we know that with anything that has implications, a data protection impact assessment is appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#EE00700"><p>I will set out the formal response and we can perhaps engage on it then.  The amendments will limit the ability of employers to share resources for receiving reports and conducting any investigations needed as part of follow-up.  The Bill currently provides that employers with fewer than 250 employees can share resources.  These amendments would limit that flexibility to employers with fewer than 50 employees and where companies are linked.  Furthermore, the amendments add an obligation to carry out a data protection impact assessment in relation to the sharing of such resources.  The resource-sharing provisions in the Bill are in place to transpose Article 8.6 of the EU whistleblowing directive.  The Senator is seeking to further define and limit how that would take place.  The provisions reduce the administrative burden on employers.  They allow for companies to share resources and build a centre of best practice for receiving and following up on reports received.  On the Senator's requirement that this be limited to companies that are in some way linked, that would exclude the possibility of an employer using a third-party company that might specialise in providing this service.  If there is not a link between the companies, they would not be allowed to use that service and that would limit their ability to put in place proper processes and procedures.  The provisions reduce the administrative burden on employers, allow for companies to share resources, as I said, and to build a centre of best practice for receiving and following up on reports received.</p> <p>The data protection impact assessment adds another criterion that is not necessary in our view as section 16 on the duty of confidentiality and section 18 on data protection apply to all channels and actions set out in the Bill.  Therefore, we do not see a need to restate that obligation as it is one that is already provided for elsewhere in the Bill.  Irrespective of the channel used, that obligation applies, including in a case where resources are shared.  Article 8.6 states the resource-sharing option "... shall be without prejudice to the obligations imposed upon such entities by this Directive to maintain confidentiality, to give feedback, and to address the reported breach".</p> <p>For those reasons. I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

The danger is that where this involves those who are experienced in receiving reports but whose clients are effectively other companies, there is a little bit of a power imbalance.  If a company is engaging somebody because they have a particular expertise in dealing with the reports, the concern is that it would incentivise certain kinds of results coming out of those reports, if the Minister knows what I mean.  It would be wrong for this to become any form of troubleshooting or perceived service provision.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The centre stage piece in any disclosure and report needs to be what is being disclosed - the subject matter and content of it - rather than a matter of how a company will manage it.  The mechanisms we have discussed internally are important in that regard.  I worry that we will end up with people who get very good at that process, for example, of assessing whether it is a substantive report and disclosure or whether it needs to be followed up.  There will be people who get very good at filtering those out.  That would be regressive.  I know that is not in any way the intention of the Minister.</p><p>I am sorry to go to a bad case scenario but, unfortunately, we have to do so.  In general, this is part of the long legacy of whistleblowing in Ireland, from which I hope we are moving forward.  The Minister is aware, however, that if all the significant energy the State and various entities and private companies have put into making disclosures and concerns and issues that have been highlighted disappear had, instead, been redirected to addressing the problem, many areas of public life and private company life would be much better.  That is why I need to highlight that concern.</p><p>I am not attached to these two particular ways in which I have tried to tackle it.  I have tried to make sure we do not create that dynamic.  I am not tied to these two ways of approaching it and I may come back on Report Stage with further thoughts on how we can avoid situations such as the one I described which, it is to be hoped, will not arise.   All present can imagine how such a situation could arise, however.</p></speech>

I make the point that it is a provision of the directive that resource-sharing is provided for.  That is an obligation within the directive, and for good reason.  Although it is important to have these processes in place, we do not wish to impose an unnecessary administrative burden on employers and I do not think we should exclude the possibility that they might use the support and services of a third-party company.</p> <p>The Senator raised several issues in respect of the group context.  It is the case that where the group structure is used as such, feedback to the person who submits the protected disclosure, that is, the whistleblower, must be given at subsidiary level.  It is important that direct relationship is maintained in the work-out and follow through of each protected disclosure that is made.  We can revert to it again.  We will reflect on what the Senator has said.  We do have the limitation that the directive provides for resource sharing, so we have to provide for it in some way.</p></speech>

It relates to an issue we have discussed previously and will discuss later, that is, consideration of Article 25.2 in the context of the commitment that there should be no regressive steps in terms of protections for whistleblowers.  Many persons - not solely whistleblowers but also experts in transparency, accountability and governance &ndash; have strong concerns that the changes under the Bill to section 8 of the principal Act will constitute a regressive step.  There are concerns in respect of the fact that it will become more difficult for persons, both whistleblowers and civil society, to make a disclosure directly to a Minister.  That has significant implications for those seeking to make a disclosure and in terms of public accountability.</p><p>Amendment No. 28 is probably the largest change option.  The Minister will see that I have tabled a couple of substantial suggested amendments and I have also suggested a few changes.  I fundamentally believe we should be going for a bigger change on this but I have tried to come up with a few smaller proposals that would ameliorate slightly some of the concerns.  Amendment No. 28 would return to the original section 8.  Under the new section 8, it is proposed that public servants will be required to report to their employer in most circumstances, removing the automatic right of public servants to make a public disclosure directly to the Minister.  This could involve issues of significant local or national concern that should be allowed to be disclosed directly to a Minister.</p><p>We know that many of the whistleblowers who are motivated to make a disclosure do so out of public concern and for the public interest, at great personal cost.  There should not be a wrong door in terms of those making this disclosure.  This is not people applying for something or seeking to gain something; it is people who are bringing and offering something in public service for the public good.  They should not face a situation in which they find themselves excluded from the provisions or protections of the legislation or discouraged from proceeding in highlighting an issue that may be of great public significance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Transparency International Ireland has cited a number of concerns about the new section 8.  The amendment would delete the new section 8, and return to the previous section 8, while adding two small elements from the new section 8 that I believe are progressive, one being the deletion of "and" in paragraph (a) and the insertion of the provisions after paragraph (b) to include categories where: "the making of the disclosure is in the public interest" or "the worker reasonably believes that their own manager or the head of the public body concerned is complicit in the relevant wrongdoing".  The reference in the Bill is to "the head of the public body", and I will address the issue of the manager later.  The point is that it keeps it as is, where a person has the right to make a complaint to the Minister, but specifically names the issue of public interest within the previous version of section 8.</p><p>Amendment No. 31 is a technical amendment that relates to the other amendments.  Amendment No. 33 seeks to improve the provisions in the current Bill.  At the moment, there is a provision whereby a worker may go directly to the Minister if he or she believes that the head of the public body he or she works for is complicit in the wrongdoing concerned.  For many public servants, especially in very large public bodies with multiple branches and iterations, the head is often a very far distance from people, but what does act as a chilling effect is how people feel about making a disclosure to their own manager.  This amendment would allow the same exception, whereby a worker who believes the head of the public body is complicit in any wrongdoing concerned.  We must bear in mind the significant penalties that we have for people who make disclosures based on false information.  People must be very careful, and they will be very nervous.  They may not ever have met the head of the public body concerned.  Many people will be in a situation where they believe their own manager or their manager's manager are complicit in wrongdoing and that in itself should be sufficient for a person not to have to take up an internal channel within a public body but to be able to go directly to a Minister.  If a person does not have confidence in the manager closest to him or her to be someone who can be honestly and properly trusted in regard to an issue of wrongdoing, it is a lot to ask of him or her that he or she would assume that the managers above the person, who presumably promoted the person, are going to necessarily give them fair treatment.  Again, that is often in light of a situation where they may never have met the head of the public body or the senior staff.  In that context, the provision that refers to the head of the public body is too limited a power.  It should be simply sufficient that if a person is concerned that his or her manager is complicit in a wrongdoing of public concern or if a person wants to highlight an issue as an act of public service, he or she should be able to contact the Minister about it.</p><p>For clarity, the new section 8 is section 12.  Amendment No. 34 relates to the circumstances in which a worker can bring a report directly to the Minister.  It should simply be sufficient that a worker did not feel confident to make a report under sections 6, 7 or 8 due to a reasonable fear of penalisation.  Again, we must bear in mind that whistleblowers are not people that we are giving things to or who are asking for things.  They are people who, through their own goodness, are bringing important information to light and highlighting an issue of public concern.  There should be every mechanism to make it possible for them, rather than any sense of an obstacle.  That should be the case, especially since we know, although I will not go into, the litany of penalisations that people have experienced.  The very fact that we have provisions in this Bill on penalisation, even though they are inadequate, points to the fact that penalisation is a known factor.  There is a reasonable fear of penalisation.  It may simply be that a person saw other people getting fired and he or she did not know why.  Whatever it might be, if a person has a reasonable fear of penalisation, that should be sufficient grounds for him or her to go directly to a Minister.  These are workers, but they are not seeking restitution through HR on employee issues.  They are acting as citizens and, as citizens, they should be able to go to the Minister who represents them and say they are highlighting this issue from their experience as workers.  They should not have to navigate an internal channel if there is a reasonable fear of penalisation.</p><p>Amendment No. 35 is prompted by my belief that the language sets an excessively high bar.  We could talk about a chilling effect in respect of the bar that is placed here.  The public interest, straightforwardly in itself, should be enough of a ground for a person to go to a Minister, but currently the bar in that regard is so high and specifies that is only possible where the relevant wrongdoing may constitute "an imminent or manifest danger" to the public interest, such as where there is an emergency situation or a risk of irreversible damage.  I do not know why we are raising the bar so incredibly high here, because that has a chilling effect.  I urge the Minister to accept my two amendments in this regard.  One would simply remove the phrase "imminent or manifest".  It should be sufficient that there is a danger to the public interest.  Ministers are not simply there to firefight the emergency.  The point is that there is a danger to the public interest and a worker has identified it.  What constitutes "imminent"?  Is it a month, six months, a year or ten years?  If there is a danger to the public interest, that should be enough.  Ministers deal with the public interest all the time and most of the issues they deal with are not imminent and manifest; they are part of trying to do things better and to fix the country.  On that basis, if there is something that could help, it should be sufficient if an issue is relevant to the public interest.  It would be preferable to keep the phrase "danger to the public interest" because putting those extra adjectives in is excessive, similar to an emergency situation or irreversible damage.  Are we just saying then that is okay if there is a problem and it is going to have a terrible consequence because we might be able to fix it later and that the Minister should not be told or that it should go through some other channel?  Frankly, we have all spent too much time fixing problems.  I do not know anybody of any party who likes fixing problems after the fact.  "Irreversible damage" seems to me to be an extraordinarily high bar when in fact prevention is always better than cure.</p><p>I have two more amendments to address in this large grouping.  Amendment No. 39 is intended to make sure that when the Minister or the head of a public body receives a protected disclosure, which is outside the remit of the Department or public body, he or she might consult with the protected disclosures commissioner and with the permission or consent of the reporting person, transfer the report to the relevant Minister or the head of the public body.  This is intended to make sure that reports reach the right people and that whistleblowers are not lost in the system when their concerns are being addressed.  Someone may go to a Minister because he or she is the Minister in his or her geographical location.  They might go to a Minister because he or she is in Cork, Galway or Limerick and the Minister may want to transfer the matter to the line Minister or the public body.  What is important is that the Minister would check with the person who has made the disclosure because there may also be reasons somebody has not gone to the line Minister.  In terms of the public body in particular, I know multiple examples, but I will not cite them individually.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There have been situations in which persons have made a protected disclosure and the complaints they made have been directed right back to the desk of the person about whom they made the disclosure.  In effect, decision-making power on what to do about a disclosure is being given to the person who is its subject.  Sadly, there are a few instances in which we can point to that having happened.  It is important that if people take a different channel, that is, going to a Minister, they do not find themselves in that situation.  That is why communication with the person making the disclosure prior to the forwarding of that disclosure is appropriate.</p><p>I hope the Minister will engage with us on these proposals.  The general concern is a wider one, which relates to Article 25(2) of the GDPR.  These amendments provide specific measures to improve the section.</p></speech>

Senator Higgins has outlined a similar rationale for her amendments to that applying to our amendments Nos. 37 and 38.  I will speak to them briefly in order that we can get to the Minister's response.</p> <p>Amendment No. 37 seeks to guarantee that where a public sector employee makes a disclosure to the relevant Minister but that disclosure is not in compliance with the requirements for making a disclosure, he or she will receive the same protections as those afforded to someone who makes a compliant protected disclosure.  In essence, our amendment proposes to add another provision to ensure greater security for those who are making protected disclosures to a Minister.</p> <p>Amendment No. 38 seeks to provide greater guidance, oversight and transparency in respect of the new procedure the Bill introduces for making protected disclosures to the Minister.  We were not in favour of scrapping this new process whereby the Minister will simply hand on a protected disclosure to the new protected disclosures office, but our initial amendments in this regard were not accepted.  We are trying to improve the new process by ensuring there is more clarity with regard to the guidelines on how it is to work.  We want to ensure those who handle the protected disclosure on behalf of the Minister have sufficient training and that those who qualify for making a protected disclosure have proper access to the relevant information.  Our amendment is about adding additional provisions to the Bill.</p></speech>

The issue was raised a number of times over the course of the debate in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I will set out our thinking, rationale and the background to what is proposed in the relevant provisions.</p> <p>These amendments provide for the deletion of section 8(2)(b) of the principal Act, as amended.  Section 8(2)(b) provides that a worker employed by a public body can only report to a Minister if he or she reasonably believes the information disclosed in his or her report, and any allegations contained in it, are true.  I have looked again at this provision on foot of amendments proposed by Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il and representations made to me by Transparency International Ireland.  The intent behind the amendments the Bill proposes to section 8 of the principal Act is to provide that a public sector worker should report in the first instance either to his or her employer or to a prescribed person before he or she reports to a relevant Minister.  If, having made such a report to his or her employer or a prescribed person, the worker reasonably believes no action or insufficient action has been taken, there should be no further impediment to his or her reporting to a Minister.  However, section 8(2)(b), as provided for in the Bill, requires that the worker must reasonably believe the information reported is entirely true.  This imposes an additional test for reporting to a Minister on top of the criteria the worker is required to fulfil to report to his or her employer or to a prescribed person.  This is not in line with the policy intent and, for this reason, I am proposing the provision be deleted.</p> <p>I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 28, 31, and 33 to 39, inclusive.  Amendments Nos. 28 and 37 would remove or nullify the criteria to report in the first instance to either the employer or a prescribed person before reporting to a Minister.  As Senator Higgins acknowledged, the Bill provides a number of qualifiers to the criteria to report in the first instance to either the employer or a prescribed person before reporting to a Minister.  These qualifiers include where the worker reasonably believes the head of the public body is complicit in the wrongdoing or where there is a manifest danger to the public interest.  I acknowledge the comments Senator Higgins made in regard to the specific wording.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 31 to 36 widen the qualifiers to such an extent as to dilute significantly the requirement to report in the first instance to either the employer or the prescribed person before reporting to the Minister.  This is not in line with the policy intent.  The operation of the ministerial channel has been one of the most challenging areas of implementation of the principal Act.  The intent behind the provision of a ministerial channel under the Act was that in the event that a public body failed to deal properly with an internal report, a worker in that public body would have the fallback option of reporting to the Minister.  In practice, there has been a tendency for reporting persons either to go to the Minister first or report simultaneously to both their employer and the Minister.</p> <p>The practice of simultaneous or near-simultaneous reporting through different channels was raised as a concern by the disclosures tribunal, which recommended that the Oireachtas consider amending the legislation such that when a report is made, the initial recipient is afforded a reasonable amount of time to take action before the reporting person moves on to an alternative channel.  Furthermore, Article 7 of the whistleblowing directive requires member states to encourage reporting internally in the first instance.  The introduction of a requirement that the reporting person should report using one of the other channels first is intended to address this issue, which will transmit disclosures to appropriate bodies for assessment and follow-up.  For these reasons, I do not accept the amendments.</p> <p>I am not clear on the purpose of amendment No. 38.  It proposes to make provision for reports made to Ministers other than through section 8 of the principal Act, which deals with the ministerial channel.  There is no other legislative provision through which Ministers can receive reports other than through section 8.  Ministers cannot receive reports through section 6, which provides for the internal reporting channel, or section 7, which provides for the external reporting channel to prescribed persons.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.</p> <p>Amendment No 39 provides for Ministers and heads of Departments to seek the view of the protected disclosures commissioner when they receive a report that is outside their remit.  The Bill provides for reports made to Ministers to be transmitted to the commissioner, who will then transmit them to a prescribed or suitable person for follow-up, as required.  That suitable person may well, in the view of the protected disclosures commissioner, be the Minister, in which case it will come back to the latter to deal with it.  Heads of Departments can already transmit to a designated person in another body, where that is required for follow-up, within strict confidentiality requirements.  An additional requirement on heads of Departments to consult with the protected disclosures commissioner in every instance where a report is not within their remit would result in an unnecessary increase in the administrative burden.  There is nothing in the legislation to prevent heads of Departments from consulting with the protected disclosures commissioner as required.  I cannot accept this amendment.</p> <p>The thrust and purpose of what we are seeking to do in these provisions is to improve the existing process.  It is fair to say that process is not working for all parties, including whistleblowers.  We need a clear process in terms of where protected disclosures should be going and where and by whom they should be dealt with.  In some instances, they will continue to come to the Minister, who will then transmit them to the protected disclosures commissioner and the latter will independently make an assessment as to who is the most appropriate person to deal with that disclosure.  It could be somebody in the employer body, a prescribed body or the Minister.  Ultimately, the protected disclosures commissioner will make that judgment call.  We are seeking to put a structure and process in place in this regard.  In my view, the current system is not working as well as it should in respect of this channel.</p></speech>

It is by having positive measures within public bodies that we will encourage employees to act.  When cases begin to pile up, people who make a disclosure may find that nobody is penalised and no action is taken to address the substantive issue they highlighted.  Once we have seven, eight, ten or 20 examples of that happening, people will be encouraged to go directly to their public bodies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At the moment, however, there is not that encouragement, which is positive encouragement.  Instead, what we have seen in this Bill and in the section, sadly, are measures to make the ministerial channel less inviting and less open.  The fact that people are not going directly to their own employers in public bodies first is because they have not received good treatment there and because they have seen others very publicly receive very poor treatment when they have done that.  Therefore, encouraging people to go to those is around positive measures that need to be taken whereas I believe discouraging another channel is a regressive step, sadly.  We have moved forward in many other aspects of the Bill but I think this is a regressive step.  Some of the language I highlighted is really discouraging and dissuasive and creates a chill effect and, indeed, perhaps a fear of consequence for persons who are doing something for others and not for themselves.  I feel really strongly about this section and I will come back to it on Report Stage.</p><p>I may come also back with a different version of amendment No. 39 on Report Stage.  The key issue for me is whether there are safeguards to ensure there should never be a situation, although we know there have been multiple situations, whereby any person or persons who are directly or indirectly effectively the subject matter of a protected disclosure would be able to influence or be in a decision-making position around how that protected disclosure is dealt with.  Similarly, I am aware of instances whereby the decision as to whether somebody should receive payments or restitution in terms of the penalisation they received ended up being routed through the person about whom they made the original disclosure.  Again, I will bring forward another version of that.  It is really important that this element at least should perhaps go in so there are safeguards in that regard.  I am not sure how we address them but we really need to do so because that scenario happens.  I do not see that the Bill guards people.  We can have all the good practices we want but that question of who is making the decisions and ensuring there is a real firewall is something we can perhaps improve or strengthen.</p><p>As I said, I fundamentally believe that if anybody has a matter that is in the public interest and, certainly, a matter that could damage the public interest, that is enough of a bar and they should be able to go to a Minister as a public servant and as a citizen.  That is why I fundamentally think the constraints in this section are too much.  I will press amendment No. 28.</p></speech>

I reiterate the point that we are trying to get away from a scenario whereby the first port of call is to send a protected disclosure to the Minister.  One of the issues under the existing Act is that it is silent on precisely what the Minister should do with the protected disclosure when it is received.  At least under the Bill, we have the provision whereby the office of the protected disclosures commissioner is being set up, which is where the Minister will send the protected disclosure for assessment.  As I said earlier, on the conclusion of that assessment, it may well come back to the Minister to deal with or it may go to the direct employer or a prescribed person.</p> <p>That is an important reform because the truth is that when a protected disclosure comes into a Minister, the Minister is, in practice, reliant on whatever advice his or her Department will give him or her.  That is the truth, which, as the committee has heard in earlier meetings, can be problematic if the matter concerns wrongdoing by that Department.  That is also a factor.  In addition, where the matter relates to allegations of wrongdoing in a body under the aegis of the Minister's Department, the power of the Minister to take action can sometimes be quite limited as some bodies enjoy strong statutory independence from Government, such as local authorities and many regulatory agencies.</p> <p>We will consider any further amendments the Senator puts down.  By the way, the advice from the Attorney General is that the provisions of the Bill do not constitute regression under the grounds of the directive.  That is the clear legal advice we have received.  I heard the points the Deputy made, however, and I think we can engage further on them.</p></speech>

It is right and proper for us, as parliamentarians and Oireachtas Members, that there should be a political accountability element to it as well.  Ultimately, those of us who are elected, and those of us who are fortunate enough to be elevated to the position of being responsible for an area of public life in Ireland as a Minister, have a particular responsibility in terms of decision-making and what happens in respect of the management of public resources and so forth.  A level of public accountability comes with the fact that when a report has been made to the Minister, it has touched the elected representatives or those public representatives in that sense.  Yes, there have perhaps been failings in the past but as the Minister described it, the failings were downstream where it was unclear what a Minister would do with a protected disclosure.  I feel we could address the issue of a clear line on what the Minister should do with a protected disclosure without having this element where we discourage the bringing of disclosures to the Minister.  For me, it is important to set out what the Minister does with the disclosure.  Even doing that would in itself address most of the concerns that have arisen without then also having this discouragement of the report to the Minister.</p> <p>I would like there to be a point in Ireland whereby any issue that are highlighted as being of public concern are dealt with slowly through that kind of light.  Sadly, however, it is often only when there has been heat that issues have been addressed.  Very practically, it has often only been when Ministers have answered questions to committees, the media or in the Seanad or D&aacute;il, where we have a political point of accountability, that issues have been addressed.  There are so many cases in which an issue has been highlighted for ten years and it was only when it became a political point of discussion that action and proper investigation happened.  That, sadly, is the reality and that is what people see.  In that context, even if we move to a point whereby we really have adequate other channels, it may be, at a minimum, premature to move away from the ministerial channel being there as an axis.  That is why I really believe it is an important point, although I acknowledge the improvements at the other side.</p> <p>My question concerns some of that very strong and undefined language I identified, which is being attached around issues of public interest and so forth.  Is the Minister at a minimum open to reviewing some of that language before Report Stage?</p></speech>

This is a good Bill that strengthens protections for whistleblowers and puts a process in place that I believe will deliver better outcomes.  That is really important.  That is certainly my only agenda in bringing forward this legislation.  I will consider the points the Senator made in that respect.</p> <p>She raised then a specific issue with regard to section 12 of the Bill and, essentially, what she regards as the bar being set too high for allowance for a direct disclosure to the Minister.   She highlighted the phrase "an imminent or manifest danger&rdquo;, in particular, as well as the idea of the head of the public body concerned being directly complicit.  I will examine those between now and Report Stage.  We will take on board the points the Senator made insofar as we can.</p></speech>

The conditions at Article 15 are, however, in addition to the conditions that apply under Article 6(1)(a) of the directive that the reporting person has &ldquo;reasonable grounds to believe that the information on breaches reported was true at the time of reporting and that such information fell within the scope of this Directive&rdquo;.  The provision in the Bill as it stands is not, therefore, a complete transposition of the public disclosure provisions in the directive and this needs to be corrected.</p> <p>The original text of section 10 of the Principal Act provided, at section 10(1)(a), that &ldquo;the worker reasonably believes that the information disclosed, and any allegation contained in it, are substantially true&rdquo;.

It is important to point out that interim relief is being extended under the Bill to all acts of penalisation, which is a positive development.</p> <p>This amendment proposes to reduce the threshold for employees who wish to apply to the Circuit Court for interim relief following penalisation.  It proposes to reduce the threshold from &ldquo;an employee who claims to have suffered penalisation wholly or mainly from having made a protected disclosure&rdquo; to &ldquo;an employee who claims to have suffered penalisation wholly or partly from having made a protected disclosure&rdquo;.  I have consulted the Attorney General on this issue.  The existing text of the Bill is consistent with the provisions of the principal Act dealing with interim relief.  Amending this provision may have wider implication for the Act and its operation, in the view of the Attorney General.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Article 23.2 of the directive provides that such penalties should apply only to reporting persons who make such reports.  The Bill as drafted, however, provides that a person who makes a report containing any information that the reporting person knows to be false commits an offence.  A concern has been raised with my officials that this could be interpreted to apply not only to reporting persons but also to any other person who handles or transmits a false report, even if that person does not know the information is false.  This could have unintended consequences for a whole range of people, including employers, prescribed persons, the commissioner, legal advisers and any other facilitators who handle reports or assist a person in making a report.  These amendments address this issue by making it explicit that this offence applies only to reporting persons.</p> <p>I am not accepting amendment No. 51.  It provides for the inclusion of &ldquo;provides knowingly false information in relation to a reporting person&rdquo; as an offence.  Provision of false information to discredit a reporting person or cause him or her detriment is encompassed by the definition of penalisation, which states that any direct or indirect act or omission which occurs in a work-related context and causes or may cause unjustified detriment to a worker, penalising or threatening to penalise a reporting person, is already a criminal offence in the Bill.  There is no requirement in the directive to draw such a specific offence out of the general requirement to provide that penalisation or threatening to penalise is an offence.</p></speech>

On a point relevant to the section, one of the witnesses said to me: "We do the right thing by the system but, unfortunately, the system does not do the right thing by us".  I have to agree with him.  How this amendment stands now means that the victim will always be the victim and the victim will always be punished, but what about the victim's company, the employer?  We want to withdraw this amendment.  However, we want more engagement with the Minister and the Department in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

It provides for a fine of not less than &euro;500,000 on indictment.  This is significantly higher than the criminal penalties currently provided for in the Bill, which provide for fines ranging from &euro;75,000 to &euro;250,000.  These penalties can apply to individuals as well as corporate bodies.  The criminal penalties in the Bill were considered with the Office of the Attorney General with the purpose of aligning them as much as possible with similar type provisions on the Statute Book.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 61 removes the provision allowing the Workplace Relations Commission to bring and prosecute summary proceedings where certain employers fail to comply with their obligation to establish and maintain reporting channels and procedures.  Enforcement of the obligation on certain employers to establish and maintain reporting channels and procedures is an essential element in the transposition of the EU whistleblower directive.  Accordingly, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#TT00500"><p>I am pleased to present to the House the Institutional Burials Bill 2022.  This is crucial legislation which, if enacted, will allow us to finally afford the children in Tuam the dignified burial that has been denied to them for such a long time.  It will provide a lawful basis for a full-scale forensic excavation, recovery and analysis of the children's remains at the site and will enable a DNA-based identification programme to be undertaken to help answer questions affected families may have about their loved ones.</p> <p>This legislation is a priority for me.  The people of Tuam, and, indeed, people throughout the country and across the world, have been deeply affected by what transpired there.  The horror of the initial discovery has been compounded by a frustration that the children have still not been given the appropriate reburial.  The Government has committed to a full-scale forensic excavation of the site, and this legislation is essential to delivering on that.</p> <p>The Bill was published in February and completed its passage through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am committed to starting the excavation at the earliest opportunity and that is why I am seeking to advance the Bill through all Stages in this legislative session.  I realise that this is an ambitious timeframe, but I sincerely hope we can work together to achieve it so that the work necessary to implement the legislation can get under way during the summer recess.  The families have waited far too long.</p><p>The version of the Bill before the House has undergone extensive changes since the general scheme was published.  The general scheme was scrutinised by the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and other stakeholders.  I made some very significant changes to the published version of the Bill in response.  I thank those Senators who sat on the committee for their valuable contributions to this process.  I also made significant changes to the Bill as it passed through the D&aacute;il that have further strengthened it.</p><p>I will now outline the key parts of the Bill as passed by the D&aacute;il, highlighting the key amendments made since the Bill was passed and the initial draft published.  In this regard, I note upfront that the restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner, which was provided for in the original general scheme, has been removed.  This was a key concern raised by the committee and other stakeholders nationally and internationally.  There is now no such restriction in the legislation.</p><p>Part 1 contains the standard Short Title, commencement and interpretation provisions.  Section 2 provides definitions of key terms used in the Bill.  A central term is "forensic excavation and recovery."  This means the excavation of the land, and the recovery and treatment of human remains, in a manner sufficient to satisfy legal requirements regarding the use and storage of evidence in connection with the identification of human remains, including in criminal proceedings.  The term "eligible family member" is another key term in this section.  It sets out the family members who are entitled to participate in an identification programme.  In fully responding to the relevant pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations, I significantly expanded the family members eligible to participate to include all second-order relatives.  As the Bill passed through the D&aacute;il, and following consultation with Forensic Science Ireland, I further expanded the definition to include half-nieces, half-nephews, grand-nieces and grand-nephews.</p><p>Part 2 provides that the Government can consider a proposal by a relevant Minister to intervene at a site where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place of persons who died while resident at an institution.  Where the Government is satisfied that an intervention is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding important objectives of public interest, it can direct that Minister to establish an office of a director of authorised interventions.  The Minister will appoint a director to oversee the intervention, as well as an advisory board to support and guide the director in the role.  The role and functions of the director under the legislation were significantly strengthened in the published Bill.  A director is now required to conduct a forensic-standard investigation and recovery of remains in line with the definition in Part 1, and a new function of arranging for post-recovery analysis has been added.  He or she will be empowered to employ or contract the range of expertise and disciplines needed to discharge these functions to international best-practice standard at a particular site.  The director will also provide updates on the work of the office to relatives of persons believed to be buried at the site, other stakeholders and the general public.  The director may also be required to undertake a DNA programme of identification, which is intended to be the case in Tuam.</p><p>The advisory board will provide advice and guidance to the director.  The board will be chaired by a former coroner or someone with coronial expertise and will include scientific experts, former residents and-or family members.  Consultation with the advisory board will be required at regular intervals, including at key decision points in the intervention.  The addition of an advisory board responds to a number of recommendations to enhance transparency and accountability that came from pre-legislative scrutiny, as well as to ensure meaningful engagement with families and survivors.</p><p>Part 2 also provides that a director can obtain information and documents from publicly funded bodies and other persons to assist in the performance of his or her functions.  These provisions were enhanced in response to pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations to give the director the power to compel, rather than simply request, the production of the information or documents concerned.  As the Bill passed through the D&aacute;il, the list of information sources was also expanded to include an explicit reference to religious organisations and communities, including, but not limited to, a diocese or parish of the Roman Catholic Church or the Church of Ireland.</p><p>Part 3 provides for the forensic excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis of human remains to be carried out by appropriately qualified persons in accordance with international standards and best practice.  It provides that remains that are recovered will be sorted into individual sets as far as possible, that forensic testing will be carried out to establish as much information about the individuals as possible, including the circumstances and cause of death, and that the director of an intervention will publish a general report on the findings.  Part 3 is a significant addition to the general scheme, which responds directly to issues raised during pre-legislative scrutiny about the need to address how people died.  A director of an intervention will be required to inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the relevant coroner where evidence emerges of a violent or unnatural death or where remains are not those of a person who died while ordinarily resident at the institution.  As a result of an amendment made in the D&aacute;il, the director's post-recovery analysis report must now also document whether any such notifications were made to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner.</p><p>Part 4 provides the legal basis for a DNA-based programme of identification to be carried out in respect of remains recovered from an intervention site.  The aim of an identification programme is to establish the likelihood that there is a familial link between people who believe they have family members buried at a site and the human remains that are recovered from that site and where a familial link is established, to identify those remains.  In response to concerns raised by family members and other stakeholders, the provision for a pilot identification programme in the general scheme was removed in the published Bill.  Instead, the Bill now provides that an identification programme will proceed where there are living family members of persons believed to be buried at the site who wish to participate in a programme and where DNA of sufficient quality is available from the remains to enable DNA profile comparisons.</p><p>DNA testing is a very powerful tool, which may reveal information about familial relationships to persons other than to the deceased relative a person believes may be buried at a site.  The legislation, therefore, has to balance the public interest of identifying remains buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner with the privacy rights of close living relatives.  The general scheme sought to do this by limiting participation in an identification programme to parents, children, siblings and half siblings of deceased persons, and providing that the highest ranking of those relatives had to provide consent or a person would be blocked from participating in a programme. The Bill provides for a much more inclusive and flexible approach.  In summary, the Bill now provides that family members eligible to participate are; children, parents, siblings, half siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, half-nieces, half-nephews, grand-nieces and grand-nephews of deceased persons.</p><p>As a necessary balancing mechanism, the Bill allows the closest living relatives, namely, parents, children and siblings, to object to the participation of other, less closely related, persons.  In this context, it is important to note that an objection does not automatically mean that a person cannot participate in an identification programme.  Any objection will be considered by a director in conjunction with the closeness of the genetic relationship of the person who wishes to participate and the public interest of identifying human remains.</p><p>The final arrangements for recovered human remains are also considered in Part 4.  The provisions in the Bill have been amended from those in the general scheme in response to a number of recommendations in the pre-legislative scrutiny report.  The Bill now provides that, once identified, remains are returned to family members or final arrangements are made in line with their wishes.  Where identification is not possible, final arrangements are similarly undertaken in line with the wishes of those who consider they are family members.</p><p>A significant change made to Part 4 during its passage through the D&aacute;il was the addition of chapter 7 to provide a legislative basis for an oversight committee to perform an assurance role in respect of the historic databases to be established under the legislation.  Given the sensitive data to be processed, and the risk associated with any potential breach, it is prudent to provide for a specific oversight structure with reference to the DNA analysis that will be carried out under this Act.</p><p>Part 5 provides for a director to acquire temporary rights of access to land required to undertake an intervention, with an obligation to provide reasonable compensation and to restore land to its original condition and use upon completion.  The primary access provided for in the Bill is to a principal burial site, described as principal burial land.  Where the principal burial land is on residential land, access can extend up to the curtilage or 10 m, whichever is the lesser, of any dwelling on the land.  This provision is a key change to the general scheme, which specified that the Government could not make an order in respect of land on which there was one or more dwellings.  In response to the pre-legislative scrutiny recommendations, I provided that principal burial land can include residential land but that the site could not come within the curtilage or 20 m, whichever is the lesser, of the dwelling.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the Bill passed through the D&aacute;il, I further reduced the distance from a dwelling property where works can take place down to 10 m, where the land in question is considered to be within the curtilage of a property.  The legislation must balance the rights of property owners with the need to intervene on land.  I am satisfied that removing the absolute restriction envisaged in the general scheme and allowing works to be carried out within 10 m of a dwelling represents a more just balancing of those rights.</p><p>I wish to be clear that the land in Tuam is residential land.  That land is public land and therefore the provision I just outlined does not apply to it.  While it has been the subject of debate recently, I wish to reiterate that all the land in Tuam - the garden and the wider site, including the car park and playground - is open for examination and investigation.  In dealing with this legislation, I wanted to put that on the record of the House.</p><p>Part 6 contains provisions related to the dissolution of an office of a director.  It provides that a director will prepare and submit a final report prior to dissolution day.  In response to concerns raised in the D&aacute;il that the provisions may not allow for a director to be called before an Oireachtas committee to discuss their final report, I have provided that the final report must be submitted at least 12 weeks before dissolution day and must be laid before the Houses within six weeks of receipt, providing a minimum six-week window for a director to be called before a committee.</p><p>Following submission of the final report, the relevant Minster shall, within 12 months, undertake a review of the implementation of the legislation in regard to that particular intervention.  A report of the review will be published.  The review mechanism is included in the Bill in response to a pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation.</p><p>As I have said before, what happened in Tuam is a stain on our national conscience.  This Bill will allow us, at long last, to afford the children interred there a dignified and respectful burial.  I have carefully considered the concerns raised by Deputies and Senators in the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I have listened to families, survivors and independent experts.  On foot of that we have made significant changes to the legislation, following the pre-legislative scrutiny report and as the Bill progressed through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The Bill is significantly enhanced and strengthened as a result of that process.  I again express my gratitude to Members of the Oireachtas and particularly to the survivors and family members who engaged with me, leading to strengthening the Bill which better vindicates the dignity of these children.</p><p>If and when the Bill is enacted, I will be in a position to establish an office of the Tuam director and start that excavation as soon as possible after that.  My sincere hope is that Bill this will finally bring some sort of closure to the families and survivors who have been so deeply affected by the abhorrent situation in Tuam.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.406" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#VV00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement.  I visited Tuam and spent time there on Monday.  I spent the day in County Galway talking to a number of people involved in this case.  I thought it was appropriate to go.  It is important to visit the site and speak to the people involved.  I had a long engagement with Catherine Corless and her husband.  Walking the site gives a great sense of its importance.  The site is in the ownership of Galway County Council.  As the Minister rightly stated, it is public land.  I walked down to the very bottom of triangle - I know the Minister has been there.  It is quite hard, with a lot of concrete.  After that comes the children's playground.  Ironically, no children were playing there but the rusty swings remain.  Then come the grass verges.  I note what the Minister said about 10 m, 20 m or 30 m.  I have studied horticulture, and the nearest thing I can compare it with is when someone has a flower bed and decides to scrap it after 20 years because they cannot manage it and they put it back to grass.  Years later, it is still possible to see the imprint of the bed.</p> <p>On the day I was there, little squares were visible throughout the lawn.  That was interesting and telling.  For some reason, I felt there was some sort of dignity about that.  There were plots set out.  I was later told that they were children who had been buried in little wooden whitewash-painted boxes.  I like to be fair when I comment on any issue.  I went away thinking that someone set out with the intention to bury them there.  It was clearly different when I went down to the sewers or the chambers as they were.</p> <p>I welcome the legislation.  I do not intend to propose amendments or certainly not many.  I have one or two in mind.  I spoke to someone this afternoon who suggested two.  I am conscious that 11 a.m. tomorrow is the deadline for tabling amendments.  I am also conscious that the Minister wants to get the legislation through, which is important.</p> <p>In 2015, the Commission of Investigation into the Mother and Baby Homes was established.  In 2017, the commission confirmed the presence of juvenile human remains at the site of the former mother and baby home in Tuam.  We know that to be factually incorrect.  In response, the Minister's predecessor, Katherine Zappone, commissioned the expert technical group to outline the options available to Government.  In October 2018 the Government decided on a phased basis to carry out forensic-standard excavation.  It then decided to look at the full site in Tuam.  I understand the Attorney General advised that new legislation would be required to implement the decision.  In December 2019, the Government approved and published the scheme of the heads of the Bill.  In 2021, the general scheme was scrutinised by the Oireachtas committee.  I have looked at the committee's papers and I commend the committee members on their work.  They put considerable time into this task.  The committee provided a report with its recommendations in July 2021.  Following Government approval, the Institutional Burials Bill was published this year.  I note that the legislation is not site-specific, a point I will deal with later.</p> <p>The legislation seeks to ensure that the remains of those who died in residential institutions and who were buried in them in a manifestly inappropriate manner may be recovered in a respectful and appropriate manner, as the Minister outlined in his statement.  I do not need to summarise the Bill's provisions; the Minister has set that out.  However, I note that the legal basis for a phased step-by-step approach to an intervention will comprise the following steps: the excavation of the site; the recovery of the human remains; the post-recovery analysis of the remains; the identification of the remains through DNA analysis; the return of the remains to family members; and the respectful reinterment of remains.  They will not necessarily be reinterred in Tuam at that site.  I know that has not been finalised.  That is an important point to make.  All steps will be taken, which is reasonable.  It will be based on international standards and practice.</p> <p>I understand that in response to the pre-legislative scrutiny, recommendations and concerns were expressed by family representatives on the general scheme.  I acknowledge that the Minister made some significant changes to the scheme.  I want to address some of them now.  Three of the key issues I have picked out for mention today are: a further reduction in the distance from a dwelling property where works can take place from 30 m, which comes down to 20 m and 10 m in certain cases.  The Minister has been to the site and he knows that if that were to happen, a substantial amount of ground would not be covered.</p> <p>The Minister spoke about the rights of owners of residential property.  I accept we have constitutional rights to own property, but the Tuam site is surrounded by residential property on three sides.  On Monday night I saw a map showing the distances measured out and I recognise the impact.  I am happy with the Minister's assurances that in this case because these are public lands, it is possible to carry out a full excavation of all the bodies there.  However, at Bessborough, which has fallen into the hands of a private developer - as is their right and I do not want to be site-specific to that extent - it would not apply.  That means we come down to 10 m, which is considerable if it goes across three sides.  Three tens make 30, which is a substantial amount of ground.</p> <p>I know what the Minister is trying to achieve.  What I took away from my conversations in Tuam on Monday is that people want assurances from him.  I flagged them when I spoke to the Minister on Monday.  I am glad he flagged them here which is reassuring for the people in Tuam.</p> <p>The Bill provides for an oversight committee to perform an assurance role in respect of the historical database which is important.  The Minister has made amendments to provide that the director may be called before an Oireachtas committee.  I had some views on that initially, and I am glad to see it addressed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the whole I am supportive.<br/><br/>I want to address an issue that has got somewhat lost in this.  The Sisters of Bon Secours issued a statement that worth reading it into the record.  It is not my view on the Bon Secours sisters but it says a lot about their admission.</p><blockquote>	The Commission's report presents a history of our country in which many women and children were rejected, silenced and excluded; in which they were subjected to hardship; and in which their inherent human dignity was disrespected, in life and in death.<br /><br />Our Sisters of Bon Secours were part of this sorrowful history.<br /><br />Our Sisters ran St Mary&rsquo;s Mother and Baby Home in Tuam from 1925 to 1961.  We did not live up to our Christianity when running the Home.  We failed to respect the inherent dignity of the women and children who came to the Home.  We failed to offer them the compassion that they so badly needed.  We were part of the system in which they suffered hardship, loneliness and terrible hurt.  We acknowledge in particular that infants and children who died at the Home were buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way.  For all that, we are deeply sorry.<br /><br />We offer our profound apologies to all the women and children of St Mary&rsquo;s Mother and Baby Home, to their families and to the people of this country.<br /><br />Healing is not possible until what happened is acknowledged.  We hope and we pray that healing will come to all those affected; those who are living and those who have died.  We hope that we, our church and our country can learn from this history. </blockquote><p>The statement is signed on behalf of the Sisters of Bon Secours in Ireland.  I think it is important to read this because it is an admission by them.  It is not something I say about them.  It is an admission they have put on the record and people have told me it is important to read it into the record of the House.  I hope we will move on.  I wish the Minister well.  These will be difficult days for all of the people involved but it is the right thing to do.  It is what people want and expect at this stage.  I hope we can get the legislation through the Houses and signed by &Uacute;achtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I will not go into it in as fine detail as the Minister.</p> <p>Today is an important milestone along the tragic dark road we are all facing up to.  Since entering the Oireachtas I have had many meetings with the families affected, mostly the women.  I have cried at those meetings; I have been shocked.  I have learned so much about human decency and dignity from the women and children affected.  I have also heard that sense of urgency the Minister will be aware of and frustration as to why exhumation has not yet happened.  I share this frustration with many people in the country and globally.  These families want to give their loved ones the respect and dignity they were so grievously denied in their short lives.  It is wrong that the previous Government failed to do this.  When it first came to light, the Department of Justice should have worked to give those babies in Tuam an adequate burial and put in all the resources and legislation required.  The normal rules did not apply because these babies had no voices and their mothers had their voices suppressed and often stolen.  The Minister with responsibility for children is taking care of a Bill that deals with coroners.</p> <p>I am glad to be part of a Government that is doing the right thing.  I think of the thousands of women, babies and children who lost their lives.  This is the country's desperate truth.  By not working to look after and protect them, we make our history our present.  It is our sick reality.  It is desperate how we treated beautiful, sacred and precious wee lives and how this country treated young women and girls who were pregnant outside of marriage.  Every time I speak on these issues, I speak with a deep sense of heartache and shame as an Irish woman.  The sense of patriotism I so strongly feel sits uncomfortably alongside my shame, anger and tears for an Ireland that let women just like me down.  It robbed them of their children, their futures, their dignity, their money and their Ireland.  It destroys the true republican ideals that I grew up with and my understanding that men, women and children were treated equally.  Shame on everyone.  Shame on our church, our State, our institutions, our Governments, our health service, our Garda and everyone.   We are all part of this story and this awful truth.  It is something I find very difficult to reconcile.</p> <p>The Bill should not be necessary.  Ireland should have done better.  Those wee lives in Tuam and all the other institutions should have been treated with respect, love and dignity.  While I am impatient that the children in Tuam are looked after, I am glad the legislation is not site-specific and will also be able to cater for an intervention at other sites and memorialisations should similar situations arise.  When we establish the Tuam investigation, I hope there will be an audit of potential sites and consideration of memorialisation.  It must cater for places where children and women are buried and excavations are not necessary.  Let us remember how invasive excavations are.  Little remains should not always be moved if they are in a safe place.  I think of Bessborough and Ann O'Gorman, one of the strongest and gentlest women I have met.  Ann had her little Evelyn in that horrid home and little Evelyn died.  It was only after years of searching that Ann found out that Evelyn was buried in the burial ground in Bessborough.  What Ann and women like her want is very simple.  They want their loved ones to rest in peace.  She wants a place to come and sit in the burial ground and for it to be protected and owned by the State and to know that Evelyn and the other little angels, and the many young women who lost their lives, who were not respected in life will now be respected in their death.</p> <p>I am thankful that we are here today.  I am furious with our country that we have to be here today.  I congratulate the Minister on the work he and his officials have done.  I thank him for the many positive changes he has made since the original draft Bill.  These are important changes as he as quite rightly outlined.  I commend my colleague, Senator Seery Kearney, and all members of the committee.  We worked hard together on the pre-legislative scrutiny.  I commend all of the stakeholders and all the affected people who came to the committee to give us their deepest darkest stories about their family members.</p> <p>I will finish with some comments directed to the religious orders and the churches.  They should face up to these sins, as Senator Boyhan highlighted.  The truth will set them free.  Give the burial grounds they have in their ownership to the State.  Give them back to the women and the people we let down.  Give over all of the information.  The Bill is about human rights, dignity and respect.  It will allow people to rest in peace.  We need to ensure we do this.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.</p></speech>

These days have been long awaited by the families who are seeking answers and reunification with their loved ones.  I will begin by recognising the extraordinary work of Catherine Corless who brought this issue into the public consciousness and her fastidious absolute determination to find and expose the truth.  We owe her a debt of gratitude.  This was reflected in the Minister's contribution.</p> <p>I thank the Minister because he has approached this with enormous empathy and openness.  He has listened to us figuring matters out behind the scenes and Senator McGreehan has alluded to the work we did together.  He has also listened to families.  All of us have spent a lot of time with families, survivors and those who are heartbroken about the Tuam revelations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister has shown an openness that has brought us to where we are today.  There were apparently difficulties and impediments in the first general scheme of the Bill.  The Minister has worked in a dedicated way.  He deserves the honour, respect and empathy he has shown, and to be honoured for it.</p><p>I also thank the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for its dedicated work, led by Deputy Funchion.  We were involved in a very long process.  The witnesses who came before the committee were extraordinary in their contributions.  It was harrowing to listen to their evidence at times but it was heartening to listen to some of the experts.  It was chastening to listen to the impediments, difficulties and complexities that lie ahead.  The answers that people think are going to be there may not be there.  This is a great day and I welcome all of the elements of this Bill but at the same time, it may not bring the peace that we all hope it will.  It will, however, bring dignity and respect.  That is something to which we can all commit.</p><p>There is a unique set of circumstances in Tuam.  We use the term "manifestly inappropriate", which in itself is a very strong term but because it is an academic-sounding term, it almost sanitises the barbaric treatment of people.  There was a barbaric discarding of human life and the potential that each of those precious souls had and the cherishing they should have received.  It is important that they are treated with great dignity and respect.  </p><p>As the documentaries have come out and exposed what happened, we have been heartbroken and appalled.  We recoil from the very dark history of our treatment of women and children.  However, I am proud to be part of the Oireachtas and the committee, working in conjunction with a Minister who is overseeing a peaceful end to this.  As I say, it will not be without its challenges.  </p><p>I recognise particular elements of the Bill.  The Minister has undertaken to broaden its scope, which is welcome.  It is important that second-order relatives were included in that opportunity for a widening of the DNA.  I also respect the right for first-order relatives to apply a veto to preserve privacy.  That is very important.  I also respect and welcome the introduction of oversight with regard to DNA.  Where DNA is being gathered in a database or anything like that is happening, oversight is very important.  That is a mark of respect to the survivors and the people who are so openly coming forward.  That is important.</p><p>The Bill is not so prescriptive that it denies the opportunity of new scientific methods.  That emerged in the testimony of some of the witnesses to the committee.  There is an open-ended element to the Bill and if something new arises in how we may come to identification, we have a means of adopting it and will not need a legislative amendment because there is scope to accommodate it in the Bill.  That was discussed extensively on Committee Stage.  I am old enough to remember a time when DNA was a new thing.  It is now easily accessible via a kit that can be sent in the post.  With regard to scientific development, goodness knows what is ahead and what may yet bring peace to families.</p><p>I pay tribute to the women who walked through the doors of those institutions, who gave birth, who had no say in what happened and whose rights were neither recognised nor respected.  The babies concerned could have been much loved and cherished by our society but were not.  In this process, I am proud that we are going to stand by the cherishing of them as people of our Republic, as they should be cherished.  I commend the Bill and will support it all the way.  I look forward to peace coming to Tuam and to the survivors who were so noble and heartbroken when they spoke to us in the committee.  I look forward to them having some sense of peace.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-23a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062300002#XX00200"><p>I thank Senators for their contributions today and I thank many of them for their contributions to this process through the children's committee.  I am grateful too for their ongoing engagement with me.</p> <p>Like Senator Boyhan, I visited the site at Tuam last July with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  We met Catherine Corless, who showed me the site.  We met one or two relatives there and during the course of the day in a nearby hotel, I met different groups of relatives and survivors representing those who were in the institution or whose family members died there and are almost certainly buried on the site.  </p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke about how tough the joint Oireachtas committee process was and how difficult it was to hear the raw emotion of people who were treated poorly and have been left with fundamental questions about the remains of their children, brothers and uncles.  We know the answer to that question.  We know where those remains are.  They are in a tank.  They are not in coffins or in any sort of regular pattern.  They were discarded.  That is probably the best description.  </p> <p>I had the opportunity in the course of drafting this legislation to work with Dr. Niamh McCullough, who many of the committee members will have seen speak on a number of the documentaries about Tuam and who was involved in the original excavation at that site that was mandated by the commission.  Dr. McCullough took us through the physical realities of the site.  She described that each of the chambers was the size of three sheets of A4 paper.  That is how difficult the job is going to be.  There are 20 of those chambers deep in the ground, surrounded by concrete.  When the time comes, the team that is appointed by this institution is going to have to excavate each of those and remove incredibly delicate remains of children, including those of children who were born and of children who died before even coming to term.  As Senators have alluded to, this is going to be difficult and it is very possible that not every person who believes he or she has a relative buried in Tuam will be able to get a set of remains.  Perhaps some will get no remains at all.  That is the nature of the situation.  </p> <p>What I was trying to achieve in the context of this legislation was to ensure that everything that can be done from a scientific point of view will be done.  That was why the intervention of Dr. McCullough was so important, particularly in terms of the post-recovery analysis, which is the degree of analysis we undertake before we begin the DNA analysis but after the remains have been removed.  I hate using the awful term "commingled remains" but it accurately describes the physical reality.  The bones in each of the chambers are mixed up.  Each member of the team will have to try to reconstruct individual sets of remains.  That is probably the part of this that will take the longest.  That work is valuable because it gives the best chance of a DNA identification that will provide a family with a significant set of remains.  That is why we are doing this.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke about what happens at the end and the burials.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are trying to give the families sets of remains they can bury according to the rite they see fit.  Some remains will stay unidentified.  A process is set out in the Bill in respect of interment for those remains.  The advisory committee will be consulted, as will survivors' groups in the area.  I am sure there will be different views and that will have to be negotiated at the time.  A process is set out here, however, to ensure that every set of remains in this site gets a dignified burial.  We have, though, been clear that cremation will not be an option for these remains in case new DNA techniques emerge in future.  This aspect of changes in DNA techniques was mentioned, and this provision is a valuable protection.  </p><p>Senator McGreehan spoke about engagement with the survivors.  She described these children, and their family members, as having been robbed of Ireland, and that struck me.  It is something I am conscious of, especially in the context where, as the Senator knows, we finally passed the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022 yesterday.  Next week, a national and international campaign will begin in that context.  We must remember the extremely international dimension of this matter.  So many of the women who left these institutions went abroad because they felt so little connection with this country.  They were abandoned by the country.  Likewise, under the legislation, there is a provision for an information campaign when a programme of investigation begins, especially concerning the availability of the DNA.  Undoubtedly, in Tuam, many of the people involved have dispersed and it is important that we do that.  </p><p>I am glad that we were able to provide the clarification regarding the land in Tuam.  A point was made about the 10 m distance.  As I said before, however, that is on land already regarded as private.  That does not apply at the Tuam site.  The entire site there is public land and all of it is open for investigation.  We have even got a provision that allows us to encroach on some of those gardens at the back of the site.  This must be proportionate and compensation will be paid in this regard.  When we look at the site, however, the area where the excavation will be happening is right beside a large wall, and, in terms of health and safety, there will be provision for measures to ensure that everyone is safe.</p><p>The issue of intervention and excavation versus memorialisation was also referred to.  At Tuam, there is no question in this respect.  Everyone believes that the course of action set out in this Bill is the right one.  Regarding other sites, however, we know there are different views.  Some survivors would like to see relatives' remains exhumed and perhaps buried elsewhere, while others have strong views concerning the sanctity of burials, wherever they may be.  This is again something we have tried to balance in this legislation.  Work is being done on memorialisation.  My Department has been engaging with a group led by officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the issue of memorialisation and on the protection of sites.  Action was taken in the Cork city development plan to protect the Bessborough site.  Other local authorities could take similar actions as part of efforts to restore and protect sites.</p><p>We are seeking swift progression of this legislation through the House.  I say this in a respectful way.  Significant changes have been made.  This is Committee Stage and we are willing to look at things.  It was noted that it is a tight deadline and I accept that.  When I was down in Tuam last year, I made a commitment to the relatives that I would do everything I could to ensure that work would take place on the Tuam site this year.  If we can get this Bill passed by the end of this session and if, before August, we can get the process started to set up the agency and to seek to appoint a director, then we will be able to work to that timescale.  I cannot give an absolute guarantee, but it allows us to work towards that goal.  My Department is not waiting for the legislation.  All the job specifications and things like that are designed.</p><p>I am eager to get this legislation passed quickly so we can undertake that work.  As all Senators have said and all Deputies have recognised, the family members in Tuam have waited far too long to get the answers they seek, but, most importantly, to see some dignity restored to those children.  Ultimately, this is the essence of what this legislation is about.  It is about restoring some dignity to hundreds of children whose dignity was robbed from them.  For too long, the State has allowed that situation to continue and we cannot do so anymore.  I thank all the Senators for their assistance through the development of this legislation.  I again thank all the survivors, relatives and advocates who have been engaged in this process.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
