She is a very popular visitor.</p></speech>

I am sharing this Commencement matter with Senator Eugene Murphy.  We met with Annette, Cathy, Martina and Nora.  These are all people who work in Portiuncula University Hospital in Ballinasloe.  These are people who were on the front line all during the pandemic.  They were our hospital warriors in the face of Covid-19.  They were our warriors that went out every single day and left their families at home when we were asked to stay at home.  When we were asked to keep people safe, they were asked to keep people safe by going to work.  They put themselves on the line.  These are contract cleaners and caterers.  They work with Noonan's and Aramark, particularly in the Saolta University Hospital Group.  They worked 12- or 14-hour shifts and they did what was asked of them, as many of us did.  We came together as a country to fight this battle.</p> <p>The pandemic recognition payment is a recognition by the Irish Government on behalf of the Irish people to staff who worked on the front line.  We have an estimated 125,000 people, HSE and section 38 staff, who have now received this payment.  Let me say again, it is a payment totally in recognition of the work that was done.  However, a number of other categories remain.  Our question here is what are the categories that are left?  What about the clarification of contract cleaners and caterers for the pandemic health care payment?  Are cleaners and caterers part of this?  Do we have an estimate of the remaining payments and timelines now that we have a new provider?  What is that going to be?  I really appreciate the Minister of State's time on this.  We really need to have fair and equal treatment for people who have worked so hard to keep everyone safe and to save lives.  Members of my own family worked in cleaning.  I have worked in cleaning.  All through college I was involved in this kind of work.  These people were on the front line for us.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

It is really fantastic to see the Minister of State back here in good form and I thank her for letting me know the good news two weeks ago.  I am delighted for her because at the end of the day good health is what we all wish for.  Many people get challenges with their health every day of the week.  I am just going to endorse what Senator Dolan has said.  I think she has given the story as it is.  We met with those people.  Cathy and the others met us with their SIPTU representative in Gullane's hotel in Ballinasloe last week.  These people are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis to rear their families.  They are doing a very good job and they are coming up with what I would call an embarrassing situation for the Oireachtas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I accept the Minister met these workers somewhere in Galway city in recent weeks, possibly at the university hospital, and that he was sympathetic.  I acknowledge he is trying and that the Minister of State is quite annoyed about the situation.  We are told this work is being out sourced to a company.  The reality is we should get on with whatever has to be done and try to get that money paid to those people for Christmas.  It is simply not right and it is embarrassing for us that it is happening and we need to get it out of the way.  I have no more to say about that.</p></speech>

They are setting a very good standard of working for a common objective in the constituency.  I invite the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#C00300"><p>I thank both Senator Dolan and Murphy for raising this really important issue.  In January of this year, to recognise their unique role and extraordinary efforts, the Government announced a pandemic recognition payment for front-line public sector healthcare workers.  The pandemic recognition payment was introduced to express the appreciation of Government for those working in front-line environments exposed to Covid-19.  Significant efforts have been made to progress the payments under this measure and it has been extremely frustrating.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, I have found it particularly frustrating.</p> <p>These payments are the result of extensive efforts by Department of Health officials and the HSE.  To date, more than 124,000 eligible front-line HSE and section 38 healthcare workers have been paid.  This means the vast majority of these eligible front-line workers have now received the pandemic recognition payment.  A wide variety of front-line workers within the HSE and section 38 organisations are eligible for this payment.  Support staff such as cleaning and catering staff, among other groups, are included once they meet the eligibility criteria set out.  There are also certain non-HSE and non-section 38 healthcare workers who are encompassed by the Government decision.  Included in these groups are eligible staff in private sector nursing homes and hospices; section 39 long-term residential facilities for people with disabilities; agency roles working in the HSE; healthcare support assistants contracted to the HSE, who went into houses day after day during the pandemic; members of the Defence Forces redeployed to work in front-line Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE and did Trojan work in supporting nursing homes and the roll out of the vaccine; and paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade to deliver services on behalf of the HSE.</p> <p>The Department of Health has been working with the Department of Defence and the Local Government Management Agency to expedite and ensure the payment of eligible members of the Defence Forces seconded to Covid-19 exposed environments in the HSE as well as Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics.  The Department of Health has now transferred funds to Dublin City Council and the Department of Defence to allow for these payments to be completed as soon as possible.  Payments to these eligible workers will be arranged by their employers.  Anyone who was contracted directly by the HSE received their payments in a timely manner, but we have seen many areas where that did not happen.  I am glad to see the issue of payments to members of the Defence Forces and the Dublin Fire Brigade paramedics has been expedited.</p> <p>In August 2022, the HSE published an invitation to tender for a third-party contractor to assist with the payment process for eligible non-public sector workers.  The Minister of Health, Deputy Donnelly, has instructed the HSE to use a simplified process to expedite payments to non-HSE organisations and the HSE and KOSI Corporation have now finalised a process to ensure the payment of these workers.  I have spoken several times to the Minister regarding this and he is extremely frustrated by the slow pace of the delivery to the non-HSE workers and in rolling out the payments.  Last week, information packs began issuing to relevant organisations.  Packs have now issued to more than 750 organisations, including nursing homes, disability facilities, agency organisations and home care organisations.  Organisations which make prompt returns can expect to receive funds in the coming weeks and I know everybody will welcome that.</p> <p>Government is mindful of other workers who played their part in sustaining services during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Officials considered the matter carefully and listened to the views of stakeholders before reaching their decision.  It was difficult to draw a line on this matter, but the Government based its decision on the risks eligible front-line healthcare workers faced.  I take on board the point made by both Senators in relation to the contract cleaners and caterers but I refer again to the line that states there are also certain non-HSE and non-section 38 healthcare workers who are encompassed by the Government decision.  Support staff such as cleaning and catering staff among other groups are included once they meet the eligibility criteria set out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Support staff such as cleaning and catering staff, among other groups, are included once they meet the eligibility criteria set out.</p></speech>

The agencies I am concerned with, particularly around the sale to the university hospital healthcare group, which includes Portiuncula and other hospitals, are Aramark catering and Noonan cleaning services.  That would include the security porters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1674" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#D00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her response.  I remember a number of weeks after the announcement being contacted by some of those people in Ballinasloe, family members of the contract cleaners.  I sought clarification.  The clear answer I got at that time was that staff of any company the HSE contracted to do work on the hospitals were eligible.  I think they will come under that.  I hope, given what the Minister of State said, things will start to move and these people will get the payments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#D00600"><p>The pandemic recognition payment is in the final stages of its roll-out and should begin reaching organisations very soon so that eligible staff can receive the payment as soon as possible.  The nub of the issue is that there is a wide variety of front-line workers in the HSE and section 38 organisations eligible for the payment.  Support staff such as cleaning and catering staff, among other groups, are included once they meet the eligibility criteria set out.  These also include private sector nursing homes and hospices, section 39 long-term residential facilities for people with disability, agency roles in the HSE, healthcare support assistants, members of the Defence Forces and paramedics employed by Dublin Fire Brigade.  I hope that clarifies it.  My understanding is they need only meet the eligibility criteria that is there for all, meaning those who work for a certain amount of time on the front line.  Hopefully that payment will issue very soon.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State.  It is great to see her back.  Hopefully she will be back to flying form in the coming weeks and months.</p> <p>I raise the issue of meningitis, meningitis awareness campaigns and supports for meningitis.  Invasive meningococcal disease is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in Ireland, causing up to 90% of cases.  The disease may present as meningitis, septicaemia or both.  Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges, which is the covering layer of the brain and spinal cord.  Septicaemia is a form of blood poisoning cased by the same organism that causes meningitis.  Early symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pains, stomach cramps and cold hands and feet.  The HSE advises not to wait for a rash if someone is ill and getting worse, but to get medical help immediately.  One in ten people may carry the bacteria.  Carriage of the bacteria increases with age.  It is typically followed by development of immunity.  Peak carriage may occur in the 15-and-19-years age group, of whom 25% are carriers, but it is also highly prevalent in small babies and young children.  </p> <p>The impact meningitis can have on a family is tremendous.  It impacts small children, babies and young adults typically at the start of their college years or whatever.  It can be a sudden loss for those involved.  It is important that there be national awareness campaigns at local level, at schools and universities and across society so people are aware of the disease, who is most impacted and the symptoms.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Act for Meningitis is a national charity based in Galway.  It aims to raise awareness and educate society about the signs and symptoms of meningitis, while offering free support services for those affected by the disease.  These support services are tailored to the needs of the individual or the family to find the most appropriate and beneficial service for them.  Act for Meningitis is a national charity, although it is based in Galway.  It has been turned down for the scheme to support national organisations on nine occasions.  It has applied to the HSE under different types of funding.  It is so reliant on donations and events that impacted families might engage in.  The support services it provides are hugely important for bereaved and impacted families.  It needs a reliable source of funding to ensure its services continue.  The organisation is 11 years in existence since last July.  It has no sustainable income.  Pre Covid, 68% of its income came from private fundraising and it is now down to 22%.  It is looking for sustainable funding to ensure its valuable work in raising awareness nationally about this disease can continue, to keep the show on the road and provide supports for impacted families.</p></speech>

I am acutely conscious of some families that were recently bereaved, including the family of a beautiful young girl in my constituency.  As I speak here today, I am very conscious of the families left behind.</p> <p>The HSE has recently investigated a number of cases of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia.  Meningitis is a serious illness involving inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.  It can be caused by a variety of different germs, mainly bacterial infections and viruses.  Bacterial meningitis, identified in recent cases, is less common but usually more serious than viral meningitis and requires urgent treatment with antibiotics.  Bacterial meningitis may be also be accompanied by septicaemia or blood poisoning.  These bacteria live naturally in the nose and throat of normal healthy persons without causing illness.  The illness occurs most frequently in young children and adolescents, usually as isolated cases.  Bacterial meningitis or septicaemia requires urgent antibiotic treatment.</p> <p>In Ireland, most meningococcal infections occur in winter and early spring.  Meningococcal disease may occur at any age but sporadic infection is most common in infancy and early childhood, with a second smaller peak of incidence in adolescents and young adults.  The HSE advises that if people have any concerns, they should contact their GP in the first instance but ensure that medical expertise is sought quickly.</p> <p>Vaccination plays a central role in disease prevention.  The meningococcal B vaccine and the meningococcal C vaccine are offered to children in Ireland as part of the primary childhood immunisation programme.  Protection against meningococcal C disease reduces over time so a booster dose is recommended for children in first year of secondary school, and age equivalent special school and home-schooled students, to provide additional protection against meningococcal C disease.  It is vital that parents check that their children are up to date regarding the recommended vaccinations.</p> <p>The HSE raises awareness around the signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease and the importance of children receiving the available recommended meningococcal vaccines to protect them from the most common meningococcal disease in Ireland.  World Meningitis Day takes place annually to help raise awareness around the disease.  This year's event took place on 5 October.</p> <p>I take on board the Senator's point about Act for Meningitis.  We are all in agreement.  I know it is a decision everyone makes for themselves but vaccination is so important.  As children grow older, we have to be aware of the symptoms that can present.  I have heard of Act for Meningitis.  I will look into the reasons the organisation has been unsuccessful on so many occasions with regard to funding.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is very hard to raise funds.  Many organisations were very good at raising funds prior to Covid-19 but it has really challenged them recently.  Sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004 provide for the HSE to provide funding for agencies to deliver services on its behalf.  There is, therefore, a funding stream in place.  That includes funding across a range of care areas including a number of organisations that provide bereavement support services to families.  All these details are available on the HSE website.  I take on board the Senator's point, however.  These recent cases frightened many people; they are worried.  People want a dedicated source of information at which they can look.  I will certainly raise the issue with regard to Act for Meningitis.</p></speech>

We all unfortunately know of people who have suffered bereavements.  As I said, it is heartbreaking for families because it happens so suddenly, particularly in young adults.  The awareness is not just in that person but in his or her cohort.  Their friends might say there is something wrong and it is serious and this person needs help.  It can happen, and hours can be critical in diseases like this.  I would certainly welcome if the Minister of State could take the issue of Act for Meningitis up with the relevant section in her Department.  As I said, it has an office in the Ballybane area in Galway city.  I would appreciate if she could get back to me regarding a sustainable source of funding if that is possible.  The organisation does valuable work across the country.</p></speech>

As we know, meningitis is also covered during the promotion of European Immunization Week in April every year.  If the Senator does not mind, he might drop me a quick email with regard to this and I will certainly have it looked at through the Department.  Volunteer organisations do a huge amount of work.  It is very important that we try to support them as best we can.  I will certainly have it looked at for the Senator.</p></speech>

I am glad to have the Minister of State with us as well.  I would like to take this opportunity, which is the first I have had, to congratulate him on his new appointment.  As they say, no better man for this job than his good self.</p> <p>I would like to talk to the Minister of State about a new IDA advance technology building that has been completed in County Monaghan.  The new 1,400 sq. m building was built at the IDA Business and Technology Park just outside Monaghan town at Knockaconny.  It has ancillary office space over two floors.  Advanced technology buildings, which are referred to as ATBs, are designed to facilitate a change of function to advance office buildings, if required.  They also have 100% expansion capability, which is a very good feature.</p> <p>The IDA said these ATBs offer ready for occupation, high-specification flexible and sustainable property solutions suitable for high-value manufacturing and global business services to support the winning of investment from foreign direct investment clients.  The Monaghan development is part of IDA Ireland's wider regional property programme, the objective of which is to develop property solutions in regional locations across the country in places such as Monaghan.  The initiative is vital in supporting the Border region in particular because in the past, the region has been left behind.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This new facility must now help to attract more investment to a county and region that has previously had to fend for itself.  I am aware that advertisements to potential investors began when the building was completed towards the end of last year and that is an ongoing process.  I am also informed that the IDA is actively promoting this facility across 24 offices across the globe.  I hope that the IDA can find an investor with long-term potential and one that has the potential to grow even further. </p><p>County Monaghan and the Border regions have for far too long exported their children to the capital city and further afield.  It is interesting to note recent statistics, which state that Monaghan has in more recent years had one of the highest levels of young people going to third-level institutions of any county in the State.  However, unfortunately, many of our young people who graduate have no work in their native county to return to.  That is something that we need to address.  That is why a county like Monaghan is long overdue some foreign direct investment.  I believe that this facility has the potential to kickstart that development.  I appreciate that the Minister of State may be curtailed in what he can say to us this afternoon, but I am hoping that he might be able to outline what progress has been made to date by the IDA in trying to find a tenant.  How many site visits have there been?  Hopefully, as a result of those site visits, we might have some positive news for the county shortly.</p></speech>

Total employment in IDA client companies now stands at 275,384, which was up over 29,000 on the 2020 figure.  Growth in the regions was particularly buoyant, with 53%, or 133 projects of the 249 investments won by IDA, going to regional locations.  Employment growth was recorded in every region of the country in 2021 and our agencies are currently finalising the 2022 employment survey with a view to publishing it before the end of this year.</p> <p>Monaghan is marketed by the IDA as part of the wider Border region made up of the counties of Donegal, Cavan, Sligo, Leitrim, as well as Monaghan.  There are currently eight IDA-supported companies in Monaghan employing 430 people.  The FDI performance in the Border region has been strong over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 18% as traditional strengths in sectors such as engineering, industrial technologies and medical technologies were complemented by new investments from the technology, international financial services and life science sectors.</p> <p>Key to that success is strategic collaboration with national and local stakeholders on the enhancement of the regional value proposition.  The existing FDI-based companies in Monaghan enjoy strong collaborative links with several third-level colleges including Dundalk Institute of Technology, the Technological University of the Shannon and the Atlantic Technology University.  IDA Ireland is committed to ensuring a good supply of suitable property solutions to be available for FDI in regional locations and as such the agency has a network of business and technology parks across every region to support both IDA and Enterprise Ireland client companies. </p> <p>As the Senator said, IDA&rsquo;s business and technology park is located on the outskirts of Monaghan town, which is an 80-minute drive from Belfast City Airport and from Dublin Airport.  The park comprises 17 ha and is fully landscaped.  The development of the advance building solution in Monaghan was part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s wider regional property programme.  The programme is funded by the Government with an extra &euro;20 million this year.  Completed in 2021, this building is located in the IDA park and offers additional IDA lands adjoining the site offering opportunities for expansion subject to planning.  The building includes a technology or manufacturing space and two-storey accommodation. </p> <p>I am advised that the IDA has regular engagement with client companies and stakeholders in the county and this will continue both towards the end of 2022 and throughout 2023.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Dara Calleary:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2201"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->IDA Ireland will continue to market Monaghan and the wider Border region through its overseas offices, as referred to by the Senator, to target mobile FDI and will arrange corresponding site visits as required.

I have no doubt he and his office will leave no stone unturned to ensure we find a suitable client for this state-of-the-art facility.  Monaghan has shown, through indigenous industries, whether in engineering with Combilift or in food with Monaghan Mushrooms, that we can be world leaders in whatever field we choose.  To date, unfortunately, foreign direct investment has been a stranger to our shores, so we hope that with this facility, and with the Minister of State at the helm, we will push all we can to ensure we get a suitable tenant here in order that our young people and graduates, who heretofore have been forced to travel, will have the option to come home to work in their chosen occupation, in line with their qualifications, in a facility located in their own county.</p></speech>

Its construction is a major win for Monaghan.  Having a site that is ready for go for any potential investor will put it well ahead of other locations.  As the Senator noted, there is a proud tradition of enterprise in Monaghan, and the collaboration I mentioned with the third and fourth level institutions and the easy access to transport hubs, for both air and sea travel, make it a high-value proposition for inward investment.  I will continue to work with the Senator on promoting that and I have asked IDA Ireland to keep me updated on its efforts to fill the building.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, we are seeing a global explosion in content production, in film, television, animation and the new digital sector, and Ireland has been very much to the fore in ensuring we get a slice of that international pie.  We have an excellent film, television and animation sector in Ireland, and one reason that has been the case relates to the section 481 tax relief, which helps in financing these productions.</p> <p>It was welcome in the budget that section 481 was extended to 2028 but there was no clarity in the budget concerning the regional uplift, which allows for projects to be produced outside the Dublin-Wicklow region.  This additional relief is available to allow film and television crews to travel, but the broader idea behind it was to ensure we could build up in the regions a sustainable film and television production sector and have people within the regions who would be able to support the development of the sector.  The Minister of State will be aware that all those who are involved within the industry, such as Screen Producers Ireland, Screen Guilds of Ireland, Animation Ireland and Ard&aacute;n, which represents the studios, as well as IBEC, the audiovisual sector and SIPTU, as the main trade union, were all supportive of this because we could see the development starting to happen.  Indeed, he will be aware of film and television production that was starting to happen in his county, Laois.</p> <p>This relief is crucial, not least as we are looking at seeing a significant number of new film and television studio spaces developing throughout the country, including in Westmeath and my county, Wexford.  To ensure we have something that is sustainable until 2028 and in order that we can guarantee to the regions that there will be support, we should have, as was originally introduced in 2019, a 5% regional uplift until 2028.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This would mean that it would be more attractive to look at filming and creating new content outside the Dublin-Wicklow hub.  It would make it attractive for domestic production and also particularly in terms of us being able to attract international productions to Ireland.</p><p>We also know the tourism and cultural dividends that come from investment in film and television production when people from outside this country see the scenery on offer here as a result of what they see on their screens, it makes it more attractive.  There have been numerous reports to verify this.  I hope, while it is welcome that section 481 has been extended, that the Government will commit further to regional film and television production and to animation production by ensuring the extension of the regional uplift.  When it was originally introduced, Covid-19 was not anticipated, which interrupted the process.  Now, we need a period to allow that to bed in and allow for regional film and television production and animation to grow in a way that will support jobs in all of our regions.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for his opening remarks.  He has shown a depth and knowledge of the industry that very few Members have and he has gone through the various groups involved in the sector that participate and are involved in it.  They earn a good livelihood and income from it, with the benefit of the tax consolation relief I mentioned.  The scheme provides relief in the form of a corporation tax credit related to the cost of production of certain films.  The credit is granted at a rate of 32% and is available on qualifying expenditure of up to &euro;70 million for any project or film.</p> <p>The Finance Act 2018 introduced a short-term, tapered regional uplift for productions being made in areas designated under the state aid regional guidelines.  The purpose of the regional uplift is to support the development of new, local pools of talent in areas outside the current main production hubs of Dublin, Cork and Wicklow to support the geographic spread of the audiovisual sector.  The uplift originally provided for an increase of the credit for four years, with 5% available in years 1 and 2, 2019 and 2020.  That 5% uplift is on top of the 32% available everywhere in the country.  That was followed by 3% available in year 3, 2021, and 2% available in year 4, 2022.</p> <p>However, in recognition of the detrimental impact the Covid-19 crisis had on the audiovisual sector, the Finance Act 2020 amended the original uplift scheme to provide for an additional 5% in 2021.  Instead of being available for two years, it was available for three.  I asked about the matter that surely during Covid-19, this may not have cost the Exchequer that much, but the film sector did reasonably well during the Covid-19 period as lots of their productions were in different areas throughout the country and the sector was more resilient during Covid-19 than many others.  That may not have been anticipated at the time.  In effect, this was to replace the incentive year lost.  As I said, an extra year was given.  The tapered withdrawal of the uplift then restarted this year, with a reduction to 3% in 2022.  It will reduce 2% in 2023.  No uplift will remain thereafter.</p> <p>The uplift is an approved state aid.  The premise upon which it was notified to the European Commission was that it would be temporary in nature and would be withdrawn on a tapered basis.  If the uplift was deemed to be permanent, it might not have been approved in the first instance.  If the uplift were to be changed or retained for a further period, we would then have to go back to the European Commission and start negotiations again.</p> <p>I am aware of how the uplift was received upon its introduction.  However, there are currently no plans to increase the regional uplift rate or to introduce alternative proposals for regional-specific changes in the context of section 481.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The main film tax credit will remain available to qualifying productions in all areas of the country following the winding down of the uplift in those regions.  That costs about &euro;70 million per annum.  The Senator is aware that the Government is committed to the continued growth of the audiovisual sector.  The Finance Bill 2022 provides for the extension of section 481 from the current end date of 31 December 2024 to 31 December 2028.</p></speech>

I appreciate that he is only reading the figures given to him by the Department of Finance.  It is clear that the Department is not committed to the development of a regional film and television industry on the basis of this response.  That is quite disappointing.  It is also clear that the Department does not understand the importance of section 481 and the regional uplift.  The fact that everyone in the sector saw new productions coming into the regions that would not have happened if it were not for the uplift.  It was well-intentioned and was interrupted by Covid.  The scheme was only getting going and then it disappeared.  The Minister of State made the point that it was temporary, as agreed with the European Commission.  Did any further negotiation with the European Commission take place?  I do not believe so.  Given the fact there was an interruption, if we were to consider temporarily extending the scheme to allow it to continue until 2028 in line with the current section 481 arrangements, that would allow us to develop a strong regional film and television sector.  We must give it a chance.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Finance to reconsider this matter.  The scheme is important for the development of the sector in the regions.  The Department does not fully understand how important the uplift is.</p></speech>

The fact the Department is, in the context of the Finance Bill, extending the main relief available under the scheme for all counties for another four years is an indication that it fully supports the general scheme.  It is a nationwide scheme.</p> <p>On assisting particular regions, the Senator will be aware the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media recently announced funding of &euro;2 million for the establishment of five new national talent academies in Wicklow, Limerick, Galway and Dublin for film, television, drama, animation and production crew.  Various local authorities are active in this area through their arts offices in facilitating local projects.  IDA Ireland is working in this area to increase facilities in different regions.  In the context of the Finance Bill, which is currently going through the Oireachtas, there are no plans to extend the uplift.</p></speech>

Because of his Roscommon connections, the Deputy Leader will know what I am going to talk about, which is Lough Funshinagh and the serious flooding in south Roscommon.  The callows area along the River Shannon has flooded for years and years.  Part of Senator Kyne's county in south Galway also floods very badly.  I posted a video on social media last week in which I travelled to Clonown in south Roscommon where literally thousands of acres of land are now flooded.  The farmers have moved their stock off it.  Roscommon County Council had carried out considerable work on the roadways in the area in recent months, raising them in the hope that floods would not interfere with them.</p> <p>However, I was brought on a bit of a tour by some of the farmers up there and it was extraordinary to see the water cutting off some roads.  In light of the forecast that the incessant rain of recent weeks is going to continue, I fear for local communities.  Farmers move their cattle off the land in time because everybody understands most of that land is going to flood.  The problem we are now going to have is that households and people may be cut off.  This creates very significant problems.  We had this problem in 2016 and in 2009 so it looks like it is coming every six or seven years.  Nobody can say that such flooding is a once in 100 years event anymore.</p> <p>Perhaps the Deputy Leader could talk to the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, Deputy O'Donovan, who is very aware of the situation, with a view to ensuring that all of the agencies including the OPW, the ESB and everybody else involved with the Shannon can keep the water flowing.  When I say that, I do not mean that people downstream in Clare or Limerick should be flooded.  However, we sometimes find that gates are not opened in Meelick.  Senator Gavan will not want me to flood Limerick but we should ensure that as much water as possible is let go to avoid people in our region being very badly affected again.</p> <p>With regard to Lough Funshinagh, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, will be meeting with a local group and Oireachtas people next Thursday here in Dublin to see if a way out can be found.  All in all, it is just a question of the weather and the incessant rainfall and of the hardship and misfortune being brought to many people, particularly in the Roscommon and Galway region.</p></speech>

He turned a sod officially on the new Killaloe bridge project, which is badly needed in south-east Clare because there has been traffic congestion there for years.  I sincerely hope that we will see the Blake&rsquo;s Corner project in Ennistimon moving swiftly forward, now that it has overcome the An Bord Plean&aacute;la hurdle.</p> <p>The point about which I was most disappointed with the Minister's visit to Clare was his absolute insistence that the northern distributor road to connect south-east Clare to Limerick has no prospect whatsoever of getting funding in the short, medium, or long term.  This is most disappointing because that particular stretch of road is essential for road transport connectivity between south-east Clare, Clare, Limerick and beyond.  Some &euro;19 million has already been spent on this project and we already have the first phase of that road between Coonagh Cross to Knockalisheen open.  To have this project completely dismissed out of hand is not acceptable.  I am looking for a debate here in the House in order that we can tease out this particular issue and find out exactly why the Minister believes that this project will not happen.</p></speech>

Where has the change happened in the programme for Government?  We need clarity on that fairly urgently.</p> <p>The other issue I wish to raise with the acting Leader is the plight of the farmers on the Burren in County Clare, who essentially are the custodians of the Burren and who have done great work in protecting the environment and in ensuring the flora, the fauna and the unique character of the Burren thrive.  That has happened through State support with a particular scheme that has been developed, promoted, designed, and has been ultimately successful in European awards.  Dr. Brendan Dunford and other people have worked tirelessly to create a scheme that benefits and promotes farming in the Burren but also conserves that area and ensures that its unique international character is retained.  There is the winterage scheme and even the Burren Winterage Weekend festival, which took place two weeks ago and was a phenomenal success.</p> <p>Now, the farmers are being encouraged to take part in an agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, which is operating in part of Galway and other areas.  This is welcome in its own right but the problem is that it will certainly create a situation where farmers in the Burren will be short-changed.  Yes, it will benefit some but it should benefit all.  While ACRES is welcome in its own right, why should farmers in the Burren suffer as a result of it?  What was wrong with the scheme that this Government and previous governments nominated for and which won international awards?  What was wrong with that scheme running in parallel with ACRES?</p> <p>My call is to have a debate with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on ACRES in this House in order that we can tease out why he intends to financially disadvantage farmers in the Burren.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Coveney, replied that &ldquo;We do not have overflight arrangements with the RAF, to be clear.&rdquo;<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

Gentleman will know, however, that RAF jets have deployed into Irish airspace on occasion.  It is for the Irish Government to set out their policy on why, when and how. </blockquote><p>Today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence issued a statement.  The statement read:</p><blockquote>	We do not comment on issues concerning arrangements of national security.  The Government's engagement in international security cooperation is aimed at ensuring public safety and is conducted with full respect for Irish sovereign decision-making authority and for Ireland's long-standing policy of military neutrality. </blockquote><p>We cannot claim military neutrality if we are depending upon a third country to defend our airspace.  The issue of Irish neutrality has long been a question in this House.  Many Ministers down through the years have declared how Ireland is neutral.  We are militarily aligned with the UK, which is a member of NATO.  As a result, our airspace is being protected by NATO aircraft.<br/><br/>Article 15 of our Constitution - of which we are the guardians - states that it is the Houses of the Oireachtas that has the authority to raise armed forces.  The question of the RAF overflying our airspace has never come before the Houses of Oireachtas.  The matter has not been debated in the Houses.  Question about this matter arise today as a result of the statement made in the House of Commons yesterday.  This Oireachtas is faced with a dilemma.  Has the Minister knowingly misled the joint committee or is he not aware of the agreement that is in place to allow armed RAF aircraft to fly though our airspace?  This is a question for the Oireachtas to resolve.<br/><br/>On whether an agreement should have been entered into, the question for the Oireachtas is does our Constitution require that such a decision would come before the Houses and be agreed by them?  We cannot claim neutrality while we depend on another country to defend our airspace.  We cannot declare neutrality while we are in a military alliance with another country.  I respectfully request that the Minister for Defence come before the House to explain to us the dichotomy with which we are faced.  Is there an agreement in place?  If there is, who put it in place, when was it put in place and why was it put in place?  Why was the General Officer Commanding the Air Corps and the director of military aviation informed at the time the agreement was put in place?<br/><br/>This is the most serious constitutional issue that has come before the House in my time, and for as long as I can remember before that.  People talk all the time about it taking 800 years to get the Brits out of Ireland.  They are not out of Ireland.  They are protecting our skies.  I understand they are building a ship to protect the cables beneath our waters.</p></speech>

Some of the Members may have seen the survey published by Barnardo's at the end of last week that showed that there were times in the past 12 months when one quarter of families across this State could not feed their children.  The same survey also showed that some 41% of households have been consciously cutting back on food spending.  A spokesperson for Barnardo's stated:</p> <blockquote> 	According to our research the cost-of-living is forcing families to choose between food and other essentials, such as energy costs.  Barnardo's has seen a marked increase in demand for its services and is concerned about the toll that soaring bills are having on families' mental health. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to highlight how the cost-of-living crisis is hitting our nurses and healthcare workers in particular.  Some of them have started to share their stories on social media and I shall quote a couple of them.  One says:</p><blockquote>	I am a nurse.  I am awake all night worried.  I have three children and work full-time.  I don't even have the petrol money to get to work next week.  My ESB bill will be out on Monday.  I don't even know how I will feed my children.  What has this country come to?  At this stage I feel like walking away from it all. </blockquote><p>A second nurse simply says, &quot;I can't cope with the mounting bills&quot;.  The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has repeatedly raised concerns about the safety of staff, particularly at University Hospital Limerick, which continuously has the highest trolley numbers in the country and serious overcrowding issues.  The staff are burned out and overwhelmed.  Then they go home after a long day or night's work and worry endlessly that they will have no food on the table for their family or money to pay the bills.  This is the reality of life for too many front-line workers and nurses in Ireland in 2022.<br/><br/>A cost-of-living crisis rally will take place at City Hall in Limerick on Saturday at 2 p.m.  The protest is being organised by the national Cost of Living Coalition, with local involvement from several political and community groups, including Sinn F&eacute;in, People Before Profit, the Social Democrats, the Socialist Party, the Postgraduates Students' Union, the Community Action Tenants Union and Limerick Suicide Watch.  The Government has not done enough to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.  It has even opposed taxing the windfall profits on energy companies, which is an absolutely shameful decision.  There are solutions.  Germany is the latest country to introduce a temporary price cap on electricity and gas.  Sinn F&eacute;in has called for less than that and just a temporary cap of five months on electricity to reduce the cost of electricity over the winter period.  Childcare, rents and mortgage interest costs here do not have to be the most expensive in Europe.  There are solutions.  What we need is a much firmer response from the Government.  I call on the people of Limerick to join us at 2 p.m. this Saturday for the cost-of-living crisis rally.  Show solidarity, stand up and call very clearly on this Government to do more.</p></speech>

I apologise to the Leas-Cathaoirleach and the Deputy Leader.</p><p>I am sure that we all saw the chaos generated by the Twitter layoffs at the weekend.  Twitter laid off people, potentially unlawfully.  The situation is still somewhat unclear, with employees in the Dublin office being let know of their redundancies via email.  Some employees, a number of whom I know personally, tweeted that they had no access to their work emails and feared that they had been laid off.  There was a really terrible lack of communication regarding the whole matter.  I do not need to go into numbers, but we know that 50% of Twitter's employees have been laid off and that offices have been temporarily closed to prevent staff returning.  In Ireland, staff are entitled to a 30-day consultation process even if there is no trade union.  There is still legal uncertainty about the layoffs.  An employee who lost their job at Twitter in Dublin noticed that their password had been changed overnight.  In Ireland, it is a requirement that staff are given a formal written letter of redundancy, which Twitter failed to do.  There have been conversations on the matter involving the T&aacute;naiste.  I would like to know what exactly the Government or the T&aacute;naiste intend to do about this matter.  It is no good offering platitudes in the media in respect of this matter.  What is needed is firm action.</p><p>The second topic I want to discuss is the forthcoming World Cup in Qatar.  Amnesty International has stated that significant human rights violations have occurred in Qatar in preparation for the World Cup and has called for workers to be compensated.  It is stated that these workers have been housed in poverty-laden communities, often without access to basic amenities like running water, working sewerage infrastructure or electricity.  These workers were expected to work for up to 18 hours a day with no day off during the week.  It has been reported in <i>The Guardian</i>that up to 6,500 migrant workers may have died in the country in the decade after it won the right to host the event.  That is a serious number of deaths.  Amnesty International and other organisations have said that there has been insufficient research into the thousands of deaths of those who worked in construction in the country over the past decade and the contribution that the extreme heat played in this.  I need not even go into the perilous situation faced by the LGBT community in Qatar.  Under the Qatari regime a cursory Google search will reveal the horrors that members of my community have been subjected to.  I shall quote some words by a Nepalese worker who said:</p> <blockquote> 	You see, some families are in rented accommodation back home.  Now for eight months if we don&rsquo;t send any money, how would they live there?  Their landlord is going to throw them out of their houses now.  Right now they are somehow trying to make ends meet...  That&rsquo;s why we are asking the company, &lsquo;it is ok if you don&rsquo;t give us money, but please send us home&rsquo;.  We asked them to just return our passport and send us back. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is an extremely serious situation over there.  It is important to put on the record while we are gearing up for a global sporting event.  It behoves us to be aware of the brutal regime that lies behind this event.  Sport should be for all.  Alas, it seems that this World Cup event cares little for the thousands of migrant workers who potentially died in its preparation or indeed the LGBTQIA people who are going to be hunted and tormented as happy football revellers descend upon Qatar.</p></speech>

Galway was taking on Waterford in a League of Ireland decider match.  The match was held up during the first half because of structural issues.  Thankfully garda&iacute; intervened quickly and got all the Waterford supporters out.</p> <p>In this day and age we should not be having such issues in our stadia.  Thankfully there were no injuries in this case.  I commend the garda&iacute; and personnel on the ground.  This is quite worrying.  I have since spoken to supporters of other League of Ireland clubs and they have concerns about other facilities across the country.  It is timely that we have a debate in the House on the safety code and standards within our stadia.  It would be timely for the relevant committee on tourism, culture, arts, sports and media to have an update from the FAI on all the stadia within its brief and stadia of clubs within the League of Ireland.  I do not think this is good enough.  It is important that we act.</p> <p>It is timely that we would have a review of clubs in all sporting disciplines.  We have had enough tragedies over the years with sporting facilities and other structural facilities.  We do not need more.  This is a call to act.  I ask the Acting Leader and the committee to act.

Like Senator Hoey, I wish to express my abhorrence at what has happened to the workers.  There was no notification other than by an email.  They were locked out of their accounts and out of the place where they work.  There was no due process in terms of the 30 days' notice that we have in this country.  The rights of the workers were trampled on.</p> <p>Thankfully, we have robust employment laws which must be adhered to and followed.  It is important that we have a debate in the House on the nature of work now and on the tech industry around jobs and job security.  I very much welcome that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and Ministers of State, Deputies Calleary and English, met yesterday with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland regarding the situation.  It is important that we as a House stand in solidarity with the workers.  While recognising that Twitter is a global corporation, we do have to recognise that we have robust employment laws in this country.</p> <p>I also concur with Senator Hoey regarding the World Cup and the awarding of the contract to Qatar, especially given its denial of and complete lack of regard for the rights of people who are of our LGBT community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As we move towards the World Cup I will be calling for a further debate on how sporting events are awarded.

Even at that early stage, when social media was awash with videos of people dropping dead on the streets of China, falsely attributed to Covid-19, and fear and panic around the unknown severity and mortality rate of the virus gripped the country, the cancelling of essential cancer screening seemed to many to be an ill-judged decision.  As time went on and we learned that our worst fears could never be realised, the full reopening of these services should have been swift and decisive but such was not the case.  Repeated Government-ordered lockdowns caused further disruption to appointments and check-ups and even when these were available the chilling effect of Government and media fearmongering led to so many people ignoring early warning signs.  They were terrified to step outside of their homes to go and receive medical care.</p> <p>It is important to distinguish that Covid did not cancel cancer appointments but the Government and the HSE did.  In his comments as reported last week, the Taoiseach seemed to once again portray the mindset that lockdowns were a thing that just happened as a result of Covid, rather than them being decided on by the Government and enforced by organs of this State, which it leads.  The issue was raised directly with the Taoiseach in the Lower House on 31 March 2021 by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  The Taoiseach told him in an exchange that should not quickly be forgotten to "get real".  It would seem that the reality has finally caught up with us just in time for winter when our healthcare system, the most expensive in Europe by some metrics, struggles and falters every year, even pre-Covid.  In the months to come people across the country will receive news that they have cancer and that it could have been treated if it had been caught sooner but it was not.  I am not asking that the Taoiseach provide a miracle for those people but perhaps an apology would be appropriate.</p></speech>

I have enormous respect for Senator Keogan but we went through two difficult years with Covid and the vaccine scepticism of herself and Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is not acceptable.  The vaccines were what got us out of the difficulties we face and there was no effort on the part of the Government to prevent people from going for their necessary treatments.  The Senator needs to stop spreading these anti-science and anti-vax messages.  It is not acceptable.  Our health service responded in the best way it possibly could and vaccines were what saw us through the Covid period.</p></speech>

In Wexford we saw a number of events in the past week which were quite serious.  In my hometown of Gorey we saw extensive flooding, including the motorway being closed.  I saw the impact of what was a mini tornado in Foulksmills and Clongeen.  Parts of buildings were demolished, roofs were taken off and damage was done to concrete in a number of houses.  Unfortunately we will see more of these extreme weather events and it is important that the exceptional weather payments would be open to those homes and businesses that are impacted.  Rather than it being done on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis we will need a clear programme on how to respond to the rising number of these climate-caused weather events.</p><p>One of the other implications has been that those who live in Wexford town are under a boil water notice.

It is a very positive step forward.  We need a debate in any of the Chambers but since the Minister with responsibility for that actual issue is a Member of this Chamber, it should work very swiftly to ensure we have the appropriate time put in place to have a decent debate about the issues of forestry.</p> <p>The forestry programme has been long-debated and in particular the afforestation programme and the targets which need to be improved.  Our targets for the last decade have been appalling to say the least.  This programme has been talked about for the last three or four years and is something that is very much welcomed but a debate in the House is required and we need to also put a timeline on a review.</p> <p>Meeting with people around west Cork over the last two days in particular, it is clear there are issues pertaining to this proposed programme.  There are huge issues regarding commercial forestry and whether it is going to be affected or whether it will be adequately promoted.  There is a significant grant of nearly &euro;11,000 per hectare over a 20-year period for broadleaf planting while spruce planting is given less than &euro;4,000 over the same period.  It is about making sure we get enough commercial forestry into the system itself.  A timed review of this is important.  There is no point putting a programme in place that will remain there for the next five years and not have a significant uptake in actual afforestation rates.  We need to have a timeline so if we do not have that increase in afforestation rates, we can come back and review the programme.  I am not saying the programme is wrong but a timed review will give an understanding that it will be amended if it is not working.</p></speech>

As somebody who has gone to Egypt, has been in an Egyptian prison, and has spoken to members of families of the thousands of political prisoners who are there, it is unfortunate to see world leaders descend on Sharm el-Sheikh this week in the hope of a good outcome in the Conference of the Parties, COP27, negotiations. We all hope for good outcomes but this is clearly a practice of whitewashing the human rights abuses going on in that country.</p> <p>Instead of easing the crackdown on civil society, President El-Sisi's dictatorship has actually ramped them up.  Ahead of COP27, they have security agents and surveillance, the restricted green zone which was previously always open to the public and to civil society to engage in, has been locked down, and people's phones are being seized and their social media accounts monitored.</p> <p>I have particular concerns for the Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abdel El-Fattah who is on hunger strike.  He has been imprisoned since 2011 and there are huge concerns around his welfare as he embarked on a hunger strike and then a water strike in the past number of days.  His family do not know or cannot get confirmation of whether he is even still alive at this point.</p> <p>It is deeply disappointing that COP27 is being hosted by a country that has such a poor track record in terms of human rights violations and has thousands of political prisoners who are held in the most barbaric conditions.  I was inside the prison and met the families.  I also had my car followed by the security surveillance.  I want to offer solidarity to all of the Egyptian civil society who are not able to make their voices heard during this COP protest.</p></speech>

I encourage the Minister for Health to come to the Chamber to have a debate on this issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want the Minister for Health to come in here for a debate because we are heading into the winter.  We need to look at reality and at ways to resolve this issue.  </p><p>The National Transport Authority currently has a public consultation on proposed cycle routes in 22 counties, but not many people seem to know about it.  On the website there are very few submissions because it has not publicly advertised the fact that these routes are there.  </p><p>In my city of Limerick, I think there are about ten proposed routes.  I was looking for something else recently and discovered there was a proposed cycle lane on a street not far from my house.  I have had elderly people calling me on the phone.  One man whose wife is in a wheelchair asked that if they completely remove his parking, as they propose to do, how he will put his wife in the car.  There are many people concerned.  It has caused huge upset to some older people.</p><p>I am not against cycling.  It is a very proactive thing but people did not know these routes were being proposed so no submissions were going in.  I think the transport authority and CycleConnects wanted very few submissions so they could go to the local authorities and say they had advertised it and nobody commented.  It is inappropriate that they have not run public awareness campaigns in the different areas to highlight this.  These should be redrawn and re-advertised to let people know.</p></speech>

The town has been making headlines recently for all the wrong reasons.  A visiting priest - not a regular priest of the parish - made a number of homilies over the weekend in which he stated straightforwardly that people who are homosexual and in same-sex relationships or other things like that were living in sin.  I have no problem with him believing that.  He is entitled to his opinion.  I do not know if it is church dogma.  I am not qualified to say that.  It is a matter, as far as I am concerned, for the church.</p> <p>Certain slants in the media would give an opposite impression but he was not speaking for me, people I know or the people of Listowel.  Listowel has always been a very open and liberal community.  In results of recent referendums on the eighth amendment and equality in marriage, there was a majority in Listowel for those motions.  I say to the LGBT community to have no fears of our community in north Kerry.  We are with you and we support you.  </p> <p>I spoke in this Chamber a couple of years ago about another incident in the same church, St. Mary's in Listowel.  It had to do with the tragic story of a young girl called Peggy McCarthy, who died in labour because she was not admitted to the local health services, basically because she was having a child out of wedlock.  It is unbelievable that that happened as recently as 1946.  To compound it, the parish priest of the day refused to allow her remains to repose in the church before burial.  He locked the gate and put bars and chains on it.  That did not stop the local community standing up for their neighbour, breaking down those chains, opening the church and making sure the body was received as was right and proper.  My town is a proud and open town.  We welcome everybody and condemn nobody.  The age of Peggy McCarthy is long over and it is time that other people woke up and realised that.</p></speech>

I live in an area where we thankfully have the DART.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann invested a lot of money in putting in new DART bridges that have lifts and make both platforms accessible.  However, as often as not, they seem not to work.  It is unreasonable that just because someone is a wheelchair user, whether he or she can use the DART is at the whim of whether somebody has fixed that lift.  If using Bus &Eacute;ireann, it is worse.  People have to give 24 hours' notice before they get the bus.  It is not an acceptable way to proceed.</p><p>I recently saw a story posted by an Irish paralympian who travelled for her sport.  She is a wheelchair user.  She flew with an airline and when she got to her destination - I think it was London - her wheelchair was not to be found.  Losing a wheelchair on an aircraft is not like losing a set of golf clubs or a suitcase, however inconvenient or unfortunate that might be for the person who owns them.  A wheelchair is part and parcel of the mobility and accessibility of an individual who needs it.  They are not cheap either.  They cost thousands of euro.</p><p>We have to look at this, particularly in a situation where persons have to surrender their means of transport when they get on a plane.  We should put in place a mechanism showing that this is not acceptable from airlines, handlers or whoever is responsible.  There seems to be a dispute about who is actually responsible.  There should be a very clear penalty for companies that do not take seriously the responsibility they have as custodians not just of the passenger but of the passenger's means to leave the airport afterwards.  When a person arrives at a destination in an airplane and the wheelchair is not available when he or she gets off the plane, there must be a serious penalty to make a serious public policy statement about how seriously we take that.  If there was a proper monetary measure involved, airlines would not be cavalier about this kind of thing.  A wheelchair should be the last thing to go on a plane so it is available first thing when the plane lands.  We need to take this seriously.  We should have a debate about this.  We as a House should be putting down a very clear marker that we take mobility and accessibility seriously and that we are willing to put that on the record.</p></speech>

That is one of the things that marks us out from countries like China and many others that disregard human rights constantly.  People are free in our society to express their thoughts freely, subject to the minimum of restrictions.  The real test of our tolerance as people is our willingness to accept and take on board that people will express different points of view.  It is not the people who trenchantly express points of view that we agree with.  That is not where the test of our tolerance and liberalism is.  It is when we passionately disagree with those people.</p> <p>It is in that context that I note the publication of the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022, discussion of which is soon to commence in the D&aacute;il.  This is very important legislation.  It is important that we scrutinise it carefully.  Following recommendations I made directly to the Department of Justice, I am glad to see the inclusion of reasonable contributions not just on literary and scientific matters but also religious discourse.  That is very important.</p> <p>I also note that section 11 provides for a direct recognition of freedom of expression around discussion or criticism of matters related to a protected characteristic, where a contribution to debate or material or behaviour is solely that.  Therefore, mere discussion or criticism of matters related to protected characteristics cannot be caught by the legislation.  This is important because in striking the balance between freedom of expression and prevention of incitement to hatred in our society, the balance can be got wrong.  The UN Assistant Secretary-General for human rights, Ilze Brands Kehris, has pointed to the danger of disinformation being used as a pretext to intimidate and harass critical voices.  States sometimes get it wrong when they clone other countries' legislation in this area, where governments respond to public pressure by rushing in with simple solutions for complex problems. </p></speech>

As the Leas-Chathaoirleach will appreciate, Ulster Bank has been a very large and important financial institution in the history of this State, really since the foundation of the State.  It is a major thing for a large bank like Ulster Bank to leave.  It has been doing so in an organised, measured and slow way but the day is coming where it will freeze accounts.  Indeed, on 6 January, it will close 12 branches and another 13 branches on 13 January.  Those 25 branches will transfer to Permanent TSB into the future but all the records, files and details relating to those accounts will go back to Ulster Bank headquarters or wherever.</p> <p>I would like the Leader to schedule a debate, or suggest that we have a discussion, not just about the future of banking in Ireland but in particular, the need to draw attention for all those people who perhaps are not using their Ulster Bank accounts.  They may have had one in the past and have moved their account.  They may have opened multiple accounts when they were students or attending college at a previous time.  Ulster Bank said it will close the accounts and send the details to the last known address.  Many people may not have been using those accounts, however, and may have moved addresses since those accounts were in place.  Much more focus and attention needs to be brought to the fact that Ulster Bank is finally now freezing and, ultimately, closing many accounts, many of which are inactive.  There will still be balances on them, however, and those people are entitled to their money.  Therefore, perhaps the Leader could schedule a debate with regard to KBC Bank Ireland but also pertinently, related to Ulster Bank.  The time is now coming and it is incumbent on all of us to alert people to be aware that Ulster Bank is leaving the market.  They probably know about it but that day is coming soon.  It is important that we draw attention to this to allow people to get their money back from this institution before it is gone and, therefore, much harder to retrieve.</p></speech>

Most of us grew up or have been around rural settings and farmyards.  We would have learned our trade driving different machines and started off in tractors and all that sort of stuff.  There have been great campaigns on safety with regard to machinery in recent years but there is something that deserves a debate and that we should thrash out.</p> <p>The licensing system for younger people to drive tractors does not differentiate the type of tractor he or she drives and that is a big issue.  We see high-powered tractors now of more than 200 horsepower carrying heavy machinery and heavy loads.  Trying to stop some of these machines on the road is nigh on impossible over a short distance.  I certainly would not have a problem with a 16-year-old with little experience driving something in a field in a rural or agricultural setting where it would be appropriate.  The on-road use of heavy machinery by people who probably have very limited experience deserves consideration, however.  In particular, there should be some link to the horsepower of a tractor or machine that somebody with very little experience is able to drive.  I would have no problem with that.  Heretofore, a person would be driving little Massey Ferguson tractors and whatever else around and it would not pull the socks off them but nowadays, some of these machines are going at 40 km/h, 50 km/h and 60 km/h on the road while carrying behind them some heavy machinery and trailers.  It really is something we must tease out.  We want to encourage young people into farming.  I am certainly not a killjoy in that regard.  It would be worthwhile to debate the issue here to see where that might go.</p></speech>

Naturally, when the war broke out, they all came back to Ireland.  One of the provisions introduced by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, quite rightly, was that, because there simply was not space for these 46 people to go straight into medical courses in this country at that time, they were told they could continue their studies online through university in Ukraine but they would be allowed to take part in the practical lessons in a university in Dublin.  That way, they were getting the best parts of their education.</p> <p>Of the 46 students, 43 are now being accommodated with practical lessons in a university in Dublin, and that is great, but there are three students who are not, and they are dentistry students.  The other 43 students are all studying medicine and they are able to carry out the practical lessons.  However, the university has told three students, two of whom are from County Louth, that it has no space for them at a practical level.  That is despite the Minister, Deputy Harris, saying all 46 students or any students in Ukraine would be facilitated.  That was the message from the Department, yet the university is going against that message and it is saying it does not have space.  There are three dentistry students who are continuing their online studies via their Ukrainian university but who cannot complete their modules.  They cannot do the necessary work unless they can carry out practical work as part of their course, which the other 43 students, who are Irish citizens in Ukraine, are able to do.  I would greatly appreciate if we could have a wider debate about it or if we could write to the Minister to ask him to use his ministerial powers to ensure all universities are playing ball and are making sure all students are able to take part in the practical lessons, as was designated by the Minister himself.</p></speech>

There was a wide variety of topics.  Senator Murphy spoke about the flooding at Lough Funshinagh.  I have great sympathy for all those who have been impacted by the floodwaters there.  The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who is responsible for the Office of Public Works, OPW, has been passionate about his concerns about the planning process as well as about objections to projects, including in Lough Funshinagh.  The CEO of Roscommon County Council did much work to try to provide a solution and to get works moving.  I welcome the fact the Minister of State is to meet with a local group next week.  He is always amenable to engaging with people on the issues.</p> <p>Senator Conway welcomed the Minister, Deputy Ryan's attendance at the opening of the sod turning at Killaloe Bridge.  The Senator spoke about the northern distributor road and asked for debate.  I will ask for the Minister to attend or perhaps the Minister of State with responsibility for roads, Deputy Naughton, might attend in his place regarding that project and other road projects.</p> <p>Senator Conway also spoke about the concern about the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, held a briefing for Members the week before last, so I am sure the Minister would be happy to engage in a Commencement debate, if the Senator were to table one regarding the specific details of the Burren LIFE programme and ACRES.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell raised issues regarding the constitutionality of RAF flights over this country and whether this has been approved by the Cabinet.  I am not privy to that information, but I am sure he can have that raised with the Attorney General or with the Taoiseach.  He has also asked for the Minister to come into the House.  I suggest this is first a matter for the Oireachtas committee at which he spoke initially.  He can liaise with the committee in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Gavan has spoken about the cost of living and the rally on Saturday.  It is important and welcome in this country that we have the ability to protest and to march.  Senator Gavan did not, of course, mention any of the range of measures put in place by the Government in the budget last month, some of which are coming through now, including the doubling of child benefit, the autumn double payment, the &euro;500 disability support grant, the &euro;500 lump sum for the working family payment, the &euro;200 lump sum to people living alone, the &euro;500 carer&rsquo;s grant, the Christmas bonus double payment, as well as the energy payments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We acknowledge that all of this is absolutely necessary because families are under tremendous pressure this year.  We encounter people every day of the week who are experiencing difficulties.  Thankfully, the Government has been able to respond, and everything we have done has been done because it was necessary.  We have been able to do it because we had the financial firepower, from a well-run economy, to be able to put in place these supports for people who are deserving of them.</p><p>Senators Hoey and Buttimer referred to the layoffs at Twitter, and Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on the matter.  I will certainly ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House to talk about the state of the tech sector.  A number of concerns have been expressed in respect of announcements made in respect of not just Twitter but also Stripe and other companies.  The treatment of Twitter employees was not right and was not what we would expect from a world-renowned multinational company.  I accept there have been a number of changes in the company management over the past while and, unfortunately, we saw the brunt of that in the form of the layoffs that took place.</p><p>Senators also referred to the World Cup in Qatar, an event that is tarnished and should never have been planned for.  There has been much talk about the fact the country has had to build many new stadiums, with questions as to whether they will ever be used again, and there is the ongoing question of whether it is right to bring such an event to that part of the world, why it was chosen in the first instance and what impact it will have through lives lost and people injured.  As far as I am concerned, it is a tarnished event.</p><p>Senator Blaney talked about the events last week at Markets Field in Limerick during the match between Galway United and Waterford Football Club.  Thankfully, nobody was seriously injured or worse.  I will ask the Minister of State with responsibility for sport to engage with stakeholders in respect of sports infrastructure throughout the country and to come to the House to talk about that.</p><p>Senator Keogan argued that Covid did not cancel cancer screenings but rather it was the Government and the HSE that did so.  I appreciate there were differing points of view but the Government, through majorities of these Houses, initiated legislation to impose severe restrictions - we accept that - in what we believed to be the national interest.  We have to balance the fact that thousands of lives have been saved by virtue of what was done, including among healthcare staff, and that was the reasoning.  We had full debates and democratic votes in these Houses in respect of the lockdowns as they happened while we were awaiting the development of vaccines.  Unfortunately, judging by reports I have read, it is an international expectation that there will be delayed cancer diagnoses, which is deeply regrettable for all families who have been impacted.  I reiterate we had democratic votes in these Houses on the policies of lockdown and vaccines and we were protecting front-line healthcare staff, who were under tremendous pressure throughout the country, from Covid.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about the impact of the flooding in Gorey and called for a clear programme of supports.  The Red Cross, along with the Department of Social Protection, has initiated measures to support businesses that have been impacted in any of these floods and it has not been found wanting.</p><p>Senator Lombard raised the announcement of the &euro;1.3 billion forestry programme, which was welcome news.  I will invite the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, Senator Hackett, to address the House in respect of this exciting programme of supports for the sector.  We have historically low levels of planting in this country, and while we have seen some difficulties over recent years with regard to licensing, this will give a new impetus to planting.</p><p>Senator Boylan also referred to upcoming events in Qatar and to human rights issues in Egypt.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I think there were a number of areas, whether Iran, Egypt or Qatar, on which we could invite the Minister for Foreign Affairs to discuss issues of human rights.  I will do that.</p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about University Hospital Limerick and the unfortunate ongoing issues regarding patients on trolleys.  I know that management were before the Joint Committee on Health where she, Senators Conway and Gavan and others would have questioned them on issues and the management in the hospital that were impacting on people and the quality of care.  Senator Maria Byrne also raised proposed cycle lanes.  We have come across this in other areas as well.  Everyone says they support cycling infrastructure which is the right thing to do but it has an impact on narrow streets in terms of removing parking and through traffic.  Reducing roads down to one lane is something that one has to bring people with one on.  One must iron out the difficulties that arise and it is not easy.  We have come across that in Salthill in Galway in the past.  Senators talked about Limerick and I am sure it has arisen and will arise in other areas as well.</p><p>Senator O'Sullivan gave a very passionate defence of the town of Listowel and the happenings last week regarding the visiting priest.  The Senator spoke of the fact that people in Listowel have indicated their support for the repeal of the eighth amendment and marriage equality.  He raised the case of Peggy McCarthy which I read about over the weekend.  One would have thought it was something of the past.  It was a shameful episode.  I am always a great believer, as the Bible says, to do unto others as you would like them to do unto you.  It is from Luke 6:31 and Matthew 7:12.  So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.  Leviticus 19:18 says love your neighbour as yourself.</p><p>Senator Ward talked about accessibility issues.  The concerns about lifts might be something to raise directly with Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The majority of us who do not need to use a wheelchair in our daily lives probably will never know the challenges that people face.  For those who have to use a wheelchair every day who find these obstacles to daily travel, it is not good enough.  I agree there needs to be a debate on that issue and I will ask for that debate.</p><p>Senator Mullen spoke about the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022.  He has already been involved in initiating some changes to that legislation.  I look forward to the debate on that Bill when it comes to the House.</p><p>Senator Horkan mentioned Ulster Bank and the freezing of accounts from today and he called for a debate on the future of banking.  It is a challenge now because there are a number of account holders who have not closed their accounts.  Ulster Bank indicated a long time ago that it was leaving the country.  There should be a debate on the future of banking and I hope that people are given the time and space to ensure that they have alternative arrangements for their accounts.  Senator Horkan raised valid points about people's last address, which they might not have updated, and that they do not want a cheque from a closed account arriving at an address at which they are no longer living.  That is important.</p><p>Senator Davitt spoke about machinery and the driving age for tractors.  It is something that I have thought about regarding very high horsepower tractors on our roads.  I might ask the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, to come in and talk about farm safety.  </p><p>Senator McGahon talked about a specific issue involving three students of dentistry who have been told there is no space for practical work.  He might raise that as a Commencement matter with the Minister, Deputy Harris, or directly.  I will engage with him or write to him.  He would have more accurate details of the issue.  I will send a copy of the transcript to the Minister and ask him to investigate this as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

It is 14 months since the plan was published and although the landscape and environment in which we are operating is ever-changing, real progress has been made.  It is important to take stock of this progress and today is the perfect opportunity to do so.</p> <p>We are seeing a combined level of commencements, completions and planning permissions that have not been seen in more than a decade.  The construction sector is growing, affordability measures are beginning to take effect and the comprehensive review of the planning system is close to completion.</p> <p>Housing for All is a comprehensive plan that covers all aspects of the housing system.  However, the aforementioned ever-changing environment, means the Government must be both proactive and pragmatic when it comes to emerging issues.  The greater range of settlements will further support the viability of developments and ensure the right houses are built in the right places.</p> <p>Housing for All represents the most ambitious housing plan in the history of the State.  This Government is committed to building an average of 33,000 homes a year over the lifetime of the plan.  Achieving this ambitious target will require enormous effort, but as I said, the progress made is already evident only 14 months into a nine-year plan.  Covid-19 and its associated lockdowns has understandably hampered the industry, but bounceback has been promising and the strong pipeline of home-building activity is encouraging.</p> <p>New home completions over the past year to the end of September 2022 stood at more than 27,500 homes, which means the new-home completions in the first nine months of 2022 exceeds the total number of homes completed in all of 2021.  In the past 12 months - October 2021 to September 2022 - commencement notices for the construction of almost 27,500 homes were received.</p> <p>The delivery of social housing is being prioritised to address the problem.  It is important to note that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has made it clear to local authorities that if there is a risk of tenants being evicted into homelessness as a result of a landlord selling the home, the local authority will be supported by the Department to purchase the home.</p> <p>We are focused on accelerating social housing supply and have a target to deliver 9,000 new-build social homes this year.  The latest construction status report from the second quarter of 2022 shows 8,247 social homes on-site with an additional 12,327 homes at design and tender stage, and 118 new construction schemes, which gives a total of 1,647 homes being added to the pipeline.  In total, the report provides details on more than 27,500 new-build social homes across 1,566 schemes.  In addition, recent changes the Minister made to the housing assistance payment scheme will help secure more tenancies and prevent households slipping into homelessness.</p> <p>Housing for All is a plan for everyone, and addresses social, affordable and private housing provision.  The secured funding will support the delivery of new social homes, with the main focus on capital investment to deliver much-needed new-build homes.  The Government is also committed to increasing home ownership, and numerous schemes have been introduced to help buyers realise their dream of owning their own home.  The first home scheme, launched in July, will support up to 8,000 affordable home purchases over the lifetime of the scheme.  Since its introduction, more than 800 applications have been received with 606 approvals issued.  This shows that the Government's determination to increase home ownership is more than an empty slogan.  We have also increased the affordable housing fund grant from a maximum of &euro;100,000 per unit to up to &euro;150,000 per unit for local authority affordable homes.  This measure is aimed at tackling the viability gap and ensuring as many affordable homes are built as possible.</p> <p>Earlier this year the Minister launched the enhanced local authority home loan scheme, which is aimed at supporting first-time buyers on low or moderate incomes who are unable to secure the mortgage they need from a financial lending institution.  Budget 2023 guarantees &euro;250 million for lending under the loan.  Since February 2018, under the previous and current iteration of the loan, more than &euro;471 million has been lent, which has helped some 2,860 households achieve their dream of home ownership.  The help-to-buy scheme is also being extended, at current rates, until the end of 2024.  The scheme has been a significant support for first-time buyers of new homes.  Since the scheme's commencement in 2017, some 35,000 people have benefitted from it.</p> <p>Addressing issues in the rental market is also vitally important.  Having good quality, affordable and secure rental accommodation is crucial to many sectors of society, be it those workers and families who are spending too much on rent, for students who need somewhere to live to further their education or the employers who worry about the availability and affordability of housing for their employees.  Housing for All is focused on tackling supply and affordability issues in the rental market.  The plan contains targets, actions and guaranteed State investment of more than &euro;4 billion a year in housing aimed at increasing supply, which in turn will help increase access to affordable rental housing.</p> <p>As I already mentioned, Housing for All commits to building more than 9,000 social homes next year.  Increasing our social housing stock will reduce the demand on the private rental market.  As committed to under Housing for All, cost-rental homes are now beginning to come into the market at scale, some of which were advertised at rates that are at least 25% lower than market rent.  Hundreds of cost-rental homes have been tenanted less than 12 months since the passing of the Affordable Housing Act last July, which has facilitated this form of rental tenure.  We are also supporting the delivery of cost-rental homes by increasing the cost-rental equity loan from a maximum of 30% to a maximum of 45% per project.</p> <p>Although these measures are vital for relieving the pressure on the rental market going forward and are a long-term solution to the problem, the Government recognises that for many this is an immediate issue which needs an immediate solution.  For those paying rent on their principal private residence, the Government is introducing a new rent tax credit valued at &euro;500 per year.  This measure will apply for 2023 and subsequent tax years.  However, the Government is providing that it may also be claimed in respect of rent paid in 2022.  Approximately 400,000 people are expected to benefit from this credit.</p> <p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will also review the operation of the private rental sector.  This review will take into account the significant regulatory changes in recent years and the Government will act on its recommendations.  It will ensure that our housing system provides an efficient, affordable, safe and secure framework for both landlords and tenants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While homes are being built at record rates and the key indicators are all positive, it will take time for the measures set out in Housing for All and the additional supply we are seeing to make the difference needed.  There is no overnight fix to the issues we face, but Housing for All addresses the root of these problems.  The updated action plan shows the Government is constantly monitoring, that the situation progress is being made, and that the plan is agile and flexible enough for immediate action to be taken when and where it is needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#GG00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is appropriate we are having statements on Housing for All at this juncture.  I always welcome the opportunity to talk about the progress that has been made with the Housing for All plan, which is building on the strong foundations which were laid in previous years.  The plan is working, despite what some say.  Is it happening quick enough?  Of course not, and of course everyone in the Government would like to see the delivery of more homes more quickly.  There are constraints in the market in terms of the ability of developers, councils, approved housing bodies, AHBs, and the Land Development Agency, LDA, to be able to scale up the delivery of houses.  However, in 2013, we were building fewer than 5,000 homes, and we are going to build nearly 25,000 homes this year.  All the indicators are positive.</p> <p>At the end of June, the numbers of home completions were up, commencements were up, permissions were up, house purchases and first-time buyers were all up and mortgage drawdowns were at a record level.  There are positive indicators of what is happening, but of course none of us on this side of the House will rest on our laurels and say we are doing enough.  We must continue to strive to deliver more homes for individuals and families throughout the country.  That has to happen across all of the delivery streams, whether it is social housing, affordable purchase housing, cost rental housing, as the Minister of State cited, or private sector housing.  No one delivery method is going to resolve the housing crisis we are in.  We must maximise delivery across all of those methods.</p> <p>Tackling the scourge of vacancy and dereliction is a passion of mine, as I know too it is a passion of the Minister of State.  We have had a number of hearings recently of the Oireachtas joint committee with local authorities, which have been feeding to us what is working well and where improvements can be introduced.  One of those is in the area of vacancy and dereliction.  Today, two councils were before the committee, namely, Waterford City and County Council and Limerick City and County Council.  Both of those are leading in certain areas.  Limerick is leading in the area of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, where more than 100 units have been placed under CPO in the past three years.  What they have done that other local authorities have not is to put funding place to underwrite the purchase of those homes.  This is something which is in the Housing for All plan, which the Government has committed to, and which we need to see rolled out so that other local authorities can take the risk in that space to be able to take on the CPO process.</p> <p>My county of Waterford leads the way in terms of the repair and lease scheme, where in excess of 150 one- and two-bed properties in urban locations have been delivered, whereas there are nine local authorities in the country that have failed to deliver a single unit.  Something is wrong there.  What is working well in Waterford is they have used the carrot-and-stick approach.  They have used the stick of the CPO and they have used the carrot of the repair and lease scheme.  They have engaged extensively with the market, with the owners of these properties, with the estate agents, with the local builders and they have actively put a team together to deliver on that scheme.  That needs to be replicated in every local authority.  One of the impediments that some of the bigger local authorities in Dublin and Cork have cited is the figure of 60,000 and the need to increase that threshold to be able to bring in units in Dublin and Cork in particular.</p> <p>We have also introduced planning exemptions for the likes of former public houses to be transformed into residential units without the need to go through the planning process.  There are examples of that in my county of Waterford.  This is a common-sense proposal which was brought forward within committee and implemented by the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Burke.  That goes to show the collaborative approach there is in delivering on schemes.</p> <p>In the time I have left I want to focus on the two issues of home ownership and capitalising on the expected underdelivery in the private rental build market over the coming years.  There is an opportunity for the State to step in as a result of the reduction in the PRS sector.  We need to instruct councils, the LDA and approved housing bodies to engage actively with the owners of sites that have planning permission.  There are a significant number of those in Dublin in particular and we as a State need to activate those sites.  We need to forward purchase those developments, or a significant percentage of them, for example 50% or 60%, to underwrite the developments and take them into ownership for cost rental homes through the Land Development Agency.  The ability to do that is there because of a slight reduction in terms of the market space.</p> <p>Another measure that can be introduced in tandem with that, which local authorities have cited at the joint committee, is the reintroduction of the enhanced leasing scheme.  I know there are some in opposition who are opposed to that on ideological grounds, but nobody can tell me it is not better to have an individual or a family in a secure, 25-year, long-term lease than it is to have them in a hotel, in emergency accommodation or in unsecured housing assistance payment, HAP, property.  Nobody can say it is not better.  Yes, there is the issue of value for money and all of the rest of it, but my priority is getting people in secure homes.  That is another way we can reactivate some of that, which the Minister of State and his Department should take on board.</p> <p>On home ownership, this Government is steadfast and my party is steadfast in our commitment to home ownership.  We introduced the help to buy scheme.  There are many who are opposed to the help to buy scheme.  In fact, I would say it is one of the main distinguishing factors between the Government and the Opposition.  We want to support young people to get their foot on the property ladder.  We have a scheme in place that provides up to &euro;30,000 to allow them to get their foot in the housing market.  The Opposition wants to abolish that scheme.  It has helped more than 860 people in my county.  It has helped in excess of 36,000 people nationally to get their foot on the ladder.  We have introduced the first home shared equity scheme.  As the Minister of State said in his statement, there have been more than 600 approvals thus far.  We are delivering on the local authority affordable purchase scheme, including in my county, where 117 units are open for application today.  Families moving into those homes will have an equity stake taken in the property by the State, which will reduce the mortgage amount they have to get to get their foot on the property ladder.</p> <p>We are therefore doing a lot.  Are we doing enough?  Of course we can do more, we want to do more and we will do more as a Government because this crisis and putting an end to it is the top priority of this Government.  It is something all my colleagues on this side of the House are passionate about.  Yet, we do not want to talk down the good work that is being done.  We can work collectively and collaboratively to bring forward other proposals, but let us not talk down the good work that is being done in the area of housing.</p></speech>

The Government's Housing for All plan was published on 2 September 2021.  It is a proposed roadmap for housing in the State up to the year 2030 and it sets out to make renting and purchasing affordable, eradicate homelessness, increase housing supply and ensure efficient use of existing housing stock.  It is the most recent instalment in a series of plans, strategies and roadmaps since 2011 which have sought to fix the Irish housing market in the wake of the 2008 recession and the austerity that followed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While the issue of housing is often described as complex, the Government wastes no opportunity to remind us that so many of the market's problems cannot be fixed overnight.  The genesis of so many of these problems is simple enough - the country went bust and everyone stopped building houses.  Indeed, the idea of Ireland being in a housing crisis is so familiar to us now, there are some young adults who do not remember a time when this was not the case.</p><p>As we reel in the years of Irish housing policy, some of the figures are shocking.  From 2004 to 2014, the number of houses built by the private sector declined by 85%.  In 2015, all of the combined local authorities in the country built 75 houses.  In 1975, 37 years ago, that figure was 8,794.  According to councillors countrywide, an unofficial moratorium on building was in place across the country, with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications giving no funding for housing construction to local authorities.</p><p>A response to requests made in 2012 for additional funding to meet local need gives great insight into the attitude of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, as it was then called, at the time.  The Department stated: "the Government has radically reformed housing policy, with a shift in focus towards leasing options, and greater involvement by the voluntary and community sector."  With no new builds, no future-proofing or planning and letting NGOs pick up the slack, is it any wonder that we now have 500 separate housing bodies competing with local authorities on bids for existing stock?  What has the fruit of all that been?  Certainly not the eradication of homelessness.</p><p>We still have more than 10,000 people homeless in this country now competing with 54,000 Ukrainians for Government-provided housing.  What changes have been made to Housing for All in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the influx of persons into this country fleeing that war?  I pointed out in March, as did many others, that we saw the writing on the wall, which this Government seems chronically incapable of doing.  It was logistically unfeasible in the extreme to commit to an uncapped number of wartime refugees.  I stated then that this policy would not serve anyone, least of all the Ukrainian people in Ireland who would be forced to endure substandard conditions due to lack of Government resources.  Once again, as with our warnings on cancer screening, these concerns were at best poo-pooed by the Government.  At worst, those voicing them were denigrated to xenophobes.  Once again, in the space of mere months, those concerns were seen to be entirely correct.</p><p>How many homes have been built this year?  I understand the goal figure was 24,000.  I got the Minister of State's breakdown today.  There were 4,100 affordable and cost-rental homes included in that figure.  How many of those has the Government built?  Yesterday, the Minister visited County Meath and opened three housing estates.  The first was for elder living.  That was bought out by a housing agency.  In the second, a private developer was building 22 homes.  That was bought out by the county council.  The third was county council land on which the council had built houses.  No affordable homes were built in our town this year.  I also understand that the commencement of constructions of units has entered its sixth consecutive month of decline.  What will the impact of this be?  How can this be reconciled with the Housing for All goals?  Those figures are in the housing audit that came out last week.</p><p>Speaking of goals, it seems like every month, a new scheme is being rolled out to play its part in tackling the housing crisis.  This is all very well and good.  Government schemes have certainly been the drivers of positive change in this country, but they must be closely monitored for their performance and adjusted where necessary.  Two housing schemes, which others and I feel are indeed an improvement, are the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe or towns fund scheme and the repair-and-leasing scheme.  The latter scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding needed to bring their properties up to the required standard for rental properties.  In return for funding, the property owner agrees to lease the dwelling to the local authority for use as social housing.  Take-up on this scheme has been dismally low.  The Minister of State informed me last year that from 2017 to the end of 2020, the owners of a mere 234 dwellings had availed of the scheme.  I am highly surprised that 190 came from County Waterford.  An increase of the funding cap from &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000 in November 2020 has served to increase interest but bigger loans need to be made available in the context of that scheme.  What would people get for &euro;40,000 or &euro;60,000 these days?  They would not get a new roof.</p><p>The Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe or towns fund scheme offers &euro;30,000 for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private resident.  Anyone who refurbishes a property will tell you that &euro;30,000 is a drop in the ocean.  Where the property is confirmed by the applicant to be derelict, that is, structurally unsound and dangerous, the Department will helpfully grant another &euro;20,000.  The problem is that a person cannot get a mortgage for a house in that state.  As a result, the &euro;20,000 is null and void.  There are amendments the Minister of State could take on board with regard to that scheme.  Perhaps that is something Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael can look at.  People cannot get the mortgages for those properties if they are in a poor state.</p><p>Housing for All states that the Government is committed to supporting homeownership.  This makes me glad, but how will this work alongside a national right to housing?  Will a right to housing entail persons being forcibly downsized in their homes, or ordered to move out so that another larger family can take their place?  It may seem like an out-there suggestion, but these are fears some people have today.  Does this Government plan for a move forward to move towards rent-for-life housing as a solution?  I attended the Respond briefing in Buswells Hotel approximately one month ago, and the Government's model was very clear.  It is going for build-to-rent housing only.  That is the only gig in town as regards providing houses.  It was very clear that this is the model of housing that will be built in this country in the future.  Does the Government plan to move toward rent-for-life housing as a solution?  Will the dilution of constitutionally protected property rights be used as a drastic measure by the Government to try to solve this crisis?  These are the questions I would like answered today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#HH00500"><p>I welcome our distinguished guest and other visitors.  It is important that they know we are discussing Housing for All, a plan that was introduced just over a year ago following the change of Government.  This is not one more in a series of other plans; it is dramatically different.  It is unprecedented in terms of its scope, ambition and comprehensive approach to providing adequate housing in our country.  It is backed by &euro;20 billion of State funding; taxpayers' money is underpinning this plan.  It is further underpinned by legislation passed in this House and in the D&aacute;il that gives power to local authorities, for the first time in well over a decade, to use State-owned lands to build not just social homes but affordable homes.  It will deliver for generations to come.  It is determined to not just eliminate homelessness, but put back into reach the possibility for every citizen in our country to have their own secure, affordable, fit-for-purpose home in a place they want to live.</p> <p>While the plan is ambitious, it certainly faces challenges.  As Senator Cummins mentioned, if we look back to the numbers in 2015, only 5,000 homes were built in our country.  We have come out of a decade of undersupply of housing.  We had two  years of a pandemic.  The war in Ukraine has led to very significant supply chain shortages.  There has been significant cost inflation and energy inflation and yet, one year on from the introduction of the passing of Housing for All, the indicators are strong and positive.  The number of planning applications for houses has increased, as has the rate of construction and completion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the first three quarters of this year some 20,807 new homes were completed.  That is more than in any year since the Central Statistics Office, CSO, statistics started in 2011.  In 2022 we are likely to exceed the target of 24,600 but that is not enough.  The plan states that we need to deliver somewhere between 30,000 and 35,000 new homes per year but this is one year and we must consider the circumstances.  In the long list of challenges I mentioned, I did not mention the delays caused by planning, planning objections, reviews in the courts and judicial reviews.  The local authorities tell us that these delays do not add months of delays to their ability to deliver social and affordable homes; they add years.  People still take these judicial reviews and object; people who own homes and land and who will never face homelessness.</p><p>The Housing for All plan is working and it is working because it is using every available resource at the State's disposal.  It faces significant challenges but the local authorities and the AHBs have to be commended on the way they have adopted it.  The local authorities have made explanations to us and Senator Keogan mentioned how, of the three developments mentioned in her county that opened this week alone, all of them were social housing.  That is not a negative and our priority should be to provide housing to those who most need help first.  The fact that the local authority was not delivering affordable housing is because until the introduction of Housing for All, the local authorities did not have the legislative basis and the framework to deliver affordable housing.  We should not be apologising to anybody for that.  The local authorities welcome the fact that they have been empowered to deliver affordable housing.</p><p>What this means in my area of Dublin Central is that for the first time in a decade on streets like Dominick Street, Dorset Street, North King Street and Connaught Street, new homes are being built, keys are being allocated and tenants will move in before Christmas.  This is also happening in Cabra, on the Cabra Road, Bannow Road and Ratoath Road.  Throughout the city and across the country, the local authorities are gearing up and using and availing of the support that has been provided by this Government.  It is questionable whether that support will be provided by future Governments but it is being provided by this Government and there is a commitment, on a prolonged basis, to use the State's resources to deliver social and affordable homes.</p><p>For the first time ever, affordable cost rental homes have been introduced.  This is a concept that had been talked about for decades but that is being delivered for the first time in this country and that is welcome.  Renters have been at the coalface of this housing crisis.  The additional protections for renters are welcome, the most recent being the ban on winter evictions, the cap on rents, the extended notice periods and the extended protections for renters.  These are all welcome but the only way we can really protect renters and ensure that renting is a viable option for people into the future is by providing security of tenure.  That is why the affordable cost rental model is incredibly important.</p><p>I want to take issue with something that was said and the way the right to housing has been alluded to because there is a commitment in Housing for All to a referendum on housing.  It is a commitment that my party supports, along with others.  It is a matter that has been debated in this House and I recall that there was almost unanimous support for it when we debated the right to housing in this House.  This would involve an amendment to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to ensure the right to housing.  It is important that this issue is debated and the Housing Commission has commenced the work and engaged in public consultation.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to update the House today on when the Government expects to receive its report from the Housing Commission on the proposition of amending Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann to include a right to housing.  It is important that the country and the State ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated and that the State is committed, on a long-term basis, to deliver on its obligation to ensure that each and every one of its citizens has access to a safe, secure and affordable home that meets the requirements of each of its citizens.</p><p>We all know the housing supply has been too low, that housing affordability is too high and that there are far too many people homeless.  Everyone on this side of the House is committed to Housing for All, not for Housing for All's sake but for the sake of the possibility and potential it has to fix our housing problems.  I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House, for debating this issue and for updating us on it.  I look forward to his reply on my referendum on housing question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#JJ00200"><p>I also welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Homelessness is a measure by which any housing policy would be assessed.  Just before the mid-term break, we spoke here about the levels of homelessness.  Back in August there were 10,800 adults and children in emergency accommodation, funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  We think the real figure is closer to 16,000 when you take into account the 4,500 people in direct provision who have a legal right to stay in our country but who are trapped in direct provision.  We must also include the number of rough sleepers and of women and children in Tusla-funded domestic shelters who have fled domestic and sexual-based violence.  That 16,000 figure would also not include those who are forced to stay with family and friends, couch-surf or stay in overcrowded or otherwise unsuitable accommodation.  That is a measure by which any housing policy is judged.</p> <p>On child homelessness, studies show that children and young people are disproportionately represented in these figures, with children accounting for just under one third of total homeless figures.  Research by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and others shows that experience of homelessness and poor quality housing increases the risk of severe physical and mental ill health during childhood and early adulthood by up to 25%.</p> <p>Rising rents, combined with increasing house prices mean that home ownership is becoming an increasingly unlikely prospect for many.  Recent figures form the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, indicate that the home ownership rate is set to fall to as low as 50% for those aged between 25 and 34.  However, the Government&rsquo;s failure to provide effective safeguards beyond the winter evictions ban for those renting means that Ireland is a precarious place for renters.  The rental sector in Ireland is often characterised by accommodation that is unsuitable for many individuals and families and Sinn F&eacute;in made renters in the private rental market our focus in a recent Private Members' motion in this House.  I too would welcome an update on the amendment to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann that Senator Fitzpatrick has mentioned.</p> <p>Ever-increasing house prices, combined with the lack of affordable and suitable rental accommodation means there is a greater need than ever for affordable social homes.  Unfortunately the Government targets are not sufficiently ambitious to effectively address the need for social housing.  This issue is compounded by a failure to deliver on proposed targets.  The issue is not just that these targets are being missed but that the Department then simply discards these units entirely.  Instead of accepting that we need to take these missed units and roll them into increased targets for subsequent years, they are just lost.  Since this Government took office, 8,000 of the promised social homes have not been and will not be delivered.  I give that figure with an optimistic assessment of the output this year.  However, the Government&rsquo;s figures indicate that just 20% of the promised 9,000 social homes have been delivered by halfway through the year.  In other words, just 1,700 of the promised 9,000 new-build social homes have been delivered.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While I welcome the Government's reopening of the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme, 300 homes is nowhere near enough.  The scheme should have been opened at the start of the year.  Local authorities are still far too slow in taking up this instruction.  The Government should go further than it has to date and issue a circular to instruct local authorities to buy these properties, subject to price and condition of them, to stop families and single people becoming homeless.  The Government must also reassess the current caps on acquiring houses from the private rental market.  The current caps are insufficient and do not take adequate account of the current housing market within which the local housing authorities are currently operating.  <br/><br/>In conclusion, the winter ban on evictions is welcome.  We had called for that for a long time.  However, it has to be met with emergency measures to increase affordable housing and social supply.  Let us use the breathing space that the winter ban on evictions gives us to accelerate and increase the delivery of public housing to meet social and affordable housing need by bringing more vacant units into stock, delivering higher quality permanent modular homes, cutting red tape and bureaucracy that is slowing down the delivery of social homes, and increasing the purchase of private rental homes with HAP and RAS tenants in place at risk of eviction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1672" speakername="Rebecca Moynihan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#KK00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming in again to debate the issue of housing.  I want to start by recognising the positives in Housing for All and the Government response.  My colleague, Senator Warfield, alluded to this.  In particular, I refer to responding to the need for a winter eviction ban, which was likely to overwhelm homeless services.  Almost certainly, there are people and families who will not be entering homelessness over this winter period as a result of the winter eviction ban.  Measures such as revising the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme from the beginning of the year regarding limits on local authorities are also welcome.  However, the Government needs to be much more proactive in sitting on some local authorities in respect of the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme.  Some local authorities are very good in the application of the scheme and others are not.  The introduction of Part 4 tenancies and the increase in some renters' rights are welcome, as is the introduction of rent limits, albeit in a hyperinflationary environment.  We have spent the last two years increasing, in a piecemeal way, security of tenure for renters, but it does not go far enough.</p><p>While we sit here and Members on the Government side laud Housing for All and say it is working, by any measure and yardstick people feel that Government housing policy is failing.  Why is that?  It is because house prices are up 14%.  While house prices are collapsing elsewhere, because of our lack of supply, our prices might slow down but they will not fall.  People who cannot afford to get onto the housing ladder will not be able to get onto it.  Renters are the most vulnerable group that we have in the housing puzzle.  Rents are up 9.2% year-on-year since 2016.  That equates an average rent of &euro;1,600 per month nationally, and of over &euro;2,000 per month in Dublin.  We are seeing rental increases of over 13% in some parts of Dublin.  Evictions have now passed not 10,000 but 11,000.  There are 3,000 children living in homeless services.  Today, on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot;, I listened to a mother who talked about how she was evicted from a house in Ballyfermot.  Anybody who knows Ballyfermot knows that it was built by the State.  This mother was evicted by a private landlord from a house in Ballyfermot and she is living in a homeless hub in Harold's Cross that is funded by the State.  She was standing outside the Springvale development site in Chapelizod which is two minutes walk from where I live.  We now know that that rapid-build development, which was promised in 2018, is not going to be delivered until 2023 to 2024.  Rapid-build modular houses that have a lifespan of 60 years were meant to be delivered.  There are problems on the Springvale site which means that the development will not be delivered until 2024.  People should be sitting in those houses this winter.  It is the same with the rapid-build developments on Bonham Street and Cork Street, which is right beside where I am from.  In Dolphin's Barn we saw the first phase of the regeneration redevelopment in 2018, but by 2028 only 44 houses will be delivered.  The plans for the first cost-rental development, on Emmet Road in Inchicore, have just been submitted.  Potentially, we are looking at the first phase of people moving in in 2026-28 - we just do not know.  It has taken six years for the plans to be submitted.</p><p>While the Government might laud Housing for All and say commencements and building are up, there is fundamentally a mismatch at the heart of the policy.  That is because Housing for All is relying on the private sector to deliver what is a fundamental social need.  We would not have the numbers of people entering homeless accommodation if we had not outsourced our social housing need to the private sector and small landlords.  It should not matter whether or not landlords are selling up regarding our homeless figures.  The reason it matters is because the tenants are people who should be housed long term in the social housing system, and instead they are being housed by the private sector.  The reason that we have delays in house building is because everything is in the private sector.  We are trying to put together and look at the pieces of the puzzle for the private sector to respond or not respond.  We do not rely on the private sector for health or education.  We should not do the same for housing either.</p><p>The fundamental mismatch at the heart of Government housing policy is that we need to move the private sector along, and we need it to respond in order to deliver what should be a fundamental human need for citizens in our country.  I welcome the progress made in Housing for All and I want Government housing policy to work because I do not like living in the midst of a housing crisis.  I do not like living with people who have to survive in housing insecurity.  As we can see, local authorities are not stepping up to the plate and increasing their involvement in delivery.  Fundamentally, unless the State puts up not just the money but also increases its involvement in it, we will always move in and out of housing crises.  While the introduction of cost rental is most welcome, countries that do not limp from housing crisis to housing crisis, such as Austria, for example, have always funded the state sector, whether it is through limited profit associations or local authorities.  In Ireland, we tend to rely on the private sector.  Unless we address that mismatch and treat it as a public service the same way we treat health and education, we will always be reliant on these shocks to the private sector.</p></speech>

Like my colleagues who spoke before me, I would love to see Housing for All work.  I believe the housing crisis is probably the largest single failure of the modern Irish State.  It is difficult to speak about it because it feels as if we are in a state of perpetual dysfunction.  The debate in this House can sometimes feel a bit like a stage play that has been running for far too long.  The exchanges between Government and us in opposition can feel repetitive, exhausted and increasingly embittered.  It all feels out of touch and distant from the human tragedy of this crisis.  We have to look at it and ask if the people languishing in homeless shelters or direct provision centres are tuning into this debate today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What about the children growing up in hotel rooms or the students commuting three hours each way to college because they cannot find or afford accommodation?  What about the people in their 30s who are perhaps living in their childhood bedrooms or in shared housing that is bursting at the seams?  They might be watching or they may be too busy mourning the adulthood they have been deprived of.<br/><br/>The housing crisis has a profound emotional and psychological impact on its victims.  It strains family relationships, which are sometimes the only thing standing between adult children and homelessness.  It creates pervasive feelings of shame, humiliation, and failure.  Adults stuck living with their parents are grateful for the support they receive, but they are acutely aware of the privacy, autonomy and freedom they are being deprived of.  It negatively impacts their social, sexual and romantic lives.  There are so many people who work incredibly hard and who are conscientious and responsible for whom home ownership is totally out of reach.  It creates a sense of defeat and futility that is incredibly distressing.  Many of the talented young people emigrating from this country every day are not doing so because of an insatiable appetite to travel the world.  They are leaving with great sadness and regret because the dysfunctional Irish housing market makes it impossible for them to imagine living their lives here.  It is so sad.  They leave behind families and friends who miss them terribly.  They are being exiled from their homes due to the compounded failures of successive governments.  I was thinking about those failures when I saw photos of Brazilian citizens living in Ireland lining up to vote in their presidential election a week and a half ago.  It seems only fair that Irish emigrants around the world are given the right to vote, in particular when the policies enacted in this House directly impact their ability to come home and build lives for themselves here.<br/><br/>As a member of the Joint Committee on Health and the Chair of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health, I cannot count the number of times I have heard from witnesses about their staffing shortages.  There are many reasons for the shortages, but a critical lack of affordable housing is a major contributor to the problem.  It is also driving the shortage of teachers.  Ireland produces many qualified and talented researchers, teachers, nurses, doctors and other health and social care professionals and we are losing them in droves.  In their absence, our ability to care for the old and sick, to support the mentally ill and to educate young people is critically undermined.  The housing crisis does not just impact on people on low incomes and young renters but also generates broader labour market and social dysfunction that spills out and impacts us all.<br/><br/>One strand of the Housing for All strategy is making housing more accessible and affordable.  When assessing whether the Government is meeting that aim, I thought about two recent developments.  First, a recently released ESRI report estimated that Irish house prices are overvalued by 7%.  This elicited a warning from developers who claimed that if house prices fell at all, new builds would no longer be profitable for them and they would cease construction.  That is a very shocking announcement.  All this time we have been told to believe the Government line that an adequate supply would make house prices fall, but all along, it has been an open secret that developers have no intention of letting the prices fall because it would hurt their profits.  Presumably, if prices did start to fall, they would make a concerted effort to obstruct supply until prices increase again.<br/><br/>Second, the Central Bank relaxed its mortgage lending rules at the same time as the ECB raised interest rates, so now people can take on more debt but they will have to pay even more interest on the larger debt.  The Central Bank report pointed out that a 2 percentage point interest rate hike could lead to households spending up to 40% of their monthly take-home pay on mortgage repayments under the new lending rules.  That is unsustainable.  We have two stories there: one that says house prices cannot fall, and another that says people may now be taking on so much debt to afford the overpriced housing that they will not be able to pay it back.  In fact, all the extra debt that is available will push up house prices even more.  Housing for All's reliance on the private developers is a fatal flaw as they are unwilling or unable to resolve this crisis.<br/><br/>I grew up in Charlemont Street tenement houses.  Throughout my childhood I remember my neighbours leaving to relocate to the new local authority estates being built and expanded in Crumlin and Drimnagh, which was then on the outskirts of the city.  These communities became the backbone of this city and produced some of its best and brightest.  They are some of the greatest achievements of the Irish State in its 100-year history.  The construction of large local authority estates allowed thousands to escape the horrendous conditions of tenement living.  They improved health outcomes, created greater educational and professional mobility and they gave some of the hardest working people in the history of this country a chance to grow and thrive.  It was a post-colonial triumph: a poor backward State marshalling its resources to provide for its people and to undo some of the criminal neglect and cruelty of the colonial occupation that had come before.  Much of this work was Fianna F&aacute;il's doing.  It was fantastic work.  It was the State-building project of a republican government.  In 2022, I find myself asking what happened.  What happened to the party that built Ireland's local authority housing and lifted people out of poverty?  What happened to the party that my family, like most working-class families in Dublin, voted for?  I believe the housing crisis is the result of a failed economic orthodoxy and the neoliberal ideology shared by all the parties in government.  They are treating housing as an investment vehicle to enrich the wealthy rather than as a human right and an essential social good.  This State responsibility has had disastrous consequences which reverberate through the lives of ordinary people.  The <i>status quo</i>has failed.  There is an alternative.  I hope the Government will change course soon and that we can begin to repair the damage done.</p></speech>

I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss housing, and more particularly Housing for All.  When we mention figures and data from a Government point of view, they are factual, accurate and realistic, unlike those of the major Opposition party, whose policy would not stand up to any scrutiny.  Its policy is composed of slogans with no depth at all.  We must take a quick look back at what has been achieved since the publication of Housing for All.  Some critical pieces of legislation were passed prior to it, which underpin the delivery of housing under the Housing for All strategy.  In the previous D&aacute;il, we had the heads of the Bill to set up the Land Development Agency.  At the time, many of us in the House had major reservations about it, but by the time it was adopted in this D&aacute;il, the Bill was completely and utterly unrecognisable from the heads of the Bill that were first introduced.  The key component of it is to deliver public housing on public land, specifically in cities where almost 100% of public land will be used for public housing - social, affordable and cost rental.</p> <p>We delivered the most comprehensive piece of affordable housing legislation in the history of the State.  It had four key elements in it: the increase in the Part V back to 20%; the new shared equity scheme; the local authority affordable housing scheme; and the cost rental element.  For the first time, the Minister secured a multi-annual capital budget of &euro;4 billion per annum.  That was never done before.  Housing for All was published with the intention of delivering 300,000 houses, including 90,000 social houses.  I accept they will be delivered through a different mechanism to how they were previously delivered, but we will be delivering 90,000 social houses and 54,000 affordable and cost rental houses.  It is the largest State intervention in the housing market in history.  We are intervening to the extent that every second home built in Ireland today will be built as a result of State intervention.</p> <p>Let us look at what Sinn F&eacute;in's recent housing budget was going to do.  Senator Warfield mentioned the downturn in homeownership.  We had better not put Sinn F&eacute;in in or nobody will own a home.  Sinn F&eacute;in would scrap the first home scheme.  The first home shared equity scheme would be scrapped.  Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe would be scrapped.  Any measure that was to be put in place to help people own their own home was going to be scrapped by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The party is going to remove the four-stage process for the delivery of social housing and get local authorities to build housing directly, and Sinn F&eacute;in is going to do it by 2023.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat Casey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are going to build more houses with less money.  Somebody tell me when a local authority last directly built a local authority housing scheme.  Sinn F&eacute;in is magically going to do it overnight.</p><p>The other one I have real fun with is every time Deputy John Brady is on the radio saying that Sinn F&eacute;in is going to build real houses.  My God - Sinn F&eacute;in is going to build real houses.  What about the 24,600 houses we have built this year?  Do they not have windows and doors, kitchens, living rooms and bedrooms?  Are there not 24,600 families living in them?  There are.  What does Sinn F&eacute;in mean by its slogan to the effect that it will build real housing?</p><p>These are the things we must take into account when we look at Housing for All.  We are seeing increases in housing delivery, planning applications and commencements on a sustainable basis. Housing for All is working.  We are gradually building sustainable growth within that policy.  It must be maintained and be kept in place.  I would take this sustainable growth any day ahead of Sinn F&eacute;in's school of house building headed up by the wizard that is Deputy &Oacute; Broin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.123" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#MM00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House.  It is very good to see the progress being made.  In the area in which I live, I see progress on the ground.  I see houses being built.  There are 40 local authority housing units being built at a turnkey development.  Galway County Council took that project on.  I live in an area where there is a huge demand for housing and for rental properties, which cannot be found anywhere at the moment.  We are in dire need.  The challenges we face particularly relate to HAP.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has looked at options in the context of supporting families benefiting from HAP.  The social housing thresholds in County Galway have increased from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000.  This is a welcome development.  It is probably overdue because it was needed.  I welcome that five counties have seen that change in the income thresholds for social housing.  The increase means that we are going to see more people coming onto the housing waiting lists but it is much needed because of the cost of rent and everything else.  So many families are dealing with receiving HAP and then paying the difference basically for renting homes.</p> <p>It is absolutely crucial that building happens.  We are seeing local authority and social housing being built, but we also need to see a mix of affordable housing and housing for first-time buyers.  As Senator Casey mentioned, the first home scheme is absolutely crucial, as are the help-to-buy and Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe schemes.  There schemes are particularly focused in rural and regional areas where there are many vacant properties.  Dublin city centre may not face the same level of vacancy.  The turnover is so fast but rural areas face a situation where many properties are left abandoned for a variety of different reasons.  What we want is a thriving property market in rural areas.  That means looking at all types of properties and bringing those that are vacant back into use.  I would like to see more supports for the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme.  I would also like the scheme to be expanded.  It has already been moved out of the town centres to include many adjoining areas.  That is a good and positive move forward.  It is absolutely crucial to support first home buyers, particularly if they are going to make the houses they purchase their principal residences.</p> <p>We are trying to get homes to the B2 rating recommended by the Sustainable Energy Authority Of Ireland by means of retrofitting.  There are many supports available, but there is major expense involved.  How do we combine all of the programmes relating to retrofitting, the warmer homes scheme, the one-stop shop, and the first home and help-to-buy schemes in order to support first-time buyers?</p> <p>I am very happy with the rental credit introduced by the Government in the budget in respect of people who are renting.  To be clear, the rental credit is for this year, 2022, and next year, 2023.</p> <p>I mentioned Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and the first-time buyers scheme.  I want to see supports for local authorities.  The Minister has brought in housing teams that are allocated to local housing authorities to support them in delivering the strategies relating to Housing for All.  Support is needed, particularly in the context of shared equity, the first home scheme and the shared equity programme with local authorities.  A person who is living in their home will have access to a shared equity option from the local authority.  This will only be returned when the person sells their home or when it is no longer their principal residence.  It is a fantastic opportunity for people to get onto the property ladder, but we need supports for the local authorities.</p> <p>Galway County Council is among the least funded local authorities.  It is obliged to deal with - in geographic terms - the second largest area in the country.  Along with having thousands of miles of road to maintain, we need to look at the provision of additional houses.  This comes back to Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, vacancy and dereliction and how we support families to be able to get onto the property ladder. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.  I thank the Minister of State for his time.</p></speech>

I thank him, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke and the Minister for the work they have done since coming to office.  We can talk until the cows come home about this matter.  Those in opposition can criticise us and we have a go at them, but there is a reality to the discussion of Housing for All.  Facts speak louder than anything else.  It is very difficult to listen to some of the Trump-speak coming from the Opposition.  There seems to be a policy to the effect that if they keep talking down Housing for All, people will actually believe what they are saying.  The reality is that the delivery on the ground is being seen.  I understand the frustrations, and we hope to facilitate much more in the years to come.</p> <p>If you sit back and look at the enormity of the reform of legislation and policy coming from the Custom House, it is completely unprecedented.  Never has there been such an overhaul of policy relating to housing, water and sewerage issues across the country and problems with mica in Donegal and other counties.  The reform has been astronomical in scope and is extremely welcome.  The major reforms in planning laws and guidelines under the national planning framework, includes: the overall and review that is taking place of An Bord Plean&aacute;la; the streamlining of county development plans; regional and spatial economic strategies proposing to extend the lifetime of county development plans to ten years - with built-in reviews; the proposed streamlining of a planning consent process, with specific timelines for decisions; and the schemes introduced by the Minister to resolve the issues in towns across the country where planning was being stopped because of sewage issues.  All of these deal with real issues in respect of which there have been barriers.</p> <p>I listened to the some of those in opposition talking about local authorities.  Our local authorities were taken out of the equation for nearly ten years.  That is a big part of the reason we are where we are today.  I take issue with what Senator Moynihan said regarding local authorities.  If local authorities do not deliver housing, we cannot get to where we need to go.  That is the reality.  Anybody who says otherwise does not really know what they are talking about.  I say that with the greatest respect.  Our local authorities were key to delivery in past decades, a matter to which Senator Black referred.  We are now rebuilding what was lost in that regard.  Housing for All has been in place for 14 months and our targets are being met.  We will probably exceed them this year.  That is a massive turnaround, but I have not heard any proposition here that will lead to anything better.  I have heard no propositions at all.  What is coming from the Opposition is absolute nonsense.  The reforms that have been made are the only show in town.</p> <p>On regulation in respect of pyrite, this is a matter that the Minister is proposing to tackle in the year ahead.  That is very welcome because this issue is completely pertinent in the context of my county, Donegal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall Blaney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Minister put time and effort into dealing with the mica issue.  It is a massively complex issue and we hope to see those regulations put into being and a scheme up and running in the next few weeks.  People in Donegal are waiting for that.  There was a lot of talk in recent months about foundations.  Many of these houses need refurbishment or demolition.  It is funny that we have yet to identify a foundation in Donegal that has the problems that some in the Opposition claim they had.  Claims were made by scientists and others who were asked to pass on the information about these foundations in Donegal to help with the review of IS465.  It has still not appeared. These scientists are great on a certain given day but when they go blazing off in the sun and neither they nor their data can be seen again, it is a poor reflection on them and those that portrayed their agenda.  We look forward to the resolution of all these issues.  County councillors in Donegal are working closely with management to ensure Donegal meets its targets, and I hope all politicians are doing the same in their respective counties.</p><p>I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours.</p></speech>

I do not know where to start as some extraordinary contributions have been made.  I will try to deal with those and then suggest some positive contributions from our side.  It is a pity Senator Cummins is not here.  His speech was quite extraordinary.  He spoke of the strong foundations laid by the previous Government.  I do not know whether Senator Cummins is considering a career in stand-up comedy but he certainly has the lines to make a good start.</p><p>What we need from Fine Gael is an acknowledgement it has been in power for 12 years.  The housing crisis happened entirely under its watch.  It is not a natural disaster nor is it like an earthquake or a hurricane.  It is a direct result of failed Government policies under the direction of Fine Gael for 12 years.  It would be good if just once we would hear someone from Fine Gael acknowledge that it has failed the people fundamentally and that is why we have a housing crisis today.  That is a fact.  That is why 10,800 people are homeless.  It is why 3,000 children are homeless.  It can be tracked back to ideological thought on Fine Gael's part, to neoliberalism, where the party decided to stop building houses, to outsource it to the private sector and to use RAS and HAP.  What did that do?  It crowded out the marketplace, which means that today people cannot afford to buy houses because Fine Gael has driven the prices up with its failed policies.  Not once have I heard anyone from Fine Gael hold their hand up and say they are responsible as they have been in government all this time.  It is not an accident.  It is bad policy design consistently put in place by Fine Gael.</p><p>My friend Senator Casey always makes a colourful contribution but I must point a few things out to him.  The first is that the Government is not delivering on its target.  I ask the Minister of State to give a straight answer on this when he responds.  How many social houses will the Government build this year?  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, could not tell us last week.  Strangely, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, was in the House three weeks ago and he insisted - he said he wanted to correct the record - that the Government will meet its targets on social housing.  Funnily enough, the Minister, Deputy McGrath, stated last week that the Government will not meet those targets.  Will the Minister of State provide some clarity on that, please, because we know the Government will not meet the targets?</p><p>There was a devastating critique in <i>thejournal.ie</i>yesterday that compared Department data with the Revised Estimates.  It showed major gaps between how money was spent as of the start of October and annual targets.  This speaks directly to the false claim that the Government will spend &euro;4 billion on housing.  It has not happened this year.  It will not happen this year.  Let us go through the figures we have. <b></b>A total of &euro;568 million<b></b>was spent on local authority and approved housing body new builds and acquisitions.  That is approximately 37% of the &euro;1.53 billion budgeted for the year.  The capital advance and leasing facility, CALF, spent &euro;95.25 million.  That is approximately 31% of the targeted budget.  The capital assistance scheme, CAS, spent &euro;59.66 million, which is about 62% of the targeted budget.  The cost rental equity loan programme spent &euro;22.6 million, which is approximately 32% of its &euro;70 million budget.  The affordable housing scheme had only spent &euro;1 million at the beginning of October, which is less than 2% of its &euro;60 million budget.  The figures are available.  They are the Government's own figures and they tell us it will reach nowhere near the &euro;4 billion it tells us it will spend this year.  Here is the problem.  The Government will not reach its targets and its targets were not high enough in the first place.  The Government's think-tank, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, told the Government it was spending only half of what is required to tackle the housing crisis.  It is failing on both counts.</p><p>In the short time available I will make a few key points, if I may.  Local authorities have a big issue with caps.  There is not enough flexibility.  I will give a concrete example.  In Limerick, the cap on buying a one-bedroom apartment is &euro;150,000.  The councils cannot acquire apartments because they cost &euro;220,000.  The caps are not in tune with the marketplace.  Similarly, for two and three bedroom apartments the caps are not enough, especially when the housing needs to be reconfigured, for example, for people with disabilities.  The Government needs to look at those caps urgently.</p><p>It needs to lift the income thresholds.  This is bizarre.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, had a report on his desk last December.  Now he is undertaking a scoping exercise.  The Government is already halfway through its term.  At what point will it address the fact that thousands of families are completely excluded from housing by these limits the Government still has not reviewed and revised?</p><p>The final point I will make is that planning and red tape are issues of concern.  It should not take 12 months to go through a four-stage planning process.  It frequently takes longer than that and, again, the Government is in power for the past two years and has done nothing to tackle that.  On so many grounds, this Government is failing people.  The facts, and people know the facts, are that house buying and renting are becoming exorbitant to the point where people are looking to leave the country.  That is the legacy of this Government.</p></speech>

The challenges we faced were immense.  Did we get everything right?  I am not saying we did, but certainly we are not responsible for everything that is wrong or has been wrong in housing in recent years.  We had a lot to deal with.</p> <p>In the four and a half years between the time the Rebuilding Ireland plan was launched in the summer of 2016 up to the election, more than 83,500 new homes were built.  Fine Gael in government passed new legislation regarding rent pressure zones, RPZs, and more power to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  The help to buy scheme that was highlighted by Senator Cummins has been a major success.  More than 36,000 first-time buyers have benefited from the scheme the Senators want to get rid of.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, which has been renamed the local authority home loan scheme, provides home loans to people, and 1,640 first-time buyers benefited in that period.  In addition, schemes such as the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, have assisted.  For example the new town of Clonburris in Dublin, which will provide 8,700 new homes, has received &euro;186,000 from that initiative which came about under Fine Gael.  There have been many successes in this and Housing for All is an excellent plan.  It carries on many of the initiatives that were included under the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  Many of the projects that have been delivered and are now open or are having their tapes cut, as it were, were initiatives under Rebuilding Ireland.  I have visited some of them.  Some are ongoing and it is hoped some will be opened by the Minister or a Minister within those areas as well.</p> <p>As someone who has fully supported unpopular social housing developments in communities, I take exception to this ideological bullshit that I hear about Fine Gael.</p></speech>

I have said on numerous occasions that all communities should have an element of social housing for people.  There are thousands of people across this country who will never be able to afford their own home.  I do not believe in long-term renting.  It would be okay if there was secure long-term renting but I have come across people in their 60s, coming into retirement and coming up to pension age who have not got security of tenure in this stage of their lives and are looking to get onto the social housing lists.  Council housing or social housing is absolutely imperative.  We could have all of the debates in relation to numbers, sizes and whether it should be mixed or whatever else but social housing is an important part of the fabric of this country.  I do not buy this ideological stuff.  There are people in low-paid jobs, whether they be in retail or hospitality, who, if they continue on lower-paid jobs throughout their lives, will never be able to afford a house.  It is important that social housing is provided.  I will defend the right to and the need for social housing at any stage, to anybody.</p><p>If the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, was to ask every Senator and every Deputy to provide a silver bullet or some initiative, one that many small builders have said to me on many occasions is equity.  It is about the finance to build the housing estates initially.  Prior to this, builders had worked on the basis that if they built a housing estate, they would get the profits from that and then reinvest into the next estate.  Many builders went bust and they may now be unable to secure the level of finance to build that first estate, to get the profits to reinvest in the next estate.  I am talking about the smaller builders who might build ten, 15 or 20 houses in an estate in a small town or village in rural Ireland.  Perhaps this is something that could be considered.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Minister of State's endeavours are genuine and I commend him on the work that he does.  It is important to point out that nearly 100,000 houses have been built since 2011.  That is a fairly significant number.  Absolutely it is not enough.  Clearly it is not enough but it is 100,000 families and people who are now in a home, many of which are social houses.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, visited Clare two weeks ago, where he opened four beautiful state-of-the-art housing developments across the county: one each in Miltown Malbay and Tulla, and two in Ennis.  These will accommodate 119 families.  It is not correct to say that nothing is being done.  It is absolutely correct, however, to say that not enough being done</p></speech>

These are very important incremental steps in the right direction.  Yes, the targets are ambitious.  They probably should be more ambitious but we must be realistic as well and we have to be able to deliver as close as possible to the targets.  Unfortunately, we are looking at a situation in Ireland, which is not uncommon throughout the world, where construction inflation is at a significantly high level.  It is an awful lot dearer now to build a house compared to even five or ten years ago.  It is not just the private sector that is grappling with these costs in providing accommodation; the public sector and the State is also facing this issue.</p> <p>I want to see more done in villages and in towns.  We must be realistic.  There are pubs in villages and towns throughout Ireland that are closed and will not reopen.  Drapery shops, shoe shops and other retail units are closed and will not reopen.  In the streets of many of our capital towns, it is pitiful to see the number of empty buildings that are there and have been there for years.  I believe we need to bite the bullet, realise they are not going to be a profitable or sustainable retail offering any more and provide the necessary supports to turn them into accommodation.  Similarly, there are shops all over the country with empty spaces upstairs that remain empty because of the very tight regulations, some of which are necessary and some I quite frankly believe to be over the top.  Many hundreds of thousands of families in this country grew up and were raised over shops.  I cannot see why there cannot be incentives to encourage people who have retail space on the ground floor to turn the upstairs into accommodation.  This needs to be looked at.</p> <p>Public representatives also have a responsibility.  Senator Kyne referred to this.  I remember the hassle that Senator Kyne got by refusing to object to social housing in his constituency.  I suffered the same when I was a councillor because I refused point blank to object to social housing.  I have been a public representative for 18 years, between the local authority and the Seanad, and to this day I have never once objected to a housing development.  I do not expect that I ever will, because we need houses.  Public representatives need to stand up and show leadership and say they will not object to the building of homes for people simply because it is politically expedient to do so.  It is wrong to do so.  We have the local authorities and we have a planning appeals process.  As flawed as elements of that may be, it is better to let them adjudicate on whether it is appropriate or right for a housing development to happen, as opposed to public representatives, be they councillors or Members of the Oireachtas, deciding to object because they are being hauled before a public meeting and it is the popular thing to do.</p> <p>I call on all colleagues to take a step backwards, to show leadership, to stop objecting to planning applications for large-scale housing developments, and particularly social housing developments, and to let the local authority planning offices actually do their job.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-11-08a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022110800002#OO00600"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, to the House.  I thank the Minister of State for being here for the debate tonight on housing.  I commend the Minister and the Ministers of State in the Department on their work on housing.  I also put on record my appreciation of the previous Minister, Eoghan Murphy, who was a very good Minister in an extraordinarily difficult time.  In many ways, the developments being opened today were planned, commenced and begun in his time.  I also commend my colleague, the environmental spokesperson in the Seanad on the Fine Gael side, Senator Cummins, on his endeavour, commitment, and work, as well as his mastery of the brief.  If I heard Senator Gavan correctly, he called him a comedian.  Then Senator Gavan must be a magician performing a three-card trick, because his party's record up North is different to that down here and their record in local authorities across the country is extraordinary.  I will tell Senator one thing; they will not bluff the people any more.  It is unlike the old days when the three-card trick lads were going to matches or fairs.  This is far too serious to be coming in here and making remarks about comedians.</p> <p>The housing issue is a generational issue.  It was faced back in the 1960s.  We faced it with the National Building Agency, NBA, developments.  We faced it in the 1970s and we will face it again into the 2000s.  Let us not pretend that we do not have an issue.  There are people today who are suffering and who are not where they should be.  Collectively, our job is to ensure that those people are in adequate, proper, and suitable accommodation.  The key words are "housing for all".  In my office and in my work I do not differentiate any person.  The person coming into me who is looking for a social house, an affordable house or help with a mortgage to buy is the exact same.  To be clear, this is the Fine Gael record.  We are not the ogres being painted by some.  The proof of that is in the budgets over many years, where we increased the budget.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=08"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Thankfully, because of the prudence of Fine Gael in government and now with our partners in the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il, we have a budget for housing that will deliver and can deliver.  However it is about time we got away from the cynical sound bite of some who think they can do a three-card trick and procure housing and houses.  Then there is this thing of how we are pro-landlord, pro-developer and pro-vulture fund; we are not.  We are pro-housing people.  Let us not stigmatise and demarcate people in this House or in our politics.  We have enough of that in other parts of the world where we are creating them and those or those who have and those who do not have.  What I want to see happen is that the action plan is developed in order that we can see the Land Development Agency deliver and can see local authorities, in partnership with Government, procuring, building, and housing people.  That is why I want to see this Government succeed.  It is not because of a political motivation but because we all know friends, family members, relations, neighbours and fellow workers who are struggling with rent or getting mortgages or being able to get on to the housing ladder.  That is why tonight's debate is important.</p><p>We need also to look at how we can tackle the revitalisation and regeneration of cities and towns.  I would love for the Ministers to come to Cork city and look at some of the derelict properties and vacant sites and the living over the shop scheme and how we can for example incentivise the likes of Barrack Street or North Main Street in Cork.  I accept there is a myriad of reasons properties lie idle and are in dereliction.  To be fair to people like Frank O'Connor in Cork who is highlighting issues and with whom I may disagree with on some points but agree on others, we need to look in a holistic way at how we can ensure we regenerate and revitalise our cities.  I know we had the urban regeneration fund in Cork but there is more to Cork than the docklands.  It is an important flagship project but I am a Corkonian, I love my city and I see Cork being the island as well, more than just the docklands.  If the Minister of State is familiar with Cork, he will get my drift.  </p><p>To conclude, we have a challenge to meet and there is an obligation on all of us to do so.  Yes, the people can judge us politically on that but let us not tell the people that nothing is happening.  Things are happening.  If we wanted a political debate - and we are in a political chamber - let us compare and contrast with the record of my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in in the North in particular and the way in which they have been in government.  I accept power-sharing has stalled but they are still there and I would like to have an honest debate on that.  I thank the Minister of State for being here.  I have great admiration for him for doing a good, quiet job in a very strong way in his Department, as are the other Ministers, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and I thank them for that.  This is a generational issue and we would be neglecting our duty if we did not prioritise it, as we have done through our budgets and our actions.  I know we have a lot to do and I accept that but I thank them for the debate and thank the Acting Chair for letting me speak.</p></speech>

The Minister of State may be aware of this and I want to let Senator Buttimer know there is an rural development fund, RDF, of &euro;50 million that local authorities can apply for through Europe.  It is called innovative actions and local authorities can apply for that in respect of urban spaces within large cities and large towns.  I call the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I will make a general comment on the points raised by Senators before I sum up.  On the general comment made by Senator Buttimer in his closing speech, I do not think we will get anywhere by revisionism or the blame game and it is critically important we work collectively to try to achieve these targets.  There is a crisis and it is a crisis we can resolve together.  That type of negative criticism, which is unwarranted in some cases, will not build a single house.  It is important we work together in a constructive way, although where constructive criticism is required that is by all means absolutely warranted.</p> <p>On Senator Cummins's points on constraints, he is correct that the indicators are going in the right direction.  Issues he has raised consistently around vacancy and dereliction are being addressed through Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, town centre first and other schemes.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been particularly strong on tackling voids.  As for the two points he raised about Limerick City and County Council on compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, I have had a comprehensive visit to Limerick city to look at the work and I would be happy to visit Cork in a similar manner to look at some of the dereliction and how they are using the CPO process very proactively.  There is excellent work being done there and similarly in Waterford on repair and lease.  That has been also raised by other Senators.  </p> <p>Income thresholds are being addressed by the Minister.  Five counties have been dealt with but the Minister will have a report on that issue furnished to him shortly by the Housing Agency.  The issue of homeownership was also raised and we also take the points raised on the shared equity scheme on board.  </p> <p>Senator Keogan raised the uncapped number of refugees and the Government has been forthright in saying we are not going to restrict numbers.  There is a war in Ukraine and people are fleeing absolute terror and horror there and that is critically important.  There are still options to house people and we need to be as generous as we possibly can be.  We will achieve our targets and will exceed targets around Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe and repair and lease.</p> <p>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick for her comments on tackling homelessness and housing in general.  She also mentioned the decade of undersupply.  I welcome the comments regarding protection for renters under the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Act 2022, which we dealt with just before the break.  Senator Warfield raised issues of homelessness and homeownership numbers, which we would dispute, as I think homeownership numbers are going in the right direction.  I thank Senator Moynihan for the positives around Housing for All.  Undoubtedly there are challenges but I welcome Opposition comments on that.  Senator Black focused on the psychological trauma caused by the housing crisis and she is correct.  There is no doubt it is having an impact on relationships, on children, and on families and we are mindful of that.  We are conscious of that and I think that she mentioned the point on leadership and I reiterate the point about leadership across the Houses.  The right to vote for the diaspora was mentioned in relation to Brazilians and it is fantastic to see them vote here.  Should a referendum be passed, we will extend the franchise for presidential elections and it is something the Electoral Commission will give consideration to and it is important we do that.</p> <p>I fundamentally disagree about the Government's overreliance on the private market.  The point had been made regarding a significant upturn in social and affordable housing that is being built by the Irish State.  It is not a neoliberal agenda or ideology of Government and we all want to achieve the same objectives.  Senator Casey raised Housing for All as regards public housing and public land and that is what it sets out to do.  It was important to see the return back to 20% of Part V provision being brought forward.  Senator Dolan raised HAP thresholds in Galway and we will look at those issues also.  On rent credits and support for local authority housing and planning teams the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has put additional staff into local authorities recognising that there is an increased demand on their needs and has put those supports in place.  Senator Blaney referenced the national planning framework and local authorities.  Senator Gavan made some negative comments, which I have addressed and again, a blame game at this stage simply will not address the issues we have to raise.  I welcome Senator Kyne's comments in terms of social housing and those of Senator Conway about not objecting to social housing.  I grew up in a fantastic local authority scheme with a large family and I think it is critically important that we as public representatives are responsible in supporting social housing provision across the country.  I also thank Senator Buttimer for his comments and I acknowledge the work of previous Ministers such as former Minister, Eoghan Murphy.</p> <p>I will move on to my closing speech if that is okay.</p></speech>

Again, these issues have been raised by some Senators here this evening.</p><p>Like all good plans, Housing for All is a living document by design.  The Government's commitment to review and update the plan on a yearly basis ensures that it will remain relevant and is flexible enough to respond to whatever issues may arise.</p><p>The first annual review of Housing for All was published last week.  We have used the opportunity to bring to the forefront a number of priority actions that will directly support supply.  A considerable amount of work has gone into the review process identifying blockages to supply that have arisen since the publication of the plan and setting out how to address them.  The focus on a number of priority actions will ensure that the Department and the Government as a whole remain dedicated to achieving the plan to provide well built, sustainable and affordable homes for all.</p><p>Although many things have changed our commitment to ending the housing crisis has not.  We will provide 90,000 social homes and 54,000 affordable purchase and cost-rental homes over the lifetime of Housing for All.  The 2021 summary of social housing assessment showed that there were 59,247 households assessed as being qualified for and in need of social housing support, a 4.3% decrease on the social waiting list in 2020 and a 35.3% decrease in the social housing waiting list since 2016.  Progress is being made and official figures show that we are helping more and more of those who need it most.</p><p>I reiterate the point that I made earlier.  The Minister has given clear direction to local authorities so that where a family or an individual is at risk of being evicted into homelessness as a result of a landlord selling the home then the local authority will be supported by his Department to purchase the home should that be appropriate.  This, and the winter eviction ban, are proof that when it comes to the extremely pressing issues that are prevalent in terms of eradicating homelessness then all options will be considered.  The plan is ambitious but, importantly, it is working as we speak.  The evidence is in the number of homes that are being built.  We are actively delivering Housing for All and the whole-of-government approach shows how deeply committed we are to solving this crisis.  We are reviewing, reforming and improving almost every aspect of the housing system and everyone involved is doing their utmost to fix the crisis.</p><p>As further evidence of our determination to solve the crisis we are taking action in response to the ongoing accommodation shortage in the private rental sector, particularly in areas of highest housing demand.  We have introduced new arrangements for short-term letting that are aimed at strengthening the pre-existing regulatory controls in this area and have been legislated for.  The new arrangements will provide that for a period of six months non-principal private residences in rent pressure zones shall not be advertised or accept bookings on online platforms or other media for short-term letting purposes unless they have the necessary planning permission in place.</p><p>We are not just reviewing the wider housing system to ensure that our targets are met.  We are also reviewing the targets themselves to ensure that they accurately reflect the growth in population.  The 33,000 average annual target was informed by the housing need and demand assessment, HNDA, tool and framework, which forecasts future housing need based on a number of assumptions and conditions.  There is a commitment to review the targets used in the HNDA tool having regard to the official census of 2022, the results of which are due for publication in mid-2023.  This review will examine the appropriateness of the existing assumptions and targets underpinning Housing for All and the extent to which these should be revised.  The outcome of this work will enable the Government to refresh both the overall national housing targets and the subsets of social, affordable and market delivery having regard to the progress already made to ensure overall housing need is met in line with the original vision for Housing for All.  This review of the HNDA tool and framework will commence in quarter 2 of 2023. </p><p>Addressing vacancy and dereliction, which have been referenced by many Senators, is also a pressing concern for Government.  Numerous steps have already been taken to tackle the problem around the country.  According to the most recent property tax returns just over 57,000 homes were classified as vacant so a little over 3% of the total housing stock.  The Government has taken numerous measures to ensure that this figure is reduced.  Local authorities are already delivering the recently launched Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe town scheme, which provides grants to support people refurbishing vacant properties.  This will encourage people to live in our small towns and villages in a sustainable way.  The Minister recently announced the ready to build scheme as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund.  The scheme will see local authorities make serviced sites available in towns and villages across the country at discounted rates for buyers who wish to build their own home.  The Government launched the Town Centre First policy in February of this year, which aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into town centres.  Vacant homes officers will play a key role in each local authority and will assist prospective applicants with their vacancy-related queries.  My Department is continuing to work on the revised compulsory purchase order, CPO, programme that will see local authorities purchase thousands of vacant homes for sale in their local area.  The team is also working on a vacancy strategy that will further empower our tackling of vacancy and dereliction all over the country.  Again, this matter was referenced by Senator Conway and other Senators.</p><p>Although the plan is a plan for now it is also a plan for the future.  To ensure that supply ramps up to a scale we need to deliver on Housing for All's ambition.  We must increase the number of people employed by as well as the productivity of the construction industry.  These long-term policies will result in a sustained level of housing output.  The T&aacute;naiste announced last summer funding of &euro;5 million over a five-year period for the establishment of a construction technology centre to accelerate research and innovation within the construction and built environment sector.  The construction technology centre will be hosted by the University of Galway and a consortium that includes some of out top universities working with the Irish Green Building Council.  The new construction technology centre will also prioritise residential construction through a number of initiatives such as putting in place structures and funding to enable innovation, and promote, develop and support innovation such as modern methods of construction, and support SMEs to develop scale and adopt modern methods of construction, MMC, for residential construction.  It will also support digitisation in the manufacturing sector for residential construction.  Furthermore, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, supported by my Department, has established a modern methods of construction leadership and integration group.  This group will support the development of MMC to ensure its adoption and improve innovation in the construction industry with a particular focus on residential construction.  The construction sector group, facilitated by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, has appointed a consultant to carry out an analysis of each component of the cost of construction of house and apartment developments.  This is being done with a view to reducing costs, including the cost of compliance and increasing standardisation.  It will also identify opportunities for cost reduction for consideration by relevant Departments and industry.</p><p>Although the publication of the updated action plan is the perfect time to look back at where we came from we never stop looking forward.  The foundations that have been laid during the first year of Housing for All have set us up for success and we will see the full effect of our affordability schemes as they build and maintain momentum.  We will also see the widespread delivery of cost rental, which is a true game changer for the rental market.  We will further tackle vacancy and dereliction, and bring thousands of homes back on to the market through Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, repair and lease and our voids programme.  Perhaps most importantly of all we will continue to implement, review and alter the plan as required.  We know what has to be done, we know we have to do it and we will not stop until we have successfully and sustainably provided housing for all.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister, Senator Hackett, my Green Party colleague, to the Chamber.  She is a supporter of this Bill and is doing her best to find a way forward for it.  That is to be acknowledged.  Since around 2012, there has been an almost 1,200% increase in imports of non-native honey bees into Ireland.  If, despite increased efforts by lobby groups to create conservation areas and to improve education, this continues, there is no doubt Ireland would lose its unique position with respect to Apis mellifera mellifera.  The continuous imports of other sub-species, which do not survive our winters and need to be continuously minded by beekeepers, interrupts the adaptation of our native bees to the unique conditions in Ireland, generating hybrids that do not have the same characteristics of the native bees that have evolved here.  Continued imports mean that even those hybrids here now will not have the opportunity of adapting because each year new bees come in for long enough to mate with local bees and cause disruption to the traits that have emerged in local areas to cope with local environments.  We will end up with a population of primarily crossbred bees, as has happened in the UK and elsewhere.  That may forever require beekeeper assistance because they cannot survive in this environment anymore.  We will see a huge loss of genetic variation in an already endangered sub-species.  Our wild honey bees would also struggle to survive this onslaught.</p> <p>In 2020, an increase of-----</p></speech>

We have a wonderful gathering of Senators in the Seanad, including the horticulturist, Senator Murphy, and Senators Higgins and Wall.  On the front line, we have more than 500 beekeepers in our county.  I thank the people in the Gallery who have come in this evening.  I also thank Senator Maria Byrne from Limerick, which is famous for traditional beekeeping.</p> <p>It is not over yet; we have to keep the pressure on, but so far so good.

I had highlighted this issue more than a year and a half ago, having been alerted by beekeepers throughout the country who were very concerned.  I appreciate what the Senator is doing here and I fully support it, as do our party members.  We should never underestimate how important the bee is to our lives and, sadly, that is underestimated in life.  Students in every school should be taught about it.  Pollination is very important to the production of food.  We will continue to support the Senator.  I also congratulate the beekeepers, because if they had not kept getting on to us, this would probably would not have happened.</p></speech>

I compliment Senator Martin on introducing a very worthwhile Bill.  I have had contact from beekeepers from Limerick, Tipperary and Murroe.  I know some of the issues Senator Martin raised are of concern to beekeepers.  I look forward to working with the Senator on the matter because I know a number of issues need to be addressed.  I hope the Minister of State and her team will be able to work on those.</p></speech>

I am also very happy to be one of the co-sponsors of the Bill.  We have taken our lead in not expanding on the different sections.  The key point is that, if this keeps moving through, it is an opportunity to ensure we deliver protection for the native Irish honeybee next year.  It is important we complement that with really strong measures in protecting the habitat.  In that regard, we need to look to our hedgerows and pollinator plants, including in urban areas.  It is vital for our ecosystems as well as for our horticulture.  We certainly do not want to end up with bees becoming an input like seeds or fertiliser.  This is something that is part of the fabric of Irish life.</p></speech>

His honey is delicious.</p><p>I fully acknowledge, as does my Department, the important contribution bees make not only to agriculture but also to biodiversity as both pollinators and as honey producers.  My Department supports the important work of all the beekeeping associations in Ireland in the promotion and protection of <i>apis mellifera</i>.  I certainly welcome the support of the members of the Native Irish Honey Bee Society who are in the Gallery today.  I thank them for being here today.</p><p>I acknowledge and welcome all the Senators' comments on protecting the native Irish honeybee.  I reiterate my support for this overall objective.  Senators will recall that, on Second Stage of the Private Members' Bill in June, I expressed my Department's concern that a statutory ban on bee imports into Ireland might constitute a restriction on trade under EU regulations and that further advice would need to be sought on the compatibility of the Bill with the EU Single Market rules.  Trade in bees is permitted and governed by EU law.  EU animal health regulations set down rules for imports into the EU and for intracommunity trade between member states.</p><p>My Department has sought advice from the Office of the Attorney General on whether the Private Members' Bill would give rise to legal concerns having regard to EU law and in particular Articles 34 and 36 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  We have received this legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General in recent days.  The Attorney General considers that a total ban on the importation of certain species of honeybees is likely to face significant scrutiny on proportionality grounds, having regard to the case law of the European Court.  While the need to protect the native Irish honeybee is recognised, the advice of the Attorney General considers that the legal and-or scientific basis to impose a full ban of all other species of bee has not at this point been established with the required certainty.  The Office of the Attorney General considers that an evaluation of proportionality and necessity by way of scientific assessment is required to substantiate the specific measure proposed in the Bill.  Without robust independent scientific evidence capable of demonstrating proportionality of the draft legislation, we were advised that there is likely to be significant risk of legal action on the part of the European Commission or affected businesses.</p><p>I have asked my officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine to procure that independent scientific evidence and data as an urgent priority.  The Government will be in a position to come to a fully informed view on the Protection of the Native Irish Honey Bee Bill on receipt of the necessary independent scientific evidence once the relevant data has been collated and assessment completed.  I look forward to receiving that evidence and assessment as soon as possible.</p></speech>
