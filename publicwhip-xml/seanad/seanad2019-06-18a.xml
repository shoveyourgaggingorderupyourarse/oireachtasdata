    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-06-18a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019061800002#B00200"><p>The Minister is welcome to the House.  I am rather disappointed the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection is not present but I am sure the Minister for Education and Skills will have an answer for this in his reply.  Class K PRSI for office holders was first introduced in 2011 under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010.  For the first time, all office holders, including Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas, judges, the Attorney General, the President and city and county councillors, were required to pay class K PRSI, which is deducted at a rate of 4% from their salaries but for which there is no entitlement to social protection benefits.</p> <p>As soon as I was elected to the Seanad in 2014, I raised this issue on a regular basis and began work as a rapporteur on a report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection on class K.  Having failed to progress the matter in the Houses, despite numerous debates and the report, I took a constitutional challenge to class K in the High Court.  My main concern was the impact of class K on city and county councillors, who receive a small representational payment on which many are dependent and the additional deduction without benefit was excessively punitive.</p> <p>In anticipation of the outcome of the legal challenge, the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who is now Taoiseach, introduced an amendment to the Social Welfare Bill 2016 on Committee Stage to remove city and county councillors from the office holders category, and their PRSI categorisation was changed to class S.  I continued with my legal challenge to class K and was joined by a number of councillors.  The case was settled with all of the plaintiffs, myself included, being compensated and the State accepting that class K was wrong.</p> <p>It is my contention that the continued imposition of class K PRSI on all other office holders, including Members of the Oireachtas, is unconstitutional, as office holders are paying for a social welfare fund without any right to benefit from it.  In essence, class K PRSI is a tax on public service.  While it was only fair that councillors on a paltry representational payment were removed from the category of office holders in the 2016 Act, all other office holders, including Members of the Oireachtas, remained and have been paying class K at 4% ever since.  I only found out in recent days that I am still on class K, having won a High Court action to remove me from it and to put me on class S.</p> <p>There are a number of problems with class K with which I am sure the Minister is familiar.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The insurance benefits that accrue to a person paying class K PRSI are nil.  The terms and conditions of employment for an elected Senator or Deputy do not carry any entitlements to illness benefit once the Members exceed the period of office.  If an election is called and the Senator or Deputy loses his or her seat, there is no illness benefit cover.  Worse still, having lost a seat and illness benefit from the Oireachtas, the Deputy or Senator is not entitled to claim any illness benefits through his or her social protection contributions.  There is no entitlement to invalidity pension or any of the benefits going with invalidity pensions.</p><p>As a Member of the Oireachtas, I have the facility to make voluntary PRSI contributions to keep a class A stamp going.  The price of a voluntary contribution for me is &euro;5,000 per year.  Depending on the class of PRSI being paid before coming to the Oireachtas, the figure for Members can be as low as &euro;500 but in my case and the case of many of my colleagues, it is &euro;5,000.  With a class A contribution, a person is entitled to an old age pension.  Many of my colleagues and those of the Minister have historically been elected for one term and at the end of that term, being contributors at class K has destroyed their social protection record, meaning that in years to come, they will have a disrupted PRSI record.  It is simply unacceptable.</p><p>The Taoiseach was wise when, as Minister for Social Protection, he removed the line in the 2010 Act referring to a member of a local authority within the meaning of the Local Government Act 2001.  That action should be extended to Members of the Oireachtas.  If we need to do something to ensure Members of the Oireachtas cannot benefit from a contributory old-age pension, it needs to be legislated for separately.</p></speech>

Payment of the class K PRSI charge does not establish any social insurance entitlements.  Prior to 2011, this income was exempt from PRSI and then, as now, social insurance entitlements were established and protected based on their non-officeholder activities or by paying voluntary contributions.  This class K charge was introduced for public officeholders because, unlike employees and the self-employed, they did not pay a 4% contribution on this income.  With the abolition of the PRSI earnings ceiling for employees in 2011 and the introduction of the 3% universal social charge on self-employed earnings over &euro;100,000, also in 2011, this meant that public officeholders had a lower marginal rate of income tax, universal social charge and PRSI when compared with other workers.  As a measure of solidarity with those workers, the Oireachtas voted to apply the 4% class K contribution to public officeholders.</p> <p>Public officeholders are now not the only group paying class K contributions.  Since 2013, modified rate contributors, including civil and public servants recruited prior to 1995, who also have earned and unearned income from self-employment pay class K PRSI on this previously exempt income.  In 2014, class K was applied to the previously exempt income of employees and occupational pensioners under 66 years where they have unearned income only.  These class K charges yield nearly &euro;40 million per annum for the Social Insurance Fund from over 88,000 contributors.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This would have a significant impact on the future health of the Social Insurance Fund.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I will be exercising my right, following a High Court case, to be moved to class S.  Second, I object to this nonsense about "generous Exchequer funded salaries and pensions".  My pension, were I to lose my seat at the next election, is the princely sum of &euro;8,000.  However, because I am a teacher my pension will be on the single pension scheme so there is no "generous" pension for me.  The Government must deal with the problem it has with other class K contributors who have unearned income like shareholders, people who have rental income and the like.  I have no terms and conditions of employment; nor have any of my colleagues.  We are officers of the State.  I assure the Minister and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that if they think I am going to sit down under this, they can think again.  If I have to go back to the High Court, I will do so and by God, the next time I go back, they will pay dearly for it.</p> <p>This is an outrageous statement on the part of the Department.  I appreciate that this is not from the Minister for Education and Skill's Department but it is outrageous.  There are young people in these Houses whose PRSI records are being destroyed.  The departmental reply refers to "generous Exchequer funded salaries and pensions" which is a load of poppy cock.  We all know that the days of great pensions in the civil and public service, particularly for elected members, are long gone.  If anyone thinks I am going to take this nonsense, he or she can think again.  I will be back on this one.  I am sorry for giving it to Deputy McHugh between the eyes.  He is the Minister for Education and Skills and it is to him I will be going when I finish up in this House.  Half of my teacher's pension is made up of my class A PRSI contributions but my contribution record has been broken by the Oireachtas class K designation.  I have no idea where my teacher's pension will end up as a result of this so rock on -  I am on the way back on this one.</p></speech>

If there are any specific education related matters, I am more than happy to facilitate a communication plan in that regard.  The next budget is scheduled for 8 October.  There will be a lot of deliberations and conversations on where we are going in regard to that budget.  The approach to that budget will be in keeping with the challenging times ahead in terms of heightened expectations, lower growth rates and Brexit.  In the context of the specific issue raised by Senator Craughwell on class K PRSI, I am sure conversations will be happening within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in advance of the budget.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-06-18a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1395" speakername="Jennifer Murnane O'Connor" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019061800002#D00600"><p>I thank the Minister for taking this Commencement matter.  I discussed the issue of Saplings special school a few months ago with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, but am delighted to welcome the Minister for Education and Skills to the House today to discuss it.  I want to tell the Minister about an incredible school about which I have spoken in this House previously.  It is doing amazing work but is facing a desperate situation because of sky-rocketing insurance costs.  A national conversation is ongoing about insurance costs and businesses being put to the pin of their collar while insurance companies report massive profits.  Last week when I heard that a number of special schools in Ireland were facing closure because of spiralling insurance costs, I knew that things had gone too far.</p> <p>The insurance premium for Saplings special school in Carlow had sky-rocketed from &euro;3,000 to &euro;10,500.  Last week, the premium increased again to &euro;13,500.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2470"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2470&amp;amp;pid=JenniferMurnaneOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The school has incredible staff, a passionate principal and terrific parents, and the parish and wider community are very supportive.  Each fundraiser, however, dips into the same pot.  The annual capitation grant of &euro;20,000 to run the school seems incredible when, just last month, it received an insurance bill of &euro;13,500 and a utility bill for one month alone was more than &euro;4,000.  The school has no choice but to constantly fundraise to maintain the services it provides so well.  It is one thing for parents to feel frustrated that they cannot give the best to their children, but for a principal and staff to feel they are facing into a grim future under extreme financial pressure is simply soul destroying.  Saplings special school caters for children from the age of four to 18.  This model of school was first established by a small group of parents and professionals in the Kildare area because there was a need for the service; it did not exist elsewhere.  Saplings now has five schools located around the country providing quality education for pupils with autism and complex needs.  Each school offers a range of child-centred autism-specific education that draws on a range of evidence-based interventions.  </p><p>In Carlow in 2007, a group of parents came together to set up a school in their community.  It began with 12 pupils.  It will have 30 in September.  In 2010, it became a Department of Education and Skills special school and was granted temporary recognition as a primary school by the Department in 2011.  With regard to capital plans for the future, only when a school has permanent recognition can it apply for capital funding provided by the taxpayer.  The school received such recognition in September 2016.  The Department has to examine how it can support these schools, their staff, and the children and their families with regard to funding.  I ask that the school be assisted in securing a permanent building.  It currently rents accommodation with the help of the parish of Graiguecullen and Killeshin, which straddles the Carlow-Laois border.  </p><p>The 32 staff in the special school, including support staff, are highly trained and highly skilled.  If they had proper funding, they could be supportive and excel in their areas of expertise.  Saplings provides speech and language and occupational therapy through a private company, the costs of which are met through fundraising.  It does not receive supports such as these centrally from the HSE, despite needing them.  That is another problem; it gets no support from the HSE.  Saplings is sometimes called the last resort for many families whose children's needs cannot be met in autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units.  While attending Saplings the children get the opportunity to reach their potential and, in some cases, eventually move to a mainstream setting.  The model of education in the school uses evidence-based interventions and behavioural analysis to provide individual education and behaviour support plans for each pupil.  Each pupil has his or her own analysis.  There is always a plan and this helps explain the frustration staff feel when financial threats are looming as these plans become tenuous and uncertain.  </p><p>Members of the school's board of management work voluntarily and none of them wishes to see this kind of financial pressure on the school, its staff, and the parents.  The Department of Education and Skills' special education section needs to step in and figure something out for Saplings special school Carlow and similar schools throughout the country.  Some 15 schools contacted the Department with their concerns last week.  The National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education commissioned a report on increasing costs and recommended that a group scheme be established for the schools in question.  Something can be done here and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response regarding the supports available to schools such as Saplings special school Carlow.  This is very important.  I have also met the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, several times but I ask that all relevant Ministers and Ministers of State work together.  We need to keep these schools.  We cannot lose the likes of Saplings and other schools across the country because of increasing insurance costs.  It is just not acceptable.  </p></speech>

My Department is aware of issues relating to significant increases in insurance costs in some special schools.  St. Teresa's special school in Ballinasloe was the first to raise this issue through my colleagues in the Oireachtas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I want to acknowledge my colleagues for bringing that to my attention.  The issue the Senator is raising relates to Saplings special school in Carlow.  We have made progress over the last period in discussions with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education.  The increased insurance costs of special schools appear to be due to annual increases in insurance costs generally and, in some cases, increases in claims.  The Department of Education and Skills is working as a matter of urgency with relevant Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and with the State Claims Agency to seek a resolution to the issue of increased insurance costs in special schools.</p><p>A number of options have been identified to address the issue.  These include the development of a group insurance scheme for special schools.  The National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education is engaging with its member boards of management in this regard.  A meeting of the boards and patrons took place on 6 June to discuss the matter and the options available.  This meeting was attended by an official from the Department.  The group scheme proposal appears to be the most viable option at this stage.  The importance of all schools signing up for such a scheme was emphasised at the recent meeting.  All school representatives who were in attendance were in favour of exploring the group scheme option.  Although the Department of Education and Skills has advanced school capitation payments on an exceptional basis to a small number of schools that recently experienced difficulty in paying insurance premiums, it is not sustainable for the Department to continue to advance capitation payments as a way of meeting vastly increased insurance premiums.  I know this is a cause of concern for schools as well.  Officials from the Department have been in contact with Saplings special school in Carlow on this matter.  Representatives of the school have been briefed on the situation.  I hope a speedy and cost-effective resolution can be secured for impacted special schools.</p></speech>

It is a worry for the parents, the school and the principal.  Everyone to whom I have spoken agrees that the group scheme proposal would be the best way to go forward.  I would appreciate the Minister's support.  I know Saplings special school would appreciate it too.  We need to make sure this cannot keep happening.  Schools will close if insurance costs keep increasing.  It is unacceptable.  We need to look forward.  I look forward to getting a good result from this.  I thank the Minister.  I apologise for missing him last week when I raised an issue relating to special needs assistants.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, responded to me on that occasion.  I have addressed my query regarding special needs assistants to the Minister now and I hope he comes back to me on it.</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;1.9 billion, or almost 20% of the education budget of &euro;11 billion, is spent on special education.  There are things we get right, things we miss and things we get wrong.  Much of what we do is focused on collaboration.  I believe the idea of schools working together as part of a single entity represents the way forward.  The first time this matter was raised with me, I learned that an insurance company had asked St. Teresa's special school to pay its annual premium with a single cheque.  This approach can cause a difficulty for schools.  I do not want to see schools looking for the capitation grant to increase for this specific purpose.  I believe that if we can get the schools working together and get the premiums into a reasonable sort of place, it will be seen that the collaborative approach represents the way forward.

I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State; it is just that I have more time for him than I do for the Minister.  </p> <p>The Government is denying pay increases to support staff in the healthcare sector who, as the Minister of State is aware, will be taking strike action on Thursday in 40 hospitals and care centres across the country.  The staff include healthcare assistants, maternity care assistants, laboratory aides, surgical instrument technicians, catering staff, porters and maintenance workers, some of whom I have just met.  Their salaries start at &euro;24,500, or &euro;28,000 for a healthcare assistant.  The figure of &euro;24,500 is approximately 14% of the salary of the Minister for Health.</p> <p>The strike promises to be very disruptive.  It has been caused directly by the Government's inability or unwillingness to keep its promises.  In 2015 job evaluation for support staff was reintroduced under the terms of the public service stability agreement, PSSA, having been suspended at the height of the economic crisis in 2009.  It was signed off on by the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform, as well as by the HSE.  My union, SIPTU, has honoured the terms of the PSSA in full and its members voted to accept the first Lansdowne Road agreement on the basis that job evaluation would be reintroduced.  According to the Government, the recession is over.  In spite of this, wages have not been restored in line with recommendations.</p> <p>In the spring of 2016 SIPTU balloted support staff on strike action as the HSE was prohibited by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform from implementing phases 1 and 2 of the job evaluation exercise.  In the spring of 2017 the Workplace Relations Commission intervened and brokered an agreement which set out dates for phases 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the job evaluation exercise to be completed.  The Minister of State will be aware that all deadlines in the Workplace Relations Commission agreement have been missed.  Phases 1 and 2 of the job evaluation exercise were completed in August last year.  Some 6,000 members in support grades represented by SIPTU were deemed to be entitled to upgrading in line with the agreement.  In fairness, the HSE and the Department of Health accepted the outcome of the evaluations and applied for the &euro;16.2 million - a paltry figure in the context of the overall health budget - needed for the pay increases.  The application was declined and no budgetary provision was made.</p> <p>Following meetings with the Departments and the HSE, SIPTU support staff grade workers voted to take action.  The Workplace Relations Commission intervened and all parties met several times, including yesterday, with no resolution in sight.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has confirmed that what is owed to SIPTU members will not be paid until at least 2021, possibly under a new public service stability agreement.  The presumption and arrogance of the Department of Health in aligning with that position are unbelievable and completely unacceptable.  Not only is payment due now, it should have been made two years ago.</p> <p>What is the point of an agreement if one side - the Government side - cannot be trusted to uphold its promises?  The behaviour of the Government has been interpreted by the workers, some of whom I have just met, as disrespectful and dismissive, to put it mildly.  They are furious.  They believe their jobs are of no value in the eyes of the Government.  That view has been reinforced by the lack of a ministerial intervention in the dispute which is heading for a very disruptive strike on Thursday.  It will be the first of many such strikes.  The Minister of State is responsible for the welfare of the workers and the upholding of their rights.  How does he defend the deceitful actions of the Government?</p></speech>

I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris.  </p> <p>I raised this issue with the Government this morning and had discussions with Paul Bell of SIPTU at the weekend.  The background to the dispute is that on 5 June SIPTU announced that up to 10,000 of its members working in 38 hospitals and healthcare facilities would engage in industrial action for 24 hours on Thursday, 20 June.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->SIPTU has advised the HSE of a further five dates of proposed action to take place on 25 and 26 June, as well as 2, 3 and 4 July.  I genuinely hope we can avoid that.  The grades to engage in this action include healthcare assistants, maternity care assistants, porters, laboratory aides, surgical instrument staff and cleaners.  The HSE has advised local management in the healthcare providers concerned to engage in contingency planning on the basis of emergency cover arrangements.</p><p>The background to the dispute goes back to the talks that took place under the Lansdowne Road agreement.  At the time, a chairman's note was agreed by all parties on the introduction of a job evaluation scheme in the health sector.  This scheme had previously been in place but was discontinued in 2008.  SIPTU sought the introduction of the job evaluation scheme for the support grades along the same principles that operated in 2008.  On this basis, discussions commenced in 2016 between the HSE and the relevant unions, namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, which is now F&oacute;rsa, in respect of the establishment of the schemes.  Successful engagement with F&oacute;rsa led to the approval of a job evaluation scheme for the clerical and administrative grades in August 2016.  However, as agreement on a scheme for the support staff grades could not be reached, that issue was referred to the Lansdowne Road agreement oversight body in early 2017.  The chairperson of the body issued a recommendation stating that the parties should proceed with the scheme as planned but that the question of its implementation would be considered at the conclusion of the exercise.  The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, agreement provided that the scheme was to be carried out in four phases.  Phases 1 and 2 included support staff in the laboratories and the theatres.  The larger categories of support staff grades, the healthcare assistants and the multi-task attendants were also included.  In October 2018, a report was produced setting out the results of phase 1 and phase 2 of the exercise.  The report recommended that a significant proportion of those grades evaluated should move to a higher pay band.  While the WRC agreement states that any payments arising as a result of the exercise would apply no earlier than the completion of phases 1 and 2 of the exercise, there is no agreement at this stage on the implementation of the result of the exercise.</p><p>In a separate issue, the chefs are engaging in industrial action over a claim to have their roles and pay scales aligned with those of the craft worker grade.  No commitment was given to this particular claim.  Senators will be aware that the Workplace Relations Commission invited the parties to talks that took place last Thursday and resumed yesterday.  These talks ended without agreement.  While it is clear that all parties are committed to reaching a resolution to avoid this strike action, it is regrettable that this has not been possible at this point.  The position is that we will continue to utilise the State dispute resolutions machinery to maximum effect.  I will do anything in my power to assist that development.</p></speech>

I know it is a scripted response from a civil servant.  It is highly cynical.  The HSE accepts the job evaluation exercise but does not accept that it has to implement it.  That is the height of hypocrisy from the civil servant who wrote that line.</p> <p>I want to finish by saying one thing.  The Government will not avoid industrial action unless there is a political intervention.  The industrial relations process has been completed and the awards were made.  The HSE applied for the money and was turned down by the Government.  What we need is political action.  Without it, the Government is heading into a public relations disaster.  If the Minister of State thinks the nurses dispute was bad for his Government, he should wait until this kicks off because there are far greater numbers of support staff.  They are going on strike.  They are absolutely furious.  We are talking about the lowest-paid workers in the health service.  The attitude of the Government is absolutely appalling.  The message is ringing out clearly now that those in the Government have no idea how these people live, struggle and work against all the obstacles in the health service in the midst of the crises there every day.  People are furious.  This will not be solved by the industrial relations machinery.  It will be solved by a political decision by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to fund the increases awarded under the public service stability agreement and the associated process.  The Minister of State must honour the agreement.</p></speech>

Of course, I accept the concerns raised by the Senator about terms, pay and conditions.  The salary rates are &euro;24,500 and &euro;28,000.  There is no disputing that element of the debate.  The Minister has asked both sides to redouble their efforts to avoid the disruption of health services.  The industrial relations machinery should be used.  The Minister acknowledges the vital role played by the support staff and the HSE is continuing to prepare plans in the event that strike action is taken.  I will do everything in my power as Minister of State to avert the strike.  At the Cabinet table this morning I raised the point made by the Senator in this debate.  Everybody is aware of my personal position and I will continue to push that agenda.  I hope we can avoid a strike on Thursday.</p></speech>

Many times 5,000 people marched to save the emergency department.  I stayed in government at the time and I am delighted that Roscommon University Hospital is now so busy that people are complaining about a lack of parking spaces at Dr. Hyde Park.  There is an air ambulance with advanced paramedics and some &euro;20 million has been spent on the hospital.  I am delighted to say hundreds of lives have been saved.  There are 500 jobs in the hospital which is busier and safer.  Anyone who has any intention of contradicting what I am saying should visit the hospital and ask the consultants and management staff.  </p> <p>One last piece of the jigsaw to ensure the future of Roscommon University Hospital remains.  It is the need for an update on the medical rehabilitation unit project.  The planned medical rehabilitation unit represents a very significant development.  The 20-bed unit will be of huge benefit to patients in the western region.  It will enable patients from the west who previously have been treated at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire to be treated in Roscommon University Hospital.  It will also assist in reducing waiting times for patients who require access to the National Rehabilitation Hospital.</p> <p>There is a clear demand for such a medical rehabilitation facility in the west.  Almost one quarter of patients treated at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire normally reside in the HSE West region where there are no dedicated rehabilitation units.  As things stands, the National Rehabilitation Hospital is the only comprehensive rehabilitation centre for patients with physical and cognitive impairments in the Republic of Ireland.  As we know, the demand for its services continues to rise.</p> <p>Turning to the details of the capital project, we are looking initially at the development of inpatient ward accommodation with ten beds on a greenfield site on the Roscommon University Hospital campus.  A further ten beds will be delivered on a phased basis.  The unit will operate as a satellite centre under the auspices of the National Rehabilitation Hospital and relieve pressure on existing services.  This will allow patients to be treated in their own community.  Towards the end of last year the project took a significant step forward when the design team was appointed.  Funding of more than &euro;560,000 was allocated for the design stage of the project.  This was a major milestone in the development of the project, on which I seek an update.  I look forward to hearing a progress report on it.</p></speech>

The Health Service Executive recently published its implementation framework for the recommendations in the national policy and strategy for the provision of neurorehabilitation services in Ireland in the period 2011 to 2015.  The strategy made a number of recommendations for services for people with rehabilitation needs.  It also covered a range of supports for them, including clinical, therapeutic, social, vocational and community supports.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The redevelopment of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire is well under way with the construction of phase 1 nearing completion.  It is expected to become operational next year, it will be a significant enhancement to rehabilitation services in the country and it will have a direct and significant impact on patient recovery by providing an optimal ward and therapeutic environment for patient treatment.  This will enable staff to deliver optimal quality care and treatment in a facility which affords dignity, respect and privacy to all.</p><p>Funding for phases 1 and 2 of this major redevelopment project, along with the development of a specialist rehabilitation unit at Roscommon University Hospital, has been included in the Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040 policy initiative, announced last year.  This provides &euro;10.9 billion for health capital developments across the country, including both national programmes and individual projects across acute, primary and social care.  The delivery of these projects and programmes, including developments at Roscommon University Hospital, will result in healthcare facilities that allow for implementation of new models of care and for delivery of services in high quality modem facilities.  Roscommon University Hospital plays an essential role as a model 2 hospital within the Saolta University Healthcare Group and will continue to do so in the future.  It provides a significant range of hospital services to patients in the region, including extended day surgery, certain acute medicine services and local injuries services.  It also provides a wide array of diagnostic services including endoscopy, laboratory medicine, point-of-care testing and radiology, as well as specialist rehabilitation medicine and palliative care.  Future growth in healthcare will be in the areas of chronic disease management and day surgery, diagnostics and rehabilitation.  The activity levels of model 2 hospitals, such as Roscommon University Hospital, will continue to increase over the coming years as they specialise in providing these services to meet the needs of their local populations.</p><p>The HSE has advised that a design team for the proposed development of a rehabilitation unit at Roscommon University Hospital was appointed in October 2018.  The design team has commenced preliminary design and is currently conducting site surveys and site investigations as part of this process.  The HSE has previously advised that the hospital is also experiencing traffic congestion and parking difficulties, for which solutions will need to be addressed as part of the planning process.  Subject to the successful completion of this process, it is anticipated that a planning application could be lodged in late 2019.  Once the final design options have been approved, the required capital allocation will be determined.  This unit will deliver 20 beds and therapy suite accommodation upon completion and will operate as a satellite centre under the auspices of the National Rehabilitation Hospital to provide intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation to patients in the west.</p></speech>

I understand that these applications take time but it must be ensure that the significant development under the auspices of the National Rehabilitation Hospital will be located in Roscommon.  When it becomes operational, it will lead to 50 jobs.  That means there will be more than 500 jobs in Roscommon University Hospital and I take great pleasure that this is so, given that people said the hospital would close.  The Minister of State said the hospital was experiencing traffic congestion and parking difficulties, for which solutions will need to be found as part of the planning process.  However, I take a little bit of credit in this regard and I laugh to myself about the fact that people said there would be no business in Roscommon hospital.  In fact, we are experiencing significant traffic problems because it is twice as busy.  I thank the Minister of State for his response.  We will continue to ensure that the National Rehabilitation Hospital will be located in Roscommon for the west of Ireland.</p></speech>

I also convey my sympathies and those of the Fianna F&aacute;il group to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and his family on the passing of his mother, Peggie.  Our deepest and sincerest condolences to both families.</p> <p>I raise two matters today.  The first is eye health for primary school children.  I call on the Minister to introduce a scheme whereby the first-time driving licence test requirements are applied to primary school children.  Many children are given the HSE standard eye test, which they pass, but then go on to suffer sight loss.  Those children would have failed the optician's eyesight test.  I was approached by a mother with a five year old son who has sensory and anxiety issues.  She let the school know about these before an eye test happened and, six months after the eye test, heard nothing from the school or the HSE as to how her child got on.  As time passed, her child still presented with serious sight issues and a lot of anxiety when going to school so she brought the child to the opticians and it turned out the child was, in fact, long-sighted.  </p> <p>Other children and parents in the school have been discussing it and it turns out that the HSE standard eye test is deficient and many ophthalmologists have been agitating for the HSE to implement the driving licence test standard to primary school children because it is more effective in ensuring that, if children have issues with their sight, it is identified.  The HSE test is too simple and is not working.  I call on the Minister to look into the matter.</p> <p>The second issue I raise is knife crime in the city.  There was an incident on O'Connell Street last week and, over the weekend, an horrendous incident in Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard.  Pictures are circulating on the Internet of a cross-section of a wound on a man's face.  It is a very graphic picture.  We are seeing a rise in knife crime in this city and the Government has not got a handle on it.  A many-pronged approach needs to be taken.  We need the Garda to be resourced properly and we need stronger sentencing for knife crimes and for the sale and possession of knives.  Garda&iacute; also need to be protected.  It is daunting, dangerous and scary for garda&iacute; who approach large gangs of youths because they do not know what the outcome will be or how aggressive the situation will be.  I am calling for a serious debate in this House on knife crime in the city.  The incidence of knife crime has increased, it is an epidemic and we need to be worried.  The increase in knife crime in the UK was described as a public health epidemic and we need to look at it in the same way.</p> <p>I congratulate our colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, who was elected to the European Parliament.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She will still be with us for the next few weeks.

Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha d&iacute;lse.</p> <p>I will mention a number of matters today.  The Perjury and Related Offences Bill that we read about today in the newspapers, which has been championed by Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and other members of my group, has been lying unaddressed in this House for some time and I am glad to see that the Minister for Justice and Equality has got the Government's agreement to make some amendments to it.  I am somewhat underwhelmed by the suggestion that these amendments are far-reaching in any particular way because the Bill did extend to perjury before tribunals and perjury in affidavits tendered to tribunals.  </p> <p>Be that as it may, it is not a question of ownership of the Bill, but one of getting it moved onwards, debated and passed.  The Leader should indicate when it is proposed to take the next Stages of this Bill, for which there is cross-party and almost unanimous support in this House for its quick passage and enactment into law, in order that civil law will have some teeth in view of the reluctance on the part of the prosecuting authorities to prosecute in the absence of a clear statutory basis.  </p> <p>The second point I raise arises out of the plans which were approved by the Cabinet yesterday and which I hope will be circulated to all Members of the House fairly quickly for our consideration and debate.  They relate to climate change and the steps the Government proposes should be taken over the next few decades on that issue and my specific issue pertains to data centres.  I understand there are between four and eight serious proposals to build extensive data centres in Ireland, the effect of which will be to increase our demand for electricity over the next ten to 12 years by up to 33% to 35%, which is a conservative estimate.  It appears to me that the Department responsible for enterprise has been single-mindedly pursuing the establishment of data centres in Ireland without proper consideration as to whether we can sustain an increase in the demand for 24-hour a day electricity of that order in the context of meeting our climate change targets in the future.  I ask that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, be called to this House by the Leader to indicate how he proposes to reconcile the increased demand for electricity anticipated on foot of the establishment of all of these data centres with the adherence to the targets for sustainable electricity consumption and generation over the next 15 years.</p> <p>Finally, on the Order of Business, I propose that an amendment be made that the figure of three and a half hours proposed by the Leader of the House should be two hours only.</p></speech>

May they rest in peace.</p> <p>I raise today the strike we are facing on Thursday that will have very serious implications.  That is the strike of the healthcare assistants, the homecare assistants, the maternity care assistants, the staff, the cleaners, the laboratory aides, the chefs and the surgical instrument cleaners who operate our hospitals and health facilities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are the people who hold our health service together.  Some 6,200 workers are affected in 38 facilities across the country, including the Central Mental Hospital.  I welcome that a delegation from SIPTU, led by Paul Bell, came to Leinster House earlier to discuss the implications with Members and give us the details.  I also thank my colleague, Senator Gavan, and Senator Nash for inviting them.  </p><p>It is disgraceful how these workers are being treated.  They may be described as servants in the Health Acts but they are not slaves, which is exactly how the State has been treating many of them.  They are on low wages as it is, and have agreements on phases 1 and 2 with Government, but the Government will not implement them.  Even the employer, that is the HSE, has agreed.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been aware of this all the time but it did not make provision for it in the budget, which is disgraceful.  These workers must not continue to be treated in this disrespectful and dismissive manner.  Massive bonuses for bankers are being reintroduced while tax relief for vulture funds continue, yet this is how the State treats the lowest paid, hardest working in our society.  It is unacceptable that these workers face entering an official dispute to secure what they are owed.  They are not looking for anything extra, only what has been agreed and what is owed to them.</p><p>The Government has saved millions of euro since 2008 when the job evaluation scheme was suspended.  These are the low-paid workers who get up early in the morning and just about manage to exist.  The Government must implement this agreement.  It is within its gift to prevent this strike and the impact it will have on communities and to the most vulnerable from happening on Thursday.  The Government must honour this agreement or I will join the picket lines in Mayo with these SIPTU workers on Thursday.</p></speech>

It is important that people understand that no worker takes the withdrawal of his or her labour lightly.  It is the singular most difficult decision that any worker can make.  It is a particularly painful decision, which can have any number of ramifications, sometimes for years, in how a person's position in work might be treated and interactions with others in work can suffer as a consequence.  Taking industrial action is a major decision.  The Government has reneged on its promises to these workers.  Many of our hospitals will effectively shut down on Thursday.  Many Oireachtas Members will stand shoulder to shoulder with members of SIPTU on Thursday, as will I.  As others have noted, it is important that the Government steps in to resolve this.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to suggest that this is a matter for the Labour Court.  The Government and the HSE are the employer, they have reneged on promises made and they should resolve the dispute immediately so that we do not end up with pickets outside hospitals. </p> <p>Anyone who has had the misfortune of having a loved one under the care of people who work in hospitals will be aware of the essential services that go beyond the nursing and doctor grades furnished by people who provide meals or transport around the hospital.  Hospitals cannot function without them.  I very much give them my support and thank Senators Nash and Gavan for their presentation earlier with SIPTU workers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2301"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2301&amp;amp;pid=AodhanORiordan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have spoken previously about the issue of school places for children with autism on the north side of Dublin and I thought we were making progress on it.  I raised it as a Commencement Matter and, in fairness to the Minister, he gave me great assurances that no child would be left without a school place in September.  However, the issue is still unresolved.  As the Leader knows, there were marches in Cork and Dublin last Saturday.  Yesterday it was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i>that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is telling the Minister there are not sufficient school places in September for children with autism.  This is not something that is just being said by a campaign group; the NCSE is also stating it.  Can we please have a debate in the House with the Minister, whom I know is a fair minded man?  We cannot have a situation where children with autism have no school places in September.  The system is broken and needs to be fixed.  It is now the middle of June and we are facing a situation where children will have no school to go to in September.  I plead with the Leader to have this discussion with the Minister.  I know he will do his best to find a solution but we are waiting and we still do not have a resolution to this very serious issue.</p></speech>

Both happened yesterday morning within a couple of hours of each other.  I am very sorry and pass on my condolences as, I am sure, does every Member.</p> <p>I want to follow up on the thoughts of Senator McDowell regarding climate change.  A major document was published yesterday.  It is the document of our generation if it is implemented correctly and it is important for every person, household and business in the context of climate change.  We cannot delay in any way on what it is proposed to do.  There are incentives for people to insulate their attics, replace their windows, wrap their houses or whatever other measures can be done at home, and to encourage people to drive electric cars.  All of these initiatives need to be rolled out quickly.  It is important that we bring the Minister to the House in the next week or two to outline to us the speed of what he is doing.  It all sounds great and we have Project Ireland 2040, something else 2050 and many targets that are a long way away but the work needs to start now.  People have shown they are interested in climate change and are willing to adapt but they must be given help and advice.  They want to know what to do and the right way to do it and it is important that the Minister comes to the House soon.</p> <p>I acknowledge the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill we are still dealing with on Committee Stage was published in 2016 but we need to proceed carefully with it.  We have had a significant number of representations.  I have never had as many representations on a Bill in my time in the House.  I appreciate I am not here as long as many other Members.  Clearly, a large number of people are concerned about the contents of the Bill.  I ask the Leader to proceed carefully and sensitively with it.  I do not doubt that he will but perhaps scheduling it tomorrow is a little premature as we may need to examine it.  I know we are discussing today's Order of Business now but perhaps the Leader will reflect on the representations that have been made to many Members.  I am sure the Leader and other members of his party receive as many emails as I do.  There is genuine anxiety about the contents of the Bill and we need to examine it carefully before we proceed further with it.</p></speech>

The establishment of the agency was announced and a statutory instrument signed in September 2018.  The agency is intended to manage the regeneration of land, particularly State lands, deliver affordable housing, work constructively and consolidate land banks on public lands between the private and public sectors.  It is expected to support collaborative structures, including mergers between public and private entities to maximise the potential for the delivery of affordable housing and social housing.  I raise this in the context of a debate on affordability we had this morning at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We had a presentation by the Dublin City Council chief executive, Mr. Owen Keegan, and the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council chief executive, Ms Philomena Poole, among others.  The absence of the Land Development Agency Bill was very clear from the discussion and the interaction with other county managers across the country.  It has been promised for a long time.  The significance of this is that, in effect, no lands can be transferred as there is not yet a legal entity called the Land Development Agency.  As we have been advised that no lands can be transferred when this entity does not exist, it is critical that we get it up and running with the required legislation.  Will the Leader speak to the relevant Ministers to find out what the issue is with the Bill?  The legislation could be initiated in the Seanad.  We have spoken about wanting to be constructive and everybody wants to be constructive.  There is time in our schedule.  We meet three days a week and this can be extended.

It is by far the most significant environmental and climate action document the country has ever seen.  Much of it arises from our growing awareness of the impact of human behaviour on the environment and climate change, as well as the need to change not just to reduce carbon emissions but also to safeguard water quality and biodiversity.  In many ways I am disappointed to hear some of the commentary on the plan that is nothing short of reckless and hypocritical coming from some of those in the Opposition.  The plan recognises that every sector, including how we live in and heat our homes, our modes of transport and the agriculture and construction industries, must come under scrutiny.  It is not just about climate change as we must also be sustainable.  We are dependent on fossil fuels from volatile countries that may be at war with one another because of oil, coal and all the rest.  This is our opportunity to make a change.  If the critics of the plan look at it, they will see an entire section on transition.  It acknowledges that it will not be easy and that sectors of society may be hit very hard.  It notes, however, that people should not be crucified.  Clearly there is an appetite among the public, especially young people, to address the matter.  It is a clarion call to politicians to tease out the matters surrounding transition but not to knock a plan that will require individual Departments to be responsible and have carbon budgets that they will not be able to hive off as somebody else's responsibility.  Everybody will have to consider how he or she will make this country a better place.  If we are clever, we will invest in the bioeconomy and the business possibilities for economic growth such as research and development of wave energy or electric vehicles.  We should look at anything that might provide a new way of living that will not be dependent on fossil fuels, which is how we have enjoyed our lifestyles for the past 100 years or since oil and the internal combustion engine were discovered.  There is both a great challenge and an opportunity.  I hope that is where the debate will start, rather than the charge that we are attacking rural Ireland or doing this or that to somebody else.  Everybody is in this together.  We must only look around to see the impact it will have on the climate, water quality, biodiversity and everything else.  We should face up to the matter.</p></speech>

It is important that Members of this House understand why that difficult decision was taken.  It is not a decision that was taken lightly.  A number of years ago the Government decided, in consultation with the trade union involved, to undertake a job evaluation process.  This involved an investigation into and examination of pay rates, skill sets and how the roles of health care assistants, porters, surgical instrument technicians and so on have evolved over the years.  That independent job evaluation process made a number of very interesting findings, including the fact that the jobs in question have evolved to the point where the skill sets, requirements and responsibilities involved are enormous and, critically, that the workers, who number 10,000, are significantly underpaid in many cases.  Unfortunately, this Government has decided not to fulfil its part of the bargain.  It has accepted the outcome of the process but has, in essence, shelved the reports produced and refused to pay the moneys owed to our health care assistants, porters, hospital chefs and other important health service support staff grades on which the health service depends.</p><p>The first person one meets when one goes into a hospital is the porter.  Those of us who have stayed in hospital know that the health service is very much dependent on the work of health care assistants to support nursing and medical staff.  They do very important jobs, but unfortunately this Government does not seem to recognise that.  There is an upstairs, downstairs attitude, as described by my colleague, Mr. Paul Bell of SIPTU, earlier today.  This Government certainly seems to value the work that is done by doctors and nurses, as does everybody, but if the attitude of the Government to this dispute is anything to go by, it does not place any value whatsoever on the work done by health care assistants and others.  We are talking here about critical cogs in the wheel, people who make sure that the system works effectively and efficiently.  I am sick and tired of being told by Fine Gael Ministers, Deputies and Senators that this and matters like it are for the Labour Court to resolve because this is actually a political issue.  There is no discussion to be had in the Labour Court because the evidence is based on the job evaluation reports.  The Government has accepted the job evaluation reports and it is now a political decision as to whether the Minister for Finance will pay the moneys to the Department of Health and the HSE to ensure that these people get the recognition and respect due to them and the moneys that are owed.  This is a political decision and I am calling on Members of this House to support the SIPTU workers who will be on strike this Thursday, the first of five planned days of industrial action.  I hope it does not get to the stage where we have other days of industrial action but that is a matter for the Government to address now.</p></speech>

The competition offers artists the chance to win a commission worth &pound;10,000 for the permanent collection of a British institution and &pound;5,000 worth of art materials.  Ms Reddy is taking part in the competition this week and I wish her well.  In her journey through this competition, however, she will receive no funding and will have no entitlements.  She might be reimbursed for the costs of her trip when the competition is over.  We do wonderful things in this country for established artists and there are great arts officers in many counties, including Carlow.  When it comes to young people starting out, however, it is very hard.  I am aware that grants are available to artists in various parts of the country but it is very difficult to qualify for same.  Ms Reddy needs a grant now but I have been told that none is available.  Ms Reddy, who I hope does very well in the aforementioned competition, did not ask me to raise this issue.  I raise it today while also sending her my best wishes.  I ask the Leader to organise a debate on how to support young artists to help them onto the world stage, as we often do for young sportspeople.  It is important that when we have a uniquely talented artist like Ms Reddy, we support her and give more to people like her.  I raise this in an effort to stimulate a debate on issues around artists' grants and so on.</p></speech>

I also offer my condolences to Senator Coghlan on the passing of his mother, Peggie.</p> <p>I support what my colleague, Senator Mulherin, has said about climate change and the Government's plan.  There is no doubt that there will always be more that can be done, but there is plenty that can be done now.  Grants are available, and further grants will be put in place, to support everybody, including those in rural Ireland, in addressing this issue.  Farmers are businesspeople and they will grasp with both hands anything out of which they can make a sustainable living.</p> <p>I wish to address the issues of autism and the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill 2017 which this House passed unanimously two full years ago.  I last raised this issue in January when I asked the Leader of the House to ask the Minister to address us and to tell us what problem was preventing this Bill, which was supported by 77,000 people online, from progressing to the D&aacute;il.  The Minister has failed to come in and I am very disappointed by that.  It is grossly unfair on people.  More than 60,000 families in this country have a member with autism.  That is more than 60,000 Irish citizens who, if they got help early enough in life, could make a real contribution to Irish life or at least would not suffer as much as they otherwise would and would be more independent than they would otherwise be.  There are such strategies in place across the UK, in England, Scotland and Wales.  They are also in place in France, Canada and various other countries around Europe.  I am aware of no good reason not to have one here.  I ask the Leader to again invite the Minister in to tell us what problem is preventing this Bill progressing to the D&aacute;il.  I will continue to raise this issue weekly until I get a satisfactory response.  Irish men, women and children with autism deserve better.</p></speech>

These are always sad occasions.</p> <p>I refer to the statement from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to the effect that the Government has decided to force people out of their cars.  This is completely the wrong approach.  People will resent it.  They will not care for it at all.  People need to be encouraged.  With regard to this business of stopping people having petrol or diesel-driven cars in the city, does anybody in this bloody Government realise that - hello - some of us still live in the city?  We live in the inner city and would like to have our cars, thank you very much indeed.</p></speech>

Last year the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, requested that each local authority designate a vacant homes officer to co-ordinate actions to address the issue of vacant properties.  I welcomed that at the time and I feel strongly that there should be at least one such officer in every large town rather than just one in each county council area.  These people should not be taken from another job within the council.  A new post should be created and that should be the person's sole job.  All of the towns and villages in this country have premises above their shops, many of which are vacant.  We have said time and time again that these properties should be used to house families.  On the street on which I grew up in Athlone, Connaught Street, 70 families lived over their businesses when I was child.  My family was one of them.  All of those premises are empty today.  It is the same in every town and village in the country.  I was in Galway at the weekend and I walked along Salthill, where many of the premises are vacant.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gabrielle McFadden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2399"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2399&amp;amp;pid=GabrielleMcFadden&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I came out of Galway, I noticed that the former Corrib Great Southern Hotel is standing absolutely derelict, which is a disgrace.  If it were used as student accommodation, students could move out of houses into which families could then move.  Alternatively, it could be converted into apartments for families.  When we drive out of Dublin along the quays each Thursday, we see many empty premises that look like they need some work to be done on them.  When the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, compiled the housing action plan in his former role as Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, he came up with the idea of a repair and lease scheme to allow people to borrow up to &euro;40,000 from their local council to do up a unit in which a family could be housed, with this money being repaid over a number of years.  I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to come to the House not for a broad discussion on housing but for a focused debate on different aspects of the housing issue, including the repair and lease scheme.  Perhaps the Minister will tell the House how many vacant homes officers have been appointed.  How many of them are actually doing their jobs?  What are the results of their efforts?  We need some accountability and data to back these things up.</p></speech>

Every day, insurance costs are putting substantial pressure on businesses the length and breath of this country.  The insurance issue is posing an existential threat to community organisations and voluntary activities throughout the country.  There is a fear that many organisations will have to shut down.  Businesses like activity centres and open farms have already closed due to high insurance costs.  Mr. Paddy O'Reilly had to close his pet farm and visitor centre in Killinkere, County Cavan, last week due to what he described as "compo-culture gone mad".  The only quote that Mr. O'Reilly managed to get from an insurance broker was for &euro;11,000.  He had invested over &euro;200,000 in his business premises over the years.  When he initially set out, his insurance premium was just &euro;700.  This is just one of many examples of businesses being forced out of business.  I know the Government commissioned a report which made many recommendations.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to come to the Chamber to advise Senators on where exactly we are at.  We need the Government to focus on this issue and give it the urgent attention it badly requires.  It is intolerable that businesses and voluntary organisations which run festivals the length and breath of this country are closing down.</p></speech>

I think that as one gets older, it is even more difficult to lose a parent or a sibling because one might not have youth on one's side to get through the terrible grief.  I ask the Cathaoirleach and Senator Coghlan to accept my sincerest sympathies.</p> <p>I agree with what my colleague, Senator Mulherin, said earlier our natural environment.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I believe we should have a new Department that deals with the natural environment.  I do not know whether this is constitutionally possible.  It is all very well to hope other Departments will take action.  We need to think about the destruction of the natural environment and about how dependent we are on the natural environment.  The recent documentary drama on Chernobyl showed what we are capable of destroying within ourselves as technology advances.  The Government should think about establishing a Department where this issue could be taken extremely seriously.  To give a simple example, we constantly use the natural environment - birds, animals, mammals and fish - to advertise.  Eir used the murmuration of starlings to advertise its technology.  I do not remember Birdwatch Ireland getting hundreds of thousands of euro for that.  A company would have to pay others hundreds of thousands of euro to use their image or logo.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Such practices are commonplace in tourism.  Visitors come to see our island, waters, puffins and other birds and to fish, but we do not put the same amount of money into the development of our natural environment as we do into technological development.  We should consider developing a Department with responsibility for our natural environment and its preservation.</p><p>The second issue I wish to discuss is the proposed strike by healthcare assistants who keep the best of us alive in the healthcare environment.  We need to discuss their critical skills, career trajectory and pay and conditions.  I read in a newspaper that we did not have enough barbers and that critical skills employment permits were being issued to boners and other workers in the agriculture industry.  Given the ageing population, there is a great need for healthcare assistants in private homes and private, public and voluntary nursing homes.  We should develop a task force to determine what we will do to assist the 6,000 people who are looking for assistance and remedy the fact that 1,800 vacancies have not been filled.</p></speech>

When such events occur, we realise the insignificance of the other things about which we worry in life.</p> <p>Last week I told the House that I was to travel to Westminster and mentioned Rory Stewart, a candidate for the leadership of the Conservative Party.  Most Senators did not know who he was, but he is now seen as the main rival of Boris Johnson for the leadership.  Sometimes we watch such contests in anticipation of the result.  Whoever becomes leader of the Conservative Party will be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and have a significant impact on our relationship with the United Kingdom, as well as that between the United Kingdom and the European Union.  It is not our decision.  Last week I thanked Rory Stewart for at least talking about the impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland.  Our voice needs to be heard in the United Kingdom, as well as in the European Union.</p> <p>I hope Senators will forgive me for being self-indulgent.  I congratulate the Roscommon football team on their wonderful victory last Sunday.  I was at the match in Galway and there was great joy.  A humorous video of Paddy Joe the barber jumping up and down with the cup in Roscommon town is doing the rounds.  He is one of the loveliest and wisest people in County Roscommon.  Sometimes one encounters people who are passionate about football and their own county but who do not like certain other counties or matters.  However, Paddy Joe is one of the nicest people I know and does not mind when another county wins the Connacht football championship.  It is nice to see such an attitude.  Now that Roscommon have won the Connacht championship, I do not mind if Galway or Mayo win the all-Ireland football championship.</p></speech>

I know others have spoken on that matter.  I was pleased to come out and support them earlier today.</p><p>I wish to speak about the dreadful case of Majella Moynihan.  I commend her on her immense bravery in coming out and speaking about the horrific injustice she suffered at the hands of the State and her superiors in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and about the terrible wrong done to her and her child, that is to say, the coerced adoption and her interrogation and threatened dismissal, along with all her other treatment at the hands of her superiors.  One thing was highlighted in a piece about her case today by Orla O'Connor of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  She pointed out that after suffering all of this injustice, Ms Moynihan was then denied access to information that she sought from within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  She was denied access to information on file.</p><p>Her treatment, the injustice done to her and the difficulties she had in accessing information should all be borne in mind in debating the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  We commenced Committee Stage consideration last week but it became clear quickly that the Minister's amendments fall far short of what is required to be done in the interests not only of adopted people but of birth mothers.  All of us in Irish society need to ensure that we have a robust framework that is sufficiently protective of the human rights of those involved, the women and children to whom the State did such injustice.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and the Government need to reflect on the injustice that has been highlighted by the Moynihan case.  They need to reflect on what it says about us as a society and what it says about how we should construct the legal framework in the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  I and my Labour Party colleagues have put forward an amendment seeking to address some of the serious flaws in the Minister's Bill.  We need to take some serious time to consider it and engage in dialogue with the Adoption Rights Alliance and others before we can progress the Bill, given what we know now about injustices done to so many women who were forced, coerced or compelled to hand up children for adoption.</p></speech>

Is olc linn bhur mbris.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a n-anamacha.</p> <p>I want to follow on from issues raised by Senators McFadden and Gallagher, in that what I have to say touches on both the issue of vacant premises and the pressures on businesses.  Since the recent local elections, new councillors have been having their first meetings within their municipal districts.  It is a shame that there is one issue they will be unable to consider properly.  It is one of the most burning issues facing local communities within their remit, that is to say, the issue of commercial rates.</p> <p>One of the provisions of the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 is to allow councillors at municipal level to vary commercial rates by business type or geographical area.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, told the Seanad last December that a rates consolidation Bill would be introduced this year.  The Bill I have just mentioned was introduced in the D&aacute;il in January and passed Second Stage there on 30 January.  Unfortunately, it has not progressed any further since then.</p> <p>We are all concerned about the state of some of our rural towns and we are all well aware of the threats faced by small retail businesses in towns, small and large, throughout the country.  They are facing the dual pressures of having large multiples located outside the towns and of online selling.  Many of these small business must grapple with issues such as red tape, regulations, tax returns, managing the rights and entitlements of their employees and so forth in a way that large multiples simply do not.  Large multiples do not have the same difficulty because they have the resources to deal easily with these issues.  Of course online retailers do not have to deal with many of these issues at all.</p> <p>We know that despite the economic recovery, a great many towns have considerable vacant shop space on their main streets.  During one of our recent debates on gambling and gambling addiction, I observed that the only type of business that seemed to be thriving on every main street in Ireland was the betting shop.  In recent days I spoke to two different business owners.  One, who was in Ballinasloe, spoke about the hefty bill of &euro;12,000 for rates.  He pointed across the road to a small business that had recently closed down.  It was another vacant premises.  The closure was partly because of the pressure of the inability to meet, among other things, the rates.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Another business in the midlands with which I spoke is facing a similar bill.  The owners said they afforded it but they objected on principle and were going to fight it.  They pointed to their business, which has oodles of potential.  With a hefty rates bill they simply will not have the resources to develop it the way they want and provide employment, which in the end would benefit the Exchequer so much more.  The Bill could give authorities at municipal level the power to apply lower rates to smaller family-owned businesses on a town's main street, perhaps to be balanced by a higher rate for large multiples based in retail parks at the edge of towns.  That kind of localised assessment of needs and localised response would allow smaller businesses based in the centres of towns the breathing space they need to survive, let alone to grow.  If the Leader agree, I request for the Local Government (Rates) Bill 2018 to be progressed as a matter of urgency to allow new municipal councillors to consider this issue in their areas.  Perhaps the Leader could kindly enquire of the Minister what is delaying the Bill.  It has been said many times recently that the D&aacute;il is not overburdened with legislation, so it is strange to me that such a worthwhile measure should languish with no progress for seven months.</p></speech>

My contribution today is on a light note.  Sometimes we can be quite local in here, but I am going to bring the discussion even closer and talk about my daughter, Jordanne.  She is currently the lead in a film.  I was coming through town today and I got to see her face plastered across a bus, which was a wonderful moment.  It got me thinking about how she ended up there in the first place.  It stemmed from a collaboration between Killinarden Community Centre and the director, Mr. Frank Berry, the creator of "Ballymun Lullaby", who then went on to make a community-based film on youth mental health.  That created two amazing actors, one of whom went on to star in "Michael Inside" and won an Irish Film and Television Academy, IFTA, film and drama award for doing so.  Jordanne is also award-winning and IFTA-nominated.  It shows the importance of actors, directors, producers and people in the arts going into the hearts of communities that do not ordinarily have access to theatre schools or connections.  It was a wonderful moment to see her on the bus.  She is a young working-class woman with a huge passion and talent all her own.  I wanted to acknowledge that the opportunity, though not her talent, originated from a director working directly with a community to unearth talent and give it a platform.

Our condolences on this loss and to our esteemed colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, on the death of his mother, Peggie.  Paul is lucky to have had his mother when he is so mature in life.  We were not all lucky enough to have our mothers for so long, but it is still a big loss.  We all have only one mother.</p> <p>I wish to ask the Leader of the House if he could elaborate on the situation of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016.  It has been mentioned already.  I have never received more genuine emails on any other issue that has come up in the House in my 17 years here.  I was trying to download one just before I came.  I got a very heartfelt email from a woman in her 70s.  There is something wrong with this Bill.  I have read it and I believe it is not right.  There is some cover-up-----</p></speech>

Nobody could think that Tusla would be given the right to decide to find out where a mother was or who she was.  A person is entitled to that information as it is a human right and it is about time this country was opened up.  We should stop the cover-ups.

The loss of a brother or sister is tough and I have had to face it myself, with two sisters and one brother now gone.  I wish the Cathaoirleach well as he works his way through this time.</p> <p>We had a debate today on class K PRSI and how it applied to Members of the Oireachtas.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, changed the class of PRSI that applied to city and county councillors in 2016 and brought them into class S.  It is my hope that we will find some way to do that for Members of the Oireachtas.  I would like a debate on the terms and conditions that apply to Members of the Oireachtas and members of city and county councils.  We do not have the same terms and conditions as any other worker in the State.</p></speech>

We do not have generous pension schemes.  All that anybody who is here for a short period of time can expect to get is about &euro;8,000 or &euro;9,000, which is hardly generous.  One thing that needs to be looked at is access to additional voluntary contributions, in particular, last-minute additional voluntary contributions.  These should be available to city and county councillors, many of whom are finding that because of the change that took place from class K to class S, they are not in a reckonable year for welfare once they have lost their seat.  Not everybody in a council has two jobs and for quite a number of them, it is their only employment.  We need to have an open and honest debate about this.  What are we afraid of?  I could not care less what people think about me arguing for our terms and conditions of employment.  We are employees of this State like anybody, albeit that we are called "officers" of the State.</p></speech>

She is a sad loss.  She left Ireland and west Cork when I was a few months old and I did not meet her until I was eight.  We became very close and I wish I had the strength she had to deal with a life abroad as a young girl.  She had lots of ups and downs but one thing that always struck me was how she never complained, even up to her final days.  I will sadly miss her.  I thank all the people who offered me their condolences.  I did not expect this to happen on the Order of Business but I was not in a position to stop it.  I sincerely thank you all.</p></speech>

It is testament to the Cathaoirleach's integrity that he is here today when he did not have to be.  We thank him for that.  I am pleased that the Cathaoirleach was able to go to New York to visit his sister before she passed away.

That is a testament to both their political acumen and the value put on this House.</p><p>I thank the 20 Members of the House for their contributions to the Order of Business.  Senator Ardagh raised the issue of eye health.  I agree with her about the need for an effective test, and I would be happy to have the Minister for Health come to the House regarding the matter.  She also raised the issue of knife crime, which I dealt with in last week's Order of Business.  There has been an increase in the number of knife acquisitions, and a strategy is being compiled by the Government which is awaiting publication.  It is important that we also recognise the need for a whole-of-community response.  Some 2,000 knives were confiscated last year, up from 1,200 in 2016, which is a startling increase.  There is a need for a strategy and the Government is working on that.</p><p>Senator McDowell raised the Perjury and Related Offences Bill.  I know Senator Craughwell will intervene on this, but I wish people would listen to the replies on the Order of Business.  I said last week that it would be before the House this coming week.  It was supposed to come in this week but has not for different reasons.  We are working with Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh on its progression through the House and the intent is to have it here next week, as I said last week.</p></speech>

Neither do I, but the Government published a plan yesterday, and one aspect of that plan is reducing dependency on cars, which is a good thing.  Senator Mulherin said that human behaviour is required to change.</p> <p>Senator McDowell raised a pertinent point regarding data centres and electricity.  I remind and alert the Senator to the fact that data centres both here in Ireland and across Europe are pioneering green technologies and are leading the way in energy efficient practices and renewable energies.  These include advanced energy efficient cooling technologies, free cooling which reduces the use of electricity, and aiming for 100% sustainable energy zones using solar, water, and wind power.  We can learn from the model used in Stockholm, and their innovative ideas whereby they reduce excess heat through the design and build of the infrastructure.  That is important.  I hear the Senator's point and it is a good one, but here in Ireland, the data centres have been trying to make huge progress around energy efficiency, and the issues of construction and design are important going into the future.</p> <p>I am not going to accept Senator McDowell's amendment to the Order of Business.  I amended the Order of Business, as proposed, last Thursday.  I understand that Senators have the right to vote against it, but a proposal was circulated in the schedule last Thursday for seven hours of debate.  In the spirit of collegiality, and given the events of the past 24 hours, I took a decision not to have seven hours of debate in the event that we might have a temporary Chair today.  I propose three and a half hours, and I will put that to the House.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have been engaged on this Bill for 12 months in this House.

I had the pleasure of working in a hospital as a porter when going to college.  I do not know where Senator Rose Conway-Walsh came up with her phraseology.  Many of us on this side of the House, including me, value, appreciate and understand the importance and centrality of all these workers.  They provide a great service through support, catering, secretarial, portering and domestic work.  The hospital would not function without them.  I certainly recognise they have a legitimate claim.  Those who have put forward the view in question, many of whom are trade unionists, know full well there is a role for the mechanism called the Labour Court in this.</p></speech>

This is an important matter.  These workers have entitlements and grievances that should be heard.  I appeal to all sides to re-engage at this 11th hour.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also raised the issue of school places.  I do not have the answer to his question but the Senator has a reasonable request and concern.  I do not have the answer as to why Senator Reilly's Bill has not been progressed.  I would be happy to engage with both Senators again on the matter.</p> <p>Senators Horkan, Leyden and Bacik raised the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  I am happy to listen to and meet Senator Horkan, the Fianna F&aacute;il acting Whip, about his concerns over the Bill proceeding tomorrow, and I would also be happy to meet Senators Bacik and Leyden.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to be fair to her, did engage.  It is a very sensitive, delicate Bill.  Senator Bacik spoke about learning from the past.  Whatever else one says about the Minister, she is very considerate, measured and caring and she has engaged on this Bill.  We need to strike a balance between the rights of the birth mother who has requested privacy and allowed her baby to be adopted and the right of the adoptee to have information.  I do not want in any way to pour scorn on any of the concerns raised by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, who has spoken to me about this, or the concerns of others.  I would be happy to talk to them after the Order of Business regarding the scheduling of the Bill tomorrow.  The last thing we want is to have the Bill made into a political football.  Many of us, including as Chairmen of committees, have engaged on this Bill.  Senator Reilly was a Minister responsible for children.  There are constitutional issues associated with the Bill and advice has been given to the Minister but I hear the Senators' concerns and will not engage in an adversarial way.  To be fair to Senator Horkan, he has before today raised the matter with me, as have Senators Marie-Louise O'Donnell, &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Bacik.  I would be happy to hear their comments afterwards.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the Land Development Agency.  It is up and running.  It has a budget of &euro;20 million.  The Senator referred to the Bill.  That is required to get &euro;1.25 billion.  The agency is hiring.  There are eight sites being progressed, with seven more in the pipeline.  Mr. John Moran was appointed interim chairman of the board.  The Minister is making progress on the Bill.  He has been engaged in a number of back-and-forth discussions with various parties.  My information is that the Bill will be back with us in the coming weeks.  It is not delaying the work of the agency.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I appreciate Senator Boyhan's concerns regarding that matter.</p><p>I do not have an answer to Senator Murnane O'Connor's question regarding Cathy Reddy.

The Judicial Council Bill will be in the House this week.  We all agree there is a need to tackle compensation culture.  This requires collective buy-in regarding this matter.</p> <p>Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's proposal for a new ministry deserves consideration.  Senator Feighan raised the issue of the Tory leadership race in the UK, a debate into which I will not enter.  I congratulate the Roscommon football team on its victory last Sunday.</p> <p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of Majella Moynihan.  I join with all Members in saying that what happened to her was wrong.  The story is about Majella Moynihan and how she was treated badly.  I thank the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality for the way in which they reached out and their speedy apologies to her.  The case was of a different time.  Perhaps we should all reflect upon from where we have come.  It is about Majella Moynihan.  We should applaud and support her bravery.  We must hope we never go back to those days or allow such situations to happen again.</p> <p>I congratulate Senator Ruane's daughter, Jordanne, on her achievements.  The point the Senator made about collaboration in the arts field is important, especially in communities where there may not be many avenues open for careers in acting.  It just shows that if one has a dream, good fortune and motivation, one can do anything.</p></speech>

I am also pleased to report that it received general support on its recent passage through the Lower House.  I do not wish to tempt fate or indeed the dispositions of Senators but I hope it might receive similar general support here.  The Criminal Justice (Mutual Recognition of Probation Judgments and Decisions) Bill will give effect to the provisions of EU Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments and probation decisions with a view to the supervision of probation measures and alternative sanctions.</p> <p>The Bill is quite technical legislation but it has a very simple purpose.  Its aim is to facilitate a person who is under the supervision of the probation service in one EU member state but who lives in another member state to return home and continue his or her supervision there.  The purpose of a probation order is to prevent reoffending through offender rehabilitation.  A key part of rehabilitation is reintegration into the community, and this is very challenging if the person is away from his or her home, family and community.  This Bill will create the legal framework to facilitate the return of a person to his or her home country while ensuring that the necessary probation supervision continues and that the legal consequences for failing to engage with that supervision can be enforced, if necessary.</p> <p>The Bill transposes an EU framework decision and the text of the Bill closely mirrors the requirements of that framework decision.  The framework decision is founded on the principle of freedom of movement and the consequent need to ensure that non-residents subject to criminal proceedings are not treated differently from residents.  This framework decision is one of a number of measures designed to ensure that the courts have the same options open to them for dealing with non-residents as they have for residents and that the member state criminal justice systems can recognise and enforce one another's judgements as EU citizens move between member states.</p> <p>The Bill applies to individuals who commit an offence while temporarily in another member state, perhaps on holidays or working or studying abroad for a short period.  The benefits of the measure may best be illustrated by some practical examples.  If a person living in Ireland goes on holiday to another member state and commits an offence for which the court in that member state imposes a community service order, that person would have to stay in that state, potentially for months, to carry out his or her community service there.  He or she would be away from family and perhaps lose a job or accommodation.  The consequences could be quite significant for the sentenced person, much more so than for a person resident in the state who is in the same circumstances and receives the same penalty.</p> <p>Under this Bill, that person could have his or her community service order transferred to Ireland.  He or she could return to the State, carry on working and living with his or her family and carry out the community service order under the supervision of the Irish Probation Service.  Transferring a probation decision under the Bill requires the consent of the person concerned so it cannot be used to remove a person from one state to another if he or she does not wish to go.  The benefits for the individual are obvious and this is likely to encourage compliance with the probation decision.  If the person fails to comply with the community service order, the Probation Service could enforce the order through the Irish courts, so the community protection element is there too.</p> <p>The Bill also provides for probation orders or community service orders imposed by the Irish courts on individuals who are not resident in this State to transfer those orders to the person's home state if the person wishes to return home.  An example would be a member state student studying in Ireland over the summer who commits an offence for which a one-year probation order is imposed.  Under the provisions of this Bill, that order could be transferred to the person's home state to allow him or her to return home and continue studying while still undergoing the necessary probation supervision to divert him or her from further offending.</p> <p>There are, of course, many Irish citizens working and living across the EU who could also benefit from the provisions in this Bill.  It is important to note that the measure encompasses not only probation and community service orders but also other types of probation supervision, which can arise in respect of more serious offending.  These include suspended sentences involving probation supervision and post-release supervision following a prison sentence.  This Bill potentially could facilitate the transfer into and out of the State of serious offenders who may have served a prison sentence and are subject to several years of post-release supervision.  This is perhaps an even more important aspect of the measure as rehabilitation is so important in such cases.  Having somewhere to live and family support will assist such offenders in reintegrating into society and reduce the risk of reoffending.  Communities are safer when probation is successful.</p> <p>I will outline in more detail the contents of the Bill, which contains 32 sections and largely reflects the EU framework decision.  Section 2 is a standard general interpretation provision for terms that will be used throughout the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The section also specifies that any word or expression used in the Act and the framework decision shall have the same meaning unless the context requires otherwise.  Section 3 provides that the Act will not apply to a judgment that is handed down before the commencement of the Act.  Section 4 specifies that the courts and the Minister for Justice and Equality will be designated as the competent authorities for the framework decision.  Section 5 enables the Minister to designate appropriate persons to carry out certain functions under the Bill.  Section 6 empowers the Minister to make regulations.  Section 7 is a standard provision on the payment of expenses.</p><p>Part 2 establishes the rules and procedures to apply where Ireland is the state that issues the probation judgment.  Section 10 provides that a request to forward a probation judgment to another member state may be initiated by either the director of the Probation Service or the person who is the subject of the probation decision.  Section 11 provides that a probation judgment may only be forwarded to the member in which where the person habitually resides with the person's consent and when any appeal process has been completed.  The Minister is not obliged to transfer a judgment to another member state.  In limited circumstances, a judgment may be forwarded to a member state other than that in which the person resides, with the consent of that state.</p><p>Part 3 establishes the rules and procedures to apply where Ireland is the state executing the judgment, that is, where the person subject to a probation order is coming to Ireland to have his or her probation supervised in this State.  Sections 17 to 19, inclusive, define a number of important terms in the Part and set out the types of probation measures the State may recognise and supervise under the Bill.  Sections 20 and 22 address several procedural steps that may be taken where documentation received is incomplete or sent to the wrong place, and to establish evidential rules.  Section 21 permits the Minister to accept a request to transfer a person who is not normally resident in the State from another member state where that person either is an Irish citizen or has close ties to the State.</p><p>Sections 23 and 24 establish the procedure for accepting or refusing a request to transfer a sentenced person into the State.  The request is first examined by the Minister and may be refused if certain grounds apply.  Where no refusal grounds apply, an application is made to the court to endorse the judgment.  The court again examines the request for refusal grounds and, if none is present, it is obliged to endorse the judgment.  Grounds for refusal include incomplete documentation, immunity, specialist treatment not being available, lack of consent and the judgment falling outside the scope of the framework decision.  Section 24 also allows the court to adapt the nature or duration of the probation measure to make it compatible with comparable measures under national law.  The purpose of such adaptation is to ensure that the probation measure can be supervised and that national law will apply in cases of non-compliance.  If the court endorses the judgment, section 28 provides that the Minister must recognise it and take the necessary steps to begin supervision of the person.</p><p>Section 25 makes specific provision for judgments relating to a suspended sentence or conditional release to ensure that such judgments correspond with the comparable provisions in national law.  This section also provides that the court must specify the prison to which the sentenced person is to be committed in case of revocation of a suspended sentence or conditional release.  Section 26 establishes a time limit of 60 days for the court to make a decision on recognition of a judgment.  Section 27 provides for the notification of interested parties.  Section 29 sets out the information the Minister must provide to the other member state in respect of a judgment that has been transferred into the State.  Section 30 provides that responsibility for taking a decision to revoke a conditional release for non-compliance, where such a decision would have to be taken by a court in the issuing state, remains with the issuing state.  Revocation of temporary release is an executive function in this State, so this provision ensures judicial decision-making power is retained in such circumstances.  The person may give evidence to the court in the issuing state by video link.  Section 31 provides that a person may not appeal the original judgment in the executing state.  Finally, section 32 provides that responsibility for the judgment and the supervision of the person will transfer back to the issuing state if the person absconds or is prosecuted for another offence in that State.</p><p>This is lengthy and technical legislation, which is necessary to ensure that the EU framework decision is fully transposed and to establish a clear and legally sound framework for the transfer of probation orders between member states.  Notwithstanding its complexity, its aims are straightforward.  It establishes a mechanism to return non-resident offenders to their home country, subject to probation measures, while supporting rehabilitation and ensuring the necessary enforcement options are available to local authorities to ensure the safety of the public.  Members will be aware of the valuable work with offenders carried out by the Probation Service.  The service has been actively involved in preparing the proposals in this Bill and identifying the structures to be put in place to begin operating the new measures, which can be done without delay.  It is difficult to estimate the number of people who may wish to transfer probation supervision under these provisions, but it is not likely to be a great number, at least in the short term.  However, for those who find themselves abroad, away from family and community supports, it will be a valuable tool to support rehabilitation and reintegration, with the ultimate goal of providing safer communities.  I commend the Bill to the House and hope Senators will find a way to support it.</p></speech>

It would be helpful if copies of his statement were circulated to Members.  I understand that the aim of this Bill, which was passed in the D&aacute;il on 12 June 2019, is to facilitate persons who are under the supervision of probation services in one EU member state to return to their home member state and continue their supervision there.  The Minister said that the Bill is technical in nature but has a simple purpose, and he outlined that purpose clearly.  I took the time to read up on the Bill and its provisions make sense.  Its purpose is to create a legal framework to facilitate the return of a person to his or her home country while ensuring that the necessary probation supervision continues and that the legal consequences of failing to engage with the supervision may be enforced.</p> <p>The Minister indicated that probation decisions may only be transferred under the Bill where the person concerned has moved or wants to move back to his or her home state.  I am seeking clarification and assurance that the Bill will not and cannot be used to remove a person from one state to another if he or she does not wish to go.</p> <p>He said the Probation Service will have the structures in place to implement these provisions.  I acknowledge the work done by the service, particularly in the area of rehabilitation, which is an important aspect of our judicial system.  Will he comment on whether the service has the necessary resources in terms of rehabilitation and reintegration which, as he rightly said, are important facets of the legislation?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I commend the legislation.

I also welcome the Minister to the House.  He is nearly as permanent a feature as the House itself at this stage.  This Bill is welcome.  It makes common sense.  It feeds into the narrative of the importance of restorative justice.  It is another angle and approach to restorative justice.</p> <p>In the previous Seanad, I tabled a motion, passed unanimously by those of all parties and none, on the importance of developing restorative justice programmes in this country.  Some are under way, particularly in south Dublin and north Tipperary.  As a result of the motion, the then justice committee carried out very impressive work on the potential of restorative justice and community courts.  It did a separate piece of work on both.  I would like to see this reactivated as a discussion point in the Houses of the Oireachtas that would lead to action points.  What was sought in my motion was the extension to the rest of the country, at least on a pilot basis, of the restorative justice programme that was working so successfully in south Dublin and north Tipperary.</p> <p>We would like to see the pilot community court for the city of Dublin elaborated on and developed.  There are better ways of operating than what we have been doing heretofore.  This Bill is an incremental step in the right direction.  I commend the Minister on making time, despite his very busy portfolio, to introduce this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

As the Minister will know from our approach in the Lower House, Sinn F&eacute;in supports this legislation, which, as our colleagues have rightly said and the Minister has acknowledged, is complex.  It is important, however, that we have a uniform approach to it in this House as it progresses given its significance and importance.</p> <p>I agree with the remarks of my colleague, Senator Clifford-Lee, on the delay.  It is my understanding that the deadline for the implementation of this legislation was 2011.  It is disappointing that it has taken so long, regardless of its complexity or otherwise.</p> <p>There are bespoke arrangements necessary given the experience of the legal system across this island and between these islands.  The Minister will know there are a number of well-known and controversial cases in Britain.  I am curious, not least within the context of Brexit but regardless of whether Brexit occurs, to know the current arrangements that exist between Britain and Ireland and the North and the South.  Are there plans to deal with some of the anomalies and complexities where they present themselves in respect of probation?</p></speech>

I have no issues with the Bill at all.  The Minister touched on most of the relevant points when he went through the sections.  My objective has been to gain an understanding of the probation services in each country and how comparable they are across Europe.  We are to harmonise probation so probation may be finished in another country.  Is there a mechanism to determine that the standard of probation and its implementation are the same as in Ireland?  How are the probationary conditions measured from state to state?  Consider the case of someone who has the remainder of a sentence suspended.  Where sexual offences or offences against a child are concerned, some EU countries have very strong monitoring systems.  In Ireland, we do not have sex registers.  What are the agreements between the states on harmonising the implementation of the laws?  Consider the example of drugs offences.  What occurs if someone goes home from Ireland to Portugal, where the Irish drugs offence is not recognised?  Does the individual not require any probation because the Portuguese state has completely different laws?  These are technical questions on how communication occurs and how the systems are comparable.  Where somebody commits a crime of a sexual nature here and returns to another European Union country with a strong sex register or programme for the rehabilitation of sex offenders that Ireland does not have, how is this managed?  What are the conversations around this?  Does it not matter at all if the probation services are completely different in the country to which the individual is returning home?</p></speech>

I indicate my support for the passage of this legislation.  There is a point I often wondered about because it practically arose when I occupied the office the Minister now holds.  I refer to the circumstances that obtain when a person is found not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered to be detained in the Central Mental Hospital.  If such a person leaves the Central Mental Hospital, on escorted or unescorted day leave or otherwise, which is quite frequently the case, and absconds to a foreign jurisdiction, is there any method of getting him or her back?  Is the individual effectively free because he or she has not been convicted and there is no sentence to be imposed?  My memory of the problem, which arose when I was Minister, was twigged by paragraph (16) of Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA, which reads:</p><blockquote>A Member State may refuse to recognise a judgment and, where applicable, a probation decision, if the judgment concerned was issued against a person who has not been found guilty, such as in the case of a mentally ill person, and the judgment or, where applicable, the probation decision provides for medical/therapeutic treatment which the executing State cannot supervise in respect of such persons under its national law.</blockquote> <p>If somebody charged with murder and acquitted on grounds of insanity is given day release from the Central Mental Hospital, escorted or unescorted, to visit family but absconds to Northern Ireland or somewhere else in the European Union, and has not been found guilty of an offence, the ordinary laws of such a place would not allow the person to be put into a corresponding mental institution.  The individual would effectively be able to abscond and set at naught the Irish court's decision.</p><p>When I saw the echo in the recitals to the framework directive, I was struck by the fact that we should attempt, if at all possible, to arrange for a new measure - I believe framework decisions are a thing of the past - allowing for the rendition of such people back to the state they left, subject to whatever safeguards are necessary, much along the lines of the European arrest warrant.  Without it, it seems there is a little bit of a hole in the system.  On one occasion, of which I had knowledge as Minister, there was nothing we could do about it at all.</p></speech>

I cannot see how there can be a reciprocal arrangement under current Irish law.  For example, I do not believe the transfer of sentenced persons legislation between EU states or Council of Europe states covers the point raised by Senator McDowell.  I will reflect on the issue between now and Committee Stage.  I am happy to come back to it, albeit having regard to the fact that we are not covered.</p></speech>

In answer to Senator Ruane, we are dealing with the recognition of probation judgments and decisions, as distinct from persons who would be serving prison sentences for serious crimes and misdemeanours.  However, the point the Senator makes would have application in the event of post-release supervision in a signature country.  There would be mutual recognition of frameworks, so it would not be possible for somebody to evade or avoid post-release supervision in one country that would not be applicable here or in another state.  For probation and supervision, the framework would be broadly similar, because we are dealing with the application of the principle of mutual recognition of judgments on probation decisions.  It is about harmonisation.  I think that was the word used.</p> <p>To come back to what Senator Boyhan said, the purpose of the Bill is simple: to allow a person placed under the supervision of probation services in one EU member state but who lives in another to return home.  I acknowledge that there has been somewhat of a delay, as was mentioned by Senator Clifford-Lee. There are a number of reasons for that, the first of which is that the Bill will not have a huge application.  It was not considered an urgent priority.  Second, I have 115 Bills on my desk at various stages of debate.  I availed myself of this window today to progress this one, which, although reasonably limited in application, nevertheless awaits processing.  Of those 115 Bills, it is my intention to seek the co-operation of the House to process to finality ten of these over the next four weeks.  I acknowledge the co-operation of the House on this Bill.</p></speech>

A limited number of amendments have been proposed to a Bill with a pretty wide, reforming application.  We will come back to that on Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>The Bill before us will increase the chances of social reintegration of offenders by ensuring that the probation measures imposed on a person can be followed up and supervised in the country in which they reside.  On resources, similar to my reply to Senator Clifford-Lee, I can tell Senator Boyhan that we do not envisage a huge number of people applying.  Therefore, it is unlikely to strain resources in the probation services.  If a number of Irish people in EU states wish to return home, the likelihood is that there might well be a corresponding number of persons in this jurisdiction who will wish to avail themselves of the mutual recognition.  However, although not many people will seek to avail themselves of a remedy under the legislation, for those who do, it will have a significant impact on their lives.  It is therefore important legislation, and I look forward to coming back to discuss the issues in more detail as the Bill passes through the House.</p> <p>I will respond briefly to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, who made an important point about the UK.  The UK has opted out of this framework decision, and so these measures will not apply as might otherwise be the case.</p></speech>

The reference to &quot;Any statement made or published under this Part&quot; refers to a statement proposed by the procedures committee, approved by the commission and published by it under this part of the Bill.  The amendment proposes that each such statement &quot;shall state that no applicant for judicial office may be questioned, interviewed or required in any way so as to express any opinion as to how any particular issue of law or matter of legal controversy (including matters of constitutional interpretation or amendment) should be decided or should have been decided by the courts&quot;.  It would apply to the commission questioning applicants in the course of an interview, interviewing them, asking them to fill out a questionnaire or anything of the kind in which they would be invited to express opinions as to how a particular issue of law or matter of legal controversy, including a constitutional interpretation or amendment, should be decided or should have been decided by the courts.  In other words, applicants should not be asked about what should happen or asked to comment on past decisions of the courts as part of the interview process.  Curiously, the Senate judiciary committee in the United States of America has such a convention, in that any person whose nomination is being considered by the committee on foot of a nomination by the President of the United States cannot be asked to express his or her views on matters of legal controversy or on how he or she would decide particular legal issues.</p><p>It seems to me that in the debate on the previous amendment there was a remarkable paucity of suggestions from Government Senators in attendance or, indeed, the Minister as to precisely how one would, in the case of a judge, for example, interview him or her and what questions would be put to a judge one way or the other.  It is fair to say that the suggestion was eventually made that a judge might wish to emphasise some aspect of his or her curriculum vitae and draw it to the attention of the interviewing panel, but that is not a very clear reason judges should be interviewed.  Given that the Minister set his face against amendment No. 97da, which provided for the interviewing of serving judges in the superior courts in respect of applications to vacancies in those courts, the necessity for this amendment becomes all the clearer.  In effect, if a sitting member of the Judiciary could legitimately be asked to comment on legal matters such as a legal controversy or a particular issue of law, including matters of constitutional interpretation or amendment, the interviewing panel of the commission would be seeking to elicit the attitude of a serving judge to what may be live legal issues or issues of legal controversy.  If such a line of questioning were legitimate, one would have a situation whereby the judicial appointments commission or some of its members conducting an interview would be in a position to differentiate between applicants for judicial office by reference to their outlook on matters of judicial controversy, decided case law, how cases should be decided or how the law should be amended and so on.  To have serving judges exposed to such questioning would radically subvert their independence.  To do so in the context of evaluating whether they should be recommended for appointment would be absolutely-----</p></speech>

If that is the case for the Executive, it must be doubly so for a group which is not the Executive and is not politically accountable for the appointments that are made.</p> <p>This amendment is designed to make it absolutely clear that applicants, particularly serving judges but also persons who are not serving judges because it does not differentiate between the two, should in no sense feel that when they apply to the Judicial Appointments Commission with a view to being recommended to the Government for appointment, any answer they would give on any particular issue of law or matter of legal controversy, including constitutional interpretation or amendment, would in any sense be asked of them or appear even potentially to influence the outcome of the commission's deliberations.

That said, I wait to be persuaded of this amendment and I am not 100% sure which way I am going to vote.  I look forward to Senator McDowell's further contributions to elucidate this because what other questions is the commission going to ask?  What else could it ask?   It would be interesting to know how somebody would decide on a constitutional matter of interpretation or amendment because, as Senator McDowell said, the Government might want to put somebody on the Bench who was of a conservative or liberal point of view.  This would be one way of finding out.</p></speech>

I will not dwell too much other than to say that I contacted the Courts Service today.  There have been 45 appointments in the various categories of judges, including the Chief Justice, two in the Supreme Court, five in the Court of Appeal, 15 in the High Court, ten in the Circuit Court, and 13 in the District Court.  The Minister knows that.  All of those appointments have happened under this Administration and they are good, legitimate appointments of high-standing judges.  I take exception to the commentary I have heard about judges in this country, people who have served us well.  That is important.</p><p>I will not drift on to the topic of the letter in <i>The Irish Times</i>but I penned a letter to that newspaper today about this matter which I hope will be published in the next few days.  We have a system that has worked exceptionally well, despite everything that has been said.  The Minister and Government have confirmed and recommended these appointments as judges, as is right and fit.  I do not know where we are going on all of this.  We have a system that works well.</p></speech>

A total of 45 appointments have been made, many of them to the superior courts, and none of those applicants, to my knowledge, has ever been asked a question by a member of the Executive as to their attitude to a particular issue, how they would decide it, or what they make of a particular decision made by the Supreme Court six months ago, or three years ago, or five years ago.  They have never been asked about their views on constitutional interpretation.  There have been 45 appointments, more than half in the superior courts, and none of the appointees has ever been asked such a question.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That being the case, I want to make absolutely clear that this Bill will not authorise the judicial appointments commission to evaluate applicants for the Judiciary by reference to their potential decisions in future.  That is none of the commission's business.  It concerns me that I do not see any signal of acceptance of this proposition by the Minister but I would be glad to hear his views on the matter.  Does the Minister believe it would be legitimate for either a serving judge or an applicant for a position in the superior courts to be asked for his or her views on legal issues or on particular issues of law or legal controversy?<br/><br/>This raises a point to which Senator Norris adverted.  What else should they be asked about?  In turn, this goes back to my plea on the previous amendment.  Why should they be interviewed at all?  This goes back to the debate when I challenged Government party Senators to come up with a single relevant question that one would put to a judge to determine whether he or she was suitable for recommendation.  The best answer I got was from Senator Noone.  In an extreme stretch of the imagination she said that perhaps candidates could be asked whether there was anything about themselves that they would like to draw to the attention of the commission and that they had not managed to say in their curriculum vitae or application form.  That was the best she could do.  In fairness, she was being utterly honest and decent in saying that was the best question or topic she could think of in respect of a question that might be asked of candidates.<br/><br/>We are now in a situation where I want to make it absolutely clear that the decision on whether someone is conservative or liberal and should or should not be appointed on that ground is one for the Government alone.  It is not a matter for the <i>ex officio</i>members, including the Chief Justice or a President of any of the courts or the Attorney General, although the Attorney General is free to advise the Government on these matters.  It is certainly not a matter for laypeople.  It is certainly not a matter for the two professional body representatives or a representative of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to start fishing for the attitude of the candidate to human rights issues.  That is not the function of an external commission.  Even to allow the members of the commission for a minute to think that would be a permissible territory of interview of applicants is to reinforce the notion that it is they who are making the substantive decision on who gets on the Bench rather than the Executive.<br/><br/>This speaks to the fundamental constitutional falsity of this Bill.  It is intended to create the impression that, to use the words of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, politicians should have no real function in determining who should be on the Bench.  That is what this Bill was intended to do.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, has stated the intent was to end what he called political cronyism.  I do not believe there is political cronyism.  Happily, Senator Boyhan did not enlighten us on who the particular people were on the list he got from the Courts Service today, but there are many fine people on the list.  I do not believe for one minute that this Government has appointed any one of them on the basis of political affiliation or cronyism.  They have all been merit-based appointments as far as I can see.  Insofar as I can divine, they cross any political allegiance held in the past by any of them.  I notice there is a considerable degree of cross-party appointment, to use that phrase, although I regard it as unfortunate.  That was the case when Rory Brady and I functioned as Attorney General from 2002 to 2007.  I do not believe there is cronyism.<br/><br/>The one thing I do not want as the price of appeasing the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his desire to pretend absolutely falsely that politicians will have no further function in the appointment of judges is to create for a moment the idea among the public that those who go into what will necessarily be a confidential interview process will be asked whether they are liberal on the subject of gay rights or the right to life or where they stand on such issues or how they would approach a given category of case with the view to creating in the minds of the public the notion that the commission effectively vets people on their outlook and complies a shortlist based on interrogation of candidates with a view to working out whether they are on the liberal-conservative spectrum, the human rights-legislative rights spectrum or the Irish independence-European integrationist spectrum and so on.  Candidates should not be asked such questions in private.  Worse still, I do not want applicants for judicial office ever to think that if they went into an interview of this kind, whether they were sitting judges or would-be appointees to the Bench, that they would be viewed by the judicial appointments commission as meritorious based on their evinced attitude to such issues.  Otherwise we will have political correctness gone mad.  We will have people going in there saying they know the background of the five people on the interview panel or the representative from the human rights commission and will make the right noises and in consequence secure judicial office.  That would be a complete subversion of the truth and of the right of the Executive to make its discretionary decisions on those issues without regard to what the Chief Justice thinks of those issues or whatever else.</p></speech>

If there is one thing we can do to improve this Bill, it is to make absolutely clear that the function of looking at the philosophical outlook of the applicant, in terms of liberal-conservative and the rest of it, is exclusively a matter for the Executive and cannot be delegated to a group of judges, practising barristers and solicitors, laypeople or human rights commission people.  It cannot be delegated to them and they should have no function when they are composing their shortlist in taking those considerations into account.</p> <p>Unless I get satisfaction from the Minister that he agrees with me on this issue, and unless he agrees that it is not the function of these people to do their shortlist by reference to liberalism or conservatism of a legal kind, then I get the impression that the hope is that this commission will take those kinds of matters into account and will, by doing so, usurp the Government's prerogative in this matter.  It is the attitude of the Government that matters not of unelected people on the commission who would not be responsible to the people.</p></speech>

Taking into account that there is no facility whatever in this legislation, as I understand it, for the Government to question any judicial candidate, how would the Executive find out the views of the person unless these kinds of questions were asked by someone at some stage?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Second, will the Minister confirm that the subject and content of the interview will remain private?

Senator McDowell knows well that in no place does the Bill provide for the type of question that may be asked in an interview, if there is an interview at all.  I do not accept that the concept of interviewing judges is as repugnant as the Senator leads us to believe.  I have listened to his comments on the amendment which I do not propose to accept in its current form.  However, without agreeing with the substance of the Senator's argument, I acknowledge that there may be some merit in introducing a safeguard to ensure there cannot be the type of scenario envisaged by him cannot.  As I said, there is no reference anywhere in the Bill to permitting the line of questioning evidenced by him.  However, in advance of Report Stage, I will consider including a safeguard to ensure there will not be the line of questioning referred to by him.</p> <p>I urge Senators to consider the situation in other common law jurisdictions.  I agree with what Senator Boyhan said about appointments.  It is not necessary for me to say, once again, that, as far as I am concerned, appointments by the Government are being made strictly on a meritorious basis, as has been acknowledged in the House.  However, there is a need for reform along the lines set out in the Bill.  It is almost 25 years since the current system was inaugurated and it would benefit from the reform envisaged in the Bill.  I do not accept that an interview of a District Court judge for a fundamentally altered position, namely, that of a High Court judge, should be out of bounds, as Senator McDowell wishes us to accept.  I see every reason an interview could, in some circumstances, be of assistance to the board in conducting an assessment of legal knowledge, skills and competence.  It would be a weakness in the Bill if we were to enact it without reference to the facility to hold an interview.  Looking at the situation in Scotland, for instance, it is common practice for an interview to take place to fill a vacancy the appointments board may wish to fill for a sheriff or an equivalent judge at district level.  The Bill should make provision for such an interview process to take place where the board deems it to be appropriate.  If, for example, it is interviewing a senior judge for another senior position, it might be appropriate for the interview to be conducted by the legal members of the commission, or for the panel to include judicial representation.  As I said, I will not accept the amendment in its current form, but I am happy to look at the Senator's proposal further and consider what safeguard might be introduced.  </p> <p>Regarding the idea that the testing element of the process be derived from the published statement and the skills and attributes identified within it, I see every reason this should be important in the context of the process, rather than what Senator McDowell is proposing, not only this evening but over several months, where the sole basis of the interview would be the ideological disposition of the candidate and where he or she might fit on a spectrum.  I do not accept that that will be the case.  I expect that there will be a range of issues, as we discussed previously, in the areas of skills and attributes which will, in effect, provide the basis of the interview in terms of questions, queries, observations or otherwise.</p> <p>I was asked last week by Senator McDowell to get back to him on the question of whether the Government opposed the particular amendment on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il which sought to insert a provision whereby candidates would be ranked in order of preference.  I agree with the Senator that this is an important issue.  I confirm that my recollection of proceedings was correct, namely, that I did oppose the amendment on Committee Stage in February last year.  However, because the Government did not hold a majority, the amendment was carried.  In fact, two related amendments, Nos. 133 and 149, both in the name of Deputy Clare Daly, were also carried on that occasion, introducing the principle that the commission would be able to rank its selected candidates in order of preference.  The introduction of this new element of ranking was considered to be of importance, having regard to the issues of concern covered in the advice of the Attorney General, issues that had been aired previously during pre-legislative scrutiny.  I considered the matter very carefully, in consultation with the Attorney General, and looked at options that might be employed in dealing with the amendments on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il.  That consideration ultimately resulted in the tabling of several amendments on Report Stage designed to make it clear that any order of preference would not limit the advice the Government might give to the President under the Constitution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The D&aacute;il readily agreed to two such amendments to insert such provisions, which might be regarded as savers, in what are now section 40(3) and section 41(4).  The record of the D&aacute;il of 31 May last year sets out the rationale behind those amendments and the need to maintain the constitutional role of Government, and to ensure that, under no circumstances, will that constitutional role be adversely interfered with, much less undermined.  It is important that appropriate savers are evidenced in the Bill when enacted, having regard to the constitutional difficulties that might arise.  </p><p>As far as more general savers are concerned, I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage with a view to inserting a more general saver that will be applicable to the Bill as a whole.  This would state clearly and unambiguously that nothing in the Bill may undermine the constitutional prerogative of Government to advise the President on the matter of appointments made to judicial office.  I have said this before but it is worth saying it again, particularly having regard to issues raised repeatedly by Senator Boyhan and others.  In addition to specific safeguards and savers, a general statement may well be important in the context of the need for a broad safeguard in respect of the constitutional function and the duty of Government to exercise its broad discretion in advising the President as to appointments to judicial office.</p></speech>

One of the points we have not yet reached in this debate, although we have touched upon it tangentially, is the question of whether it was the intention of the drafters of Deputy Daly's amendment that someone who was ranked first on the shortlist by the commission would be informed of that.  Would they be told that they were the commission's number one choice?  Such a candidate may find that, despite being the number one choice on a number of occasions, he or she was constantly passed over the Executive.  I am conscious of the potential for mischief if such a ranking was put in place without consequence.</p> <p>I had not appreciated that section 40(3), which refers to section 40(2), and which provides that "Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the advice the Government may give to the President with respect to the appointment by the President, under Article 35 of the Constitution, of a person to be a judge" was an antidote, so to speak, thought up by the Minister to undo the effect of the ranking amendment tabled by Deputy Clare Daly.  I am glad the Minister now agrees that, in addition to the references in the final subsection of both sections 40 and 41, there must be a general acknowledgement.  I believe Senator Norris will agree with me on this.  There must be a general honest acknowledgement in this Bill that the Government will always be free to go outside the commission's recommendations and to select from eligible people it may propose to appoint.</p></speech>

He cannot do so constitutionally, but he can support legislation that makes it look as if that is what is going on.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Flanagan's, announcement that he proposes to make it clear, in a general way by means of an omnibus amendment of some kind, that nothing in the Act as a whole attempts or purports to trespass on that overall discretion of the Government.</p> <p>Once that is understood, a number of things follow from it.  Why are we establishing this expensive quango instead of an advisory board?  Why are we providing for full-time directors and for buildings for it to inhabit?  Why are we providing a budget of between &euro;500,000 and &euro;1 million per annum for this process when the 45 appointments to which Senator Boyhan referred stand out, in my respectful opinion, as clear proof that it is entirely possible to make appointments on merit without any hint of cronyism and for the Government to discharge its constitutional function without any of the expensive elaborate apparatus we are being asked to put in place?  The Minister has estimated on previous occasions that if ever this Bill is enacted it could be another 18 months to two years before it would have any effect.  When something is not broken, why on earth would one set out to mend it?  </p> <p>The information Senator Boyhan obtained from the Courts Service is stark in its content.  It shows that, first, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has been a member of a Government that has made very good appointments-----</p></speech>

Nobody has accused any member of the Government of cronyism in this regard.  Let us be very clear.  If one looks at the people involved, who are fine men and women - and I will not trespass on their dignity or on parliamentary practice by adverting to any of their names - some 45 people have been appointed to the Bench and to senior offices in the Judiciary by this Government.  In those circumstances, on what basis could it possibly be argued that we need to establish a commission to do what we are doing perfectly well at the moment without any of this stuff?  It is worse than that - and I am slightly straying away from the text of the amendment - because the process envisaged in this legislation will deter people from applying to be judges.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They do not want to be rejected, or go to an interview panel where they are evaluated by people, the majority of whom probably will have no legal training at all.  I am also interested in the Minister's mention of a potential proposal that a majority of the interview panel could be judicial people.  That is interesting but I do not think that is something with which the Minister, Deputy Ross, would be very happy.  The interviews would be carried out by judges and the laypeople would get a report from them afterwards as to who was good and who was bad.  I do not think the Minister, Deputy Ross, would be very happy with that idea at all.  I think he would be very unhappy with it and if his minions are listening in to this debate now, they are already scratching out their strong objections to such a proposal.</p></speech>

The Minister himself said that the majority of the interview panel could be judges.  I do not think Deputy Ross had that in mind at all.  The Minister says this could be justified because it might be appropriate to interview a District Court judge who was seeking appointment to the superior courts.  Amendment No. 97da, which we have just voted down, states &quot;No statement under this Part shall provide for the interviewing of any applicant who is a serving judge in the Superior Courts in respect of any application to the Commission by him or her in respect of any vacancy in a judicial office in any of those courts.&quot;  I was not talking about District Court judges or even Circuit Court judges, but about High Court judges, Court of Appeal judges, and Supreme Court judges.  I cannot see why they should be interviewed for appointment to vacancies for posts in which they were already <i>ex officio </i>qualified to serve.</p><p>On the amendment we are now discussing, the Minister said he might consider some amendment on Report Stage along the lines of what has been proposed here, to limit the interviewing of would-be appointees to the bench, or serving judges who are would-be appointees to other positions on the bench, in matters of law or legal controversy including constitutional interpretation.  It continually reopens the question, which I ask the Minister to bear in mind, of what they are going to be interviewed about.  Will they be asked if they play golf, are in the local GAA club or if they have ever been in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul?  What questions could they be asked which would be pertinent to whether they should be appointed or whether, for example, a Court of Appeal judge should be made an ordinary judge of the Supreme Court?  I cannot imagine what questions could be asked of them at an interview.  I am not keen on the idea of a majority of the interview panel being judges but even if that were the case, I cannot imagine what questions they could ask which would be of much assistance.  Would they ask them how they get on with their fellow judges, or if they would be a team player in the Supreme Court?  What answers would they expect?  They would hardly say that they are not team players, or that they are difficult and very independent.  I do not see how those kinds of questions would yield any useful fruit.  I ask the Minister to completely reconsider the process of interviewing superior court judges at all.</p><p>On my second point, I may have unduly narrowed the scope of this amendment, which I did not intend to do.  Amendment No. 97db proposes a new section, section 53, which would apply to both serving judges and new applicants.  That is important to emphasise, because it would be wrong to ask even practicing solicitors or barristers, who are not judges, questions which would require them to disclose their attitudes on judicial issues in advance.  It is wrong from a number of points of view.  It would send a signal that the recommendation of the committee depended on the way in which they responded to such issues, and if, for instance, an applicant was of a conservative disposition, it would encourage them to portray themselves as more liberal than they were for fear of offending interviewers who they suspected of having more liberal views than their own.  That is why this amendment is hugely important, and cannot be diluted in any significant way.  The group of people being applied to do not have discretion on issues such as liberalism or conservatism, and no interview process should allow for examination of applicants on those issues.  Even if they were disregarded by the commission in the end, the impression would be given to applicants that they were being grilled on their political and legal outlook in advance, and that the shortlist would be composed based on how they performed on such issues.  This is an important amendment and I will have to push it to a vote.</p></speech>

I understand where Senators McDowell, Boyhan, and others are coming from but what is the principal intent or import of what we are doing here?</p><p>The Courts Service has advertised positions, and the headline of this article from the <i>Law Society Gazette</i>reads &quot;Judgeship vacancy applications thrown open&quot;.  The article states:</p><blockquote>Vacancies for judgeships have been announced by the Court Service.  Applications are invited from practising barristers and solicitors, under the Courts and Court Officers Acts 1995-2002, for appointment to the following roles.</blockquote> <p>It then provides a list of roles from the Supreme Court down to the District Court.  It further states:</p><blockquote>Those eligible for appointment and who wish to be considered should apply in writing to the Secretary, Judicial Appointments Advisory Board ... Fully completed applications will then be considered for vacancies that arise in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court, Circuit Court and District Court during 2019. ... These applications will only remain valid pending enactment of any new legislation in relation to Judicial Appointments which is expected in 2019, the Courts Service has said.</blockquote> <p>It also says that more information is available on the website <i>www.jaab.ie</i>, and that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, is involved.</p><p>I was watching &quot;Nationwide&quot; last night, which was broadcast from Listowel where John B. Keane's son was being interviewed about the town's Tidy Towns committee.  I often wonder if John B. Keane were alive today and he wrote a letter to a Minister or a Deputy about appointment as a judge, what would he have said?  Senator McDowell had the privilege of being a member of the Government as an Attorney General, a Minister, and as T&aacute;naiste.  The Minister before us, Deputy Flanagan, has also had that privilege.  I fully accept that we have been well served by the vast majority of our Judiciary, and we do not go down the lines of the USA, with liberal judges versus conservative judges.  Imagine that John B. Keane wrote a letter to the Minister, stating that he had been a member of the cumann since 19 nought splash, had been a diligent and loyal servant of the party, had graduated with an honours degree, had a budding practice, and would now love to be a judge.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=18"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Suppose he said that he was looking to a Minister, Deputy, Senator or councillor to help him on the way.  He might draw the Minister's attention to his relation, Margaret, a first cousin of the Minister's wife or a second cousin of his sister.  Perhaps the relation is a member of the Bar Council of Ireland, with influence the Government could use in his appointment to the advertised position.  I am not referring to Senator McDowell, in case he thinks I am.  I am making a general point.  Let us suppose that John B. Keane went on to note that he had canvassed in by-elections in north Donegal, west Kerry, north Cork and across the country, carrying the flag of the party with distinction.  He might write that it was time for him to be honoured and accepted by the Government of which he had been a proud supporter.  Suppose he wrote that he could be a wonderful judge in accordance with the party's great distinction of serving the country.  Such things are in the gift of the Minister and his colleagues in Government, the comrades with whom he or she serves.  The letter might seek the Minister's support.  The letter might conclude: "Yours sincerely, Michael John Murphy, practicing solicitor, Main Street".  The Minister might bring the letter to his colleague in Cabinet.</p></speech>

We had a major dispute when the decision was taken that we would no longer appoint people to positions of responsibility on the basis of seniority.  Instead there was to be an interview process and a scorecard reflecting experience, qualification and the interview itself.  The motto of the Honorable Society of King's Inns is <i>nolumus mutari</i>, &quot;We shall not be changed&quot;.  However, I have to ask why we are afraid of change.  I have no vested interest in this whatever.  If we simply accepted the world that exists, we would never change anything.  Marriage equality would never have happened.  We would never have changed how we do our business in other referendums.  We would live in the past.  We would never have changed how we do business in this House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>What is wrong with having a conversation about the best skills and attributes for a judge to bring to the role?  Why should we not have an interview?  What are we afraid of?  It is not a litmus test of whether someone is liberal or conservative or for or against something.  What is wrong with interviewing members of the Judiciary to see if they are up to the job?  Why are we running away from that?  I am not condemning in any sense of the word.  I have listened to the debate with incredulity.  I have read all the articles on it, including the articles and letters in today's newspaper.  Are we going to say that the cosy cartel can continue, that those who live in the Law Library can say to those of us who do not and are not in any kind of club that this is beyond change?  We all change in life.  We have made gargantuan changes in how business is done across many parts of society.  Why is it that in this case we are not bringing change?  Why are we afraid of it?  I appreciate that we must have an independent Judiciary.  I am all for that.  I am not advocating against it.  Why should its members not be interviewed?  Why are we saying that an applicant responding to the  advertisements I read out should not have an interview?  If I am missing something, I will be happy to admit it.  Let us be honest about this.  A vested interest is opposed to this Bill - hook, line and sinker.  No matter what the Minister or the Government introduces, that vested interest will not change its mind.</p><p>Reference was made to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and the Government.  If the Government did not appoint judges, the Opposition would come in here every day, highlighting the appointments that were not made and asking why.  Members of this House have highlighted vacancies and asked why they are not being filled.</p></speech>

Are the editors of <i>The Sunday Times</i>, who have condemned this Bill, a vested interest?  Are we going to get better judges from this or not?

We then read in the newspapers that we were going to be sitting until after midnight, until this House said it would not be bullied in this way.  The Leader will not get away with this kind of tactic.  Do I have a problem with an applicant for judicial office being interviewed by a board?  No, I have no problem with it whatsoever.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has the power to interview people if it considers it necessary.  I have a major problem, however, with serving members of the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court being interviewed by a body which will not make the ultimate decision about them, being ranked in order of preference and being put on a little shortlist which is sent to the Government to create the impression that whoever is appointed to the Bench is the creature of the commission, rather than being the person recommended by the Executive to the President.</p> <p>These amendments are about saving members of the serving Judiciary and other applicants from being asked to divulge their political outlook and their views on likely upcoming issues to be determined in the courts.  I believe this is very important.  It is important for any applicant but it is doubly important for a serving judge of the High Court who, according to the Bill as it stands, will no longer be able to do what he or she is allowed to do at the moment, that is, to write to the Secretary General of the Government to say he or she is available for appointment to the vacancy in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, leave it at that and let the Government make up its mind.  Such a judge will be required to apply to a commission which will interview him or her.  What form could such an interview take?  There is no point in repeating the discussion we have had about the notion contained in the Bill that appointments should be made on merit.  Nobody will determine what merit is because issues such as whether one is conservative or liberal are points of merit in the mind of an appointing government.  If a person believes that a judge who has been excessively generous with damages is the person to be appointed as the President of the Court of Appeal, that would be naive and that person would not do that.  If somebody believes a certain judge, who is on the lenient end of the spectrum in terms of sentencing policy, is the one that person wants to appoint as President of the Court of Appeal or a senior judge on the criminal side of things, who will decide questions of the inadequacy or otherwise of sentences, of course he or she will make decisions like that, but those are decisions for the Executive and not for a quango.  These decisions are not ones on which the views of a quango are of any assistance whatsoever and, on my reading of the Bill, the commission is not permitted to carry out its evaluation of candidates in this way.</p> <p>It has been asked whether it is acceptable for an applicant for judicial office to be questioned, interviewed or required in any way to disclose his or her opinion on how any particular issue of law or matter of legal controversy, including matters of constitutional interpretation or amendment, should be decided, or should have been decided, by the courts.  It is a very simple proposition.  Are interviews to cover that territory or not?  The Minister says he sees some merit in some consideration of these points, which is a movement forward, but he is not willing to accept this amendment in its present form.  I do not see why it is not acceptable in its present form and I have not heard any coherent explanation as to what is wrong with it in its present form.  It is relevant to the discussion on amendment No. 97db so I will put the amendment to a vote of the House.</p></speech>

Clearly one's party political outlook is irrelevant to one's appointment to the Bench.  One's religious views have now become irrelevant to an appointment.  There was a time, when I was a young barrister, that a person of a religious minority was appointed to the various superior courts.  There was a convention that no court in this country would be entirely composed of catholics.</p></speech>

If one is going to be asked questions about those matters it can only be because it is relevant or irrelevant to the question of whether one is going to be recommended.  I cannot imagine why a person should be asked questions which are irrelevant to the decision to appoint him or her to judicial office.  We have arrived at the view that we are willing to take people as they stand and on their merits without considering those kinds of matters, at least as far as the judicial appointments commission is concerned.  However, it might well be that a Government might say that somebody who had publicly expressed very strong views of a religiously intolerant, homophobic or ideological kind would not be suitable for appointment to the Supreme Court.  Who could second guess a decision of that kind?  In the past, the stance taken on social issues by some people who were in the minds of others in the running for appointment to senior judicial positions did weigh in the mind of Government as to whether or not they really did want a Supreme Court with one or two people of that persuasion, or whether they had any choice.</p> <p>It seems the Minister has, in respect of the last amendment, indicated a willingness to make some concessions.</p></speech>
