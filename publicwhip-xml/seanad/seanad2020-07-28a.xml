Many people are visiting Ireland who have never visited before and most of them are from Dublin.</p> <p>The Minister is more than welcome to come to Kerry.  When Senator Ned O&rsquo;Sullivan gets into the Chamber I am sure he will also extend this invitation.  As the Minister knows, tourism is one of the big economic drivers in Kerry and Donegal and is the main industry in many towns, none more so than in Kenmare and Killarney.  They are concerned about pubs reopening because many of them may never reopen as a result of the pandemic.  We welcome the Minister both to the D&aacute;il Chamber and the Seanad simultaneously and look forward to her statement on tourism.</p></speech>

It is right and proper that the primary focus of the Government is on the public health crisis response.  Nevertheless, we must ensure that we do our utmost to help our economy to recover from the worst short-term economic shock in the history of the State.</p><p>The tourism sector has made a huge economic and social contribution in recent years and played a leading role in driving the recovery from the last economic downturn.  Tourism plays a pivotal role, particularly in rural and regional Ireland, with most earnings retained within the country.  Heretofore, as a labour-intensive sector directly contributing to over 11% of employment, tourism has been a leading job creator, supporting 260,000 jobs in 2019 - Ireland's largest indigenous sector.</p><p>In normal circumstances, tourism provides diverse employment opportunities, including for those unable to work full-time.  Tourism also provides employment in rural communities and other economically disadvantaged locations where alternative opportunities can be limited.  Approximately 70% of tourism jobs are located in regional and rural areas outside of Dublin.</p><p>Tourism is a significant exporting sector, with the majority of tourism spending being generated by overseas tourists.  In 2019, international tourists spent more than &euro;5 billion in Ireland compared with approximately &euro;2.4 billion spent by residents of Ireland, North and South.</p><p>Tourism is one of the most directly affected sectors in this current crisis.  The impact of Covid-19 on tourism globally has been overwhelming and immediate, with unprecedented consequences for Ireland's tourism industry.  Over the past four months, the Irish tourism industry has been decimated.  The devastation being experienced in the sector is unprecedented, and I sincerely empathise with those who have lost their jobs or livelihood as a result.</p><p>Both international and domestic tourism has been very severely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.  International tourism has collapsed, and the OECD estimates that the impact of the crisis on the tourism industry could result in a 60% to 80% decline in international tourism in 2020, depending on the duration of the crisis and the speed with which travel and tourism rebounds.</p><p>Ireland's tourism sector is deeply dependent on overseas visitors, who account for 75% of overall tourism revenue.  While increased domestic tourism will undoubtedly help make up for some of this, only a proportion of this activity could be expected to be offset by domestic tourism.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland estimates that a write-down of 2020 overseas tourism business would mean an overall loss to the economy of &euro;2.1 billion this year, with associated job losses of up to 180,000.</p><p>The July stimulus measures agreed at Cabinet last Thursday are a significant part of our response to the Covid-19 crisis and will help ensure Ireland's businesses get back on their feet and that as many people as possible can return to work when it is safe to do so.  The Government is working on a longer-term national economic plan to be finalised in October, but the new supports are critical for the sustainability of the tourism sector and for the Irish economy as a whole over the coming months.  They provide vital supports for businesses to retain existing jobs and to create new jobs, and they will help build confidence in consumers and communities throughout Ireland.</p><p>I worked very closely with my ministerial colleagues in Cabinet, and the measures announced provide much-needed supports to the tourism sector.  The new employment wage support scheme will greatly benefit tourism enterprises, especially due to the labour-intensive nature of the sector.  Both the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the new employment wage support scheme will run in parallel from 31 July until the temporary wage subsidy scheme concludes at the end of August.  This will provide additional flexibility for employers with new hires and seasonal workers who were not previously eligible.  The inclusion of seasonal staff and new employees is particularly welcome for the sector, which provides employment to thousands of seasonal staff, especially in rural areas.</p><p>To help businesses stabilise, reopen and redeploy their staff, enhanced direct grants will be provided from a revised restart grant.  This grant was increased and extended, with an additional &euro;300 million in funding being provided.  These changes mean that a grant of up to &euro;25,000 is available to more enterprises in the tourism sector.  A number of businesses, such as bed and breakfast premises not previously included in the scheme, are also now eligible.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am pleased that the Government found a way to assist the hard-hit bed and breakfast sector.  Combined with F&aacute;ilte Ireland's adaptation fund, the restart grant will now greatly assist many more tourism businesses.</p><p>Covid-19 is having a devastating impact on tourism demand.  The stay and spend initiative will help stimulate demand in the very challenging shoulder and off-peak seasons.  This incentive, which will run for the period from 1 October 2020 to 30 April 2021, will incentivise taxpayers to support domestic providers of accommodation, food or both during the off-season, providing much-needed support to a particularly impacted sector.  Revenue will provide an income tax credit of up to &euro;125 per taxpayer, or up to &euro;250 for a jointly-assessed married couple for spending on accommodation, food, and non-alcoholic drinks.  The tourism and hospitality sector depends on high footfall and businesses are highly aware of the importance of implementing public health measures in preventing the spread of Covid-19.  However, the social nature of the businesses means that adapting premises is another expense in a sector that has already suffered more than most.  I was therefore very pleased to announce an adaptation fund of &euro;26 million to help tourism and hospitality businesses to cover the costs of adapting their premises to meet public health requirements and make them safer for customers.</p><p>I am aware of how badly the coach tourism sector has been impacted by the crisis.  These businesses are a vital part of Irish tourism and we will need them when our overseas visitors return.  That is why I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to develop a business continuity scheme to help these businesses through this very difficult period.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland will now engage with the sector to develop this scheme, which has been allocated &euro;10 million in funding.  Further measures which will benefit the tourism sector include the &euro;2 billion Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, the package of liquidity and enterprise investment measures to support small companies and microenterprises, the corporation tax refund, the income tax relief for the self-employed, the warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension of the waiver of commercial rates for a further three months.</p><p>These measures will supplement the other supports already in place and the excellent work being undertaken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in supporting the tourism sector in its time of greatest need.  The overall package of direct employment supports, cash grants, demand stimulation measures and tax reliefs will make a real difference to the bottom line of tourism businesses right now.  I know that the tourism industry has called for other longer-term supports such as a change in the VAT rate.  These will be considered as part of the work on the national economic plan in October. </p><p>As Senators are aware, the tourism recovery task force is preparing a tourism recovery plan which will include a set of recommendations on how the Irish tourism sector can best adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment.  The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period from 2020 to 2023.  Since it first met at the end of May, the task force has undertaken a widespread stakeholder consultation process whereby any sectors and parties with an interest in tourism have been able to provide constructive inputs and innovative ideas on how this economically vital sector can adapt and recover in a meaningful and sustainable way.  Furthermore, the task force has heard directly from several stakeholders in the past two weeks with a view to informing its deliberations as it works towards a final report.  I expect the final report from the task force in the autumn and will carefully consider its recommendations at that time.</p><p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently unveiled its new national domestic marketing campaign, Ireland, make a break for it, to the tourism and hospitality industry and it has since gone live across all media.  This is a major drive to encourage people to take domestic breaks this summer.  I will be taking my family holiday in Ireland in the coming weeks and I encourage anyone who can to take the opportunity to enjoy our excellent tourism offerings.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland research shows almost nine in ten people want to ensure that the appropriate safety measures are in place if they are to consider taking a domestic break in Ireland this year.  Responding to these insights on safety, F&aacute;ilte Ireland recently launched a new Covid-19 safety charter, designed to stimulate demand and boost public confidence in the safety of tourism businesses.  The charter, which is based on operational guidelines for tourism businesses, is now available to applicants on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website.  More than 1,000 businesses have signed up to it so far.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->According to F&aacute;ilte Ireland's research, 60% of people are now planning breaks in Ireland in the next six months.  Many intend to extend their short breaks from two or three nights to four nights, and 40% of those who intend to take short breaks booked them in the past two weeks, which is a significant increase on previous numbers.</p><p>Tourism Ireland is undertaking an extensive Covid-19 programme of research in our major markets to identify when consumers are ready to consider holidaying again and which of our markets offer us the best short-term prospects.  This research is considering potential source markets and will then analyse when promotion of the island of Ireland should begin and where marketing should be targeted.  The insights gained will ensure that Tourism Ireland's promotional plan is as targeted and motivational as it possibly can be in order to drive a strong recovery for tourism to the island of Ireland as quickly as it is possible to realise it.  With regard to international tourism into Ireland, the tourism agencies are guided in all their decisions by public health advice.  In line with the advice on non-essential travel, there are currently no paid advertising campaigns by Tourism Ireland in overseas markets about coming on holiday to Ireland.</p><p>The incidence of Covid-19 has been rising in Ireland over the past two to three weeks.  This is aligned with the experience internationally.  It is difficult to keep the virus suppressed while also easing restrictions.  Overseas travel increases the risk of importing a higher incidence of the virus into the country.  In order not to lose the gains we have worked so hard to make, now more than ever we need to stay vigilant and follow public health advice.  Everything we are asking people to do is aimed at protecting the vulnerable and ensuring we can get to a point where schools can reopen and vital health services can be resumed.  We cannot completely ban overseas travel because we are a small open economy and many people depend on trade for their livelihood.  Many people need to travel to and from Ireland to carry out essential functions.  There are also essential supply chains from overseas relying on these routes and connectivity to bring food, medicines and other products to Ireland that are critical to our health and for economic activity.  Travel is also necessary to allow people to perform essential work, care for family members overseas and return to the country.  For that reason, international travel must continue.</p><p>The agreement reached recently on the &euro;750 billion European Union recovery package represents a very positive step.  The package will consist of &euro;390 billion in grants, with &euro;360 billion to be distributed as loans to member states.  The eligibility criteria for these funds include objectives that will provide supports for small businesses, tourism, culture and natural heritage, among a range of other areas.</p><p>I am under no illusions as to the difficulty of the task ahead, particularly with so many competing priorities.  At the same time, given the importance of the sector, especially in regional and rural locations, I realise it is critical that we save as many of these jobs and businesses as we can.  The July jobs stimulus measures agreed at Cabinet last week, the other supports already in place, together with the assistance being provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland will, I have no doubt, save many tourism and hospitality jobs and businesses all around the country.  Together with the industry, the tourism agencies and the Department, I look forward to building on our natural advantages and working to ensure the sustainable development of tourism in the coming years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#D00200"><p>I thank the Minister, who is very welcome to the House.  I wish her all the best in her new role in a new Department that has responsibility for media.  I look forward to working with her as my party's spokesperson in that area not just in discussing the industry here but what is happening internationally.  We saw what happened in Hungary last week when the staff of an entire newsroom resigned from the last independent news organ in that country because of state interference.  I look forward to discussing such matters with the Minister when she returns to the Chamber.</p> <p>This morning, we are dealing with the crucial tourism industry and I thank the Minister for what she has set out in her comments this morning.  In preparing for the debate, the phrase "lies, damned lies and statistics" came to mind.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People attempted to make arguments from all sides and some amount of statistics have been produced.  Yesterday, I read the Minister, Deputy Ryan's response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Michael Healy-Rae on the numbers arriving into Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports.  That prompted a headline that 6,000 people were flying into Ireland every day, a third of them from the UK, 700 from Spain and 160 Yanks.  One would get the impression, reading the sub-editor's headline, that this was a tsunami, however the CSO statistics show otherwise.  On Sunday last, Sky News produced a special report from Ireland on the impact of Covid-19 on the Irish tourism industry which it filmed in Mayo.  It focused specifically on the loss of the British market.  A total of 5 million UK residents visit here in a normal year, and &euro;1.4 billion of the &euro;5 billion international market mentioned by the Minister is their spending.  The 1,500 UK residents arriving into Ireland are a long way short of reaching the 5 million in a normal year, and the lost spend.  I wish to focus on the spending of tourists.  The Minister and the Government are doing everything possible to salvage the season through a focused range of measures for the domestic market.  However, spending by the domestic market is notably less.  Cork was mentioned in the reply to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.  The last available figures for Cork had 2.7 million people visiting "the real capital", of whom 1.6 million were from overseas and 1.1 million from Ireland.  It is evenly balanced enough in visitors but the real difference is in the value of their spending.  The overseas visitors were worth &euro;631 million to Cork compared to &euro;200 million from domestic visitors.  Despite the hope of a big staycation surge in August, of which I will be a part as I am travelling to Kerry to try to boost the Cathaoirleach's county-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1641" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#E00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach.  The fear in the industry, and among the ancillary industries that survive off it, is that the money circulating will be significantly down.  The Minster has said that on her worst case scenario figures, that spending could be down by &euro;2.1 billion.  In Kerry alone, Ireland's tourism capital, anticipates a loss of &euro;400 million this year.  According to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, every &euro;1 million in tourist expenditure supports 27 jobs.  The OECD estimates a 60% to 80% decline in international tourism which is hugely worrying.</p><p>The Government schemes to keep as much of the industry alive is welcome, especially the restart scheme and the additional &euro;300 million in direct grant funding, the &euro;10 million to help tourism businesses adapt and the stay and spend initiative, however there will be casualties.  The impact of the loss of international visitors this season on jobs could be 180,000 of a workforce of 260,000.  How many of those beyond the PUPs would be considered permanent job losses in the short to long term?  Does that figure include the ancillary jobs created by tourism?  Has the Minister liaised with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on this?  </p><p>On hotels that may not reopen, have local tourism boards, including Boyne Valley tourism, liaised with the Department on any problem with beds?  When I served on a tourism board in Meath 20 years ago, the biggest thing was trying to build up hotel capacity.  Will they be hit?  While I am on the subject of hotels, I might mention pub closures which may not be under the Minister's remit.  The 10 August date is at the front of many publicans' minds.  For hotels that might close, it is about more than job losses now but future losses.  During the lockdown, <i>The Irish Times </i>analysed large hotel developments planned prior to the outbreak of Covid.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Have we an analysis from the director of planning in each of the counties where projects may not now happen as a result?</p><p>Appearing before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response last week, representatives of the Irish Airline Pilots Association stated Aer Lingus could be wound up if it is not given state aid and that it is losing &euro;1.5 million every day, with very little income coming in.  There is the potential for its owner, IAG, to sacrifice our national carrier to protect its pillar airlines of British Airways and Iberia, which is getting a large subvention from the Spanish Government.  Does the Minister believe that is a real possibility, and has she and the Minister with responsibility for transport, Deputy Ryan, held discussions on this aspect?  How real is the claim made by the pilots' union before the committee last Friday as to the winding up of Aer Lingus by its owners, IAG?</p><p>The Minister might now put on her other hat, as the Minister with responsibility for sport.  It is very important, as part of the overall summer for Irish people and more widely for Irish culture, hat the GAA season is under way again.  In the context of what we are encouraging people to do with regard to staycations, that will be a key component of attraction for people.  A limit of 200 patrons, however, is allowed into such games, and that includes the players, the squads and so forth.  Last week, the size of the crowd at games in the North of Ireland was increased to 400 people by the Northern Ireland Executive, which has created a divergence in what is an all-Ireland association.  I urge the Minister and the Cabinet to re-evaluate that position.  Liaising with Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael, we have had many ongoing discussions to try to find a solution where social distancing can be carried out at large grounds, given the importance of the GAA to Irish culture and what is at stake here this summer.  It would be a great statement of support for Irish communities if that change could happen in the coming days, and I urge the Minister to examine that.</p><p>I again wish the Minister well in her role.  She has outlined the crucial nature of this industry to our economy.  I hope we can survive this summer and save as much of the industry as possible.</p></speech>

I have been chairman of the County Longford tourism committee for seven years and have been involved in developing the product in our county, which had the lowest tourism numbers for many years.  I was heavily involved in the development of the start of the Royal Canal, which next summer will run the whole way from Spencer Dock to Cloondara in Longford.  We hope it will be as successful as the Waterford greenway has been for tourism in the south east.  We were low in numbers but we developed a strategy and employed a tourism officer, and we are working to develop the product we have.</p> <p>Needless to say, the opening of Center Parcs has done wonders for us as a county, through not only promoting the area but also providing more than 1,000 jobs and increased sales in the ancillary businesses throughout that area of south Longford and the wider midlands.  I take this opportunity to wish Daragh Feighery and his team well.  Tomorrow will be the first anniversary of the opening of Center Parcs.  We had a meeting at 9 o'clock this morning with the County Longford tourism committee, of which Daragh is a member.  The park has reopened its spa and sub-tropical swimming area to guests.  The numbers are up and Daragh is quite positive about the prospects of people coming to stay and holiday in Longford.</p> <p>I am also involved in our new brand, the Hidden Heartlands, as was the former Minister of State, Kevin Boxer Moran.  We always believed we needed a product to promote us and we relied on Ireland's Ancient East for a number of years, which was not a natural fit.  I take this opportunity to thank Paddy Matthews, Sarah McCarthy and the team involved in that who do tremendous work in promoting the midlands as a brand.</p> <p>Economically, tourism was hit immediately when Covid-19 came and it will be the last sector to recover.  I thank the Minister, her officials and the Government for recognising this and introducing the ten measures that were announced in the July stimulus plan last week, such as the business adaptation grant of &euro;26 million and the coach tourism continuity scheme, which was raised in the House by Senator McGahon last week.  I have family involved in that industry and it has been decimated, not just in terms of school transport but also because there are virtually no coach tours.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MichealCarrigy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, I am feeling positive for 2021.  Many tours that were cancelled, especially coming from America, have not looked for refunds but want to move their bookings on to 2021.  That is positive for the year ahead if we keep going well with regard to Covid-19.  The stay and spend initiative is fantastic.  It is incumbent on all Members to holiday in Ireland, promote the fact that we have stayed in the country and give something back into our economy.  The Minister said she was going on holidays in Ireland.  She is more than welcome to come to Longford.  It is not far away from her home county of Monaghan in Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.</p><p>I refer to the wage scheme and restart grant.  Issues around some of the schemes have been brought to my attention by people involved in the sector.  A number of businesses or tourist centres are not rateable for the purposes of the restart grant. Some are run by voluntary agencies, such as the Maria Edgeworth centre in Edgeworthstown in my own home county, which is backed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland but run by a voluntary committee.  It has no visitors but it is not open to the committee to apply for a restart grant due to the fact that the centre is not rateable.  On the credit guarantee and rates waiver schemes, the rates waiver scheme is only available to bed and breakfast accommodation that is registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  A large number are not registered with F&aacute;ilte Ireland for whatever reason, although I believe all should be.  They are not eligible to apply even though they are in the industry.  There are only ten in my county.  On tax refunds, are income tax relief and tax warehousing enough?  We also need guidelines for businesses with regard to people coming into the country.  In a restaurant in Galway that is full of local people, if two international people come in, how do we know they have self-isolated?  Can the person refuse to allow them to come in if they have not?  These guidelines need to be put there for the people in the industry.</p><p>Tourism is at the core of our economy and it is extremely important that it is rebuilt and developed throughout the regions.  As a Government, we need to continue to support it throughout the crisis and into 2021 and beyond.  We need to look at areas where the bed nights are not up.  The recent F&aacute;ilte Ireland figures state that they are up in the rural areas but the cities are still down.  I think they are down around 30% in Dublin with the lack of conference centres.  We need to look at those figures and consider an increased suite of funding for them.</p><p>Is F&aacute;ilte Ireland committed and is the funding for the capital projects that it started with to continue?  I think of the Knights and Conquests Heritage Centre and the Norman heritage village in Granard, County Longford, which is a &euro;4 million project.  They only dug ground last week.  I want a commitment that the funding is there for those projects to be finished out.  We also have the mid-Shannon wilderness park which has been proposed for the boglands in south Longford as part of the just transition.  Will that funding be in place going forward?</p><p>I look forward to working with the Minister in supporting tourism throughout the crisis, implementing the stimulus package and providing a new stimulus where it is needed as part of the national economic plan.  A VAT reduction is extremely important to the industry.  It worked in 2010 and I feel it will work again.  It needs to be considered.  I concur with Senator Cassells with regard to the limits at sporting events.  I am also involved in the GAA.  For local club games in my own county at the weekend they had to sell tickets online for people to be able to go to games.  The limit of 200 is incorrect.  A GAA field perimeter is 500 m and 240 people can stand 2 m apart outside the playing area.  That really needs to be looked at to increase it to 500 or at a minimum that the 200 would not include the people on the field.  It would allow more people to go to our games.  My brief covers arts, media, tourism and sport.  I look forward to working with the Minister and wish her well.</p></speech>

I wish her well in her new role as Minister with responsibility for media, arts, tourism, culture, sport and the Gaeltacht.  However, it is a cause of great concern and disappointment not only to me, but to those in the tourism industry, which in normal times contributes in excess of &euro;9 billion to the economy and employs more than 250,000 people, that tourism sits amid six other important portfolios.</p> <p>Two weeks ago in the House, I suggested pre-flight Covid testing.  The Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, which is a State-run agency and whose representatives are currently in Leinster House appearing before the Covid-19 committee, is suggesting the exact same solution.  I am delighted to see that someone is listening.  Is the Minister listening and will she lead on this matter?</p> <p>I do not have to tell the Minister that the tourism industry is on its knees.  Covid-19 has essentially switched it off overnight.  Although it had been facing challenges, the industry was set for another bumper year of growth.  We were told that projections showed record figures and growth upon growth, with 11 million foreign visitors and something similar domestically.  Even in the face of Brexit, the situation looked challenging, but we were ready.  Brexit budgeting of &euro;47 million had been announced on top of the &euro;186 million F&aacute;ilte Ireland budget.  That is what we spent last year.  How are we to spend that money this year?</p> <p>We have increased access from China.  The US was set to herald wave upon wave of new market opportunities.  The overwhelming success of the Wild Atlantic Way was to be emulated by the soon-to-be-successful Ireland's Ancient East, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, the Spirit of Dublin and offerings from our friends in Tourism Northern Ireland.  As as we know, marketing works 50% of the time.  We just do not know which 50%.  What happens now?  What are the Minister's plans?  Were is the political leadership?  What is she going to do about this?</p> <p>The F&aacute;ilte Ireland Authority's board consists of a chair and 12 appointed members.  A list of highly eminent names and all experts within their given fields and sectors, they have to be commended on their contribution to the industry as a whole, but with a budget touching on &euro;250 million of public funding, where is the political accountability?  Where is the Minister in all of this?  What is her role?</p> <p>The emphasis has been well and truly placed on the international visitor while placing the domestic visitor as an additional bonus.  We have placed most of our eggs into the international basket.  We find ourselves in an environment where we have not been cultivating a stay-at-home mentality in what appears to have been a concession based solely on meeting the needs of the international.  As we look to the future of international travel in the short to medium term, we see the new trends emerging, the continued uncertainty that the pandemic has brought and the possibility that, with the ease of international movement, viral spread may become more and more a part of our new reality.  What is the Minister's plan for that?  We must shift an element of our focus to that likelihood.</p> <p>Our domestic tourism industry has suffered greatly, but not only from the direct effects of Covid-19 and the necessary measures taken to lessen its impact or from the effects of mixed messaging by this indecisive Government.  The industry will continue to suffer unnecessarily from the effects of what could be interpreted as an international priority focus.  What is the Minister's view on this?  There are people listening who need to know.  There are 180,000 jobs at stake.  We need to know what we plan is.</p> <p>A new emphasis needs to be placed on a true partnership model, where the strategies employed by our tourism industry are held more closely to scrutiny and where the measure of success is not based solely on figures at the airport, which is something that we will have to change, but also on the lived experience of the domestic visitor and citizen and how tourism can be supported to become part of our cities, towns and village communities, something that has to date been paid lip service but can pay dividends.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The current and welcomed F&aacute;ilte Ireland strategy of encouraging visitors away from the more prestigious sites in an attempt to spread the visitor load has yet to materialise and the development of the much-vaunted new and exciting visitor experience development plans remains unfinished.  There are many examples of success within our tourism industry at a national and local level, including Boyne Valley Tourism, Westport, Donegal and Kerry, and those responsible should be recognised and congratulated.  The flow of Covid-19 information to the sector has been solid and consistent.  However, there are many examples of soft and easy goals being missed.  Strategies have been pursued that have now been exposed and found to have fallen short.  Does the Minister agree with that?</p><p>The financial supports are not sustainable.  Our tourism industry is not looking for a handout, but for a hand-up at a time when it urgently needs it.  While short-term investments are needed, we need to reassess how we do tourism and who does it.  At this time of change and flux in a new world, now is the time to create a single decision-making forum with a focus on drawing together national and regional tourism interests, the OPW, the National Monuments Service and the local authorities.  Such a forum should work to create a roadmap for our beleaguered tourism industry and to act as a conduit for the real discussion which must take place about the future of who we are and how we present our story to the world and to ourselves.  Does the Minister agree that in light of the changing circumstances I have outlined, we need to grab hold of this now if we are to have a tourism industry that will survive?  It demands it.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas l&eacute;i as an r&aacute;iteas cuimsitheach at&aacute; leagtha amach aici d&uacute;inn inniu.

The Minister is very welcome to the Seanad and I wish her well during her term of office.  She will be aware that Sinn F&eacute;in proposed to give a voucher to every man, woman and child in the State.  The staycation voucher plan would have given &euro;200 to every adult and &euro;100 to every child to ensure everyone can avail of a helping hand to enjoy a holiday this year.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s plan would have put money directly into the pockets of people who would then have put the money into the tills across the State.  This would have given a much-needed boost and lift to our tourism sector.  The plan was simple, effective and costed.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the Government's stay and spend approach will exclude those on low pay, carers, the vast majority of pensioners and people who have lost work during this crisis, all of whom are in desperate need of a break.  There were high expectations within the hospitality industry that the July stimulus package would lift the pressure on those who work in the industry.  Unfortunately, the Government has dashed those hopes.  Another flaw in the Government's plan is that it only runs from October to April.  This means that school-age children are excluded, as they take their holidays during the summer.</p> <p>Given the new normal, we understand that we need to stimulate the tourism industry on this island to generate as much return to the sector and to our people as possible.  We need a targeted, co-ordinated and comprehensive strategy to stimulate tourism and safely generate movement across the whole of our Thirty-two Counties.  We need to work with local tourism promotion agencies across Ireland so they can co-ordinate in order to promote our tourism offering better and more effectively.  We need to see posters promoting the Ring of Kerry in Belfast and posters promoting Titanic Belfast in Killarney.  At such a crucial time, the message in our marketing cannot be confused and we cannot run in competition with one another.  This is really vital given the economic reality out there.  I accept that there will always be a degree of competition, which is fair enough.  We have already heard some colleagues getting their speak in for their own areas this morning.  I am sure we will hear much more of that.  We need to work to show leadership to ensure those charged with promoting our fantastic tourism assets and tourism offering understand they cannot be too aggressively in competition with one another.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They need to harmonise their plans to maximise economic outcomes for the sectors and for communities.  If we do that, it will naturally make the case for viable, sustainable, better connected and more modern transportation links across our country.  There is a compelling case for that, not least within the context of tourism.  For all of the reasons that have been outlined by other Members, sometimes we put an understandable focus on our international marketing strategies, and that is fair enough - I am for that because it is so important - but if this crisis has shown us one thing, it is that we cannot take our eye off the ball in stimulating tourism indigenously and showcasing to our own people the offer we have here.  We will have other opportunities to talk about international travel and what is happening at our airports, and I do not intend to go down that road in this contribution, but for the foreseeable future we are asking people not to travel internationally.  There is a duty upon us, therefore, to stimulate that movement to improve our tourism offer and infrastructure throughout the island.  I believe, and I know many, if not all, colleagues agree with me, that Ireland works best when we work together.  There is nowhere that is shown greater than in the way we market and promote ourselves internationally.  We market ourselves to the rest of the world as one positive, brilliant tourist destination, and that is how we have to market ourselves going forward.</p><p>The North-South Ministerial Council meets this Friday.  I do not know if the Minister will be in attendance.  I hope she will be, but if not, there will be sectoral and other opportunities for her to meet with her counterpart in the North.  I ask that she would take that on as a matter of urgency so that we can begin to implement some of that much-needed co-ordination and promotion, not just at that bigger macro level but down into our local tourism promotion agencies, because I believe that is vital.</p><p>One thing we could do, and I offer this as a positive suggestion when the Minister undertakes those conversations, is to look at issues such as the way our international market transfers down to a more localised level.  It defies all logic and common sense, economic and otherwise, that the Wild Atlantic Way stops at Derry and does not continue across our stunning north coastline.  It is crazy, and I am sure colleagues from Louth will agree, that Ireland's Ancient East stops at Louth and does not go further into Gullion, the playing fields of C&uacute; Chulainn, and does not showcase the fantastic new discoveries at Navan Fort, Emain Macha.  I refer to the way we promote St. Patrick's Trail and St. Patrick internationally and how we use St. Patrick's Day as an opportunity to market Ireland internationally.  How many people across this State know about St. Patrick's Trail or that St. Patrick's burial place is in County Down?  How many know the Columbanus coast from where Columbanus monks travelled throughout Europe to re-educate the people and take them out of the Dark Ages?  They left from our shores.  I refer to the Giant's Causeway and the story of Fionn Mac Cumhaill.  Those are our stories and it would make a great deal of common sense, as well as economic sense and logic, if we were able to link those up for all of the tourism and economic reasons but for the practical reasons also.</p><p>Mar fhocal scoir sula chr&iacute;ochna&iacute;m, cuirfidh m&eacute; ceist ar an Aire f&aacute; ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeltachta.  Would the Minister consider or does she have any plans to promote a dedicated marketing strategy for our Gaeltacht areas?  The Gaeltacht is a unique tourism offer, whether that is the language or the stunning views and locations they offer.  She will be aware that &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta recently did a rebranding for Gaeltacht areas.  Given the historic neglect of those communities, it would be a wonderful message for the Minister to send out in her new role that she will work to develop a dedicated tourism strategy that promotes our Gaeltacht communities as tourist destinations, particularly given the loss of the summer colleges this year.  I am aware that mechanisms have been put in place to support mn&aacute; t&iacute; and the colleges, and that is very welcome, but it would be an added benefit to those communities already suffering if we were to encourage people, for the many reasons that exist, to visit those communities and help support them through this crisis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I believe in tourism as an economic driver.

I wish her very well in her new post.  There is no doubt that this is a challenging time for tourism in Ireland and for those employed in the industry.  As the recently appointed Labour Party spokesperson on tourism, I look forward to working constructively with the Minister on solutions to the current problems and to develop the massive potential tourism will still have in a post-Covid-19 Ireland.</p> <p>The Minister will be aware that 2019 saw a record number of international visitors at just under 10 million.  The tourism industry, which includes overseas visitor expenditure, domestic market spending and fares paid to Irish carriers, was worth about &euro;9.3 billion to the economy.  The tourism and hospitality industry employed more than 265,000 people throughout the country.  Tourism accounted for one job in nine in the State.  Unfortunately, with the arrival of Covid-19 the industry is on its knees.  International visitors composed almost 75% of the market on which Ireland's tourism economy was based.  With very few of those 10 million visitors expected in 2020, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation estimates that the cost of Covid-19 to the tourism industry will amount to &euro;6.9 billion.  </p> <p>In the months since the essential shutdown in mid-March, the collapse in Ireland's international visitor numbers has represented a loss to the Irish economy of &euro;27 million per day.  The number of workers employed in the industry who have been temporarily laid off is mind-blowing.  It is estimated that at least 90% of the 265,000 workers whose jobs are supported by the industry have been temporarily laid off.  Research carried out by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the past month is also very worrying.  Too many of the 20,000 businesses in the sector, many of which are family-owned or family-run, face the imminent risk of permanent closure, resulting in job losses and a diminished tourism offering for domestic and international visitors.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's findings state that up to 90% businesses are closed and almost half have let their employees go at least temporarily.  However, three out of five intend to reopen for the summer months at least. </p> <p>This is the current situation, with which I am sure the Minister is only too familiar.  A ninth of our jobs are in this industry.  All tourism representatives have called for radical and far-reaching support from the Government, which to date has not met the wide-ranging needs of this industry.  Regarding the July stimulus, the Labour Party welcomes the extension of the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme and the announcement of the major upskilling programme, which could have a major role to play in this industry and the future job security of 265,000 employees.  </p> <p>The staycation voucher, that is, the stay and spend initiative, was a missed opportunity of gigantic proportions.  It targeted those still in work, forgetting those who have lost their jobs in this pandemic.  The Government seems to have forgotten those who have worked all their lives and are now in receipt of pensions.  These are the same people who were asked to cocoon and have been looking forward to getting out.  They have been forgotten once again.  Is it the policy of this new Government to ignore our older population?  The Government also forgot those who cannot work and are on a disability payment.  Surely they deserve the voucher or the chance to put some money back in their pockets.  With a little imagination, the staycation voucher could have been used to reward our front-line workers for their hard work and dedication on behalf of us all.  Unfortunately, as has been said, they too will have to gather receipts, fill in forms and wait for the end of the tax year to get their money back.</p> <p>I am sure the Minister, like many Members of the Oireachtas, has been contacted in recent weeks by various sectors of the tourism trade.  Notwithstanding what she has already said today, I would really appreciate it if the Minister could outline the plans that she and her Department are considering to assist Ireland's coach operators, tour guides, pub owners, bed and breakfasts and many other sectors.  These professionals and their families are suffering and are in urgent need of help.  Has the Minister considered funding for local authorities to maintain and, more importantly, promote the attractions in their care?  She did not mention this today.  Perhaps she can confirm what she expects of the tourism recovery task force and how much support the tourism industry can expect from it. </p> <p>Research consistently shows that visitors highly value the scenery, natural environment and cultural heritage that Ireland has to offer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are unique to our shores, of course, and when we add the friendliness and hospitality of the Irish people, we end up with a product that can and will ensure a future for this important sector.</p><p>The development of nature-based tourism and experiences of a high standard, with minimal environmental impact, presents a market opportunity after the Covid-19 emergency.  I am sure we can all agree Ireland could become a world leader in this regard, and with the support of the Government it would be able to offer an unrivalled package.  I spent several hours last Saturday at one potential site, the Umeras peatlands experience just outside Monasterevin in County Kildare, which fits the bill in so many ways.  This Bord na M&oacute;na bog has the potential to become an ecotourism attraction while at the same time being run by a not-for-profit community group.  I hope it will get support from the just transition fund.  It can offer walking and cycling routes, birdwatching and child play areas, along with peat heritage.  This is an overall family experience for both the international and domestic tourism market, as well as a recreational outlet for people living in the local community.  I extend an invitation to the Minister to join me and all public representatives in the area to view the potential in this amenity.</p><p>There is also massive potential in the Barrow blueway, construction of which has begun in my local area.  This 46 km of tourist track can be a game changer for the economic development of the south Kildare and Laois area.  There is a golden horde of tourist attractions in this part of County Kildare.  For example, the Shackleton Museum development in Athy has the potential to create a worldwide attraction in honour and memory of the Arctic explorer, Mr. Ernest Shackleton.  There is also the abbey at Castledermot, the Moone high cross, the Curragh and the National Stud to consider, to name just a few attractions.  The towns of Athy, Monasterevin, Rathangan and Allenwood can offer much along the route to make this blueway an exciting project for tourists and recreational potential in Ireland after Covid-19.</p><p>I mention some of the magnificent attractions in County Kildare, putting some of them once again on the public record, because it was with massive disappointment that I read a Bord F&aacute;ilte brochure at the weekend.  I am sure it was an oversight that the only county not highlighted in the State was County Kildare.  I am sure, like me, the Minister will raise the matter with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and this oversight will be rectified in the near future.  Maybe a visit by the Minister could compensate for this oversight and give the short grass and thoroughbred county its rightful place as a tourist destination.</p><p>I thank the Minister once again for being with us today.  As I said, I look forward to working with her in discussing this very important sector of the economy.  Most important, I look forward to the assistance, financial and otherwise, that the Government must put in place in the quickest possible time to protect jobs in this industry.  It is very important to protect the name that Ireland has as a holiday and tourism destination that has been built by so many over such a long period.</p></speech>

The next speaker, the leader of the Green Party group, is sharing time with Senator Vincent P. Martin.  They are taking four minutes apiece.  We have the rotas of speakers from the different parties to be called in order, but if they all take six minutes, party colleagues will not have time to contribute.

I am just informing Senators as the Minister must, as agreed in the Order of Business, speak at 12.22 p.m., with statements to conclude at 12.30 p.m.  I want to ensure everybody can get an opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

I will start again.  I offer hearty congratulations to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.  I know she will do a fantastic job and she has all the experience and passion required for this role.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Tourism is where culture, economy and mobility come together, hopefully not to collide but to enhance each other.  </p><p>I will begin with the economy.  My constituency of Galway West is good example, which I will use today.  We are completely reliant on tourism.  Having spoken to the Galway Chamber, the expected occupancy rate for hotels in Galway is between 11% and 14% for the off season.  Many of the measures outlined today in the stay and spend, employment wage support scheme and the restart grant are really welcome.  I would love to hear the Government is open-minded in regard to seeing that it is working and looking at tax, including VAT, in time.  </p><p>When I was a councillor, the council spent a great deal of  time trying to think of innovative ways to support tourism throughout the seasons because we were so reliant on it, such as ensuring there were comedy festivals during the off-peak season to encourage people to visit.  Those festivals will not go ahead to the same extent, which is why we so desperately need the support.</p><p>I will take the opportunity to mention ecotourism.  The programme for Government and the commitments around greenways and fast rail will all enhance the sector.  It is not only about investing in the sector, as was the case before Covid, but it is also about finding new opportunities, such as adventure tourism, which I will engage in with my family in Galway and Mayo.  I encourage others to think creatively about their own holidays here.  These sectors need support now to get off the floor.  It is not only about restarting but also starting new, innovative, businesses.  Now is the time to look at the completion of the Connemara greenway, the urban greenway, the Salthill Barna greenway and to invest in adventure tourism to get it off the ground.  I am delighted to see the islands are now open for business.  They have lost much business and need further support because they opened so much later than other parts of Ireland.</p><p>On culture, the Minister announced the effective restarting of Galway 2020.  I have spoken about this a lot.  If Galway 2020 is extended, it is important we be afforded its full accounts.  That is something I have constantly asked for.  There is a commitment to have more local acts.  I would like to see the list for that as it was not forthcoming at last week's council meeting.  We need to be assured that other artists who are not involved in Galway 2020 will have their arts grants awarded to them this year and in coming years.</p><p>On mobility, I note Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann took into consideration the overcrowding on its services the Friday before last.  I was on one of the overcrowded trains where people were sitting and standing in the aisles.  When I was on the train again last Friday, there were none of the same issues.  That shows that we are taking the issues on board.  Many buses are not yet up and running.  City Link and Go Bus have not yet restarted which means there is huge pressure on the other operators such as Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.   The Government is doing a good job in ensuring that when these problems arise, we act quickly.  Let us do the same for our tourism and our economy and see where the people who have been forgotten in this are and ensure they are not forgotten into the future.</p></speech>

I am absolutely convinced we will have to reimagine how we do tourism in this country.  My colleague from south Kildare, Senator Wall, has extolled some of the virtues of our county of Kildare but there are so many others, not to engage in repetition.  The houses on our beautiful stud farms, shared across the north and south of the county, are splendid pieces of architecture and maybe should be opened to the public.  Our canals, which we are so blessed to have throughout our county, north and south, could become central infrastructure showcasing the wonderful gourmet options in the county.  As Senator Wall said, we have to reimagine our bogs.  I am finalising a number of proposals I have put together.  The Minister is a frequent visitor to County Kildare and it is always great to see her there.  She will be familiar with some of these features.</p></speech>

As other Senators noted, it is very important from an employment point of view.  This incredible challenge presents opportunities and it is about how we grasp them.  We have to do things totally differently.  The Minister's friend and colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in a previous life was very big into cycling tourism, and there is significant potential there too, not just in Kildare but throughout the country.</p></speech>

I wish the Minister well.  She has a comprehensive portfolio and will be seeing a bit of me on the tourism side.  I play second fiddle to Senator Cassells and have an interest in tourism.</p> <p>I will cut out all the statistics I had prepared because the House heard them from the Minister, who has the brief.  The great success story in this country for the past two decades has been tourism.  Every year we have seen increased figures, increased employment, new projects and a great deal of excitement and growth in that area.  It is impossible to quantify the added value of that for the country, whether in terms of transport, online sales or foreign direct investment, which is often located here because the investors have previously come here as tourists.  I have met more than one person who fits into that category.  Another benefit relates to aviation.</p> <p>Tourism is big business.  The Green Party is very interested in renewables, and tourism is renewable and inexhaustible.  It is an asset that will never run out because it is based on our natural resources, the beauty of our landscape, our history, our culture, our music and our welcome.  The much-hackneyed c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte is a significant factor in making Ireland premier in world tourism.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ned O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2233"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2233&amp;amp;pid=NedOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Counties such as Kerry and Galway, which have been major leaders in tourism, are now the ones that will be crippled by it, unfortunately.  I hope there will be some form of regional examination of how we will deploy funds to help particularly the counties that depend so greatly on tourism.  The biggest tragedy I have seen in a long time is the holding of the Galway Races to an empty stand yesterday.  At the end of September - I am from Listowel - we will witness the same situation.  It is heartbreaking.  Covid has changed everything utterly, and there is not much beauty in it.</p><p>I welcome the stimulus plan.  I will not go through it.  I would like to talk about one or two items in particular.  I am glad to see that the coach operators will be helped.  I would like that knocked on not so much to taxi drivers in the country but to hackney drivers and chauffeurs.  We have a number of them operating from the airports, and there is so little business for them.  I welcome the stay-and-spend initiative.  It has been mocked a small bit.  I think it is good.  Anyone going out to spend a long weekend with his or her spouse or to bring the family away to a resort for a week in October will get a bit of a bonus out of it.  The money will be spent anyway.  It will go around.</p><p>I give my full praise to the people working in the sector.  They are all working hard at compliance.  There is an imaginative approach going on.  I holidayed abroad: I have just come back from Valentia Island, which, as the Minister will be aware, is the most beautiful, undeveloped place in Ireland.  Members really should go there.  I will not belabour the point.  The people there are working so hard.  There are small restaurants and hotels.  They are trying their best to comply, with big smiles on their faces.  Everybody is pulling together.  If I have one gripe, it is against the politicians and protest parties, and they are in a minority, that seem to be getting pleasure out of picking holes in whatever is going on with the Government's dealing with Covid.  That is not going down well with the people.  I can tell them that straight away.</p></speech>

Of course, the decision is dressed up by the management and the board as a response to the fallout from Covid.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is a bad decision and will further undermine the effort to rebuild business when the pandemic has passed.  Viable domestic market business at Hallowe'en and Christmas will be lost and will be unlikely to return.  The Minister's intervention is needed to persuade the board and management of the need to keep the attractions open.  I know that there have been communications between the board and management and various Departments and that a request has been made for approximately &euro;4 million.  I appeal to the Minister and her Government colleagues to give very serious consideration to this request because it will help to protect this vital business.</p> <p>The July statement brought a welcome injection of cash into the economy, and the tourism sector, as the Minister said, badly needs that.  Can the Minister confirm that the bed and breakfast businesses that will avail of the restart grant do not necessarily have to be affiliated to Bord F&aacute;ilte?  Can she also confirm that a business such as that run by Sean Kilkenny, a jarvey and carriage ride service based in Dromoland Castle, will be able to avail of the new enhanced restart grant, even though the business does not pay rates to the local authority?  There is a business continuity aspect to this.  As the Minister indicated, she is prepared to provide funds to the coach sector.  Coach businesses are really under pressure, but so too is a business such as Mr. Kilkenny's.  The Covid pandemic payment to the individuals concerned is not enough to sustain the horse business.  Horses have to be fed over the winter.  Up to 40 horses cannot be fed on a &euro;350 pandemic unemployment payment.</p></speech>

I am amazed by how much tourism can bring to an area in terms of investment and employment and the potential it possesses.  I congratulate the Minister on what has been put together in the July stimulus package and other measures.  They are extraordinary and welcome, so I will not go into their details.</p><p>The Minister referred to the tourism task force.  I ask that she exert her influence in obliging the task force to consider smaller packages of tourism offerings that have not been put together heretofore or any alternative that could equip local authorities with additional funds for the promotion of particular tourism offerings.  In my constituency of Dublin South-Central, there is a wealth of historic sites spanning several centuries.  Repackaging tourism offerings like Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, which my colleague mentioned, heightens awareness, improves an area's reputation, creates stories and increases capital investment and employment.</p><p>Dublin South-Central holds in its heart a unique history and heritage for any tourist from inside or outside the Pale.  Indeed, the remnants of the Pale itself are within the constituency.  One can ramble through the Liberties, which is one of Dublin's most historic neighbourhoods and is associated with the River Poddle.  There are market traders and local family-owned businesses, including those in the Iveagh Markets, which are to be further developed.  The area is home to the Guinness brewery, whiskey distillers on James's Street and historic textile industries, including Weavers Hall.  One can visit John's Lane Church and view the 12 statues in the tower niches, the work of sculptor James Pearse, who was the father of Patrick and William Pearse.  One can visit St. Catherine's Church on Thomas Street, the site of the execution of Robert Emmet, and remember that our country has taken its place among the nations of the world.  One can visit St. James's Church, the historic start of the Camino de Santiago.  One can ramble to Kilmainham and take in the Royal Hospital, the Museum of Modern Art and its beautiful grounds, and wander through the War Memorial Gardens and Kilmainham Gaol or visit Richmond Barracks in Inchicore or Drimnagh Castle, the only remaining castle with a flooded moat in Ireland.</p><p>There is a wealth of tourism offerings in Dublin South-Central.  I ask that the Minister consider looking at this suggestion as part of the tourism task force or equipping local authorities to put such smaller offerings in place, particularly in urban settings to put more life, business and employment into them.</p></speech>

Tourism equates to approximately 10% of our GDP, but it is more than just that.  A large number of people beyond that 10% are employed in the sector.  There is a great deal of seasonal and part-time work.  As I have stated each time I have spoken about how we can get out of this crisis, our success will be measured in how many people return to work.</p> <p>I do not want to mention every town, village and parish in my constituency, but I will mention a project that I have been pursuing for some time.  As deputy leader of the Green Party, I am sure the Minister will appreciate it.  It is the reconfiguration of the old N11, which was the road all the way up to Dublin city centre.  Now that there is the M11, we have a large carriageway of 6 m and 8 m in width, allowing two cars to pass, that has been downgraded.  Although roads have been reconfigured on occasion, none has been reconfigured with a plan to travel a great distance and link up clusters of projects and areas.</p> <p>I met the Minister's predecessor, former Deputy Ross, about this project when he was in the tourism role.  It would link south County Dublin along the old N11 all the way down to Rosslare.  A wide portion of the road can be reconfigured through some engineering work in a safe manner.  I am not just talking about having a line on the road with a cyclist painted on it.  Rather, this route would be detached properly and safely from the vehicle carriageway so that families could travel from south County Dublin to Rosslare and there connect to the Rosslare greenway, which in turn connects to the New Ross greenway, which has started work in recent weeks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael D'Arcy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2208"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2208&amp;amp;pid=MichaelWDArcy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The New Ross greenway will connect to the Waterford-Dungarvan greenway.  Suddenly, a project that started in south County Dublin, which benefits Senator Seery Kearney&rsquo;s constituency, would go all the way through Wicklow, Wexford and Waterford, to the far side of Dungarvan and entering County Cork.  The project would connect all those towns and villages that had been suffering because the motorway is in place.  In a village such as Inch, there was a vibrant pub with 14 or 15 rooms, called Toss Byrne's, but it is now closed.  Given that these cyclists and tourists would be able to use the greenway all the way down, connecting south County Dublin with Cork, there would now be a project on a national scale.</p></speech>

We worked closely together for many years on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I am a native of Kildare and I have never heard more name checks of that county by a man from Monaghan.  It always amazes me in the House when we keep referring to our constituencies.  Most people who come in here seem not to want to be here.  They talk about their constituencies but we do not have D&aacute;il constituencies.  We are national politicians and Senators.  Sometimes it is a pity that we lose that.  Let us be happy here.  There is a great expression about being happy in one's station in life.  I can say as a Senator, having served one term and hoping to serve a few more, that I am happy to stay in Seanad &Eacute;ireann because I find it meaningful, engaging and important work.  Perhaps we need fewer references to constituencies because the constituents have made their choices and, hopefully, they will have those people in those place for the next four and a half years.</p> <p>As people have been talking about where they are going on holidays, I point out that I am going to the Minister's beloved Carrickmacross in County Monaghan for one week and to Renvyle in Galway for another because I have met many of the people involved in the harbour there.  The lovely Renvyle harbour, as many Senators will know, was left in a terrible state and something needs to be done about that, but that is for another day.</p> <p>I raise three issues with the Minister's contribution.  I welcome the restart grant for bed and breakfast operators but we need much more clarity for the sector.  Is the grant for bed and breakfast operators that are registered with Bord F&aacute;ilte or not?  I tabled a Commencement matter last year with the then Minister of State with responsibility for local government, Deputy Phelan, and one will see in the Official Record of the House that we were told there was an issue with rates due.  Some bed and breakfast operators have been told they have to pay rates while others have been told they do not.  I do not believe that any of them should be paying rates, but especially small ones in a certain category.  I want the Minister to examine that because we need absolute clarity.  Are we talking about rate waivers for bed and breakfast operators?  Some are not paying but some are.  There are inconsistencies among the 31 local authorities in respect of rates for the bed and breakfast sector.  We know that from the Minister's responses and from other correspondence that I will forward to her today.  I ask her to consider that area.</p> <p>Another matter raised earlier by one or two Senators relates to the partnership with local government.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I was a member for many years, was paying a levy for Dublin tourism.  All three local authorities were paying into a fund.  Why are local authorities paying into some bigger or greater agency for the promotion of tourism?  How can we develop local tourism in conjunction with the 31 local authorities, their members and their executives?  It is a very diverse country, as people have discussed in respect of the areas where they reside or that they know.  I ask the Minister to give a special focus and attention to the role of the local authorities and how they can engage in that regard.</p> <p>We need to look again at our diaspora, our contacts throughout the world.  While there may be a different mechanism for promoting tourism, we need to tap in to that.  It is a really important sector.  We are an island people, and what a great opportunity we could have to promote tourism by having a national and international festival of the sea.  We saw what happened with the Volvo Ocean Race and various other international racing clubs.  We know that at harbours throughout the island of Ireland we have enormous synergy potential for promoting an international festival of the sea, celebrating the fact that we are an island, surrounded by water and the sea.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is great potential for local, national and international tourism if we work with the people involved in this sector.

I thank the Minister and welcome her to the House.  I will leave all the statistics and formalities.  The Minister's is the single most important Department for us as a country to express who we are and who we wish to become.  I look forward to the Minister's term of office and the progress she will make in ensuring a diverse, sustainable and inclusive tourism sector.</p> <p>I want to raise a few passion projects of mine.  Senator Boyhan might not like this but I will speak of what I know.  I hope the Minister might take a few things into consideration when looking at the next stage of our tourism and cultural economy.  The North-South aspect of our tourism sector needs to be looked at.  We have significant commonalities across the regions of Dundalk and Newry, all along our east coast and all around our country.  By working together these regions will get stronger and benefit from a cross-Border emphasis.  We need to look more closely at building the Narrow Water bridge.  We must look to the Cooleys, Mournes and Slieve Gullion as a marketable project and start thinking of Carlingford Lough as one area to maximise the great potential we have in north Louth and south Down.  This concept should be replicated right across the Border region.</p> <p>One positive aspect of our lockdown was that people exploring within their 2 km and 5 km radius saw for the first time all that they have at their back doors.  No matter where we come from on this island we have a wealth of nature, culture, folklore and history at our fingertips.  It costs us nothing to stop and listen to the water in the streams or the birds or even to read the plaques on the buildings that mark a bit of history.  I would like to see the Department coming up with an initiative for getting to know one's own area, making it a marketing ambition for a local area to be able to highlight what it has.  This would be a nationwide project to encourage all to embrace what our localities have, a history that is untapped and unappreciated in many instances.  That history can be developed and mapped so we can have a database and a proper roadmap to our history and culture.</p> <p>For example, I refer to the Battle of Faughart, also known as the Battle of Dundalk, in 1318.  It was very significant battle in the Irish Bruce wars and it ended, for the time being, King Robert the Bruce's attempt to open a second front against the English in the battle to win Scottish independence.  This massively significant part of Irish-Scottish history is sitting there waiting to be explored.  Another example is how the Knights Templar set up in the Cooley Peninsula, with Templetown named after them.  They provided safe passage for pilgrims coming from Ulster and leaving at Kilwirra church in Templetown to complete the Camino in Spain.  People can get their Camino passports stamped in the oldest church in the Archdiocese of Armagh, in St. James's church in Grange, County Louth.  </p> <p>We have the most beautiful biodiversity in this country.  We should be examining the possibility of biodiversity tourism.  I think of the humble and magical hawthorn tree that supports 200 different insect species and our unique heathers in the Cooley Mountains.  This is all untapped opportunity for healthy, positive, sustainable tourism.</p></speech>

With her collective portfolios she is going to play a vital role in the development of rural Ireland.  A couple of the issues I was going to raise today have already been raised.  Senators McGreehan and &Oacute; Donnghaile talked about the cross-Border element of tourism.  It is a vital element which we need to develop.  In conjunction with the new unit being set up in the Taoiseach's office, it is imperative that the Minister, Deputy Martin's Department works in that context.  I, too, believe that the Ireland's Ancient East brand should be developed as far as Belfast.  The Wild Atlantic Way should also be developed as far as Belfast at the other side.  As somebody who lives in the north of the North, I do not think anywhere in the world has the diversity of beauty of the coastline from Belfast around to Belmullet and beyond, with the different beauty spots right along it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall Blaney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Most of it is completely untapped.  There is massive potential for tourism development.</p><p>Senator Boyhan mentioned our coastline in relation to sailing.  There is massive potential for tourism along our coastline.  A great deal of emphasis has been placed on tourism, which is a vital indigenous sector, by the Government in recent weeks, including in the July stimulus.  Now that there is going to be a review of the national development plan, Ireland 2040, it is imperative that there be a much greater focus on tourism.  I propose that the Minister consider the introduction of a national marina plan.  It is very well to talk about sailing in Ireland but there are not enough marinas around the coastline.  Wherever marinas have been built there is great potential for further infrastructural development, such as hotels and restaurants, and for creating jobs right around the coastline.  Sailing is also a green initiative.  It has great potential and should be included in the development plan.</p></speech>

The consideration and respect she has shown me in the House over recent years reflects her commitment to equality.  Having someone with that belief sitting at Cabinet can only improve equality of opportunity and access for all our citizens.  I wish her well.</p> <p>I come from a part of the country, County Clare, that heavily relies on tourism.  The last recession was very difficult and challenging but the industry that started kicking us back to economic recovery was tourism.  The Gathering initiative in 2013, which was promoted by the Government under the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was seen by many as the starting point of the recovery of tourism here.  That was followed by the masterstroke in international marketing that is the Wild Atlantic Way.  It has the potential to compete with the Camino as being the world's greatest walk.  That needs to be our ambition.</p> <p>Although the coming recession will be much worse than anything we have experienced, I believe that tourism will, yet again, kick us into economic recovery.  Hundreds of thousands of people rely on tourism for their livelihoods.  In County Clare in particular, thousands rely on tourism and thousands are struggling now because of the lack of tourism.  I encourage everyone here to consider visiting County Clare on their holidays this year.  We have had the T&aacute;naiste on his holidays for a weekend in Clare already, as well as many others, but we need a lot more.  We need a lot of capital investment in walkways, greenways and public transport so people can get around our county and are able to visit all parts with regularity, in comfort and with choice.  We need capital investment in our tourist attractions.  The Cliffs of Moher visitor experience in County Clare is a gold-plated tourism facility.  I hope the Minister will have an opportunity to visit it during her period in office.  It needs further investment.  There is a coastal walk that probably needs &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million to bring it up to the type of standard we need.  We also have a lot of silver-plated attractions with regional importance, such as Seaworld in Lahinch and Waterworld in Kilkee.</p> <p>We can make tourism an all-year round industry.  That is why it is critical that Shannon Heritage keeps its facilities open throughout the year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Therefore, when people come to County Clare on holidays they will have a choice of activities and facilities to visit and enjoy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#U00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister.  She has a very broad and interesting portfolio covering arts, tourism, media and culture.  I will speak to what I know, which Ireland's Hidden Heartlands in the middle of Ireland.  Is it not great that this opportunity has been brought about for us to rediscover what is on our doorstep?  That is what many families are doing now when booking their holidays, particularly in August which is the month in which many people are taking a few days, a week or longer off.  Regarding the hidden heartlands, between Roscommon and east Galway one can travel down the River Suck or the Shannon River on the opposite side.  There are great lakes and it is a great way to enjoy blueways and water sports while also connecting with heritage.</p><p>I like one of the proposals here on how to promote the local area and developing some type of strategy on that, perhaps how we do <i>visitGalway.ie</i>, <i>visitBallinasloe.ie</i>and the equivalent for all the other counties.  How can we ensure we are getting the most benefit from such websites?  I had the opportunity, and I thank the Fine Gael team, to promote Roscommon and Galway.  I got to promote the activities in my home town of Ballinasloe and hire a boat, meander down the River Suck and show what it was like to go into the marina in Ballinasloe.  It is a great adventure.  It is something I am looking forward to and am going to plan for a couple of weeks hence.  Along with that were activities such as horse riding in Creagh Equestrian centre and doing hikes and trails on the Beara-Breifne Way which goes all the way from Cork through the centre of Ireland to Leitrim and Longford.  There are great ways to explore.</p><p>What I really enjoy is the way families and children can connect with history through everything in our heritage.  For example, the Battle of Aughrim was directly outside Ballinasloe.  Other battles have been mentioned here, but how do we connect and build this heritage, culture and interest in our past, which shapes everything we do today?  I believe there are great opportunities to do that.  Other cultural items worth pointing out include the National Famine Museum in Strokestown, in which there was great investment by Discover Ireland and Bord F&aacute;ilte last year, Clonalis House in Castlerea and the lovely Roscommon Castle and park.  I am passionate about the greenway and seeing it go from Athlone to Galway.  That is a priority for Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  Perhaps what will come out of this situation is the importance of developing that type of infrastructure and that type of tourism.  We need to be able to accommodate short stays in Ireland as well as potentially longer stays of a week or two weeks.</p><p>Finally, can the Minister say what supports are being provided for travel agents?  Obviously, that industry is gone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1660" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#U00300"><p>It is nice to see the Minister, and I congratulate her.  I had the pleasure of working with her on the education committee in the last D&aacute;il and she was a genuinely progressive and radical voice.  I hope she will be a radical Minister.  The good news is that I am going to give her three opportunities to be radical over the next five minutes.</p> <p>The first opportunity is in respect of the Shannon Group, which has been mentioned already.  It is an absolute disgrace that the Shannon Group has decided to shut down King John's Castle and Bunratty Castle from the end of August.  It has caused absolute fury.  The fact that it has also refused to open Craggaunowen and Knappogue Castle is equally appalling.  The Minister has established a stay and spend initiative and my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, rightly criticised aspects of that initiative.  How will that stay and spend initiative work in a city and counties where key sites have been closed down?  It makes no sense.  This is not just about the 350 people employed by Shannon Heritage, but the thousands of other jobs that depend on these sites being open.  This is the equivalent of taking Limerick off the tourism pitch at half time.  We will not stand for it.  In fact, the Shannon Group has achieved something truly unique - it has managed to unify every political party across the mid-west on this issue.  We cannot all be wrong.</p> <p>The Minister has the power to intervene and to insist on ring-fenced funding to keep King John's Castle and Bunratty Castle open and to open the other sites.  I ask her to give a firm commitment today that she will do that.  The people of Limerick and Clare will not settle for anything less.  I also ask her to prepare the ground to move those sites to the Office of Public Works.  It is a long time since we lost faith and confidence in the Shannon Group management.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to be radical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The next opportunity is Moore Street.  I will again ask the Minister a direct question: what will she do to save and develop Moore Street as a national monument and cultural quarter?  The previous Government abandoned it.  That was a disgrace.  I encourage all Members to go to Moore Street and see the state in which it has been left.  A national battleground in 1916, it has been abandoned by both conservative parties.  I have faith in the Minister that she will address the issue.  Will she meet stakeholder groups and work with us to repair the long-standing wrongs in this regard?</p><p>I will address a matter that I suspect others will not during this debate.  It is all very well talking about how quickly we can get back to normal, but there is a dark underbelly to our tourism industry of poor pay and conditions.  The Minister does not have to take my word for it - I will refer her to the word of Dr. Deirdre Curran, an NUI Galway lecturer who has done extensive research in this area as recently as the end of last year.  I will cite some statistics.  Of workers surveyed, 64% have suffered psychological abuse and 76% have suffered verbal abuse.  We are discussing what is a largely female workforce.  Some 52% of workers receive no work breaks, 16% receive no regular wage slips and 43% receive no written statements of terms and conditions.  This is the reality of the tourism industry that we do not hear about.  It needs to be addressed.</p><p>One way the Minister could help would be by supporting Sinn F&eacute;in's tips Bill, which is alive and well and will be returning to the D&aacute;il.  The Minister was good enough to support it in the previous D&aacute;il.  It is a simple Bill to guarantee that people who work for their tips can get them.  Unbelievably, Fine Gael opposed it and used a cynical money message when it knew it did not have the votes to stop the Bill from becoming law.  I ask that the Minister be radical and work with us on defending front-line workers in our tourism industry.</p><p>The last point I wish to make does not relate entirely to the Minister's role, but there is a significant imbalance between east and west.  Part of that imbalance operates through our airports.  That we have airports under the control of the DAA on the one hand and, on the other, Shannon is a failed independent airport - there is also Ireland West Airport Knock- makes no sense.  That is why nine out of ten flights leave from the east coast.  If we are to be serious about regional balance, we need the Government to address this issue.  I urge the Minister to do what the workers at Shannon Airport have urged her to do and what Sinn F&eacute;in has always said should be done.  We are the only party on record as opposing this failed model of independence in Shannon.  One group needs to manage all of Ireland's airports in order that we can implement proper regional balance and ensure that, when flights are granted in Dublin, it is insisted upon that the airlines put some of them across to the west.</p><p>I wish the Minister well.  I cannot emphasise enough that, if there is no action on the Shannon Group situation, there will be fury.  Please start as a radical Minister and intervene.  Save our heritage sites and our jobs.</p></speech>

I worked closely with her over the past four years on the education committee and in the women's caucus.  She is a politician of deep conviction and a woman who is passionate about her county.  I have no doubt that those will be matched by ambition and vision for the Department she now leads.</p> <p>I understand that the Minister might be visiting Kildare in a professional capacity in late August to open the new centre at the Irish National Stud.  While she is there, I invite her to take a little tour of the county I know and love so well.  I would bring her to the Curragh to see Donnelly's Hollow and to make my first request of her, which would be that we would make the Curragh a national heritage park.  This is warranted and important.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On the issue of transport, there is a stop at the Curragh for the train service.  That could be utilised for both tourism and those who come to racing.  Kildare is particularly well known for racing events and has many fabulous places we could bring tourists to, which I will highlight.  It may surprise some to learn that 600 enterprises in Kildare are dependent on tourism and that tourism in Kildare contributes &euro;127 million directly to the economy.  Kildare is also associated with St. Brigid, who was the first feminist in Ireland and who is the patron saint of creativity.  I have no doubt she will inspire the Minister.</p><p>Finally, I turn to the issue of our waterways.  There are two canals in Kildare.  I had the opportunity to be on a barge last week.  There are only 28 serviced berths in the country.  We need to explore our waterways and have a greater number of permanent berths.</p><p>I look forward to talking to the Minister about these issues at greater length on another occasion.  I ask her to keep on the table a further cut to VAT in budget 2021.</p></speech>

The sector has never faced a crisis of such magnitude, and we have been through a number of them.  In the Minister's words, the devastation being experienced in the sector is unprecedented.  I welcome the July stimulus package, which addresses some of the short-term measures required to keep our doors open in the coming off-season, but the sector believes that the rhetoric from the Government is just rhetoric and that the sector is not a primary focus of the Government moving forward.  We will have an opportunity in the forthcoming national economic plan to address the concerns of the industry if we work together.</p> <p>I will focus on two issues, the first of which relates to VAT.  We need an open and frank discussion on VAT.  A reduction in the rate is needed to secure a viable, sustainable and competitive future for the industry, to level the playing fields with our European competitors and to respond to the move last week by the UK Government to reduce its rate for the sector to 5%.  The UK is our largest foreign market.  We were already losing a significant portion of that trade because of Brexit and the decrease in the value of sterling.</p> <p>The other issue relates to opening our airports and ferry ports to mandatory testing to give security to the people.  Instant testing is being developed.  We did it 19 years ago in the case of foot and mouth disease, when we washed every wheel of every vehicle that came into the country and everyone had to step in a disinfectant.  If there is a will, there is a way, and we can open our ferry ports and airports safely through carrying out mandatory testing.</p></speech>

I sincerely wish the Minister well.  I served in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann with her and chaired many a debate, and I found her very co-operative and fair.  I think she will do a good job.  I have known her brother very well for years but the Minister is catching up in terms of his wit and company.  I wish her the very best of luck.</p> <p>As our time is limited, I will not go through the whole stimulus package, which contains a great deal.  I return to the area of entertainers, many of whom are sole traders and are not rate payers.  We often talk about sound engineers, roadies and so on, who will find that the package is limited for them.  Some of them are hitting serious economic times.  As I noted last week, whenever this pandemic comes to an end, those people will be at the very end of the queue because it will be a long time before we get back to concerts, arts centres and so forth.

I officially invite the Minister to the Banner County.  She can come as soon as she can when she is on her holidays.  Senator Boyhan made a good point that while we are national politicians, we are from where we are from and we cannot help but care about our counties as well.</p> <p>I will not waste any more time as the Minister knows about the devastating effects of Covid on tourism.  She was aware before she came into the House about that, particularly concerning owner-occupied businesses.  The July stimulus is good and will bring some hope.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue, however, of seasonal workers.  For many in the tourism industry, it is not a full-time job.  What has happened in many places for thousands of people is that they were on the books in February but were not brought on the books in March because of Covid.  As a result, they were not entitled to the Covid payment.  Many of these workers, thousands of them, would have been working in the industry and in particular locations for 20 or 30 years.  They were the friendly face of Ireland which tourists met.  However, they fell out of this category for Covid payments.  Will the Minister examine this?</p> <p>I want to draw the Minister's attention to visitor attractions and music venues.  Social distancing has been crippling for music venues and visitor attractions.  I came up on the train this morning with a mask on and with hand sanitiser.  I did not always have to be 2 m apart from people, however.</p></speech>

We have musicians who are seriously struggling as well.</p> <p>I have requested that the Minister, the Minister for transport and the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, all of whom happen to be in the Green Party, will come together to look at the devastation that we are dealing with in the Shannon region as a result of the Shannon Group and what is happening in the area.  There were issues there long before Covid.  It is important that the Ministers work together on this.</p> <p>We have one kind of tourism on which we have to focus in Ireland.  All tourism must be ecotourism from now on.  We are facing a climate and biodiversity challenge.  Everybody comes to Ireland expecting real green tourism, not just greenwashing.</p></speech>

I thank them for their contributions.  I will follow up on as many of the questions raised as is possible.  If I do not manage to get back to every query, I will ask my officials to write to the Senators.</p> <p>As I said earlier, the tourism industry in its entirety has been decimated by the Covid-19 crisis.  The sector will take the longest to recover.  Senator Keogan raised that issue.  I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by Ireland's tourism industry.  I am mindful of its complete loss of earnings, jobs and businesses.  I assure Senator Keogan that I am taking this matter seriously.</p> <p>Senator Cassells asked about ancillary job losses.  Approximately 260,000 people are employed in the tourism and hospitality sector.  I do not have exact figures on the indirect impact of their spending on other jobs.  I certainly know that many regions are very dependent on that income.</p> <p>As sports Minister, I understand the desire for larger crowds and attendances at GAA and other grounds.  The Government must put health first with everything that comes with Covid-19.  If we are ever to reach a point where we can open everything up, then we must act with caution at all times.  We have to adhere to the current public advice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If it is at all possible to mitigate the risk to life with bigger crowds, then I am sure NPHET will consider that.

Like many tourism attractions, I am aware of the massive challenges it faces.  As it is a subsidiary of Shannon Airport, it is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  I will work closely with him on this.  He is looking at financial issues with Shannon Airport and will bring recommendations to the Government with regard to these in due course.</p> <p>F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be assisting tourism attractions through the adaptation grant.  I am aware of the impact this is having on the entire region, as well as how critical it is to it.  I will do what I can under my remit to assist with the reopening of these sites.</p> <p>Senator McGreehan spoke about beautiful Louth.  She was like an advertisement for the county.  I am a frequent visitor to Slieve Gullion and Carlingford Lough.  I will be there in the next few weeks, as I often am with my family and friends.  Border tourism has already been threatened by Brexit and was a focus for F&aacute;ilte Ireland before the Covid crisis.  I grew up on the Border.  I will be attending the North-South Ministerial Council and liaising with the Minister, Diane Dodds.  I will be collaborating and co-ordinating every which way possible.  It is a priority.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are working on joining up initiatives such as the Causeway Coast and the Wild Atlantic Way.  I would like to see much more of this.</p> <p>On the Gaeltacht areas to which Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile referred, I have a gr&aacute; for Gaeilge myself.  Last week, I provided &euro;8 million in capital funding to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  I want see factories and buildings repurposed and supported to encourage people to stay and work in Gaeltacht areas, helping to build them up.  I provided funding under arts to Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta.  I will do whatever I can to support our beautiful language, our native tongue and the Gaeltacht areas.</p> <p>Many Senators brought up the issue of VAT and the voucher scheme.  We saw stay-and-spend as the quickest way to get a scheme up and running.  It is also more efficient and less costly for a business to administer compared with a redeeming voucher.  It has a wide application with up to 2.8 million people being able to avail of it.  It is about encouraging demand.  The reason that specific timeframe from October to April was targeted was because it is off-season.  When I engaged with stakeholders, they said that was when they really needed the support to get them through Christmas.</p> <p>The scheme will not be administratively cumbersome.  Some Senators referred to the filing of paperwork involved in the scheme.  It will actually be operated through a downloadable Revenue mobile phone app.  We envisage one goes to a restaurant or a hotel and one takes a photograph there and then.  That is how easy it will be.  It was about making it as easy as possible to support our restaurants, coffee shops and hotels.</p> <p>At the level of individual taxpayer, the relief on accommodation and food, including soft drinks but not alcohol, it is a minimum spend of &euro;25 per person per time with a maximum spend limit of &euro;625 over the lifetime of the scheme.  The taxpayer will take the photograph.  One will get 20% of the voucher costs through the income tax maximum credit of &euro;125 per person.  The tax credit may be set against a claimant's USC liability where he or she does not have a sufficient income tax liability to fully absorb the tax credit in the year of assessment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senators Garvey and Conway spoke of the lights of the Banner county.

With family there, I am a frequent visitor to Kildare.  I have friends and colleagues there also.  I enjoyed working closely with Senator O'Loughlin and I look forward to a tour of Kildare.  On the bogs and stud farms and if they should be opened up, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a tourism capital fund that has developed many similar attractions, for example, in the Lough Boora park in the midlands.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan commented on Carrickmacross.  I am happy to meet him for a coffee and recommend the sights and thrills of my native home town.  Senator Blaney referred to North-South tourism.  The national maritime park is part of the brief of my colleague in transport, but I will bring that to his attention.</p> <p>Senators Conway, Dolan, O'Reilly and D'Arcy referred to greenways.  An investment of &euro;23 million has been allocated this year for tourism-focused greenways.  Senator D'Arcy spoke on a specific project.  Anything we can do to encourage cycling and to make cycling safe in this regard, is of course a priority for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan.</p> <p>Senator Wall referred to coach tourism. I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland to develop a business continuity scheme to help these businesses through this difficult period and &euro;10 million has been made available under the July stimulus programme for this purpose.</p></speech>

We did that.  All options were considered with regard to VAT and all options will be reviewed as we come into the October package.</p> <p>If there are any other issues I have not addressed here, as a lot were raised, my officials will get back to the Senators.  With the tourism-specific and wider economic measures announced in the July stimulus programme I really hope I worked hard with my ministerial colleagues to prioritise this sector.  I understand the concerns of those who want more longer-term measures, and that is what I will focus on now.  This is just the start.  Last week's July stimulus package and the longer-term national economic plan will be launched in October.  I will work on ensuring the tourism sector's voice is heard loudly and clearly in the deliberations on that plan.  Working together with Government and the industry I am confident in our ability to overcome the difficult challenges that lie ahead.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad as ucht an t-am agus an deis seo a thabhairt dom.  I am very proud to be here today for the first time as Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and his colleague Senators for the opportunity to engage with the House today in regard to the roadmap for the reopening of our schools and the calculated grades process for leaving certificate 2020 students.  I also want to congratulate the Cathaoirleach in securing the elevation to the role of Cathaoirleach last week.  It represents a vote of confidence in the Cathaoirleach from his colleague Senators.  As a fellow Kerry native, may I say how proud we are in your home county of the Cathaoirleach's achievement and I wish him every possible success and good fortune in the role.</p> <p>When the then Taoiseach announced on 12 March that all schools, colleges, universities and other training and learning facilities were to close as a consequence of Covid-19, it was the commencement of a series of significant challenges across the education and training sector.  Those challenges have continued to be managed by my Department, the education partners and a range of stakeholders ever since.  The interests of students and their families, as well as the safety of the staff in the sector, have been the paramount considerations throughout as the challenges before us have been worked through.</p> <p>Coming from an education background and as a regular contributor to the debates on education in the D&aacute;il before becoming the Minister for Education and Skills, I was keenly aware of the interest in education but also the concerns and, at times, the anxieties of students, their families, their school communities and more generally in how those challenges needed to be addressed.  One of the most significant challenges was how the leaving certificate class of 2020 could receive certification for their work which would allow them to proceed to other study, to training, to work or to follow other pursuits.  I will return to the topic of calculated grades in a short while.</p> <p>Since I was appointed Minister the number one priority for me, for the Government, my Department and the wider schools sector and society has been the safe reopening of our schools at the start of the new school year in late August and early September.  We said in reopening our schools, we would be guided by the available public health advice and comprehensive engagement with stakeholders or partners in education, including the school management bodies and staff representatives, as well as students and parents.  There has never been any doubt but that I as Minister, my predecessor, my Department, school leaders and staff all want to see schools reopening as normal in the new school year in late August and-or early September and based on the normal timeframes for return.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Yesterday, I brought proposals to Cabinet which outlined a comprehensive funding package and plan to provide the necessary supports and clear guidance for primary and post-primary schools to return safely in the new term.  I also sought approval to publish a roadmap for the full return of schools, described yesterday by the Taoiseach as the most comprehensive and detailed sectoral plan he had seen.  Cabinet agreed to both and I was able to publish both the roadmap and details of the over &euro;375 million in additional funding necessary to support its implementation.  The roadmap outlines a comprehensive range of measures being provided to support the full reopening of schools in time for the start of the new school year.  It was developed following intensive engagement with stakeholders from the education sector, including teachers' unions, SNAs, school caretakers and secretaries, representatives of principals and deputy principals, school management bodies and representatives of parents and post-primary students.</p><p>The roadmap and the funding package recognise the challenges faced by schools in ensuring the safe return of over 1 million students and approximately 100,000 staff in 4,000 schools in the context of Covid-19.  It sets out clear plans and practical guidance on the measures schools will need to take to operate safely and minimise the risk of the introduction and spread of infection in schools.  The roadmap and the documentation relating to it provide schools with guidance on training, checklists for schools on preparing for reopening and guidance for operating schools safely in a Covid-19 context.  It advises on matters such as logistics, the curriculum, teaching, managing school activities, supporting pupils with additional needs, administration and, very importantly, well-being.  In other words, it is a comprehensive plan.</p><p>My Department has prepared a suite of support materials for schools, including guidance on the curriculum and the well-being of students and staff, as well as protocols for minimising the risk of spread of infection in schools.  In addition, I also published template Covid-19 response plans for schools.  These plans provides clear and practical guidance and support to schools on the range of measures that need to be put in place to bring everyone back to school safely.  The funding supports are comprehensive across a range of areas and include the following measures: funding for replacement of staff who cannot come to school because they are at very high risk of Covid-19, including teaching staff, SNAs and administrative staff, which can occur where staff members who are identified in line with HSE guidance as being at very high risk of Covid-19 are advised to cocoon; funding for additional supply panels at primary level, which will ensure more certainty regarding the availability of substitute teachers for primary schools; funding for over 1,000 additional teachers - including 120 additional guidance positions - at post-primary level to help with physical distancing and class sizes; funding to provide release days for teaching principals at primary level to meet the administrative burden arising from the changes and the impacts of Covid-19, which will mean that all teaching principals will have one release day per week - something I am particularly pleased to be able to deliver because I consider it a really essential support to reduce the burden on these principals - and there will be some release time for deputy principals in primary schools; enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures, which are particularly important, are also included and the additional funding being provided will enable schools to have daily cleaning arrangements and purchase supplies of hand sanitiser and any other PPE material necessary; funding for enhanced supervision, which is a key control measure to support schools in minimising interaction of students from different classes in line with public health advice; and funding to support school leadership, especially principals, in getting schools ready.  On the latter, every school will be able to employ an aide to help get the school ready for the return.  As announced in the July stimulus package, funding of &euro;75 million will support minor capital works for all schools. </p><p>As already stated, reopening schools is a priority for the Government.  It has been my priority since becoming Minister.  In preparing for the reopening of schools, we know that most students, their families and school staff will be looking forward to going back, reconnecting with the school environment, staff and their friends and settling back into school work.  There is a strong emphasis in the roadmap on safety and on practical arrangements, but also on ensuring the well-being of students and the entire staff community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of the key elements to ensuring that schools, once they reopen, can remain open is to prevent the Covid-19 virus from getting into a school in the first instance.  This will mean students, their families and staff playing their roles in keeping the virus out of their school by ensuring those who have symptoms or suspect they have the virus stay out of school, by maintaining best practice in hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette in school and by minimising social contacts and respecting physical distancing practices. <br/><br/>The public health advice which underpins all of this has been published and recognises that physical distancing in a school context has some specific elements acknowledging.  It states: </p><blockquote>	The principle of distancing can be usefully applied in the school setting, allowing for some flexibility when needed [...] However, it must be applied in a practical way, recognising that the learning environment cannot be dominated by a potentially counterproductive focus on this issue  </blockquote><p>Reopening our schools is not just a matter of achieving a certain minimum physical distancing, it is about getting students re-engaged fully with learning, socialising with their peers, for some preparing for examinations, and for others transitioning to school life or to a different level in terms of moving from primary to post-primary.  Students need the support of their families, teachers and school staff in readjusting to school life and physical learning environments again.<br/><br/>It is realistic to predict that all students, parents and school staff will experience a broad range of feelings as part of the return to school.  This may include a mixture of excitement, happiness and relief but may also include anxiety and fear.  This is understandable given these circumstances and there is a response in place to support the well-being of our school communities as part of the planning to return to school. <br/><br/>I can assure the House that there is full engagement with the education partners and that everyone is committed to supporting schools to prepare at a local level for their reopening.  There will also be comprehensive communication with students and parents so that they are fully informed over the coming weeks.  My Department is providing dedicated and direct contact channels to schools so that where issues might arise they can be resolved quickly.  Government has provided a comprehensive plan and supports to ensure we can reopen our schools but we must continue to work together to achieve the goal of seeing our schools reopen. <br/><br/>Returning to the calculated grades process for the leaving certificate class of 2020, my predecessor announced the calculated grades process in May and the schools-level estimated marks data was returned by schools to the Department by late June.  A specific process for those learners who are outside of school settings was put in place.  The calculated grades executive office in my Department has in recent weeks undertaken the national standardisation process, which is a step necessary for the conversion of estimated marks to calculated grades in a manner comparable with leaving certificate grades over the years.  In parallel, the office has also been reviewing the circumstances of the out-of-school learners who have sought to obtain calculated grades.  Decisions on these applications will issue in the coming days. <br/><br/>Leaving certificate 2020 students were asked to log on to the student portal set up to assist administering the process over the last week to opt in to receive calculated grades.  By the closing time of 4 p.m. yesterday approximately 59,300 of those due to complete their studies in 2020 had chosen to opt in.  The calculated grades executive office will continue to follow up with students who have not yet opted in to ensure all eligible students who wish to avail of the calculated grades process have the maximum opportunity to do so. <br/><br/>Senators will be aware that I announced previously that the results of the calculated grades process will issue to students on 7 September and by the end of that week, on 11 September, the CAO has indicated it will issue the first round of offers for places in higher education this year.  The additional three weeks for the release of the results are necessary because we are operating a brand new system this year which was designed and implemented rather quickly.  The key points are that students will receive a leaving certificate that is comparable with those obtained in other years and that students can proceed to the next stage of their lives in a timely fashion.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The State Examinations Commission is planning to hold the deferred leaving certificate written examinations in November of this year, provided it is safe to do so.</p><p>These are changed times.

I congratulate the Minister and wish her well in her new position.  I met her before either of us ever had designs on the Houses of the Oireachtas, probably in 2001, when the Minister was chairperson of Tralee host town committee welcoming Special Olympians to the town.  At that point, I thought the Minister an incredible leader within her community and from that I learned how passionate she was about education, culture and, in particular, supporting people with special needs.  I am very glad we are crossing paths again in this House.</p> <p>I have no doubt about her capability to lead us forward.  The Minister has had a very difficult task since being appointed only a few short weeks ago, and when we think about the level of debate, preparation and engagement that had to be undertaken immediately, there was quite a phenomenal task for her.  The Minister presented the roadmap yesterday and I have had the opportunity to go through it, although not in significant detail.  I look forward to having the time to do that after this engagement.  I say "Well done" to the Minister, the departmental officials and all those stakeholders who engaged fully, including students, parents, teachers and boards of management.  Everybody has the abiding ambition to reopen the schools fully and safely but much detail had to be gone through before people could be comfortable.  I know we all wish every single school and board of management well over the next few weeks as they make those preparations.</p> <p>I will comment on the roadmap before raising some matters on which we focused in the previous four years of work on the Oireachtas education committee.  In speaking about education, I think of the words of the great educator and philanthropist who was president of the Irish National Teachers Organisation at one time, Mr. Vere Foster, who spoke about a nation's greatness depending on the education of its people.  That connection between education and the welfare of any nation has been made in every century by all the philosophers, including Aristotle, Plato and Socrates.  Never has that connection been so important as now.  This is a time of connection between the State and education.  It is certainly the matter that has been brought to me most often over the past few weeks and months.</p> <p>There is no doubt that schools around Ireland faced many significant and different challenges when they responded to the initial closures on 12 March.  Much depended on their location and socio-economic environments.  The Economic and Social Research Institute did some work in this regard, giving particular insight into those directly involved with the challenges arising from the sudden switch to distance learning.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope we learn from that and get the opportunity to put contingency plans in place if such a scenario arises again.  The ability of schools to respond was very much affected by broadband availability in the catchment areas.  Both teachers and students were challenged to improve their digital competencies, and this is something we must consider.  Schools, by their nature, are communities at their heart, and the challenge of maintaining school communities and bringing them forward is absolutely immense.  I know the Minister is very conscious of this, as we are.  Students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special educational needs were very deeply affected by the shift to distance learning.  I saw some research from other European countries about the number of students who disengaged from the educational process after a period.  I would like to see some research done on that in Ireland so we can get to see the bigger picture of the existing gaps.</p><p>Appendix 1 of the document contains a return-to-work form for staff, secretaries and those working in the educational environment.  I would like to see a similar form for the parents of students.  It would be important in our approach to these final and crucial weeks.  There are particular concerns that have been raised by incoming sixth year students, and I thank them for their engagement with me on the State exams to be held next year.  I had the opportunity to raise some of these points with the Minister.  This will be an ongoing matter and we must keep a very clear eye on it.</p><p>There are incredibly welcome grants included in the unprecedented &euro;375 million budget that is going to the schools, but some schools will have major problems in maintaining any type of physical distancing.  I mention in particular St. Paul's school in Monasterevin, which is currently doubling its capacity.  There are only two toilets to cater for 175 boys.  I know we have great expectations for a new building very soon but I have great concerns about schools like this.  I have no doubt there are similar examples around the country, including Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in in Portarlington, where pupils and teachers will not be able to pass and a one-way system will have to be implemented when students emerge from classes.  Of course, there are students who do not have schools to go to.  Schools in Newbridge, Kildare and the Curragh are still awaiting sanction for building projects.</p><p>I hope we do not forget about our caretakers and secretaries, particularly as we are going to depend on them so much.  Down the line, I hope there will be the opportunity to include them in pension schemes.  Home school liaison and school completion officers do incredible work, particularly with families that have had the traditional challenges engaging with schools.  Now is the opportune time to look at those programmes and help to develop them, especially as school completion officers are coming to the Department.</p><p>I am really glad to see a big focus on the well-being of students and staff.  A report on the level of depression among secondary school students, which is a matter of great concern, was compiled in 2017.  We need to focus on that.</p><p>I have two more quick points to bring to the Minister's attention.  The first relates to the development of relationships and sexual education in schools.  The education committee of the previous D&aacute;il had comprehensive engagement with stakeholders on this matter and made 18 very strong recommendations in respect of it.  I hope the Minister will take up those.  The second point is on the retention of records.  The education committee had the opportunity to engage with survivors of the residential institutions.  I have no doubt that the Bill proposed by the previous Government in respect of this matter should not go ahead.</p></speech>

As for my background, I am an arts graduate in French and history, and I had the opportunity after completing my degree to teach French for a period in secondary schools.  I have many friends who work as teachers and principals in the primary and secondary school sectors.  Prior to my role in the House, I was also on the board of management of the Roscommon community college and St. Kililan's, New Inn.</p> <p>This significant investment of &euro;375 million by the Government is testament to the commitment of our parties to ensuring a safe teaching environment for teachers and students this September.  Ireland now has a clear plan in the form of the roadmap for the reopening of our schools, which will facilitate the full return to school of more than 1 million students, 4,000 schools and 100,000 staff.  These far-reaching measures will give reassurance to parents and students about the safety and importance of education as a fundamental right as classes start again in schools at the end of August.  I am also pleased to see there was significant input from many stakeholders, including teaching unions, associations, school leaders and staff.</p> <p>The commitments that are being given include more than &euro;53 million for 1,080 secondary school posts and there has already been an initial allocation of 600.  I, too, listened to the Minister earlier on RT&Eacute; Radio 1 and it was very good to hear about the potential for job-sharing and that the number of teachers will increase.  The commitments also include 120 counselling posts, a really innovative measure to help students' well-being in the context of the new ways of teaching that will be employed.  This has already been praised internationally, which is great to see.  A total of &euro;40 million has been allocated for primary school substitution as teachers cannot attend school if displaying any symptoms.  I am pleased to see there are more than 60 supply panels, with at least one in each county.</p> <p>More than &euro;75 million has been dedicated in respect of infrastructure within schools and &euro;11 million for school buses to help assist in the context of distancing and where the wearing of face masks will be necessary.  There is more than &euro;84 million for replacement teaching staff.  I am very pleased to see the particular supports for special needs students and I welcome the statement from the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on special needs and inclusion to the effect that every school will have access to special needs assistants.  That also includes additional access to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, where an additional sum of more than &euro;17 million will be provided to support the well-being of those coping with complex special needs, disadvantage or marginalisation, particularly in this time of stress and anxiety due to Covid-19.  Primary schools will have access to minor works grants to reconfigure spaces and this is a doubling of the current minor works scheme.  A school with 100 students, for example, will receive roughly &euro;14,000, and the commitment is in place until mid-August to support the reopening.</p> <p>This is a large undertaking to plan the immediate infrastructure and recruiting resource needs.  It will be necessary that all hands are on deck to ensure that our schools are ready in the next few weeks, which will be an added pressure for principals and teachers at our schools.  We need to ensure, as the Minister is committed to doing, that we will return to a safe working environment.  I listened to the Association of Secondary Teachers, ASTI, president, Ms Deirdre McDonnell, this morning on RT&Eacute; Radio 1.  She highlighted the input by unions and associations into the roadmap.  It showed the strength of this plan through involving all stakeholders.  Teachers have welcomed the fact that curricular reform has been paused but there is concern over the timeframe.  I have also had the opportunity to speak to some teaching staff, such as in Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa in Ballinasloe, the only DEIS band 1 school in County Galway.  The feedback they gave to me was that DEIS schools in particular, which deal with more disadvantage and perhaps more complex special needs, will have to rearrange their breakfast clubs and homework clubs.  I would be very interested to learn how we will help accommodate such schools.  Scoil an Chro&iacute; Naofa has been waiting more than 20 years for a new school building.  I am working with it currently.  It is in the middle of planning with Galway County Council.  It is dealing with classroom sizes that are 45 sq. m, whereas the standard configurations provided were for 80 sq. m.  I am curious as to how we will manage when classroom sizes are so much smaller.</p> <p>In the case of such schools, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and psychologists move from one school to another.  How will we ensure that pupils have access to these professionals in a safe way, which is needed for their development?  When dealing with children with special needs, there is an opportunity for them to mix with mainstream classes.  One objective of the Department is the integration into mainstream of children with special needs.  We might get some detail on how we will do this, if it is possible to provide at a later stage.  These are challenges and I ask the Minister to consider them.</p> <p>As I outlined, principals, teachers and administrators will need speedy access to the required funds offered by the Department in order to get matters across the line by mid-August and to recruit teaching staff.  What additional supports are being put in place at the Department to help principals and teachers to get their classrooms reconfigured and resources recruited?  It is a massive administrative project.  On the issue of substitute teachers, it is an excellent initiative to have more than 60 supply panels, and additional teachers have been immediately allocated to them.  How will that be safely managed?  The Minister may have referred to that matter on the radio earlier.</p> <p>Currently, face masks are not required in schools and each school has its own Covid-19 response plan.  What types of regular reviews are being set up to examine cases in primary and secondary schools and public health guidance with the Health Protection Surveillance Centre?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is it necessary to consider a testing protocol in respect of this for when cases are identified?</p><p>I very much welcome this large investment to ensure that schools will open safely at the end of August and the start of September.  I thank everyone in the education sector - principals, teachers, administrative executives - who will be working at full tilt in the next few weeks.  It had already started by this morning.  I rang the Department and was told officials were talking to all the people in the schools they were going to get set up.  It was really kicking off this morning.  How will we ensure we support them to have 4,000 schools ready to welcome students at the end of August?  It is no mean feat.</p><p>Students will get to meet school friends.  They will continue on their exciting path of discovery through education and, as parents have let me know, they have a whole new appreciation for the role of teachers.  It has been a difficult and stressful time in recent months.  Parents and children have all been affected in how we have managed and behaved in recent months with Covid.  I ask that my colleagues, as public representatives even in our debates, instil confidence, hope and a sense of calm in our children going back to school.  It is really important for that sense of well-being, which the Minister demonstrated well in the report and the strategy she brought to us today.  It is also important that each of us be responsible in how we ensure in our debates that our children will be hopeful and confident going back to school and that it is an enjoyable experience.</p><p>I thank the Minister very much and look forward to working closely with her as a party spokesperson on education.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that she will open schools and the measures she outlined today.  I am encouraged that there has been significant stakeholder engagement during the planning process, but we must be honest with the public.  We cannot guarantee that all schools will open or that there will not be closures from time to time.  According to the World Health Organization liaison person for Ireland who appeared on the radio earlier, from time to time places will have spikes and will have to close.  He estimates that will go on for about two and a half years.</p> <p>Before I go any further with my comments on the Minister's plan, I publicly thank the thousands of teachers who worked so hard during the lockdown period.  Their continuous delivery of remote learning to their pupils, their enthusiasm, their ingenuity and their good humour epitomised everything that I, as a former president of the Teachers Union of Ireland, and the public at large are proud of about our education system.  I also acknowledge the role of parents and caregivers in providing formal and informal learning opportunities for their children throughout the lockdown while, in many cases, working from home themselves.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Article 42 of the Constitution reads: "The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide ... for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children."  For the past four months, families across the country have embraced this duty with energy and bravery as they themselves negotiated the uncharted territory of home schooling out of necessity rather than choice.  Families have borne the financial and emotional cost of this.  I hope the Department and educational researchers and academics will continue to engage with parents to mine the valuable knowledge and insight that has been gained from their outstanding handling of this unplanned social experiment.</p><p>While parents and teachers have done their best, the results have been uneven.  From the recently published ESRI report, we have learned that students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds and those with special educational needs had been deeply affected by the shift to distance learning.  School principals fear that the outcome of the lockdown will be a widening of the gap between advantage and disadvantage.  They are also concerned about child safety and possible nutritional deficiency due to the absence of the school meals programme in DEIS schools.  The research tells us that school closures have severely affected peer relationships and limited opportunities for social interaction, which many children need.  This, added to the lack of broadband connectivity in some areas or the lack of tablets and PCs, resulted in many students falling behind in their academic and social development.  Anecdotally, I have heard of deeply committed students uploading completed consignments on their phones using their own credit.  I hope the Minister will join me in calling on mobile phone providers to supply a free and unlimited data allowance for second level schools during the crisis.</p><p>As someone who has actively campaigned for an increase in the number of career guidance counsellors since taking my seat six years ago, I welcome the Minister's commitment to employing additional staff, but I am stunned that it took a pandemic to hammer home what the experts and professionals have been telling us for years.  I agree with the INTO's general secretary, Mr. John Boyle, who said that it was ironic that it took a pandemic for us to realise that education could not work on a shoestring.</p><p>The news that children will return to school at the end of August has never been more welcomed by students, parents and staff.  I do not doubt that it will work within the guidelines.  For the past five months, people have already demonstrated an incredible capacity to co-operate and comply, but they will need assurances, detailed signposting and clear information with as much advance notice as possible.</p><p>I am mindful to speak to the Minister about a school I would like her to visit, Kinsale community school, which is led by its principal, Mr. Fergal McCarthy.  It has had an active committee of students, parents and public health experts setting up one-way systems and planning how it will work in Covid conditions.  For example, we need to know whether temperatures will need to be taken at points of entry.  What will happen if a student presents with a temperature having travelled via school bus?  Must the entire population of that bus self-isolate for 14 days?  What about a second level teacher moving from class to class where one member of a class presents with Covid-19?  The teacher has been exposed and might have compromised the other classes.  What plans are in place in that regard?</p><p>There are serious issues in terms of logistics and time.  We are already behind the curve and the task ahead is mammoth.  It is mammoth not only because of the pandemic, but because Covid-19 has brought into sharper relief the deep inequalities, underfunding and staffing challenges that have plagued the education sector for decades.  Every single issue that has been shirked by successive Governments has come home to roost.  The Minister is a teacher and will be aware of many of these issues.</p><p>An additional 1,080 teachers will be employed, but that is a drop in the ocean in light of the task ahead.  More importantly, how quickly can we get those 1,080 teachers through Garda vetting and how are we going to utilise them?  One of my colleagues mentioned the fact that teachers move from school to school in some cases.  In such a situation, are we running the risk of bringing infection from one area to another?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

We have been arguing about this since 2012 when I was president of the TUI, but no one has taken notice.  We have lost the best and brightest of our educators to places like Dubai, London, Birmingham and Manchester.  This morning, I heard that we were expecting those in the UK to return home.  They will not because they have seen what has happened to the nurses who came home.  Many came back from all parts of the world only to never be employed.  As such, I do not know how the Minister will find 1,080 teachers.</p><p>Despite significant growth in our economy down the years, the underfunding of capital projects has left us with a school infrastructure that might be unable to accommodate the type of social distancing envisaged in the plan.  From my calculations, 2 m distancing means there will be 13 students per 49 sq. m classroom.  If there is 1 m distancing, there will be 26 students.</p><p>I am 100% behind opening schools, but I am also 100% behind the teachers who will have to deliver this for the Minister and 100% behind the principals who will have to manage it.  Will the Minister make contact with Mr. McCarthy in Kinsale and take a look at the outstanding plans he has in place?</p></speech>

They now deserve clarity and certainty.  At the very least, they deserve accurate and up-to-date information so that they can make informed decisions.  Some of the measures and resources associated with these decisions make no sense.  Last year, 500 teachers per day were not replaced by a substitute teacher.  However, the Government is only providing 200 teachers for panels under this plan.  That will not even meet last year's needs, never mind the challenges of Covid-19.</p> <p>There are serious issues with space and class sizes.

One in five primary school children are in a class of more than 30 pupils.  We have the largest primary school class sizes in Europe and the Government seems to believe it is a good idea to keep it that way.  If there was ever a time to reduce class sizes, this is it.  Sinn F&eacute;in will use our Private Members' time in the D&aacute;il tomorrow to call on the Government to reduce them immediately and drastically.  I ask all parties that have expressed concern about the roadmap and will express concern when we get around its opposition in this House to support the Sinn F&eacute;in motion in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.</p> <p>Diagrams in the roadmap point to classrooms of 80 sq. m and 60 sq. m, but as has been mentioned, that does not reflect the reality of many classrooms, particularly in older schools with rooms much smaller than that.  This was a time for the Government to make a significant effort and show that children and their future are important.  The roadmap has come late in the day and, worryingly, still has omissions.  I see nothing in it about helping those at risk of becoming disengaged from the system.  There is no increased funding for home-school liaisons or school completion programmes.  If those who have been disengaged since the lockdown are over 16 years of age, they may never return to education.</p> <p>There remains a great deal of detail to be worked out.  As such, why is the joint Oireachtas committee on education not sitting through the recess?  All of these questions need to be answered and solutions need to be teased out.  For example, parents do not know whether to buy school transport tickets.  They are being encouraged to buy them early, but their tickets might never be used at all.  The roadmap was meant to clear up such issues.  There is limited detail on special educational needs, and I am concerned that special education teachers will be pulled from pillar to post to cover remote learning, absences, breaks and so on and that special educational provision will suffer.  There needed to be a dedicated strategy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have pointed out where this roadmap is lacking.

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus gu&iacute;m comhghairdeas agus gach rath uirthi ina r&oacute;l nua.  The Minister comes into this position at a challenging time with huge decisions around the reopening of schools and indeed the reform of the sector as a whole, with the creation of the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  As the Labour Party spokesperson on further, higher and all aspects of education in the Seanad, I am glad to have the opportunity to engage with the Minister today.</p> <p>I wish to address some of the long-term Labour Party educational priorities but at the outset I will address some of the immediate issues around the reopening of schools at the end of August.  While the plan and funding that has been announced by the Minister is very welcome in providing clarity to schools, students and families, as my Labour Party colleague Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in stated, the task for schools is truly gargantuan.  The announcement is coming very late in the day and in the next four weeks school principals are been asked to interview and recruit extra staff, access more building capacity, acquire PPE and sanitising equipment, produce new policies and procedures, train all staff in a new teaching reality and communicate with all parents.  This is an enormous task ahead.</p> <p>I am somewhat concerned about the consultation within the sector.  We need to hear the voices of the school wardens, the special needs assistants, the caretakers and secretaries who will also be returning to school in August or September.  </p> <p>There are also significant questions on school transport.  Ireland has some of the largest class sizes in Europe and nearly 20% of pupils are in class sizes of 30 students or more, which has been referred to by a number of the previous speakers.  There is a missed opportunity here to reduce class sizes while also addressing social distancing in schools.</p> <p>Serious concerns have been raised about consultation with students throughout recent months.  The Special Committee on Covid-19 Response has had several sittings to discuss the return to school and has asked a variety of stakeholders to present to the committee but not students, despite the Irish Second-Level Students&rsquo; Union, ISSU, contacting the committee.  ISSU should be at the table in discussions around returning to school and the leaving certificate and I make this request of the Minister today.</p> <p>While we should be concerned about any age group missing out on education for an extended length of time I am particularly concerned about vulnerable fifth year students.  As this year&rsquo;s leaving certificate cohort have received much warranted the attention, the challenges may be even greater for incoming sixth years who have missed out on a significant amount of their leaving certificate syllabus.  Many members of the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland, ASTI and the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, are concerned that some fifth year students may not even come back, particularly vulnerable ones, because of the length of time they have been out of the school system.  There is no legal requirement for them to be in school over the age of 16.  I would welcome the Minister's response on this issue.</p> <p>It is no secret that I am passionate about education and increasing educational opportunities for all.  While I welcome the opportunity presented by the formation of the new Department and all of the signs from the Minister, Deputy Harris, are very positive, my party has some concerns regarding the maintenance of the entire educational system as a continuum.  We would insist on a coherent principle of equality and access from preschool years through primary, secondary, further and higher education in a continuation of lifelong learning.  The research shows that access to higher education starts at the youngest age.  While many fantastic access programmes exist in many universities and institutes of technology, it is very difficult to overcome the educational disadvantage that exists at primary level.  The continuity aspect is absolutely crucial.  Investment in early years is the single biggest way to ensure lifelong access to education.  What are the Minister&rsquo;s plans for this, particularly given the upheaval caused to the sector by the Covid-19 crisis?</p> <p>An essential aspect of this continuum of education is career guidance in secondary school.  Students need to be presented with a much wider range of further and higher education opportunities to meet their interests and needs.  I will also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on how she envisions the bridge between second level and further and higher education developing over the coming years which is now more crucial than ever given the upheaval caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>I will address syllabus reform.  We welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to establish a citizens&rsquo; assembly on the future of education at primary and second levels.  Referring again to my point on consultation with students, I would welcome a commitment to ensure that the voices of young people and learners are central in any of these consultations.  Our schools have been very adaptable and flexible in recent years in responding to digital and technological changes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We saw this most recently as schools adapted quickly to online learning.  Our teachers go above and beyond the call of duty to support students, particularly those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The citizens&rsquo; assembly will provide a great opportunity to look at priorities in education and making our education system fit for purpose in the 21st century.  It will allow us to take a step back and ask the fundamental question as to what our education system is in an age when access to information is ubiquitous throughout the Internet.  How does one equip students to engage with information in a critical, creative and curious way?  How do we give them the skills to adapt in an ever-changing society environment and job market?  The Covid-19 crisis has highlighted the need for an educational system that is fit for purpose and one that is adaptable.  </p><p>My party has called for an end to single-sex schools.  There is no justification today to segregate children on the basis of sex.  Segregation plays into significant issues in regard to LGBTQ+ inclusion and bullying.  I commend the work of groups such as ShoutOut which provide workshops for tackling LGBTQ+ bullying.</p><p>I also stress the great reforms that are needed in sexuality education.  It is striking that the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, report observations noted the shortcomings in Ireland in this regard.  In particular, the report recommended that Ireland integrate compulsory and standardised age-appropriate education on sexual and reproductive health and rights into the school curricula, including comprehensive sex education for adolescence girls and boys covering responsible sexual behaviours and focused on preventing early pregnancies, and to ensuring that sex education is scientifically objective and delivered by schools and is closely monitored and evaluated.  This is particularly pertinent given the launch yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Harris, on tackling sexual violence, rape and consent at third level education.  I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s plans for this area.</p><p>We also need to look at inclusion, not just within our schools, but within our syllabus.  The Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill which was introduced by a former Senator, Colette Kelleher, and which passed All Stages in the Seanad last November will go some way towards addressing the inclusion of this much-neglected and ignored aspect of Irish history.  Can the Minister inform the House of her plans to introduce that Bill in the D&aacute;il?  </p><p>On the issue of inclusion, I also mention here the need for educational opportunities for asylum seekers.  Many residents in direct provision accommodation are valued students in our educational system at primary and secondary levels and sit our State examinations with their leaving certificate friends and yet cannot go on to further and higher education like their peers and the divide they feel is driven further.  Has the Minister any plans to address this anomaly to ensure that those who have come through primary and secondary education with their peers can continue on to education just like any other normal leaving certificate student?</p><p>I appreciate the Minister comes to this role at a very challenging time with tackling the Covid-19 crisis as a priority, but this crisis also highlights a number of flaws such as our outrageous student-teacher ratio, the chronic state of a number of school buildings and pay parity which desperately needs to be addressed for our teachers.</p><p>I refer to the supports for, and the needs of, our students, which are provided by SNAs.  I am concerned about the voice of SNAs not being included in the conversation over the past while.</p><p>We must also look forward as to how we will ensure the well-being of our LGBTQ+ students, particularly our trans students, asylum seekers and Travellers within the system.  We must ensure none is lost within the system due to the Covid-19 crisis or simply falling through the cracks.</p><p>I thank the Minister for coming here today.  I would appreciate her response on some of the issues I have raised.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas m&oacute;r.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister will adjust and make changes, having seen how schools and children are coping and how the families and the staff, in particular, are coping.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have had many representations from schools and I was formally a chair of a school board.  We need to ensure that the short-term measures do not impede the long-term future of these schools.  I would like the Minister to take that into consideration.</p><p>To go back to home education, I welcome and support the proposal in the programme for Government for a citizens' assembly on education.  Now is the time we need to look at pedagogy and education and what that means for our society.  To educate means to learn about the culture and the society we are brought up in and how to be valuable members of society.  What that means now is very different from what it meant even a year ago, but certainly a decade ago.  The education system simply is not fit for purpose when we consider that more than 90% of schools are still Catholic.  We need to address that but we also need to address what we are learning in school.  I urge the Minister to look at a fantastic programme on empathy, which is fully funded and which Professor Pat Dolan, the UNESCO chair of the Child and Family Research Centre in Galway, was behind.  In terms of teaching our children in a school setting, we need to look at what empathy really means and the different cultures that surround us.  This is the time to do that.</p><p>I was the chair of the Home Education Network.  Some 40% of nine year old children reported having been bullied in the previous year.  That is from the Growing Up in Ireland study.  I hope that will have changed but I do not have full confidence that we have the staff numbers to ensure that it has changed.  Alternatives are needed.  It has been referred to previously that we have a constitutional right to home educate.  More people may choose to do that but there have been inequities in that regard.  It has been incredibly difficult to receive dental services or vaccinations when one was outside of a school system.  It has been incredibly difficult to do the leaving certificate when one was outside of a school system, but 50% of those who choose to home educate do so because the school was not working.  They removed their children from school for a variety of reasons.  That means that we have to ensure that those people are catered for.  Before the pandemic, the Department of Education and Skills website said that it was compulsory for children to go to school beyond the age of six.  It is not compulsory, as I am sure the Minister is aware.  That was closing off an avenue to people who were struggling.  Many of the calls I was receiving were to ask about the other options when a child is struggling.  Do they have to cry for two years in a row because they are being bullied in a school system or are we actually supporting them by providing other alternatives?</p><p>It was a significant step that the 2014 legislation moved responsibility for home education and home tuition, as mentioned earlier, from the Department of Education and Skills to Tusla.  I welcome the fact that it has been moved back because these are not extreme situations.  These are our families.  They are the same as anyone else.  They are being educated and they should be treated the same.</p><p>I will not speak any further on that other than to say that I welcome the Minister's position.  I look forward to working with her and to bringing an alternative view to education, which I believe is valuable when we are talking about a society as diverse as ours.</p></speech>

I also know the important role teachers play in listening to and caring for students and the value extra resources can provide in helping children reach their full potential and feel connected.</p> <p>I have spoken and listened to the voices of people and NGOs across Ireland ahead of today's debate about the need to ensure that reopening our schools is done in a meaningful way that gives everyone an equal chance.  There is a common thread to what I heard that would make all the difference for young children seeking asylum, children from a migrant background, Traveller children, children living in homelessness accommodation, and children who have a learning disability such as autism and dyslexia.  What is clear is that children experience poverty racism.  They come from poor communities, do not have appropriate accommodation, or any accommodation, and often get left behind in normal times, never mind during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Regarding class sizes, there are too few supports, and not enough homework or after-school facilities play a part in making education too difficult.  That, in turn, has a direct impact on children's experience, their ability to stay in school and the level of their achievement.  That has nothing to do with their intelligence or their ability.  It is all about rejection, neglect or damage by the school system itself.</p> <p>Since March, I have been hearing about children who could not complete their work at home due to not having laptops, an Internet connection and a safe place to call home or a place in which they could study.  There are children right now who are living on sites without Portaloos and in overcrowded accommodation who do not have access to any privacy.  If we are serious about creating the conditions in which all children are able to have equal access to schooling again, there are issues that need to be addressed.  We need extra special needs assistants and resource hours; a programme of after-school, out-of-school and homework supports; and an education plan for every child diagnosed with a learning difficulty that takes into account his or her unique needs such as living conditions and accommodation.</p> <p>Every school needs to be clear on the diverse needs of their students.  They must stop treating them as if every student is the same.  The starting point should be access to technology supports at home, awareness of the way racism is making life very difficult for them, and the impact poverty is having on their ability to be able to participate in education.  Schools can work with children and their families to ensure they believe they are being heard and understood, proud of who they are and the community to which they belong.</p> <p>Some Traveller families are getting no support during this time because many parents cannot read or write and do not have any support at home.  As Martin Luther King said, we should have the audacity to believe that people everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Last but not least, yes, we are facing a huge challenge in trying to reopen schools in the face of Covid-19 but I also see this as an opportunity to fix what has been broken in our education system for far too long.

While I have the Minister, my colleague, Senator Hoey, referred to the Traveller History and Culture in Education Bill.  The former Minister, Deputy McHugh, was in favour of the Bill and campaigned for it.  We look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy Foley in the future and hope she will be equally supportive of the Bill.</p></speech>

I know of her personal deep commitment to education and notwithstanding the criticisms of Senator Warfield there is a very clear commitment on the part of the Government to education.  It is our top priority.  It is probably reflected in the number of speakers on the Government side who are present.  There will be no shortage of speakers on the Government side wishing to offer on education, in contrast to the Opposition benches.  Senator Warfield also offered criticism of the Government in terms of outlining the full range of challenges which the Minister faces.  They are considerable.  However, it should be remembered that Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the establishment of the Department of further and higher education in this very Chamber on Friday.  Notwithstanding how much work the Minister already has to do, Sinn F&eacute;in would have given her even more work dealing with the challenges facing our universities and colleges had its approach been followed.</p> <p>The Minister has certainly had a baptism of fire.  I do not think any Minister in their first four weeks in Marlborough Street has had to face the range of challenges she has, dealing with issues from predictive grading for the leaving certificate to ensuring that our schools are reopened at the end of August.  It is really welcome that she has delivered a substantial package of &euro;375 million to ensure that the schools will be open.  I join colleagues in welcoming, in particular, the appointment of 120 guidance counsellors.  Apart from the importance of students being able to get access to their academics, their health and well-being are also going to be essential during this difficult period.  What plans does the Department have, if we see an outbreak in a particular area or school, to ensure those students' education can continue?  If there is a particular community or school that has to close because of a cluster, what plans are in place?  Will those plans be made widely available?</p> <p>There is a need to focus on supporting last year's fifth years, who are now moving into their leaving certificate year.  It is going to be as difficult for the incoming leaving certificate students as for those last year.  They have to be at the centre of our thoughts.  There is also going to be the question of the school bus challenge.  Being from Kerry, the Minister will know as well as I do, coming from Wexford, that at the best of times the issue of school buses is a challenge.  There is a need for a review of the whole school bus scheme.  It is essential that there is a lot of clarity for those who have to use school buses over the next month.  I ask the Minister to outline that to the Chamber and to a wider audience.</p> <p>Colleagues have mentioned concerns around schools that are already overcrowded and that face a number of challenges.  In Gorey and Wexford town there is already a shortage of secondary school places.  This is going to place additional pressures on those schools.  It is a matter of looking at the specific geographical areas where those problems arise.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Minister is often going to be firefighting, but I join Senators Hoey and Pauline O'Reilly in welcoming the idea of a citizens' assembly on education.  It is crucial that the Department also focuses beyond the pandemic and considers how we can invest in this area having a long-term strategy.  I ask the Minister to have regard to the strategy on modern European languages that is being introduced by the Department.  We must ensure that there is access to European languages from primary level on.  One of the big challenges at second level is that there is a shortage of language teachers.  This is something the strategy needs to develop.</p><p>We need to look at technology education.  The pilot technology programme is in place in quite a number of second level schools.  We have to look at expanding it.  Equally essential from primary level on is that we enhance the levels of digital literacy such that students are able to understand how to use technology but also to differentiate between fake news and real news.  It is important that we expand education in the area of democracy and rights.  We have a successful politics and society programme which began as a pilot and is now becoming more widely available.  I join calls that student participation right through the entire education process at an appropriate level would be encouraged.  We also have to continue to invest in creativity and design.  Given how we are all adapting our workplaces and school, the importance of understanding design also needs to be emphasised.</p><p>It is a cause for concern that the bell curve that is going to be used with regard to the calculated grades for this year's leaving certificate needs to be clearly explained to and understood by a wider public.  I wish the Minister well in her role.  I encourage her to be ambitious for our education system and our learners.  I am quite certain she will be.</p></speech>

We are each taking two minutes.  On school planning, I would be grateful if the Minister could check with the Department's forward planning unit to see if the Blackrock and Haggardstown area outside the town of Dundalk is outside their radar for new school development.  Louth county councillors are going through the whole process of drawing up the county development plan.  Now would be an excellent time to sit down with planners and staff in Louth County Council and in the Department's unit to make sure the proper zoning is there in the first place for new school buildings to be built over the next six to seven years.</p> <p>It would also be important to carry out a survey of parents in the local area.  It has been done previously.  People input their Eircode postcode to show they are resident in that school area.  There should be a survey of parents to find out what type of school they would like in their community, an Educate Together school, a community national school or a church-run school.  This worked well three years ago in Faughart, where parents decided to transfer the national school to the patronage of Louth and Meath Education and Training Board.</p> <p>I also want to raise the issue of the Teaching Council.  Many citizens in Northern Ireland train to become teachers but it takes a long time for them to process the registration of their qualifications so they can be appointed to jobs here in the South.  Whether a school is in Dundalk or Donegal, when we need so many new teachers coming in to work in September it is really important that we speed up the registration process so that schools can give jobs to teachers from across the Border</p> <p>.  On the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, applications, students are given the calculated leaving certificate results on 7 September and on 11 September UCAS opens.  It is important that we get more clarity on the appeals process for students who are not happy with their results on 7 September.</p></speech>

Those students doing the leaving certificate in 2021 have not been in a classroom since March.  We face an uncertain autumn in terms of the reopening plan and the possibility of second, third or fourth waves of Covid-19, as has been said.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Over the coming weeks and months we will need an outline of plans to ensure that those students move as seamlessly as possible to the new exam in 2021.  It is never too early to start thinking about that.  What provisions are being made for schools that simply do not have the space to implement the plan and provide for all their students every day?  The requirement for social distancing of 1 m will mean a reduction in class numbers.  Will extra room be provided under this plan?</p><p>Overall I welcome the reopening plan.  This is the first national priority.  Everybody wants to see schools reopening and we understand the absolute need to have children back in school.  This plan has been resourced with &euro;375 million.  I commend the Minister and her colleagues on that.  This is a well thought out step by step plan to manage schools each day.  I wish teachers, management, ancillary staff and school bus drivers well in putting their new routine in place.  I thank them for their commitment. </p><p>I also welcome the 1,000 additional teachers in the post-primary sector, including 120 guidance posts.  This will help student well-being.  In regard to safety and well-being, it is also very important to remember that many students and teachers have underlying health issues.  They may be nervous about going back to the classroom.  I am glad this plan puts resources in place to support the school community.  I wish the Minister well.</p></speech>

The biggest challenge is the one on which she embarked yesterday and she has made a great start.  Could the Minister address the issues raised by Mr. John McGowan of the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, today?  It was disturbing to hear him talk about staggered opening.  I ask the Minister to try to minimise that.</p> <p>It is great to hear that we will have another 1,000 teachers at post-primary level.  I would ask the Minister to comment on the question of supply in her response.  Any primary level teacher who gets any teaching time at all should be able to count it towards his or her qualification as part of the Droichead framework.  That is a big issue for some people.  I ask that we use the extra teachers to permanently reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.</p> <p>I would like to raise something that is a little bit outside the Minister's remit but is very relevant.  I ask her to ensure that the school meals programme is expanded and very widely used.  It is also important that online bullying is dealt with.  Work on school halls has been halted for a long time.  I am thinking specifically of St. Aidan's comprehensive school in Cootehill.  The Minister should visit it to see a glaring example of the need for a new school hall.  There are very compelling reasons for this.</p> <p>Looking to the long term, I would ask the Minister to look at the readiness for distance learning, which will be necessary in any future pandemics.  In that context, the broadband plan is vital.  We have evidence from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that work needs to be done there.  </p> <p>I am glad to hear about the weekly day for teaching principals, enhanced supervision, aid for school readiness and the extra capital funding to help schools to prepare.  I welcome the plan.  I think it is good.  I would love for the Minister to respond to me specifically on St. Aidan's comprehensive school in Cootehill.</p></speech>

I listened very carefully to her speech.  Naturally enough, at the moment most people will be focused on the plan to reopen schools, which is extremely welcome.  Education is a very important and challenging brief at any time.  Everybody recognises the particular importance and sensitivity of the work before the Minister now because of Covid-19.  We recognise the vital importance of getting students back to school and of ensuring systems of education, examination and college application in which people can have confidence, that are fair to all and that prioritise the needs of the most vulnerable members of our society. </p> <p>I was listening carefully to the Minister's speech.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When she spoke about the need for intensive engagement with stakeholders from the education sector, she rightly mentioned teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, school caretakers, school management bodies and so on.  I noticed there was no mention of patrons or trustees.  I sometimes think that the important and indeed legislatively defined role of patrons and trustees is left out or dealt with under the general heading of school management.  That may just be an oversight in this case, or perhaps the category of school management is intended to include patrons and trustees.  I wish to draw that to the Minister's attention.  I certainly hope there was consultation with patrons and trustees.</p><p>I also have a couple of other questions.  I apologise if some of this ground has already been covered by the Minister or by other speakers.  The Minister mentioned the &euro;375 million in funding for the roadmap.  Does that include the &euro;75 million provided as part of the July stimulus package to support minor capital works?  My apologies if that is a question to which everybody else here knows the answer, but I thought it appropriate to ask.  It certainly occurred to me while I was listening to the Minister.</p><p>I particularly welcome the funding to provide release days for teaching principals.  The pressure on teaching principals, as opposed to walking principals, is acute.  The need for greater assistance in this area has been a source of discontent and concern among teaching principals.  I welcome this measure and many other provisions the Minister has spoken about today.</p><p>It is understandable that many teachers are concerned by their potential exposure to the coronavirus.  However, there may be a danger of that threat occasionally being overstated in the media and elsewhere.  Great strides have been made to minimise its spread.  I noted that Professor Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist who is a member of the UK Government's scientific advisory group for emergencies, has said that there has yet to be a single confirmed case of a teacher catching Covid-19 from a pupil anywhere in the world.  I hope that is true and that it continues to be true.  It is to be hoped that will give comfort to teachers ahead of the reopening of schools, even as we take all of the necessary precautions.</p><p>Regarding the cancellation or postponement of the leaving certificate and the issue of calculated grades, it is important to note that the system broke this year because of its inflexibility.  Of course we need an objective system of assessment for students.  However, there was huge and widespread concern about the pressure that system put on people before Covid-19 came along.  Now is the time to look at how the problems that already beset system can be fixed.  We need to look at the possibility of students doing part of their leaving certificate examination at the end of fifth year and perhaps in several stages during sixth year.  We need to look at the possibility of awarding more grades for parts of courses at school.  In another context, we spend a lot of time talking about the mental health challenges younger people face.  It is important to acknowledge that our system is a tremendous cause of stress.  Stress is a part of life and we must all encourage resilience, but where a system imposes stress unnecessarily, we must examine it.</p><p>An approach to life, public policy and law based on human dignity requires us to take a hard look at the leaving certificate system.  Should students be competing for such high stakes over that particular period just because it is required by a small number of college courses that demand a lot of points?  That is an issue to which we will have to return.  I could say more but I do not have time to say it now.  I wish the Minister the very best.  Let us all hope that this system works and that people have confidence in our education system.  That system is crucial, not only to the well-being of the people going through it but to the success of our economy, our competitiveness and our ability to thrive as a nation.</p></speech>

This &euro;375 million package involves more than 1 million students, 100,000 staff and 4,000 schools.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Foley, her team and the Government for their effort in putting together what I consider to be a comprehensive and significant plan and investment in our education and schooling system.  It is an extraordinary feat when we consider what it took to put this plan together in such a short space of time, which involved engaging with many stakeholders to try to get schools reopen fully for the beginning of the academic year.  Each and every one of us is motivated to get schools open because we know the impact being away from school has had on children and families during the pandemic.  I am glad to see that this plan not only focuses resources on school facilities and refurbishments but also looks to deal with the well-being and mental health of students, recognising that the pandemic and being away from school has had an adverse impact on children's mental health and well-being.  It has also exposed, as Senator Hoey and Senator Flynn have outlined, the mass inequality in our education system.  Not every child has equal access to education, not every child experiences the same supports at home, and not every child experienced the lockdown in the same way.  Some children found the lockdown a very positive experience having time at home.  For other children it was a very difficult time.  Schools provide a safe haven for many children and we need to get them back there.</p> <p>I want to make observations on some of the specific measures outlined in the plan, in particular the minor capital grant of &euro;75 million.  That is very welcome but I know the grant will be distributed on the basis of pupil numbers.  As someone who comes from a rural constituency, I know that in a small rural school with small classroom sizes it will be difficult to afford some of the refurbishments that are required.  I will highlight one example.  I will not name the school in question but it will cost it &euro;22,000 to refurbish its toilets and to have the basic cleaning facilities for their pupils.  That school will only receive &euro;16,000 so there is a shortfall of &euro;6,000 for the toilet and hand-washing facilities alone.  The Minister might look at the situation with regard to small rural schools.</p> <p>I welcome also the release days for teaching principals.  A significant problem is that many principals in small rural schools are teaching principals.  That release day will be of huge benefit in terms of allowing them cope with the extra work.</p> <p>I am aware others have spoken to the Minister about the calculated grade system about which there is significant anxiety.  There has been an issue with students who undertook studies outside of school.  They have done subjects off their own bat without doing them during school time.  I believe they have been disadvantaged in that they will not be given a predictive grade for that particular subject.  I ask the Minister to look at that to see if anything can be done for those students.  They are small in number but nonetheless they are significant.</p> <p>In the time the Minister will have once she gets the schools reopened I ask that she might examine the psychological impact of social distancing for younger students.  I am aware that students from third class up will be asked to socially distance.  I would have concerns around that.  They are still very young to be trained and encouraged not to shake hands, not to hug their friends or not to be in close proximity to their friends.  I ask the Minister to review that policy in the months ahead.</p></speech>

She is very welcome.  I congratulate her on the Trojan work she has done in the few short weeks since her appointment.  There was certainly no honeymoon period for the Minister and it is a phenomenal achievement on her part that, four weeks in the position, she has announced one of the biggest packages we have ever seen in the education sector.  As a mother, I am delighted and relieved that this announcement has been made.  I can now speak to my children with certainty, outline what is going on, help them to reconcile with the new reality, explain the issues to them, reduce their anxieties and try to help them adapt to new terms such as "bubbles" and "pods" and the rules that will flow from them.</p> <p>I look forward to the communication campaign to assist parents like myself in explaining how things will work to our children.  It would be welcome also to get guidelines on when not to send a child to school.  I realise that a cough and a high temperature is a stay-at-home issue but I have a boy who has a runny nose from the time the temperature drops in October until the following Easter.  I want to know whether a child who has no other symptoms can be sent safely to school.  Clear guidelines from the Department of Health would be very beneficial to cut out the guesswork and give teachers and parents some clarity.</p> <p>Another query I have is about the provisions that will be required for online remote learning for those students who may have to self-isolate or schools that may have to close to assist the schools, the students and the teachers to continue the use of online platforms.</p> <p>Another issue is the teacher levels in primary schools.  A number of schools contacted me with regard to some schools losing teachers because they find they are just below the threshold in terms of keeping their teaching staff numbers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That will result in increasing class sizes and decreasing social distancing.  I hope that this will be reconsidered as during this time we should not be taking classrooms out of commission or allowing schools to lose teachers.  </p><p>The teachers I know have been working very hard in trying to adapt to and foresee some of the changes.  They have an incredibly tight deadline but with the funding and the extra supports, I hope it will be a successful time for all.  What is expected of teachers is colossal but with these extra supports I believe it can be achieved.  We have an incredible body of dedicated teachers.  I hope the increased capacity of teachers we are putting in place to deal with the volatile Covid-19 pandemic can be retained and a programme put in place to keep these teachers employed will be introduced so that they can be used to decrease class numbers in the future.  I wish all teachers the very best in their efforts to prepare for the opening of schools for 1 million students across the country.  Our first day in school of the new term will be a first day like no other.  I wish the Minister the very best.</p></speech>

Like her, until recently I was a physical education teacher in a classroom in a secondary school so I would like to think I can bring something to this debate.  For some of the time available to me I would like to concentrate on the logistics of operating physical education in the secondary school setting.  I am heartened to see the reference in the Minister's document that pupils' physical education is a central part of their well-being and that it should form a significant component of timetable programmes upon returning to school.  It goes on to state that teachers should choose learning experiences where pupils can work individually or in small groups, for example in their pods, with minimal equipment.  While that makes a lot of sense on the face of it, it does not address the obvious question, which is how teachers and schools handle the changing room situation, particularly in the secondary school setting because, by their nature, changing rooms are constrained settings.  If a situation arose whereby the pods or groups do not apply in the case of changing rooms, given that every student takes part in physical education, I would question their validity in their entirety in the school setting.  I ask the Minister to focus on that area and ask her officials to address that particular concern.</p> <p>I reiterate what other Senators said with regard to teachers who have specific health concerns.  Is there specific leave available?  What are the provisions being put in place for those teachers because clarity is needed by principals and boards of management?</p></speech>

I was particularly heartened to see the provisions in yesterday's plans when it comes to ASD and the provisions for special needs assistants.  However, I want to draw her attention to a particular lacuna in the provisions, that is, in the areas of Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W.  As a result of interventions and lobbying by the Involve Autism group and the Dublin 12 autism group a report was commissioned by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, at the behest of the previous Minister, Deputy Joe McHugh.  That report highlighted that lacuna in the provision.  It also highlighted that it is being disputed by some of the schools which have come out on the public record and released letters countering the engagement by the NCSE, and it would appear that there was a lack of site visits.</p> <p>The Department does not seem to have an inventory of the provisions within schools or the school accommodation.  As a consequence, there is a dispute between what is possible and what is the reality.  I ask the Minister to examine that.  I am grateful to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, who facilitated a meeting recently between Involve Autism and myself.  I have the fullest confidence in her.  However, I believe also that we will require the authority of the office of the Minister, Deputy Foley, to ensure that these children are included and that they have a right to be educated in their local community among the children in their local community, as has any other child.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There may be an autism spectrum disorder provision in the junior part of the school but not in the senior part.</p></speech>

I have two questions, one of which relates to yesterday's announcement and the second to a local school.  Do the guidelines set out yesterday regarding school transport extend to after-school services that provide a drop-off and collection service for parents?  I know a business in Clonmel involving three carriers collecting, on average, 20 or 25 children on any given day.  If those guidelines do not include after-school services, what arrangements should they make?  May children returning to after-school services mix with those in other schools or pods or should they be grouped in school pods?</p> <p>Cahir is located in my constituency in Tipperary, and I seek an update on a new building for a primary school there.  There are two primary schools in Cahir, one for boys and the other for girls.  The principal of the boys' school, Mr. Brendan Horan, has been very progressive in trying to move forward this matter.  This application began in 2004, some 16 years ago.  The tender process was completed on 30 November 2019 and an announcement is long overdue.  Does the Minister have an update on this matter?  I tried to contact the her office two weeks ago and I have been waiting for somebody to come back to me.  I know officials have been busy but people in Cahir have been waiting a long time to bring together the boys' and the girls' schools.</p> <p>I wish the Minister well in her new role.  My mother was a teacher before becoming a Deputy as well, so I have a slight understanding of the transition that the Minister is making.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on her appointment.  I wish her well because, to be absolutely clear, everybody wants to see the schools reopened on time and for all our students to be able to go to school safely in order to learn.  It is absolutely crucial that this happens.</p> <p>I have concerns, although a few are based around the need for more detail.  I welcome the points made about well-being but I want to understand exactly what the well-being programme will look like.  A really excellent survey has been done by the Irish Second-Level Students Union, ISSU, of 11,000 people, which is quite significant, and it highlighted, for example, that 24% of respondents have concerns about transitioning back to school in September and over 51% noted concerns relating to academic matters.  Of the respondents, 29% had concerns around physical health and there were 662 comments around stress alone.  I welcome the note about the 120 guidance counsellors but from where is that figure coming?  I suspect that we will probably need more, particularly as this was a key request of the ISSU.</p> <p>When my kids go to school in Limerick, they do not do so in a normal school building.  They have been waiting years for a school building and I asked the Department for an update on that three and a half weeks ago but I have not received a response.  It is a significant school in Limerick city.  It is a school that has been converted from apartments and there will be no space to operate at all.  To be frank, my main concern is not what the Minister has done since entering office but, rather, the significant delays endured by parents over the summer months.  They did not even know whether to reserve spaces on buses.  We just need to understand how this will be done in three weeks and how the 1,000 teachers will be put in place in that time really concerns me.</p> <p>I emphasise one of the points made by my colleague, Senator Warfield, who stated that last year more than 500 teachers a day were not being replaced by substitute teachers.  While the figure of 1,000 teachers sounds impressive, when we put it in that context, we know it will not be enough.  Again, I would like a detailed response on that matter.  I will not take up any more time as I want to let other colleagues contribute.</p></speech>

Comhghairdeas to the Minister and I wish her well.  As has already been said, she had a baptism of fire.  There was some veiled criticism in the background but fair play to the Minister because she kept her head down and did not come out with half a statement.  It is a credit to her and her team the way that she addressed this matter today and yesterday.  I was very impressed listening to her on the way from Roscommon this morning when she was interviewed on "Morning Ireland".</p> <p>This is about welfare and well-being and getting children back to education.  Without doubt and like most in the Chamber, the question I have been asked over and again is whether we can get children back to school.  There is no doubt about what the Irish people want; they want a return to school but they want this done safely and properly.  A number of teachers rang me to say they wanted to get back, play their part and do this right.</p> <p>This is a considerable package and the well-being element is quite important.  It includes psychologists, guidance counsellors and special needs personnel.  It looks like the Minister has covered every area but of course there will be challenges.  Not everything will go right.  Who said we have ever lived in a society where we were free of problems?  Some people have said we should fix classroom sizes now but if we did so, the schools would still not be open by next May, never mind the end of this year.  It is an important matter but this is the way to proceed.</p> <p>I hope this will lead to the opening of schools.  Work will be required and the minor works scheme is very important in this regard.  As Senator Lisa Chambers mentioned, there may be some challenges with the financing of works in smaller schools, and it may not be possible to do the required work with the amount of money they receive.  I say "well done" to the Minister.  She has my support and will continue to have it.</p></speech>

I am sure everybody in the House wishes her well.  Many of the speakers have commented on secondary schools so I will focus on primary schools.  I have three or four points and a couple of questions.</p> <p>Supply teaching panels have been announced for the primary sector but how many teachers are likely to be employed on each panel?  There is a major focus on secondary schools, which is welcome, but I want to ensure primary schools are covered accordingly.  May each primary school appoint a Covid aide for the logistics?  It seems schools can do so but will that person's appointment be for the duration of the school year?</p> <p>Is there any additional support for the supervision of pupils within primary school?  It appears there will definitely be additional supervision and support staff for secondary schools but I did not see anything for primary schools.  I will leave it at that because we are constrained by time.</p></speech>

I stand here because I am always concerned in these cases that students with disabilities could potentially be left behind because of the challenges they suffer anyway.  I refer particularly to students with vision impairments.  I came across several cases during the lockdown where visiting teachers had made no contact whatever with such students.  Will the Minister look at addressing such cases?  I know 30 seconds is not adequate but that is life.</p></speech>

I am a maths and physics teacher and co-founder of a school in Ennistymon called Mol an &Oacute;ige Steiner national school.  It has been in prefabs for more than 16 years, and although it got approval from the Department for buildings, it is waiting for one letter from the Department so that it can start the tendering process.  My son is 21.  He went to school at four years of age and we are still waiting with those prefabs.  It would save the Department money if we built permanent structures for these schools that have approval instead of wasting money on renting prefabs.</p> <p>The Department of Education and Skills is promoting Aistear and the primary school language programme, which I am sure the Minister is well aware of.  This is a perfect time to implement this programme because it requires the same things that we required during the Covid-19 pandemic, which are younger children needing extra staff in the classroom and more space outside.  I appeal to the Minister because this is an opportunity not just to make children happier and healthier but also to help the Department to implement the Aistear programme.  I wish the Minister the best of luck.</p></speech>

I am a great believer in the co-operative and inclusive approach in education, particularly in how this roadmap was brought about.  It was as a result of extensive consultation and engagement with the widest range of partners and stakeholders in education.  I do not for one minute assume that there is a monopoly of wisdom when it comes to solving issues and I am very happy to engage with the Seanad on an ongoing basis.  If I do not have the opportunity to answer all of the different issues raised by the Members today, I will most certainly speak to my officials and will engage with the Members on an ongoing basis in that respect, which is only fair and proper.</p> <p>I appreciate that I have limited time and I will deal initially with some the points that have been raised.  On protocols for parents, and given that guidance has been issued on protocols within our schools, protocols will also be issued to parents on what, when and how to do things when bringing children back into the system of education.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When the roadmap was finally launched yesterday, all of the information was sent immediately into the schools.  An email was also sent from me to the staff within the schools and indeed to the parents.  I reiterate that the success of the roadmap will be based on the co-operative approach of everybody who engages with the school sector.</p><p>I will ask my officials to revert to the Members on the specific cases raised by them with regard to Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in and St. Paul's secondary school in Monasterevin.</p><p>I am very conscious of the sixth years of 2020.  I acknowledge that there is anxiety among pupils who have finished fifth year and are going into sixth year about how they will face their exams.  This is also the case for junior certificate students.  Accommodation is being made for those students.  The curriculum will not change - it cannot change at this stage - but the breadth of assessment of that curriculum will change.  It would be very hard to determine what one teacher would teach at a particular time and another teacher would teach at another time.  It is not possible to interfere with the curriculum, but the assessment will take into account some students' absence of engagement in the school process.  This is the case for the leaving certificate, the leaving certificate applied, the junior certificate and all of the exams in that respect.</p><p>On the question of the inclusion of caretakers and secretaries in all of the benefits, this is most certainly the case.  The package here is for the benefit of all who work in the school community.  There is a provision of &euro;14.7 million for caretakers, secretaries and SNAs who might have to exclude themselves because they have to cocoon, or whatever, in the same way as there is provision for the teaching staff.</p><p>The 120 posts for well-being were raised by Senators.  A figure of 120 has been provided for because it would represent the restoration of the full guidance places so that full guidance services can be maintained.  They were missing and have now been returned.  They are there because there is a considerable focus at primary and secondary levels on well-being and on safely and happily reintegrating students into the school system.  A considerable emphasis is being placed on well-being supports being made available to the entire school community.  Many staff members may have particular anxieties about returning to the school system.  That is also provided for.</p><p>On the minor works funds, there may be doubts about when the money will arrive.  The money will automatically arrive into the school.  It will be received on the basis of capitation grants and will be easily accessible.  I am aware that work is under way in many places at the moment.  It was previously done, and that will continue to be the case.</p><p>As to contacting parents and informing people, there are dedicated helplines and there is a strong element of communication in terms of advertising.  A series of materials will be made available prior to children returning to school and parents or guardians bringing their children to school.  For example, there will be short cartoon-like, age-appropriate videos for children.  The website is now live to access information.</p><p>I will not get the opportunity to deal with all the Senators' points.  If they want to raise their specific queries directly with my Department, I will ensure they get responses to them.</p><p>Senator Craughwell said that we cannot give a guarantee.  There are no guarantees on anything at this point.  However, I can guarantee that there is absolute determination and goodwill from all of the partners in education to ensure schools open fully and safely.</p><p>Specific schools were mentioned, including one in Kinsale.  We might discuss that at another time.  I am very familiar with the school in question.</p><p>Issues were raised with regard to the substitution panel.  A substitution panel is being rolled out on a national basis because of the immense success of the six pilots that took place around the country.  This success is acknowledged by the INTO and all of those involved in it.  I have no doubts as to how successful that will be.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is there to ensure that when teachers are not available for any reason, their classes are not subdivided into other classes.  It is in addition to the normal pool of substitutes available to principals in the primary sector.</p><p>SNA and caretaker voices were mentioned, and I assume we would include school secretaries too.  I categorically want to say there has been intensive engagement between the Department and the union that represents SNAs, caretakers and school secretaries.  I wish to confirm that I have also met that union.  It is important that is abundantly clear because everyone who works in the education sector is of equal value.  I want to underline that and it is my intention to continue that.  I am afraid I have run out of time.</p></speech>

As Members will be aware, it is the Government's intention to progress the Bill through all Stages in the House today and I look forward to the exchange of views that will flow from the debate.</p> <p>This important legislation constitutes the Government's response to the new challenges posed to our courts and legal systems from the current pandemic.  However, the Bill goes beyond the pandemic and will make many of our legal processes more efficient and effective into the future.  I have no hesitation in saying that this Bill is urgently needed and, overall, it represents a substantial modernisation and reform of our courts and legal systems.</p> <p>The Bill covers a wide range of issues relating to both our civil and criminal legal systems, such as the reform of the law concerning coroners in the context of the current pandemic, the introduction of a statutory basis for our courts to conduct remote hearings in civil proceedings; the admissibility of business records as evidence in civil proceedings; the lodgement of documents with the courts by electronic means, or e-filing; the lodgement of what are called "statements of truth" with the courts by electronic means as an alternative to the swearing of affidavits; provision for the wider use of video links between persons in custody and the courts; enhancing and widening the existing provisions on giving evidence through video link; providing for appeals in criminal proceedings to take place via remote hearing; removing the existing requirement to transport prisoners between prisons to execute a warrant; providing for the remote meetings of State bodies, unincorporated bodies and bodies designated by Ministers of Government; the execution of documents in counterpart; and making it easier for the Courts Service to alter the operating hours and sitting locations of the District Court.</p> <p>I will now outline the provisions of the Bill.  As many Members will know, the provisions of Part 1 are standard in nature and are common to nearly all legislation.</p> <p>Part 2 contains urgent amendments to the Coroners Act 1962.  The main provisions, at sections 7 and 8, provide new powers for the Minister to authorise temporary additional capacity in the coroner system as necessary to meet the risks and challenges arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.  Section 6 is a standard definition section to reference the principal Act, which is the Coroners Act 1962.</p> <p>Section 7 inserts a new section 11B in the principal Act entitled Assignment and appointment of temporary coroner in exceptional circumstances.  The section applies where a coroner makes a written request to the Minister, justifying the need for a temporary additional coroner in that coroner district.  The justification must satisfy the Minister first, that exceptional circumstances arise due to the number or nature of deaths resulting from a pandemic, catastrophic event, or other mass fatality occurrence, and second, that the requested extra capacity is necessary, to increase the number and progress of coroner inquiries into deaths in the coroner's district.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If so satisfied, the Minister may assign or appoint a temporary additional coroner to that district for a period not exceeding six months.  This may be renewed, each time for a period not exceeding six months, on a fresh request from the coroner of the district, but only if the Minister is satisfied with the up-to-date justification provided.</p><p>If the coroner district is outside Dublin, the Minister will consult the responsible local authority before deciding on the request.  The Minister is responsible for the Dublin coroner district.  A temporary coroner under this section will have all the powers and duties of a coroner for the district concerned during the period of appointment or assignment, other than the power to appoint a deputy.  He or she will effectively be acting as an additional coroner.  Where a temporary coroner is assigned or appointed, the Minister shall designate the requesting coroner as the senior coroner for the district, and that senior coroner will order the work of the district to ensure coherence.</p><p>Section 8 inserts a new section 13B in the principal Act entitled "Arrangements for coroners' districts other than coroner's district of Dublin".  This section provides that, in the exceptional circumstances already described, where the coroner of a district so requests in writing, the Minister may authorise the deputy coroner of that district to act concurrently for the coroner, during a period not exceeding six months, which may be renewed.  The deputy must have consented to so act.  The same justification is required for this request, and for any renewal, as under section 7 of this Bill and the same arrangements in respect of powers, duties and costs apply.  The proposed section applies only to coroner districts outside Dublin.  The reason is that in the Dublin coroner district, the deputy coroner is already authorised to act concurrently with the coroner under a Dublin-specific temporary provision at section 13A of the principal Act, which is valid until 2022, having been introduced by my predecessor, Deputy Flanagan.</p><p>Section 9 proposes to amend section 14 of the principal Act, which sets out the qualifications required for appointment as coroner or deputy coroner.  The effect of the amendment is to add an appointment as temporary coroner under the proposed new section 11B to the situations which require those qualifications.</p><p>I now move to the issue of the reform of the law concerning civil proceedings.  Section 10 of the Bill, in Part 3, chapter 1, simply provides for a definition of the term "civil proceedings" in this part of the Bill.  More substantively, Part 3, chapter 2, provides for the remote hearing of civil proceedings.  As Members can all appreciate, current social distancing rules are causing disruption to, and difficulties for, court hearings and this is leading to delays in the administration of justice.  In the current climate, this is particularly challenging for the Courts Service in maintaining the efficient and continued operation of our courts.  I am sure the Members in the House will agree that we must do everything we can to assist our courts and to protect the well-being of those engaging with them.</p><p>Section 11 makes provision for remote hearings in civil proceedings.  This provision enables a court to direct that any category or type of civil proceedings be conducted remotely.  A court may make such a direction either of its own motion or on the application of any of the parties.  Participants will take part in a remote hearing by electronic means and from a location other than the courts itself, whether inside the State or outside the State.  A court shall revoke a direction to participate in a remote hearing where, for whatever reason, it would be unfair to any of the parties to do so, or it would otherwise be contrary to the interests of justice to do so.  It shall also be an offence to make a recording of a hearing without the permission of the court.  In addition, a judge may participate in a remote hearing notwithstanding the fact that he or she is not physically within his or her district or circuit.  In summation on this chapter, the conducting of remote hearings will be an important tool to facilitate the efficient dispatch of court business, will increase court efficiency and will provide a mechanism to overcome the current difficulties.</p><p>I now move on to Part 3, chapter 3 of the Bill, which concerns the admissibility of business records in civil proceedings.  The reforms in this chapter are based on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its 2016 report "Consolidation and Reform of Aspects of the Law of Evidence" and reflect similar provisions in the Criminal Evidence Act 1992.  The commission's report considers that business records are possibly the most common form of hearsay evidence presented in litigation and their legal status is of particular importance.  In the great majority of cases, and in the previous absence of a statutory basis, many litigants in civil proceedings agree to admit documentary hearsay evidence in order to expedite proceedings or to spare themselves an adverse costs order if the objection proves unfounded.  However, in a minority of cases, certain litigants, most notably those who would be incapable of satisfying a costs order in any event, may insist on proof of each and every document.  These cases have posed increasing difficulties for our courts in recent years and highlight the need for statutory intervention.  In its report, the commission recommends that records compiled in the course of business, because they are generally reliable, should be admissible in civil proceedings as an inclusionary exception to the hearsay rule, subject to the safeguards set out in the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This chapter provides that in civil proceedings, any record in the form of a document compiled in the course of business shall be presumed to be admissible evidence of the truth of the fact or facts asserted in that document.  This does not mean that the record cannot be challenged in court by any party to the proceedings.</p><p>The remaining sections set out provisions concerning oral evidence in respect of those documents, the rules around providing copies of documents where the original is not available, the procedure and timeframe for supplying documents to the court and the power of the court to determine whether it is in the interest of justice to admit documents as evidence, among other issues.  Before moving on, I would like to thank the Law Reform Commission for laying the groundwork for this chapter and particularly for the assistance it provides to my Department and many others through its invaluable work. </p><p>Chapter 4 provides for two important measures concerning the use of electronic means in civil proceedings.  The first concerns the remote lodgement or "e-filing" of documents with the courts and the second concerns the provision of statements of truth as an alternative to the swearing of affidavits and the ability to lodge those with the courts by electronic means.</p><p>Section 20 of the Bill introduces the use of electronic means in civil proceedings.  This will be available as an alternative to the lodgement or filing of documents or applications in paper form.  Rules of court may specify the conditions under which documents can be submitted by electronic means.  The current crisis highlights the benefits and necessity of providing these services.  This is a long-term solution which will be of particular assistance while the current restrictions continue but will provide the Courts Service with the legislative basis needed to progress court procedural and process reform.</p><p>Section 21 provides for the introduction of a statement of truth.  This may be in electronic form and can be used as an alternative as a means of submitting evidence or verifying documents to the swearing of an affidavit or statutory declaration.  A statement of truth shall comply with any other requirements prescribed by rules of court.  Section 21 also makes it an offence for a person to make a false statement or cause a false statement to be made.  Apart from addressing the difficulties arising from the personal contact required for the preparation and witnessing of documents at present, the introduction of the statement of truth is critical to court process reform and will yield significant benefit to the Courts Service and users of court services.  These changes are critical to court process reform.  The introduction of these measures is essential in the context of the current pandemic but also has the potential to yield significant benefits to the Courts Service.</p><p>I will now discuss Part 4 of the Bill, which contains substantive reforms to our criminal procedure law, particularly in relation to the widened use of video link technology in criminal proceedings.  This Part also includes important reforms to improve efficiency in executing warrants.  These provisions are urgently needed to assist courts with the conduct of their business in these extraordinary times.</p><p>This Bill provides for the wider use of video links between persons in custody and the courts.  These were formerly permitted in limited circumstances under sections 33 and 34 of the Prisons Act 2007.  On the recommendation of the Attorney General, the Bill also extends provisions to cover persons not in custody so that any accused person can attend by video link, for certain applications, where the court so directs.  The Bill allows the court to direct that video link will be the default for certain categories of application.  Where an individual application is not covered by such a direction, the court can still direct that the application will be conducted over video link on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>In relation to the giving of evidence by witnesses over video link, the Bill, for the types of hearings covered, allows any person to give evidence via video link with the permission of the court.  Currently this is permissible in limited circumstances only under the Criminal Evidence Act 1992.  There is provision to allow appeal hearings in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court to be conducted remotely where the court is satisfied that it is fair to all parties and not contrary to the interests of justice.  This includes a provision that it shall be an offence to interfere with the remote means for conducting such a hearing, mirroring similar provisions in respect of civil proceedings. </p><p>Regarding committal warrants, the Bill rectifies a long-standing problem in relation to the execution of warrants for a person who is already in prison.  The Bill provides that any warrant committing the same person to prison may be executed at the prison where the person is already detained, even if that warrant names another prison on its face.  This removes the need to transport prisoners between prisons and back again merely to have warrants executed.  It also reduces the need for staff and personnel to do that.</p><p>Finally, there is a general provision in the Bill to allow courts flexibility to make arrangements for the just and expeditious conduct of hearings in criminal proceedings.  This has been included on the advice of the Attorney General and is intended to address practical solutions such as the need to accommodate social distancing requirements, for example by spreading those present at the hearing out over more than one room.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Part 5 of the Bill introduces provisions and reforms the law on several issues.  The provisions in this Part are intended to ensure compliance with social distancing and the health and safety of citizens.  The provisions facilitate the continued operation via remote means of State bodies, unincorporated bodies and designated bodies.  In continuing the Government's policy to make our legal system more efficient and accessible beyond the current pandemic, this Part also provides for the execution of legal documents such as contracts and deeds in counterpart, and includes a provision to assist the Courts Service in making the operation of the District Court more efficient and flexible. <br/><br/>I will now outline the main provisions of this Part to the House.  Section 29 provides for the remote meetings of State bodies.  Any business of that body conducted remotely, for example decisions taken or votes made, shall be as good and effectual as if the business or the body was conducted in person.  A relevant Minister may designate a State body for the purpose of holding meetings or parts of meetings remotely, subject to certain criteria. <br/><br/>Section 30 provides for the remote meetings of unincorporated bodied, for example, clubs, community associations and charitable organisations, during an interim period.  As in the previous section, any business of that body shall not be affected by the fact that the meeting was held remotely.  For the information of the House, the interim period to which I refer shall be the three months following the commencement of section 30 or any other period as requested by the Government in the interest of public health. <br/><br/>Section 31 provides that bodies designated by relevant Ministers may hold hearings remotely, subject to certain criteria.  A person required to attend a hearing in person shall be required to do by remote means and the designated body shall have the power to make any arrangements to conduct hearings by remote means.  Designated bodies will also have the power to determine, following representations from the subjects of the hearing, whether the holding of a hearing remotely would be unfair to that person or contrary to the interests of justice.  For both sections 30 and 31, where a body is the responsibility of more than one Minister, all Ministers must be consulted before a designation order is made.<br/><br/>Before moving on, I would ask the House to note that I intend to bring a small technical amendment to section 31 on Committee Stage. <br/><br/>Section 32 is aimed at bringing about efficiencies in our legal systems and provides for the execution of documents such as contracts or deeds in counterpart, subject to the requirements set out in the section.<br/><br/>Section 33 assists the Courts Service in the operation of the District Court.  Under paragraph 26(1)(<i>f</i>) of the Courts of Justice Act 1953, the Courts Service must prepare and issue a statutory instrument each time it needs to vary District Court opening hours or locations.  The experience of the Courts Service is that the making of orders under paragraph (<i>f</i>) can be quite complex and time-consuming and does not supply the flexibility necessary to address its requirements in situations such as, but limited to, the current pandemic.  Section 33 inserts a new section to the 1953 Act providing that each time the Courts Service needs to vary the hours of operation, sitting location, etc., of the District Court it shall publish a notice outlining the need for change on its website.  Before issuing such a notice, the Courts Service must consult with and receive the consent of the President of the District Court.  This approach is less complex and more efficient than the current provision of the 1953 Act.  The amendment is essential in assisting the Courts Service in ensuring the efficient operation and continuation of the business of the District Court.<br/><br/>This Bill contains important steps in the process of modernising our courts and our civil and criminal law systems in the light of the current pandemic and beyond.  The measures I have outlined to the House today will ensure the continuity of the essential services our courts provide in manner that is efficient and safe for our citizens.  I commend the Bill the House and I look forward to engagement with colleagues on its contents.</p></speech>

This is the first piece of legislation that has come before this Seanad from the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is a very welcome legislation.  As the Minister said in her Second Stage speech, there are some really progressive aspects to this Bill that will help the Courts Service and the justice system to function in a much easier and more efficient way.</p> <p>It is important to recognise the importance and urgency of some of the provisions of the Bill outlined by the Minister.  I note the Minister intends to introduce more legislation in this vein in the coming months.  I look forward to further opportunities to debate it.  As with every piece of legislation that has come before the 26th Seanad, this will pass all Stages in a short period of time.  Everybody recognises that this is generally an undesirable state of affairs, but it is permissible in the circumstances that make the measures in all of that legislation urgent.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The impact of the Covid crisis has brought home to people how systems are sometimes not designed to respond to a pandemic or an emergency.  The Courts Service and the justice system are no exception in this regard.  It is important to recognise that we have a very good, functional justice system.  We score well on just about every international matrix.  The system has its flaws, without doubt.  There are issues regarding access to civil justice, such as civil legal aid for some individuals, and there are issues with delays in the process and these have been exacerbated by the Covid crisis.  As a general rule, however, we have a functional justice system.  Judges are fair and amenable to the rule of law, the courts are amenable to review and appeal and, in general, the persons who come before the courts are well represented and get a fair and just hearing from the judges they come before.  Sometimes we are slow to recognise what we do well and quick to criticise - and that appropriate - but we should take a moment to recognise that the system here works very well in administering justice for people, citizens and non-citizens alike.  This is an important aspect of what the legislation does, namely, facilitating that system.  However, as the Minister indicated, there are aspects that need to be improved.<br/><br/>One issue that the Covid crisis has brought home is how antiquated the system is in some respects.  This Bill goes to the heart of some of those matters.  I refer to the notion of electronic filing of documents.  Until recently, there was a requirement for a physical document to be signed by a particular person - and that a particular oath had to be sworn - and brought physically to an office in the Four Courts.  That is now a thing of the past.  It is appropriate that this legislation should deal with those issues and allow the legal services, both the courts and practitioners, to enter the 21st century.  I am not aware of any jurisdiction in the developed world where the same strictures as those which currently obtain in Ireland apply.  It is welcome that the matter is being addressed in the legislation and that it will be easier for people to do the things to which I refer online in an efficient way that benefits everybody.<br/><br/>I will go through the measures in the Bill.  On the reform of the legislation relating to coroners, the coroner system in is probably quite antiquated. This country relies on legislation primarily dating from the 1960s.  It has been updated a little but is still very rigid.  There is definitely room for provisions that can improve it and there is probably room for a consolidated coroners Bill in the future.  What the Bill before the House does in the area makes a great deal of sense and is a recognition of the fact that, from time to time, an emergency situation will arise and that the system, as currently designed, is not equipped to deal with it.  The measures which allow a Minister to appoint persons to fulfil the duties of those coroners, still fulfilling all the criteria that would be required to appoint that person in the first place, are welcome.  Good safeguards are included in those sections which provide for the manner in which the Minister can do that.  They provide safeguards in that context which are very important and which mean that we will not allow a given Minister to simply bypass important systems that are there already.  This is done well, the provision is measured and it is an important fallback measure for a Minister if and, perhaps, when something similar to Covid happens in future.  It is right and proper that this should be there.<br/><br/>Also front and centre in the Bill are the provisions relating to remote hearings.  These will allow witnesses to give evidence remotely and judges to be absent from the relevant districts when hearings are taking place.  Credit is due to the Judiciary in that it has dealt with many of the challenges brought about by the Covid crisis.  The Court of Appeal, as its president has pointed out, is particularly well-equipped to deal with those matters online.  There is very rarely<i>viva voce </i>evidence in the Court of Appeal, so there is an opportunity for lawyers to appear online and judges be present remotely.  The Court of Appeal has embraced that very successfully.  I am not sure when it last sat corporeally.  Having three judges creates a particular difficulty in the context of an infectious pandemic.  The court has addressed that well by having remote hearings.  We hope to return to a situation in September whereby the criminal courts will have sittings with live witnesses and juries present.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are particular challenges that face the Courts Service in terms of the administration of those processes, including jury pools, witnesses and so on.  Many of these provisions will assist the Courts Service in dealing with those issues and will remove the doubt that might otherwise have existed as to the legitimacy or otherwise of conducting hearings in particular ways.  That is very welcome.</p><p>In terms of addressing the modernisation of our justice system, it is entirely appropriate that we move towards saying that it is acceptable to use technology to streamline the process and make it more efficient.  Equally, by extension,  it is appropriate to facilitate people who are involved in that process, in some cases by not requiring their attendance.  I am aware of a trial scheduled in September where one of the witnesses is over 70 and has been advised to self-isolate.  It would be impossible for him to come to court in those circumstances but it will be possible for him to give video link evidence.  That is progressive, appropriate and welcome.</p><p>Another important modernisation concerns the statements of truth.  The somewhat antiquated method of swearing affidavits and the requirement for a religious or other affirmation depending on the person's belief code date from a different time.  As long as the person swearing that affidavit understands that he or she is making a serious declaration of truth that is not to be trifled with or taken other than very seriously, the new system achieves exactly the same thing as the old system.  I therefore welcome the provisions in respect of statements of truth.</p><p>The measures in respect of facilitating appeals are also welcome.  A particular hole is plugged by section 27 of the Bill, which deals with committal warrants.  There has been a lag in that antiquated system for a long time.  That can now be undone and put on a statutory footing to give clarity to everybody involved.  It will also reduce the risk of further actions unnecessarily arising where somebody is in custody already.  This is a progressive and simple measure in section 27 that will save hassle for individuals and will save the State money in terms of proceedings that might take place as a result of errors.</p><p>All the measures contained here are reasonable, progressive and good and they all achieve a particular and identifiable good.  The business records point required clarification which has been achieved in the Bill.  I welcome that.  The Minister makes an important point in her Second Stage speech about the fact that business records are an exception to the hearsay rule.  It is dangerous to chip away at evidential rules that are there to protect everybody but it is important to recognise that this does not mean business records are automatically admissible and cannot be challenged.  The Bill retains the right of a person in court to challenge a business record if it is the appropriate thing to do.  The usual provisions still apply.  Sometimes it is dangerous that we think of these provisions that are protections for all of us as loopholes.  Every loophole is in fact a protection for the person whom we perceive as guilty but who may be innocent but accused.  That is a very important provision and a safeguard that we thankfully have in our legislation.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It is progressive.  I particularly welcome that in the next few months we will have an opportunity to do more in this area because there is a great deal of work we can do to streamline and improve the process.</p></speech>

I wish to extend a warm welcome to the Minister this afternoon.  It is my first opportunity to address her in her new role.  I wish her well.  She will be working alongside the Minister of State, Deputy McConalogue.  I have no doubt they will get on like a house on fire.  I am aware both of them have had meetings with a number of organisations, some of which I requested on the organisations' behalf.  I thank the Minister sincerely for that and wish her well.</p> <p>I fully support the Bill.  Covid-19 has set many challenges for different aspects of our society.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The legal and judicial system is not immune to that either.  It is an opportunity, in many ways, to see how we can do business differently and in a way, even two months ago, we could not imagine.  I welcome that change and this legislation is a genuine effort to try to enter that space and bring technology to the legal and judicial system in a way that will make it work more efficiently.  It will be evident when considering the need to transfer prisoners to court or other prisons, the process of giving evidence in civil proceedings and the work of the coroner's court.  I would like to think this will be the first step in the judicial and legal system entering this technology space.  It is a challenge that Covid-19 has thrown to us and I hope this is just the beginning, in many ways, of how we can do business differently.  For those reasons I very much welcome the Bill.</p><p>For the citizens caught - if I can use that term - in the legal system seeking justice, whatever system we introduce must be fully operational so the rights of those citizens at all times can be respected.  The embrace of technology, in whatever form it comes, should in no way lessen an individual's right to get a fair trial or justice in a speedy and efficient manner.  For that reason the Fianna F&aacute;il Party and I are glad to support this legislation.</p><p>My colleague outlined in great detail the different aspects of the Bill and there is no need for me to dwell on them now other than to say I hope this legislation passes speedily.  I know some of my colleagues may have a number of amendments and I hope there will be an opportunity to address the legitimate concerns they may have so we can all embrace this legislation.  We are in a strange place now but it is reassuring how society is pulling together and doing things differently.  The legal profession and the Judiciary are no different in that regard.  I look forward to the Bill passing through the House successfully.</p></speech>

As my colleagues, Senators Gallagher and Ward, outlined, it is long overdue.  I worked in the legal system for a number of years and faced many of the frustrations that the Bill seeks to address.  It is very welcome, although it is a pity it has taken something like a global pandemic to bring about these changes.  It is good and progressive that we are doing this now.</p> <p>The legal system needs to prepare itself for the second wave of the virus that all the experts tell us is coming.  We need to get our systems in place and be able to continue to function with some degree of normality and allow the judicial system in particular to work.  Justice delayed is justice denied and we want to ensure everybody can access justice in as speedy a manner as possible.</p> <p>I particularly welcome the statement of truth changes.  I know the Law Society of Ireland has warmly welcomed this measure and it is something the society, of which I am a member, has constantly lobbied for.  It is a progressive act for this to be done now.  I know, for example, a number of people who needed to get affidavits sworn during the lockdown but they could not access a solicitor to do it.  The solicitors were putting themselves in danger by swearing affidavits.  It is a very welcome move.</p> <p>I hope this Bill can move through the House today with consensus.  There are some amendments and I hope we can work our way through them.  Changes such as those already before the House require political cohesion on the matter so I welcome the Minister's input, along with that of other parties in the House, in seeing if we can come to some sort of compromise and have the Bill passed.  I look forward to working with the Minister in implementing further changes that the legal system may need.</p></speech>

T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och go bhfuil deis agam labhairt sa Teach agus an reachta&iacute;ocht th&aacute;bhachtach seo &aacute; pl&eacute; againn.  The Minister is very welcome to the Seanad I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important legislation.  As others have done, Sinn F&eacute;in will support the legislation, although we have an amendment that I will speak to in this contribution so I do not necessarily have to repeat those remarks later.</p> <p>I agree with speakers who have expressed sentiment around the need to try to effectively clear the backlog as we deal with a Covid-19 health emergency.  Consequently, we understood we would not go through the normal process of pre-legislative scrutiny with this Bill in order that we could try to promptly deal with concerns around enabling our courts and those working within our criminal justice system.</p> <p>There are more fundamental issues of reform contained in the Bill.  That is not to say we oppose them, and we do not necessarily oppose them.  Nevertheless, they come from outside the health emergency scenario.  In the same way we seek to greater enable the criminal justice system in doing its job, the purpose of the amendment, which effectively sets a sunset clause, is to enable us as legislators to do our job better.  It would give us the opportunity to review these important changes and examine them again.  I hope, God spare us, that it would not be in the same context of an acute emergency like the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>I urge colleagues to reflect on this.  As people have correctly argued, important aspects of this Bill must be examined and we support and endorse them.  There is consensus around the Chamber and between groups in that regard.  However, there are other matters to consider and we must be very alert.  It is a somewhat separate point but Senator Ward touched on something I raised last week.  It is how we do our business.  We conceded that there should not be pre-legislative scrutiny around this, we are taking all Stages of the Bill together and there are aspects of the Bill that do not necessarily pertain to the Covid-19 crisis.  The mammoth emergency health legislation will correctly come back for review in November and it would do no harm for us to take the same considered approach to this legislation and look at it once again.</p> <p>As I said, we will support the Bill and we understand further reforms will be introduced by the Minister later in the year.  That is important, necessary and welcome.  Nevertheless, legislation is being rushed through the Houses in volume, which should give us all cause for concern.  We understand the reasons but that is not to say we should not be alert and enable ourselves to examine such legislation again.  I understand some of the Bills are urgent.  I take that point and we have sought to work in a collaborative and co-operative way with other groups as much as we can in trying to assist the Government where the emergency legislation is relevant and needed.</p> <p>I acknowledge and agree the point on the need for more coroners, and that would be welcome, especially if the additional resources will mean inquests, including the Stardust fire victims inquiry, will not be further delayed by extra strain on coroners due to this pandemic.  The families of the victims of the Stardust fire, along with many other families awaiting inquests relating to loved ones, should not have to wait so long to have matters dealt with.  Two years of a backlog leads to much stress for any family of a lost loved one to endure.  I mention in particular those families of victims of the Stardust fire who have campaigned for justice for many years and who await a date for a fresh inquest.  I pay special tribute to the late Ms Christine Keegan, affectionately known as Chrissie, who passed away just recently.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She spent almost 40 years, along with her daughter Antoinette, campaigning tirelessly for a fresh inquest into the disaster that took the lives of two of her daughters, Martina and Mary, and so many others.  I hope that these measures will help and that we will see further reforms soon to resolve such resourcing issues in this area in order that families will not have to suffer the stress of long backlogs any further.  That is the real human impact and need that is out there and it is why we need to move on the issue.</p><p>While many of the provisions in the Bill will allow for practical solutions during Covid-19 and should be welcomed as they will assist the legal profession to operate in unprecedented and difficult circumstances, I note that of the changes in Part 4, which deals with criminal procedure, sections 23 and 24 are sought to be permanent reforms.  This will allow for the use of video link at pre and post-trial hearings, such as when seeking bail, free legal aid or sentencing hearings.  While I accept this will not be used during the trial itself, there is some evidence to suggest that even at those stages of the process an accused person might be at a disadvantage to have certain matters decided over video link.  I recognise that allowing for these traditional measures during the pandemic would prevent the transferring of prisoners, which might cause more harm than good for everyone involved, and keeping the prisons Covid free is an absolute must.  Nevertheless, these reforms are not just to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  They are reforms for the future, which raises the need for more care and attention as we move ahead.</p><p>We can all relate to what goes on in our own Zoom meetings.  How many of those have we taken part in lately where engagement is just not the same as in a face-to-face meeting?  Nuances can, of course, be missed and there are legitimate concerns as to why we need to reconsider that.  That is not to say there are not benefits to using video link, as is the case with other provisions in the Bill for civil cases, and even more so in the short term during this pandemic, but we have not had enough time to scrutinise the devil in the detail of the Bill to be sure in our own minds that we are doing the right thing and protecting human rights.  The reforms in this area are absolutely well intended.  We certainly want to enable the courts to deal with the backlog and for everyone to stay safe at the same time, but the issue is the absence of proper legislative scrutiny for such serious and fundamental reforms of our justice system.  The Bill should have contained only the temporary measures necessary at this time.</p><p>If everything in the Bill were a temporary measure to deal with constraints during Covid-19, there would be no issue.  I do not see why the reforms promised later in the year cannot incorporate the reforms in the Bill to avoid the unnecessary development of hastily passing some of the reforms.  We have to have a more considered, thought-out and nuanced approach to the passing of emergency legislation.</p><p>I wish the Minister well.  I do not want to be a hindrance to the important aspects of the Bill but there is legitimacy in our amendment.  I ask her and colleagues in the House to reflect on the need for that review.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#TTT00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister on her appointment and wish her well in the time ahead.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; go geal l&eacute;i.</p> <p>The Bill is generally welcome, although others may well already have commented that here we are, yet again, taking all Stages of an important Bill in just a few short hours in a single day.  While this is certainly excusable and necessary for Bills relating to emergency health or financial measures in response to Covid-19, or one-line Bills such as the Minister and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, which was debated here last week, it seems more difficult to justify in the case of a Bill such as this.</p> <p>The question that always has to be asked in such a context is whether the measures in the Bill are sufficiently urgently needed at this point for such haste to be justified.  The courts have made significant adjustments to their operations within the current legislative framework.  The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Clarke, recently stated the courts have made five years' worth of progress in the past five months.  The tendency to rush legislation always needs to be watched.  The review of the administration of civil justice group, chaired by Mr. Justice Kelly, is due to report in the next ten weeks or so on reforms to civil procedure generally, most of which dates back to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877.  Would it have made sense to fold these amendments into a larger set of adjustments to the system, perhaps based on that report?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is proposed that temporary coroners can be appointed to a district in an emergency.  I certainly have no reason to oppose that measure.  However, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that this is needed: "where exceptional circumstances arise due to the number or nature of deaths resulting from a pandemic, catastrophic event, or other occurrence leading to mass fatalities."  I hope the Government does not foresee that as necessary in the short term, against the threat from Covid, which, I hope, is slowly receding.  Notwithstanding the fact that we have to be vigilant, I wondered whether that formulation was somewhat alarmist.  A comprehensive review of the coroner service was carried out in 1999 and the changes in the Bill were not called for in that report, as far as I am aware.  The Seanad approved the Coroners (Amendment) Act 2019 last summer and the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, told the House that it represented "a far-reaching and important modernisation of our coronial law."  That Act contains 40 sections and none of the provisions in the Bill before us was included at that time.  I wonder why that is.</p><p>I turn to the use of electronic means for filing documents and the question of the enactment of the possibility of a statement of truth to be made when filing documents.  I spoke about this in the House last week.  I wish to give some context to my remarks and to many people's understanding of what was going on.  The Bill was approved by the Cabinet last Tuesday.  Fairly quickly, there was a response from the Law Society welcoming the fact that people were now to be released from the embarrassing position of either having to swear a religious oath or denying religion and making an affirmation instead, in the context of filing documents such as affidavits.  As often happens in this country, we were relying on newspaper reports - even those of newspapers of record - for our first understanding or analysis of what the Government was proposing.  It left me wondering whether there had been some kind of a leaking or sharing of the information by the Government with the Law Society at that point, prior to it being made available to the Oireachtas.</p><p>I may be wrong in what I am saying but it seems that the whole narrative of such matters can get very easily shaped if some people have access to relevant information before others.  I hope the Minister will help me understand more clearly what precisely are the implications for the current system of swearing an oath or making an affirmation in the context of filing documents such as affidavits.  Am I correct in thinking that the Government is seeking, via the legislation, to enable the rules of court committee to make whatever arrangements it considers appropriate in this area, and that it will then be possible for those responsible for making rules of court to have also on the table the possibility of making a statement of truth instead of the option of swearing an oath or affirmation?  Is it to be left under this legislation to the rules of court committee to decide whether all these options are to remain on the table for people or whether the system of oaths and affirmations might be abolished in favour of the statement of truth?  Is it the case that these provisions merely encompass cases where the electronic sending of documents is concerned, or will they potentially reach wider than that?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not going to table amendments to the Bill, although I might want to do so depending on what the answer is.  My concern is that, against a background of the early public welcoming for this legislation given in terms of decrying the existing system as embarrassing as opposed to focusing on the efficient operation of court business, which we all support, there is a failure to understand that the current system of making oaths or affirmations forms part of the way that the solemnity of the State is buttressed when people come to set out factual information for the consideration of a court, which is an issue of tremendous seriousness.  All that needs be done to prevent false averments is to provide a penalty for making them.  Obviously, there is a sense that something else is needed so that people have a clear idea of the seriousness of what they are doing.  Hence the requirement of a statement of truth.  However, it seems to be a false idea and a failure to recognise a genuine pluralism to go against a system that buttresses the solemnity of what is being done.</p><p>I have more questions than answers at this point.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply and, I hope, contributing further on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#VVV00200"><p>I congratulate the Minister on her new role.  I am conscious that she appeared in the House for another Bill, but this is my first time speaking on a justice Bill and I want to wish her well.</p><p>The Labour Party is happy to support the Bill, which contains several measures that have been long sought after by the legal profession.  One of those measures is the introduction of electronic filing and the issuing of documents from court offices.  This positive change will save solicitors and others significant costs and time.  However, what are the Minister's plans for introducing e-conveyancing?  That measure would greatly reduce the amount of time and money spent by those working in the law, but it is not obviously contained in the Bill.</p><p>The Bill provides for remote hearings.  Many of us who have been teleworking and continue to work from home hope that this will remain a feature of the post-pandemic world of work and the justice system in particular.  However, we have a query pertaining to section 11(6)(b)(ii).  Is it practicable to assert that a witness giving evidence by remote line, potentially from outside the State, is subject to the same obligations and liability as a witness present in court?  Could such a witness be found guilty of contempt in the face of court and be committed to prison?  This is an important point on which we need clarity, as it would have significant implications were an inaccuracy contained in the Bill.</p><p>Under Part 2, we welcome the measures to appoint temporary coroners when mass deaths necessitate a high number of inquests.  None of us wants to think about an incident taking place that would require such a measure, for example, an act of terror or an outbreak of illness, but it is critical that a backlog of inquests not develop.  A backlog forces bereaved families to wait for answers about their loved ones' deaths and reduces access to funeral grants, life assurance and other vital financial supports.  This is a difficult subject to think about, but we must be prepared for it during the time of coronavirus and into the future.</p><p>Another change contained in the Bill is to be enthusiastically welcomed, that being, the new statement of truth under section 21.  We understand that it will replace affidavits and statutory declarations and will not include the religious oath.  Since the Labour Party has long stood for the principle of secularism, this is a welcome measure.  We live in a pluralist society and it is important that this reality be reflected throughout every branch of the State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> My final point, which has already been raised by Seanad&oacute;ir &Oacute; Donnghaile, Senator Mullen and others, is on pre-legislative scrutiny.  I accept that this is not necessarily practicable for emergency legislation, but this Bill and others that are due to be taken by the House over the coming days include reform measures that are not intended to deal specifically with the pandemic.  In particular, Chapter 3 of the Bill contains the general amendment to the law of civil evidence to allow for the admissibility of business records in a simplified way.  This is a permanent amendment to the law and not something that relates to Covid-19.</p><p>Overall, the Bill contains a number of positive changes to streamline many of the more cumbersome processes of legal proceedings.  I join other Senators in calling for a more comprehensive reform, which I hope will be forthcoming sooner rather than later.  The virus has shown to be predictable only its unpredictability.  Bearing that in mind, these immediate changes are warranted and we are happy to support them.</p></speech>

She is hitting the road running by coming to the House today as we progress this important legislation, which will improve the efficiency of the administration of justice.  I acknowledge the work of the Courts Service in recent years in making the workings of the legal system more accessible to the public and the day-to-day administration of justice more efficient.  As Senator Ward stated, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, is a reforming voice who is bringing us - some would say dragging us kicking - into a more modern age of the administration of justice where people feel a part of it.</p> <p>A number of Senators have addressed various aspects of the Bill, including the welcome reforms relating to coroners.  I will touch briefly on sections 13 to 15, inclusive.  Section 13 is on business records as documentary evidence presumed to be admissible.  The key word is "presumed".  There is no automatic admissibility.  Like other Senators, I would be concerned if there was ever an erosion of our country's strict rules of evidence, which are cherished and upheld day in and day out in the courts.  I welcome this section because there is a presumption, which people are entitled to refute and rebut if properly armed with the legal ammunition.</p> <p>The Minister kindly mentioned the Law Reform Commission, LRC.  I suspect section 14 has its genesis in the 2016 report.  The LRC is the unsung hero in the administration of justice and should be better resourced and more valued than it is currently.  Often, its reports lie on shelves for decades before we get around to them.  The LRC is usually way ahead of the curve.  What it suggested in the report it published in 2016 is becoming a reality during the pandemic.  We do not like to see an erosion of the evidential rules, including on the admissibility of business records, but it brings us into a more modern time when an approach like this is important and where such records are compiled in the ordinary course of business.  There are balances and checks and these can be found in section 16.  Apart from Covid, the higher courts will be able to exercise their inherent jurisdiction.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is very important that misinformation does not go out from this House today.  In, say, debt matters, the nature of these contracts often means that a summary procedure is instituted, which does not mean R11s; it does not go to plenary.  However, there is no prohibition on a plenary hearing in this modern step the Minister is taking.  If, for instance, a debtor says he or she never got the money and disputes the admissibility of the business records, the court will take that into consideration and, apart from its own inherent jurisdiction in the higher courts, will consider if the information is reliable, if there is reasonable inference that the information is authentic and whether it is likely to be possible to controvert the information.  Consideration is given to all the circumstances which may be taken into consideration or drawn from the accuracy of the information or otherwise.<br/><br/>I know the intent of the legislation in many respects but when it comes to personal debt we should always remember that we have the personal insolvency regime on a statutory framework in this country which is one of the most modern in the world.  It is a fair system and it should be embarked upon by anyone in debt difficulty.<br/><br/>I understand that the amendments will in a sense save unnecessary court costs.  They will become less unwieldy but it is not a <i>fait accompli.  </i>There is still a plenary hearing entitlement if one can convince the court of its appropriateness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.215" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#XXX00200"><p>I want to explain the reason we will support this Bill.  Pre-legislative scrutiny is essential, and I am sure many of my colleagues have spoken about that today.  However, this Bill contains, first, necessary measures with expiry dates attached, which is essential when we are talking about Covid-19 and, second, low-hanging fruit measures in terms of the type of legislation needed for our courts.  I have spoken to the Department with regard to that and I am satisfied that they are low-hanging and that they are contained in the 2016 law reform report in particular.  The measures around hearsay are included.</p> <p>When we are talking about coroners we have two issues at hand.  First, there are a number of inquests coming up, particularly the second Stardust tragedy inquest and, second, we do not know where we are going to go in terms of Covid-19 and we must prepare for that.  As it stands, however, we already have a backlog when it comes to coroners and we can only allow one per district.  That must change.</p> <p>The prison system has done an extraordinary job in keeping Covid-19 at bay.  If we are to continue that down the line, we must ensure that those who are accused can attend court remotely but also ensure that they will not bring Covid-19 back into the prison system.  That is why this Bill is very important on the criminal aspects.  In addition, we know that there is a backlog of civil law cases.  This Bill will ensure that that backlog is addressed.</p> <p>When it comes to the miscellaneous section, it is there for a particular period for Covid but if this works we need to look at how we can allow State bodies to ensure that we can have remote voting and remote meetings.  I am thinking in particular of councils and women councillors who are unable currently to take maternity leave.  When they step out they can no longer participate in the votes that they would and should have been entitled to be part of.  I ask the Minister to take that into consideration to see how we can facilitate local government in that regard.</p></speech>

She has clearly hit the ground running with this far-reaching legislation.  I will be delighted to work with her over the next few years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many of us in this House who pass through the halls of King's Inns look with bemusement at the Latin motto, <i>&quot;Nolumus mutari</i>&quot;, which means &quot;We do not wish to change.&quot;  As my colleague, Senator Martin, said, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, literally brought the Bar kicking and screaming into the 21st century.  The Supreme Court sat remotely for the first time on 20 April.  I would like to thank Mr. Justice Frank Clarke, and the Courts Service, for being so proactive and ensuring there was no lockdown within the courts during the Covid-19 lockdown period.  There was a slowdown but the justice system continued.  Great thanks are due to the Chief Justice and the staff in the Courts Service, all of whom should be hugely commended.  During that first remote hearing, the Chief Justice commented that while other jurisdictions have started or announced the commencement of remote hearings, in many cases they were coming from a significantly higher technology base.  Ultimately, what he was saying was that there is a major shortfall within the Courts Service in terms of ICT.  From my reading of it, this legislation, and bringing the Courts Service up to speed and into the 21st century, will require a major amount of investment.  From the Minister's point of view, I hope that proper funding will accompany this legislation.  It is vital that not only do we have the legislation but also that we have the proper funding for ICT facilities within the courts in order to ensure that they run smoothly.<br/><br/>As previous speakers pointed out, the legislation does not preclude plenary hearings.  In some instances, remote hearings are not ideal, for example, where there is digital disadvantage.  Across the midlands and in other parts of the country, there is a major lack of broadband services.  That would give people a disadvantage in terms of accessing remote hearings.  While many lay litigants may be familiar with technology, they can be unfamiliar with the way the courts work.  I know, as a practitioner, that when lay litigants are in court, judges are very patient and pragmatic when it comes to ensuring such individuals have the access to justice they would have if they had legal representation.  Vulnerable people also may not be suitable for that.  I would like to see what is going to be done in that regard.  It might require additional legislation or an extra set of rules to figure out how to deal with those instances.<br/><br/>There are also issues regarding the family law courts.  I am aware that there is legislation which deals with having fines for people who record <i>in camera</i>hearings but it will be much harder to police than that.  There is a huge backlog in the family law courts.  I am sure it has been brought to the Minister's attention that Dolphin House court is a disgrace.  It is probably the most dangerous place one could be in the context of Covid-19 because people are literally on top of each other.  It is unfortunate that, within the timeframe of the pandemic, there has been a major increase in the level of domestic violence.  That is another day's work but something has to be done in terms of Dolphin House and the backlog in family law proceedings.<br/><br/>I welcome the provisions in the Bill relating to the appointment of coroners.  It is very unfair for families to be obliged to wait a long time for inquests.  Not only in Covid times but also in general, the appointment of coroners should be prioritised.<br/><br/>I would like to ask the Minister about the extension of technology to e-conveyancing, as mentioned by my colleague, Senator Sherlock.  Many practitioners and auctioneers are already doing that.  Auctioneers and solicitors are setting up their own e-conveyancing arrangements but it is very difficult to get buy-in from the banks.  The State needs to be involved in any e-conveyancing set-ups.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Will remote hearings be extended to extra-judicial hearings such as those of the WRC or the refugee appeals tribunals, which would benefit from similar guidelines?</p></speech>

This is my first chance to do so in a public forum.  We are particularly proud of her in the region I come from, as we are near neighbours.  I also endorse the remarks of Senator Martin, as echoed by Senator Ardagh, on the Chief Justice.  He is a very reforming Chief Justice and it merits recognition here.  Senator Martin is my near neighbour in Carrickmacross, and I also congratulate him on his appointment.  We know each other a few years now.</p> <p>There are good aspects to this legislation, including necessary modernising aspects.  It is important that it includes the potential to appoint extra coroners and the use of the deputy coroner, as is the case in Dublin, and will be extended across the country.  Delayed inquests are particularly painful and difficult families.  Families find themselves in a shocking position after untimely bereavements and we should not add to their pain with delay.  That is important.  There is also the context of additional deaths from Covid.  It is a very good legislative change that those appointments are possible and that there can be practical, common sense use of existing personnel.  I welcome that dimension.</p> <p>I welcome remote hearings.  It is common sense in the electronic age that there would be that modernisation.  Without straying, although much is allowed during Second Stage, everything we have discussed since Covid emphasises the need for implementation of the broadband plan of which I was a great champion in the last Seanad and remain so.  We need to implement the broadband plan immediately to facilitate these modernisations, so that civil hearings and so on can be held remotely if necessary or simply witness statements received.</p> <p>Slightly extraneous to today's debate, I ask the Minister to review the on-the-spot fine system.  The more people we can keep out of our courts the better, and we can do so with their use.  It is what hurts most and hurts immediately, and should be done, rather than clogging up a court system with petty things.  As a general principle, the use of community service and training and extra education should be to the fore in our justice system.  Where rehabilitation can be introduced, particularly in cases of addiction, it should be supported.  As a new Minister, I ask that she review these areas and stretch the level of on-the-spot fines, community training, and the rehabilitation of those in addition, out to their limit. </p> <p>It is great that business records can now be introduced electronically.  I agree with the principle of the statement of truth.  It is much less cumbersome than a traditional affidavit.  It will be up to the Courts Service to impress on people the seriousness of what it is doing.  Traditional methods were cumbersome and delaying, and it required adjustment, especially when we have the modern technology.</p> <p>The use of video links is good.  It warrants use without prisoners being transferred around, not only in the Covid context but in a practical sense.  I am also happy that clubs, societies and various community associations can meet and take votes without necessarily transgressing proper legislative principles.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The point made by our Labour Party colleague earlier on e-conveyancing is worth serious consideration.  One of the great problems for ordinary consumers here is the cost and speed of conveyancing.  I appeal to the new Minister, who will be reforming and is already proactive, to look seriously at that option.</p><p>Those are the main points.  It is good that we are embracing the IT age with the legislation.</p></speech>

I congratulate her on the changes which the Bill brings in.  They are creatures of necessity.  While they are temporary, I look forward to them modernising how we conduct the business of justice in the State.  Many of the measures are welcome and long overdue.</p> <p>I particularly welcome the video link and warrant arrangements.  They will lend themselves to a more efficient and effective means of conducting matters of justice and may also lead to a diversity of inclusion and to a greater scope of individuals being able to have access to and participate in the courts system.</p> <p>Albeit a small feature, I welcome the provision for remote meetings of clubs and the filing of documents.  I echo Senator Ardagh's question about whether we intend to extend remote hearings to bodies including the Workplace Relations Commission.  It appears on reading the Bill that this is the intention.  Prior to Covid-19, we had been at a stage where we were seeing the inside of a hearing room reasonably quickly and the system was taking a shorter period of time than ever.  Naturally, Covid-19 has caused a delay which is a matter of concern.  I hope this Bill will alleviate that and we can work back towards where we were.</p> <p>The modernisation of the oath and the use of a statement of truth also allows for equality and really represents that our society includes persons of all faiths and none.  It is reasonable that we respect that.  I echo everything that has been said on facilitating e-conveyancing.</p> <p>Finally, as the Minister for Justice and Equality is present I raise the fatal shooting yesterday.  There has been a call to consider bringing in something along the lines of a police campaign like Operation Cherry Orchard.  The ordinary decent people deserve to be safe on their streets and they deserve to be safe as their children play on their greens.  I would appreciate a strong statement of support from the Minister to the wonderful and proud people and families in Ballyfermot.  I ask the Minister to use her office to empower them and support them in their lives.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House and wish her well in what will be a difficult and challenging task.  I have no doubt that the people who made the choices knew of her ability and record.  I wish her well in what will be difficult times ahead.  Having looked at the Bill and listened to the contributions to the debate, I welcome the legislation before the House.  While it is a minor step, it is progressive and it marks the beginning of the modernisation of the justice system.  There are issues, and we must always be careful when we change systems, but the administration of justice is important and there must always be equal access to it.  I welcome the first and initial steps towards the modernisation of the application of the justice system under the Minister.  I also welcome the appointments of temporary coroners in certain and exceptional circumstances set out in the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know the importance of the video links.  As somebody who has served on various prison authorities, I know the practical difficulties that can arise, particularly with Covid-19.  There was mention of Covid-19 and prisons and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work done in this respect.  It did not just happen overnight and there was a long lead-in to dealing with infectious diseases and health concerns.  Our prison staff, throughout the system, put processes in place long before Covid-19 had been heard of.  It is an amazing example of how the Prison Service came together, dealt with the matter and prepared for eventualities like Covid-19.  I acknowledge that work.</p><p>Of course, there have been difficulties and the Minister is aware of them.  For example, people get temporary release on special grounds, and such cases present challenges to the Minister and the prison system.  These are exceptional times and circumstances and the processes are being used correctly.  I do not detect that this pandemic is being used against prisoners.  There is a public health matter at the heart of this.  I know this because people have contacted me because the Minister has ultimately had to refuse cases of possible temporary release, even for a day, in special family circumstances.  The Covid-19 virus affects the logic of this.  I acknowledge the difficulty it has placed on the Minister and the governors of the various prisons.  We must also consider the complexities of justice and all that goes with it.</p><p>This is the beginning of a modernisation process and I generally support it.  I will wrap up on that point as I will speak to section 1 on a later Stage.  I do not know if the Minister has considered the amendments or if we will hear from her later.  I am interested in her considered response to the amendments before the House.</p></speech>

This is the first Bill I have brought through the Houses and I am under no illusion it will always be the case that the legislation will pass as quickly, but I appreciate Senators' support in that regard.  I take on board the points that have been made that it is not ideal how quickly this is being passed and that we have bypassed earlier stages.  I have asked for that and we are debating the Bill now so it can be enacted before the D&aacute;il and Seanad break later this week.  It is being done so the Bill can be enacted as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Many, if not all, the measures identified in the legislation were highlighted following extensive engagement with the legal profession, the Judiciary, the Attorney General and many others.  This was to ensure we can allow them to go about their business in an orderly fashion and that where delays or blockages exist, they can be released.  These measures are intended, in both the short and longer term, to help the modernisation of our courts system, and this is something all Senators would agree on and support.</p> <p>I refer to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's amendment and the focus on the sunset clause.  There will be many opportunities in the coming weeks and months to address these matters.  There will be legislation dealing with miscellaneous provisions in civil and criminal law, as well as the criminal procedure Bill.  There will be other opportunities where we will be able to discuss and address many more issues that will undoubtedly need to be raised.</p> <p>Many, if not all, of these measures are required very quickly because of issues arising resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic.  They will also be used in the longer term.  For example, I have spoken before about the provisions concerning the remote hearing of civil proceedings.  These had already been developed following detailed discussions with the Courts Service, so they have not appeared in recent weeks or even since the onset of Covid-19.  The e-filing and statement of truth provisions were highlighted as part of the external Courts Service organisational capability review that was carried out in the context of the Civil Service renewal plan completed in 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is a long-standing request.</p><p>The admissibility of business records element is based on the Law Reform Commission recommendations from 2016, as many have mentioned.  Video links have been recommended for some time and this part is also welcome, not just for the support such a process could provide during the Covid-19 pandemic but in general.  The measures in the section dealing with greater flexibility in times and dates of the District Court have been thought through and there has been significant engagement in the process from the Judiciary and legal profession.  Many of those elements have been sought for some time.</p><p>I fully understand where the Senator is coming from in asking for the sunset clause but I am sure this is not the only legislation on which I will engage with him.  We will cover many areas across the civil and criminal sectors and will have the opportunity to deal with them later.</p><p>I will touch on some other matters that have been raised.  Senators mentioned concerns about video links.  This legislation does not prevent video links being used during a trial as well as before and after but they will not go ahead either before or after unless a strict range of conditions are met and there are safeguards in that respect in the Bill.</p><p>A question was raised on the instances in which measures relating to coroners may be introduced.  We do not want to talk about the potential of a second wave of the virus or something else coming down the line.  However, we cannot allow it to happen that we would be caught unaware.  We have seen how in a second our life can change and we need to be able to adapt.  This is simply putting in place a measure should a second wave emerge or something else happen that would require additional coroners and support to be put in place.  In the Dublin district, as a result of the backlog and a lack of additional support, there are timelines of up to two years before people can get a coroner's report.  We do not want that to be replicated anywhere else.  These are extremely welcome measures and I thank Senators for their support in this regard.</p><p>A number of Senators mentioned the Stardust fire inquest.  I join the condolences to the family of Ms. Christine Keegan, who was instrumental in advocating not just for her two daughters but many other victims of Stardust.  This is an absolute priority for us as a Government.  After the appointment of Dr. Myra Cullinane, senior coroner for Dublin, who will hold the fresh inquest, the challenge that has arisen since the appointment is not a lack of engagement or the provision of services but, unfortunately, the onset of Covid-19.  The space identified for use with this inquest was not suitable under the new health restrictions so we are currently engaging with the Office of Public Works to ensure the process can progress as quickly as possible.  I can give Senators assurances in that regard.</p><p>I thank Senators for their points on admissibility of evidence.  As has been mentioned, this will save costs and give both sides a fair hearing, but it will not prevent a person at any stage from challenging this evidence.  A presumption of admissibility does not amount to the presumption that records are correct.  It is important to say there are a number of safeguards in the provision of this Bill.  Most important and in particular, it is open to the court in its own motion to exclude business records evidence in the evidence of justice.  I accept some of the points being raised but this at no stage should prevent anybody from questioning records being brought through this process at any stage.</p><p>I very much support the potential use of remote hearings for votes on councils if women are on maternity leave.  It is something we should look at progressing.  There is an ability for Ministers to designate bodies, such as the Workplace Relations Commission, that could come under this piece.  It is not intended for use just with the likes of the GAA, which is also important.</p><p>We tried to initiate through the July stimulus a package of &euro;5 million to coincide with the passing of this legislation to allow for changes to deal with the backlog in the Courts Service in the coming months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Substantial funding has been allocated to Hammond Lane, which will replace Dolphin House, as has been mentioned.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.236" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1688" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#DDDD00500"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 6, line 2, after &ldquo;provisions&rdquo; to insert the following:  	&ldquo;and continue in operation until the 9th day of November 2020, unless a resolution approving of its continuation has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>I referred to this amendment in my Second Stage contribution.  I will begin by saying that the composition of the group of justice spokespersons has changed in the Seanad, as has the Minister, but it was my experience from sitting on the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality and holding this brief for Sinn F&eacute;in in the previous Seanad that Members by and large worked collaboratively, engaged with one another and did not fall into the more common, perhaps combative, back and forth that one might see in other areas.  That is how I will approach this term and I look forward to the same spirit prevailing among other Seanad colleagues and the Minister.  That will be important.  Except in times when it has been absolutely necessary, we have shown that we can work together.  Much of the legislation that we will deal with is about keeping people safe, which is something on which we can all agree.</p><p>I do not want to delay this legislation, and it is important to say that my amendment does not seek to do that.  Nor would it if passed, because that is not what the amendment is about.  It is about adding a punctuation point for us as legislators and allowing us an opportunity in the context of the Covid-19 dynamic.  As the Minister rightly acknowledged, this legislation has not undergone the normal standard of parliamentary scrutiny.  It affords us that opportunity should we need it - there is nothing to say that we will - to stop, take a breather and consider the issue again.  As others have stated, there is more to this legislation than the Covid-19 emergency response.  While I do not necessarily take issue with those proposals, it would do no harm in the absence of earlier scrutiny and given the more rushed process today to revisit the legislation and re-examine it.  This is not about us being obstructive.  Rather, it is about strengthening and further enabling this legislation by taking the opportunity to re-examine and make its provisions stronger for all of the reasons and more outlined by other Senators and me so that the necessary change being sought can be the best it can be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#DDDD00600"><p>In the first instance, I would not ascribe for a moment motives of obstruction or delay to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  It is a perfectly reasonable amendment and has its place, but I do not believe that place is in this legislation.</p> <p>In his contribution on Second Stage, Senator Mullen referred to the provisions in section 7, which insert section 11B into the 1962 Act and refer to circumstances "resulting from a pandemic, catastrophic event or other occurrence leading to mass fatalities".  He lamented the idea that such circumstances might be foreseeable.  We all know that they are not, just as the extent to which the Covid crisis has affected the system was not foreseeable.  What the Bill tries to do - I do not just mean in respect of the measures on coroners, but the entire Bill - is put in place contingencies to allow the State to deal with these unforeseeable circumstances as, when and if they arise.</p> <p>I am not afraid of sunset clauses.  They are a very good idea as a general rule, but the difficulty is that I cannot envisage a scenario where we would want to undo these provisions.  They are contingencies for an unforeseeable eventuality.  That is why the amendment does not have a place in this legislation.  The provisions being proposed in the Bill are contingencies that are necessary and they must remain.  We cannot include them if, in a couple of months' time, we might decide that such circumstances are unlikely to occur, given that we do not know.  They are protections for all of us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#EEEE00100"><p>In the past week or two, I stated that we would be challenged.  These are difficult times.  It makes our job particularly difficult when one is in opposition and there is such a mass gathering in government, as is its members' call.</p><p>This amendment should be included in the legislation.  If circumstances change, we can reconvene.  In one of his speeches to the House, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, talked about the role of the Seanad in scrutinising, improving and polishing legislation.  It would be a sad day if the Government stood here with its vast numbers and told us &quot;No&quot; every time it proposed legislation, which it could do.  That would not be good.  Our job is to scrutinise legislation.  The amendment is a reasonable and appropriate intervention.  I have no difficulty with a sunset clause.  If circumstances change, we could revisit the legislation.  These are the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If a certain set of circumstances arise following any legislation, I would do nothing but expect the Minister to come to the Houses and seek to change it and engage with people.  Let us recognise the challenges.</p><p>The amendment is a reasonable proposal and I am supportive of it.  I encourage Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile to call a vote on it.  If we believe in something fundamentally, we should come to the House with a sense of confidence, articulate our views, point out the reasons for an amendment and make our strong case.  Ultimately, the House speaks through the mechanism of a vote, meaning its decision is on the record of the House.  This is an appropriate amendment and I urge the Senator to press it and, if necessary, call a vote.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Boyhan.</p><p>I listened to Senator Ward.  My experience on justice matters in the Seanad is that they have been conversational.  Members have engaged with and listened to one another and spoken out on matters about which we feel strongly.  I would probably concede the Senator's point more broadly if the Bill presented to us today, and certainly in how it was presented beforehand, pertained solely to the issue of the Covid-19 emergency and other such crises and emergency situations.  For example, Chapter 3 has nothing to do with the emergency measures and should have been subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny.  That is one of the reasons there is no harm in us adding that punctuation point and breathing space for us down the line.  As Senator Boyhan stated eloquently, if it comes to that time, we could still be supportive of this legislation.  The Minister has acknowledged that she will be introducing other measures in the autumn.  We will look to assist that process where we can.  I do not see why the other aspects of this Bill that are somewhat removed from the Covid-19 crisis and our response to it could not have been left until the autumn as well.</p><p>I do not want to postpone the inevitable.  I will be pressing the amendment and calling a vote.</p></speech>

These are not ideal circumstances in which to pass legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Helen McEntee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2394"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2394&amp;amp;pid=HelenMcEntee&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These measures, however, are different.  It is not just, as Senator Ward has outlined, that they are contingencies for unforeseen eventualities.  They are also changes, many of which have been sought for some time, that happened to be needed to try to deal with Covid and to ensure there was not a backlog and that justice could be served.  They will benefit not just the Judiciary and the legal professions but also our citizens, and they will be of enormous benefit to those working at and attending our courts.  They confer mostly a longer term benefit but they are needed in the short term too.</p><p>I am not sure what other way we could have introduced these measures.  Other provisions could have been brought forward but they were not really relevant for now to combat the challenges we face with Covid, so we have not brought them forward.  We have dealt only with the ones that have been asked of us and that we believe will create the greatest support for the Courts Service.  I accept the point the Senator raised but I believe that this provision is absolutely necessary at this time.</p></speech>

I fully accept that many of the demands are necessary and come from within the sector.  It is about freeing up backlogs and helping people who work within our courts system.  I have no issue with that and I do not disagree with the Minister in that regard.  If the amendment passes, that will still happen.  It will not hinder any of that.  As has been articulated, it will give us the opportunity to stop in the autumn and to take another look at the issue.  I recognise the context of how business has been done in the House in recent times, but this would not do any harm and it would be good practice for us to stop, take a breather and re-examine the matter.  I do not disagree with the Minister on the need for these changes.  I support the need for them and the amendment is not about delaying or hindering those changes in any way.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#LLLL00500"><p>The section concerns statements of truth, a matter that was raised on Second Stage and that was a subject of focus previously in the House.  To be clear, section 20 will provide for &quot;the lodgement or filing of a document with, and the making of an application to, a court by transmitting the document or application by electronic means&quot;.  Clearly, it is very welcome that such an adjustment to the way things are done will be made in the interests of efficiency and so on, and providing that documents, applications and so on can be made by electronic means is to be welcomed.  It is within that context, as I understand it, that section 21 arises, where it is provided that rules of court may make provision for a statement, known as a statement of truth, to be made and transmitted by electronic means in place of the affidavit or statutory declaration concerned.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Section 21(2) then sets out the specifics, providing that a statement of truth "may be in electronic form", should "contain a statement that the person making the statement of truth has an honest belief that the facts stated therein are true" and "may be signed by the person making it by that person entering his or her name in an electronic format".  This provides for it to be done electronically.  It is left to the rules of court under section 21(2)(d) to provide for "other requirements" about the "verification" of such a statement of truth.</p><p>It seems to me that the main efficiency achieved here is the provision that documents can be submitted electronically.  When we are talking about affidavits or statutory declarations, the question arises of the seriousness of such documents in presenting evidence to the court.  It seems to me that there are two dimensions to what is involved with the statement of truth.  One is the idea that instead of an oath or affirmation, there is this statement of truth.  The second question is whether such a statement is required to be made in the presence of another person.  As I understand it, the section amends or abolishes the requirement for a deponent either to swear an oath before God or to make a more secular affirmation, which is already provided for when swearing an affidavit.</p><p>I mentioned previously that the director general of the Law Society said it was embarrassing that a deponent should have the option of indicating their religious faith when swearing an affidavit.  That comment was unfortunate because it illustrates a certain attitude of official Ireland that anything with even the most cursory or inconsequential reference to religious faith should be abolished as being somehow out of date or offensive to other people.  There is something of a scratching of a secular itch going on here when one considers that there is already the alternative possibility of a secular affirmation anyway.  As I pointed out last week, the real lack of pluralism that exists and is not being addressed by this Bill is where a newly elected President or newly appointed judge has to make a religious oath.  I am thinking in particular of a President.  That is obviously a discussion for another day because it has a constitutional dimension to it.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Seanad has a prayer as Gaeilge and in English preceded by 30 seconds of silence.  This offers a better model for modernisation than what is proposed in this legislation.  I was on the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges when we came up with this new arrangement on foot of a proposal from Senator Bacik to dispense with the traditional Christian prayer in English and as Gaeilge.  I proposed at the time that we should recognise the solemnity of all legislators who gather, of whatever religious faith or none, and this was accepted by everybody including Senator Bacik.  The 30 seconds of silence addressed that in an inclusive way, but at the same time we avoided the lowest common denominator or the dispensing with tradition by maintaining the existing prayer after that.  I think people found that the atmosphere surrounding the whole thing was greatly improved by the change we made.</p><p>In a similar vein, when it comes to trying to put new structures in place to reflect different times we should avoid an either-or mentality and seek always to achieve a both-and solution or approach.  I think that what is proposed here would tend to facilitate an attack on a genuine pluralism.  I presume the Minister will respond by saying that this legislation merely enables changes to be made to the rules of court and that this is no more than an enabling provision.  Nonetheless, it seems to envisage the abolition of the requirement to swear an affidavit before a solicitor or commissioner for oaths.  Does it do more than that?  Does it envisage that even the option of swearing an affidavit before a solicitor or commissioner for oaths would be removed?  I would be grateful if the Minister would respond to that question.  What precisely is envisaged to happen?  Is it that there will no longer be the possibility of swearing an affidavit, or in the alternative, either making an oath or affirmation?  There is a big difference between swearing an oath using a religious or secular formula in the presence of a law officer, and simply signing on the dotted line and returning a scanned statement of truth by email.</p><p>This speaks to the second aspect of what I am talking about, which is the removal of the fail-safe requirement to present before another person or official.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the end, when we talk about efficiency, much has already been achieved by permitting the filing of documents electronically.  Does it really prevent efficiency that when it comes to the making of important legal statements, there must be a requirement of presenting before another person?  The fact that the law now seeks to provide for a statement of truth where it could simply penalise any false statements knowingly made or any statement that was false where the person lacked an honest belief that it was true.  There is clearly a recognition that there is a need to confront people with the seriousness of what they are doing.  Otherwise one would not be thinking up this alternative formula of a statement of truth.  The law would merely provide that if it is not true and if a person did not have an honest belief in its truth, then that person has committed an offence.  There is a desire to maintain seriousness here by requiring the statement of truth.  I am suggesting that that seriousness is frustrated by the dispensing with the existing formula in its current varied form.</p><p>It was mentioned to me by a colleague here that there are certainly judges down at the courts who are concerned about the existing cavalier way that some people have of treating oaths, sworn affidavits, and so on.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir gur sin sc&eacute;al eile go l&aacute; eile.</p><p>I am concerned that what is happening here would reduce the pretrial submission of evidence in civil proceedings to a box-ticking exercise and might increase the chance that false evidence would be introduced because it would not be viewed as seriously by those submitting these statements of truth, notwithstanding the severe penalties for making a false statement provided for in this legislation.</p><p>To make a simple comparison, when a person fills out a passport application or an application to register to vote, they are required to complete a section of it in the presence of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the reason being that this operates as a fail-safe.  It applies some measure of verification, imports an atmosphere of seriousness to what is going on, and compels applicants to take the process seriously.  If that requirement were abolished, does the Minister consider that there would be fewer or more false applications made for passports or for inclusion on the electoral register?  I would say that there would surely be more.  I fear that the same might be said about these statements of truth.</p><p>To summarise on the core issues, this is a false concept of pluralism - if that is what is at work here, and I would be grateful to hear the Minister&rsquo;s view on this - in proposing to replace the making of an oath or affirmation with a statement of truth.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am interested in hearing the Minister's view on the reasoning behind this provision.  The possibility that this could be done electronically and without the requirement for a person to present to a third party or official appears to be envisaged in the legislation.  What is the Minister's view on that matter?  Does she agree with me regarding the potential loss of an important fail-safe here?</p><p>I would also like to ask an overarching question.  Am I correct in stating that the legislation, in providing for a statement of truth, refers to situations where, under the previous section, documents may be or may be required to be lodged electronically?  Is it thought that there will be other documents that may not be permitted to be submitted electronically and that, therefore, would not be covered by this provision in the context of the statement of truth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-28a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072800002#OOOO00200"><p>I want to address a couple of issues Senator Mullen mentioned.  I understand the point he is making about pluralism.  It is a matter for the Minister to outline the rationale behind this section.  It seems to be more from the point of view of facilitating the electronic transmission of documents than addressing a wider pluralistic point.  It is important to draw the distinction between the different types of document required to be witnessed.  Senator Mullen made reference to passport applications and registering to vote.  In the case of a passport application, although I stand open to correction, I understand that the signature of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is primarily for the purpose of attesting to the person's identity rather than to the veracity of anything that was said in the context of the application.  I do not think that an instance of standard voter registration has to be done in the presence of a garda, it is only entry onto the supplementary register that requires this.  Again, this is to do with the identity of the person, which is demonstrated to the garda before the form is signed.</p> <p>The other key difference between those examples and the instant case in this Bill is that the Passport Act and the Electoral Act both provide for specific penalties for people who lie when completing those forms.  The legislation before us brings a specific, significant penalty, at both summary and indictable level, of up to five years in prison in respect of a person who makes a declaration of truth without honestly believing it to be true.  That contrasts quite sharply with other kinds of documents, such as an affidavit.  A person signs an affidavit, usually in the presence of a commissioner for oaths or a solicitor, and attests to the veracity of the statement he or she has made.  The signing of the document in the presence of the peace commissioner is only to prove that the person signed it and to attest to their identity.  None of these provisions actually secures the veracity of the statements made in any of those documents.  Every Member of this House at least once if not twice a year signs a statutory declaration in the context of returns to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  We are obliged to do it all the time.  Those statutory declarations have force of law and carry penalties for any mistruths or deliberate inaccuracies contained within them.</p> <p>The point I am trying to make is that this measure facilitates the going online of certain processes.  It does away with an antiquated practice, notwithstanding what Senator Mullen said - and I have some sympathy with him - in terms of the requirement to be in the presence of a particular person, sign a document in ink on hard paper in front of that individual and for that document to be physically transmitted to the relevant court office.  My understanding of section 21 is that it specifically enables us to move beyond that to a point where this will be done virtually, without ceding any of the protections that exist, making it any easier for people to falsify information or making it more permissible for people to render an untruth to the court.  In fact, quite in contrast to the situation that currently exists with respect to affidavits, the provisions in section 21 (5) lay down strict penalties for those mistruths or misdeeds.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=28"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->No such offence exists, to my knowledge, in statute.  Contempt of court obviously exists in common law.  This week alone, we have heard reference to the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018, which has already been through this House and is in the other House, specifically to address exactly these issues that are not provided for in statue law as it stands.  There may be common law provisions, contempt of court provisions and so on.  However, I respectfully suggest to Senator Mullen that the present Bill puts on a much firmer footing the seriousness of such a declaration and the penalty that comes with making it wilfully or without regard to its seriousness.  </p></speech>

These provisions are not meant as an attack.  What is envisaged by them is nothing more than what is set out here.  The intention is that this should be an alternative.  It is not meant as a replacement.  The rules of court may provide for a statement of truth in place of an affidavit but this is obviously where the person so wishes.  It is to try to ensure that we can create an efficiency, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 crisis and the inability of people to be able to sign a document in the presence of the required persons.  This has been available to people, more so in Dublin, but in the more rural areas it has been a challenge.  It is simply to provide greater efficiency, not to replace what is there.  Following on from that, in the case of somebody giving oral evidence, a person can still be asked to give evidence on oath whether they have provided a statement of truth or an affidavit.  We are not talking about removing the swearing of an oath or signing of an affidavit.  It is meant as an addition to provide a greater efficiency where it is potentially not possible but it does not remove that possibility for a person who wishes to do so.  That and nothing else is what is intended here.</p></speech>

I have much sympathy with that analysis.  There is a great deal to be said for efficiencies here.  I still think, and it probably has to be said, that the commentary and reaction of the Law Society to this was unhelpful.  To some degree, it raises certain issues that may not actually arise at all, depending on what the relevant committee produces in terms of options.  There is a big difference between getting rid of the requirement of an oath or affirmation arising out of some document of secularism or some misconceived definition and inaccurate grasping at pluralism and making issues more efficient.  That said, we will have to see what the relevant committee produces by way of an option.  I still think there is a validity to my comparison with the Passport Office and the supplementary electoral register.  I thank Senator Ward for that clarification also.  While he is correct to say that what is being proven by presenting oneself before an officer of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na goes to the issue of the identity of the person, in the end it all does come down to veracity.  If someone signs up to who he is and he is not telling the truth, that is the issue.  I would submit that it is veracity as to identity.</p> <p>The more important point here is the question of whether it is antiquated to require a person to appear before a third party when preparing information that is to go before a court, or whether it is a necessary fail-safe.  Whether, in appearing before that third party, one makes a religious oath, secular affirmation or statement of veracity that carries criminal sanctions if it is a false statement, need not detain us for the purpose of considering whether there ought to be the requirement to appear before a third party when preparing documentation before the court.  I remain to be convinced that it would be a good idea.  The legislation does not specifically indicate what the desired outcome is to be.  I am not convinced that it is a good idea not to require something of people when preparing documentation that goes before a court and that involves evidence and claimed statement of fact.  It seems to me that while it is good to facilitate efficiency by providing for the making of electronic statements, requiring some form of presentation to a third party be it an oath or statement of truth does not necessarily clog up the system or cause unnecessary delay.</p></speech>

It is a small technical amendment.  Section 31 provides for the designation of bodies by relevant Minsters for the purposes of holding hearings remotely.  Under the provisions the Ministers may designate bodies that may hold remote hearings, and persons who would otherwise be required to attend in person can be required to attend remotely.  Designated bodies will also have power to determine, following representations from the subject of the hearings, whether the holding of a hearing remotely would be unfair to that person or contrary to the interest of justice.  Having considered the matter further, I believe it would be useful to clarify in the Bill that where the subject of the remote hearing is required to produce a document to a designated body, it can be sent by post, electronically or otherwise delivered to the body.</p> <p>The second element of the amendment broadens the definition of the term "hearing" in section 31.  This amendment will provide greater flexibility to the designated bodies.  It will also allow them to conduct entire hearings, parts of hearings or the hearing of an appeal or part thereof, remotely.  It is a small amendment to the Bill but it is essential.
