I also thank the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for providing the necessary waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny and the Chief Whip for enabling the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 to be read a Second Time today.  I also acknowledge my colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for quickly passing the Bill yesterday.</p> <p>I am asking Seanad &Eacute;ireann to pass the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 today to enable its early enactment to make emergency provision to defer the termination dates of certain residential tenancies that fall or would fall during the period beginning on the date after the enactment of this Bill, and ending on 31 March 2023, in order to mitigate the risk that persons whose tenancies would otherwise be terminated during that period will be unable to obtain alternative accommodation, and to provide for phased arrangements to enable tenancies affected to be terminated over the period from 1 April to 18 June 2023 to assist in managing demands on housing services as a result of such deferred termination.</p> <p>This Bill is urgently required to help those facing the very real threat of homelessness this winter.  The number of people entering homeless emergency accommodation has been increasing since the start of this year.  There have also been increases in the number of notices of termination from private rental accommodation during this period.  The Department and local authorities have taken a number of steps to deal with the situation but given the extraordinary situation and ongoing increases in the numbers of people accessing emergency accommodation, additional emergency measures are now required.</p> <p>The Bill provides for deferment of certain tenancy terminations taking effect over the coming winter emergency period due to the ongoing, acute supply constraints in the residential rental sector and the expected increase in homelessness presentations over the coming period.  The Bill seeks to reduce the burden on homelessness services and pressure on tenants and the residential tenancies market during the winter months.</p> <p>The Government recognises that although a landlord's constitutional protected property right to terminate a tenancy will be constrained by this Bill, it is necessary to take this step to achieve an urgent social objective of preventing tenants being made homeless or having to source alternative accommodation in an extremely constrained market during the coming winter months.</p> <p>To ensure the response is proportionate the measures in this Bill are limited to the winter of 2022-23, will impact only in respect of certain tenancies and are calibrated to apply as fairly as possible.  In proposing the termination pause, the Government is balancing the competing priorities of preventing people falling into homelessness, while recognising the need to fairly stem the continued exit of small-scale landlords from the private rental sector.</p> <p>I recognise the key role that landlords play in providing vital accommodation in our State and I completely reject any political rhetoric demonising them.  The Government is conscious of the need to ensure that small-scale landlords remain in the private rental market.  With this in mind, as part of the review of Housing for All which the Government will publish shortly, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has proposed to commission a comprehensive review of the private rental sector after significant regulatory changes over the past several years and will act on its recommendations as soon as practical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our housing system needs a safe and secure framework for both landlords and tenants.</p><p>I am also conscious that, if passed, this Bill provides a window of time for my Department, local authorities, approved housing bodies and NGOs to progress delivery under Housing for All to remove the need for this emergency legislation.  The Government is taking significant steps to address the supply constraints in the housing market and to deliver homes for rent and purchase, including social, affordable and cost rental housing.  However, there are a number of factors, including the increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness, increased demand for accommodation resulting from the Ukrainian crisis and significant inward migration, which are combining to create significant difficulties in the provision of emergency accommodation, particularly so over the coming months.  This is placing additional pressure on homelessness services as we enter the winter period, when capacity constraints are extremely tight for emergency accommodation and housing providers generally.  Let me reassure Senators that the Government and I, and my Department officials, as well as relevant stakeholders, are doing everything within our power to mitigate the pressures that people will face this winter.</p><p>For those tenants who are struggling to meet their obligations to pay rent, in particular due to loss of employment, there are supports available to help.  This can include the provision of rent supplement and the use of additional needs payments, or both, from the Department of Social Protection to address the person's particular needs.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department of Social Protection can make additional needs payments to help to meet expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income.  This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments.</p><p>I turn to the emergency provisions contained in this Bill.  It is important at the outset to note the exceptions from its provisions.  These exceptions are provided in recognition of constitutionally protected property rights and the need to balance the rights of the tenant with those of the landlord.  The deferral of notices of termination from taking effect during the winter will not apply where there is a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations under the tenancy.  The core rights of a landlord to protect his or her property and to secure a rental income will not be limited in any way by this Bill.  Landlords&rsquo; obligations to their tenants and to third parties, such as neighbours, do not change under this Bill.</p><p>In the time available, I would like to outline the specific provisions of the Bill, which contains five sections.  Sections 1 and 5 contain standard provisions dealing with the interpretation, Short Title and collective citation of the Bill.  The "winter emergency period" is defined to mean the period commencing on the day after the enactment of this Bill and ending on 31 March 2023.  Section 2 provides for the deferral of a notice of termination where it has been served by a landlord on or before the date of the passing of the Act, which specifies a termination date that falls during the winter emergency period, or where a dispute in relation to the termination of a tenancy is referred to the Residential Tenancies Board under Part 6 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and a determination order issued in relation to the dispute specifies a termination date that falls during the winter emergency period.</p><p>In terms of the exceptions, as I have alluded to, the deferral does not apply to a notice of termination where the termination is grounded on the tenant&rsquo;s failure to meet his or her obligations under section 16 of the Act of 2004.  It also does not apply where the landlord states in the notice of termination that the reason for the termination is on the ground of a breach of tenant obligations, other than to pay rent; a breach of a tenant&rsquo;s obligation to pay rent; or the fact that the accommodation no longer suits the tenant&rsquo;s accommodation needs having regard to the number of bed spaces and the size of the household.  I note that some concerns have been raised about continuing to allow a landlord to terminate a tenancy during the winter on foot of overcrowding.  I note that a number of Senators have submitted amendments on this issue and we can debate them fully on Committee Stage.  Overcrowding can be serious and a landlord needs the legal right to act to prevent it.  It is rarely used, with less than 2% of all notices of termination referred under it.  In reality only such a small number of notices of termination already issued will be impacted by this exception during the winter emergency period but it is important in instances of clear health and safety or fire risks.</p><p>Section 2 of the Bill sets out, in a table, how the deferment of relevant tenancy terminations will operate.  As can be seen, the deferment dates operate in a staggered fashion beyond the winter period to ensure that there is no cliff edge at the end of the period, which would put an unmanageable pressure on the private rental market and homelessness services.  Section 3 of the Bill provides that, where a tenant is not in breach of his or her obligations, any notice of termination served by a landlord in respect of a tenancy of less than six months duration during the winter emergency period shall not specify a termination date that falls earlier than 18 June 2023.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the interoperability of the Bill with the Residential Tenancies Act 2020, introduced to deal with the Covid pandemic.  If a stay on tenancy terminations comes into effect under that Act, in the event of peoples&rsquo; movements being restricted on public health grounds to within 5 km of their home under section 31A of the health regulations made by the Minister for Health, the revised termination date that applies to affected tenancies in an area under the Act would apply if it is later than the relevant deferred termination date under this Bill.  The Bill also provides that a tenant shall not accrue security of tenure rights under Part 4 of the Act of 2004 by virtue of the operation of the deferred, or later, termination dates required under this Bill.</p><p>The Bill is framed in a proportionate and fair manner in its limitation of landlord&rsquo;s constitutionally protected property rights.  As legislators, we have shown throughout the pandemic how we can work together to quickly help tenants.  I think we can all appreciate and recognise the sentiment behind this Bill.</p></speech>

I do not mind waiting to speak.  I thank the Minister of State and the Government for bringing forward this ban on residential no-fault evictions during the winter months of November until March.  As we start this debate, it is important that we all stop for a moment and take stock of the context of this legislation.  The context is that we have almost 11,000 people in emergency homeless accommodation of some form or another.  On top of that, more than 50,000 Ukrainians have arrived in our country and at least 45,000 of them are in some form of emergency temporary accommodation; they are not in what they would consider to be their homes.  In addition to that, between direct provision and international protection roughly another 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation.  When anybody is watching this debate, they need to keep it in mind that we are talking about a sizeable portion of people in our population who do not have a permanent home.  That is the first thing I would say to them.</p><p>Second, I would say to them that it is important that they know that we get it.  We understand how much it undermines them to be in temporary or emergency accommodation or in any form of insecurity in what passes for their homes.  The Government gets it too and it has committed &euro;20 billion to deliver more than 30,000 homes over the next four years.  That is important and it is starting to deliver.  I am talking to people every day who are getting notices to quit.  It is incredibly unnerving and destabilising for them.  It undermines their ability to go to work, school and college and to get on with their lives.  We wholeheartedly welcome and support the legislation on that basis.</p><p>There is no escaping the reality that there is a shortage of supply of adequate housing out there.  That is a consequence of ten years of supply being below what was required but the efforts that are being made to increase supply are significant.  It is also important to recognise that there are financial supports in place.  For example, &euro;1 billion per year is being spent on the rental accommodation and housing assistance payment schemes.  There was also a decision to mandate local authorities that where a rental property is being sold with a tenant <i>in situ</i>, it should buy that property to keep the tenant in the property and ensure they do not enter homelessness.  That is a practical and pragmatic measure.  From the perspective of the city council it was introduced a number of years ago, but it has been rolled out to all local authorities.  After this debate I would like the Minister of State to go to the local authorities and re-emphasise that message to them.  I am hearing anecdotally from some of my local authority colleagues around the country that not all local authorities are embracing that measure.  Some local authorities are not taking it on.</p><p>The reality for local authorities and the State is that if you put a family into a family hub for a year, the financial cost, which is only one element of the cost, is &euro;70,000.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is such an inadequate form of housing for a family.  It is an unnecessary cost.  If the local authority buys the house with the tenant<i>in situ </i>we can avoid the financial cost and the emotional and psychological damage done in that instance.<br/><br/>I hope the legislation is passed today and speedily enacted so it can come into effect and provide protection until next April at least.I support the staggered phasing-in of notices to quit.  It gives some time to increase the housing stock but not enough.  Local authorities say the biggest part of the delay in housing is planning.  To deliver from concept to keys being handed to tenants in a new social housing development takes, they say, four years.  They say they build into that a year for planning and that, where there are objections, it adds another three to four years.  When this is passed, we need to tell people to remember the context of this and that these are human lives and homes we are trying to protect for people and to stop objecting unnecessarily or on a whim.<br/><br/>I appreciate this is a direct impingement on landlords' private property rights.  They are citizens of our State and are entitled to have their rights defended.  However, this is an emergency situation, as I outlined.  All of the State's resources are being used, including finance and land, to address the housing crisis and to not impinge on their private property rights.The Minister of State and Government have mandated the housing commission to bring forward proposals on a right to housing in the referendum.  I would appreciate if he would update the House on the progress made.  The commission had a public consultation and we expect a report on that.  Until we as a State decide to insert the right to housing in our Constitution, there will always be this debate and this pushback.  The right to an adequate and secure home is a basic human right and should be enshrined in our Constitution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#C00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are dealing with Second Stage but all Stages of the Bill are being pushed through the House.  While I am supportive of the Bill, this is not the way to do business.  I accept these are unprecedented times and this is an emergency but I want the message to go back that it is not the way we should process legislation.  I will support it but I wanted to make that important point.</p> <p>We have 19 amendments, none of them mine.  They will be debated and I thank the Senators who tabled them.  That is parliamentary democracy.  It is important we have an opportunity to engage for those who wish to do so.  I understand the pressures and that the D&aacute;il and Seanad are scheduled to go into recess for a week today.  We are all cognisant of that.  </p> <p>We all know there is pressure on homeless services, limited supply in the rental market and heightened anxiety and worry regarding tenants and tenancies.  While this is a temporary measure, it seeks to protect renters facing homelessness by deferring any no-fault tenancy terminations from taking place this winter.  It is not a long time.  This legislation provides for temporary conditions of stay on tenancy terminations this winter.  The Minister of State set all that out and I will not rehash it.  The Bill will defer no-fault tenancy terminations due to occur during the coming winter months, taking effect until or after 31 March 2023.</p> <p>The Oireachtas committee on housing, of which I and my colleagues to my right, Senators Cummins and Fitzpatrick, are members, agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  That is an important point.  My colleague on the left from the Labour Party, Senator Moynihan, is also on that committee.  It is important to note the committee made a strong recommendation that where a notice to quit is issued the relevant local authority be informed, as well as the RTB.  The rationale for that is to ensure local authorities are informed in tandem with the RTB and that would keep councils informed of potential homelessness and homeless risks.  It is an important synergy that the local authority is kept up to speed.  It is involved and the housing authority as well.  That is an important recommendation.</p> <p>The legislation will cover the licensing of tenancies in student-specific accommodation, which is an important point, and student tenancies in the general rental market.  That is a critical aspect of the Bill and one I welcome.</p> <p>While the emergency measures in the Bill are necessary and will provide short-term assistance, it may need to be reviewed.  We have to bear that in mind in our debate on the issue.  We may learn in this process and things may come to light.  It is important that Government has an open policy as to the potential of extending the provision at some point.  The long-term answer, as the Minister of State and I know and everyone in this Chamber knows, is a rapid increase in the supply of new housing in all shapes and forms.  This is where the collective political focus on the delivery of housing construction and targets must remain.  That is where our focus across these Houses must remain in a collaborative way to get more houses through all sources of supply.  That is important.  </p> <p>I support the Bill and look forward to the debate on the amendments before the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being with us, and his colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for the speedy passage of this legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas this week.</p> <p>This emergency Bill seeks to defer the termination dates of certain residential tenancies that fall or would fall during the period beginning on the day after the enactment of the Bill and ending on 31 March next year.  Its aim is to reduce the level of homelessness that will occur during the winter months as a result of a lack of emergency accommodation and-or alternative accommodation in the private rental sector.  In proposing this termination pause, the Government seeks to balance the rights of property owners with the common good.  That is why the measure is time-bound.  While some will say this Bill does not go far enough, we always have to try to thread the needle when introducing housing legislation between measures that will have a positive impact for one cohort against possible unintended consequences on the other side.</p> <p>It is important in that context to say the deferral of notices of termination from taking effect during this winter will not apply where there is a failure on the tenant's behalf to comply with his or her obligations under the tenancy, such as non-payment of rent, criminality or antisocial behaviour.  That said, Government is clearly of the belief that this emergency measure is needed at this time to prevent tenants being made homeless or having to source alternative accommodation in what is unquestionably a constrained market during the upcoming winter.</p> <p>The number of people entering emergency accommodation has been increasing since the start of this year, due in no small part to the increases in notice of termination from private rental accommodation.  There are many reasons why that has occurred and we teased out many of them with the Irish Property Owners Association, IPOA, and the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, at a recent joint Oireachtas committee hearing.  The first is rising property values, which have taken many properties out of negative equity.  They also cited the complexity of the RTB process and a tax system that does not encourage them to stay in, rising interest rates, the fact that landlords have been demonised by many in the media and Opposition over a prolonged period, and the reality that some parties, like Sinn F&eacute;in, are calling for policies such as a rental freeze and a requirement that properties no longer be reclaimed for personal or family use, or to sell on the open market. </p></speech>
