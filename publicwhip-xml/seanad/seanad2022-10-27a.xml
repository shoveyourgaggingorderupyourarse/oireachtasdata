I also thank the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for providing the necessary waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny and the Chief Whip for enabling the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 to be read a Second Time today.  I also acknowledge my colleagues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann for quickly passing the Bill yesterday.</p> <p>I am asking Seanad &Eacute;ireann to pass the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 today to enable its early enactment to make emergency provision to defer the termination dates of certain residential tenancies that fall or would fall during the period beginning on the date after the enactment of this Bill, and ending on 31 March 2023, in order to mitigate the risk that persons whose tenancies would otherwise be terminated during that period will be unable to obtain alternative accommodation, and to provide for phased arrangements to enable tenancies affected to be terminated over the period from 1 April to 18 June 2023 to assist in managing demands on housing services as a result of such deferred termination.</p> <p>This Bill is urgently required to help those facing the very real threat of homelessness this winter.  The number of people entering homeless emergency accommodation has been increasing since the start of this year.  There have also been increases in the number of notices of termination from private rental accommodation during this period.  The Department and local authorities have taken a number of steps to deal with the situation but given the extraordinary situation and ongoing increases in the numbers of people accessing emergency accommodation, additional emergency measures are now required.</p> <p>The Bill provides for deferment of certain tenancy terminations taking effect over the coming winter emergency period due to the ongoing, acute supply constraints in the residential rental sector and the expected increase in homelessness presentations over the coming period.  The Bill seeks to reduce the burden on homelessness services and pressure on tenants and the residential tenancies market during the winter months.</p> <p>The Government recognises that although a landlord's constitutional protected property right to terminate a tenancy will be constrained by this Bill, it is necessary to take this step to achieve an urgent social objective of preventing tenants being made homeless or having to source alternative accommodation in an extremely constrained market during the coming winter months.</p> <p>To ensure the response is proportionate the measures in this Bill are limited to the winter of 2022-23, will impact only in respect of certain tenancies and are calibrated to apply as fairly as possible.  In proposing the termination pause, the Government is balancing the competing priorities of preventing people falling into homelessness, while recognising the need to fairly stem the continued exit of small-scale landlords from the private rental sector.</p> <p>I recognise the key role that landlords play in providing vital accommodation in our State and I completely reject any political rhetoric demonising them.  The Government is conscious of the need to ensure that small-scale landlords remain in the private rental market.  With this in mind, as part of the review of Housing for All which the Government will publish shortly, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has proposed to commission a comprehensive review of the private rental sector after significant regulatory changes over the past several years and will act on its recommendations as soon as practical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Our housing system needs a safe and secure framework for both landlords and tenants.</p><p>I am also conscious that, if passed, this Bill provides a window of time for my Department, local authorities, approved housing bodies and NGOs to progress delivery under Housing for All to remove the need for this emergency legislation.  The Government is taking significant steps to address the supply constraints in the housing market and to deliver homes for rent and purchase, including social, affordable and cost rental housing.  However, there are a number of factors, including the increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness, increased demand for accommodation resulting from the Ukrainian crisis and significant inward migration, which are combining to create significant difficulties in the provision of emergency accommodation, particularly so over the coming months.  This is placing additional pressure on homelessness services as we enter the winter period, when capacity constraints are extremely tight for emergency accommodation and housing providers generally.  Let me reassure Senators that the Government and I, and my Department officials, as well as relevant stakeholders, are doing everything within our power to mitigate the pressures that people will face this winter.</p><p>For those tenants who are struggling to meet their obligations to pay rent, in particular due to loss of employment, there are supports available to help.  This can include the provision of rent supplement and the use of additional needs payments, or both, from the Department of Social Protection to address the person's particular needs.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, the Department of Social Protection can make additional needs payments to help to meet expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income.  This is an overarching term used to refer to exceptional and urgent needs payments.</p><p>I turn to the emergency provisions contained in this Bill.  It is important at the outset to note the exceptions from its provisions.  These exceptions are provided in recognition of constitutionally protected property rights and the need to balance the rights of the tenant with those of the landlord.  The deferral of notices of termination from taking effect during the winter will not apply where there is a failure by the tenant to comply with his or her obligations under the tenancy.  The core rights of a landlord to protect his or her property and to secure a rental income will not be limited in any way by this Bill.  Landlords&rsquo; obligations to their tenants and to third parties, such as neighbours, do not change under this Bill.</p><p>In the time available, I would like to outline the specific provisions of the Bill, which contains five sections.  Sections 1 and 5 contain standard provisions dealing with the interpretation, Short Title and collective citation of the Bill.  The "winter emergency period" is defined to mean the period commencing on the day after the enactment of this Bill and ending on 31 March 2023.  Section 2 provides for the deferral of a notice of termination where it has been served by a landlord on or before the date of the passing of the Act, which specifies a termination date that falls during the winter emergency period, or where a dispute in relation to the termination of a tenancy is referred to the Residential Tenancies Board under Part 6 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and a determination order issued in relation to the dispute specifies a termination date that falls during the winter emergency period.</p><p>In terms of the exceptions, as I have alluded to, the deferral does not apply to a notice of termination where the termination is grounded on the tenant&rsquo;s failure to meet his or her obligations under section 16 of the Act of 2004.  It also does not apply where the landlord states in the notice of termination that the reason for the termination is on the ground of a breach of tenant obligations, other than to pay rent; a breach of a tenant&rsquo;s obligation to pay rent; or the fact that the accommodation no longer suits the tenant&rsquo;s accommodation needs having regard to the number of bed spaces and the size of the household.  I note that some concerns have been raised about continuing to allow a landlord to terminate a tenancy during the winter on foot of overcrowding.  I note that a number of Senators have submitted amendments on this issue and we can debate them fully on Committee Stage.  Overcrowding can be serious and a landlord needs the legal right to act to prevent it.  It is rarely used, with less than 2% of all notices of termination referred under it.  In reality only such a small number of notices of termination already issued will be impacted by this exception during the winter emergency period but it is important in instances of clear health and safety or fire risks.</p><p>Section 2 of the Bill sets out, in a table, how the deferment of relevant tenancy terminations will operate.  As can be seen, the deferment dates operate in a staggered fashion beyond the winter period to ensure that there is no cliff edge at the end of the period, which would put an unmanageable pressure on the private rental market and homelessness services.  Section 3 of the Bill provides that, where a tenant is not in breach of his or her obligations, any notice of termination served by a landlord in respect of a tenancy of less than six months duration during the winter emergency period shall not specify a termination date that falls earlier than 18 June 2023.  Section 4 of the Bill provides for the interoperability of the Bill with the Residential Tenancies Act 2020, introduced to deal with the Covid pandemic.  If a stay on tenancy terminations comes into effect under that Act, in the event of peoples&rsquo; movements being restricted on public health grounds to within 5 km of their home under section 31A of the health regulations made by the Minister for Health, the revised termination date that applies to affected tenancies in an area under the Act would apply if it is later than the relevant deferred termination date under this Bill.  The Bill also provides that a tenant shall not accrue security of tenure rights under Part 4 of the Act of 2004 by virtue of the operation of the deferred, or later, termination dates required under this Bill.</p><p>The Bill is framed in a proportionate and fair manner in its limitation of landlord&rsquo;s constitutionally protected property rights.  As legislators, we have shown throughout the pandemic how we can work together to quickly help tenants.  I think we can all appreciate and recognise the sentiment behind this Bill.</p></speech>

I do not mind waiting to speak.  I thank the Minister of State and the Government for bringing forward this ban on residential no-fault evictions during the winter months of November until March.  As we start this debate, it is important that we all stop for a moment and take stock of the context of this legislation.  The context is that we have almost 11,000 people in emergency homeless accommodation of some form or another.  On top of that, more than 50,000 Ukrainians have arrived in our country and at least 45,000 of them are in some form of emergency temporary accommodation; they are not in what they would consider to be their homes.  In addition to that, between direct provision and international protection roughly another 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation.  When anybody is watching this debate, they need to keep it in mind that we are talking about a sizeable portion of people in our population who do not have a permanent home.  That is the first thing I would say to them.</p><p>Second, I would say to them that it is important that they know that we get it.  We understand how much it undermines them to be in temporary or emergency accommodation or in any form of insecurity in what passes for their homes.  The Government gets it too and it has committed &euro;20 billion to deliver more than 30,000 homes over the next four years.  That is important and it is starting to deliver.  I am talking to people every day who are getting notices to quit.  It is incredibly unnerving and destabilising for them.  It undermines their ability to go to work, school and college and to get on with their lives.  We wholeheartedly welcome and support the legislation on that basis.</p><p>There is no escaping the reality that there is a shortage of supply of adequate housing out there.  That is a consequence of ten years of supply being below what was required but the efforts that are being made to increase supply are significant.  It is also important to recognise that there are financial supports in place.  For example, &euro;1 billion per year is being spent on the rental accommodation and housing assistance payment schemes.  There was also a decision to mandate local authorities that where a rental property is being sold with a tenant <i>in situ</i>, it should buy that property to keep the tenant in the property and ensure they do not enter homelessness.  That is a practical and pragmatic measure.  From the perspective of the city council it was introduced a number of years ago, but it has been rolled out to all local authorities.  After this debate I would like the Minister of State to go to the local authorities and re-emphasise that message to them.  I am hearing anecdotally from some of my local authority colleagues around the country that not all local authorities are embracing that measure.  Some local authorities are not taking it on.</p><p>The reality for local authorities and the State is that if you put a family into a family hub for a year, the financial cost, which is only one element of the cost, is &euro;70,000.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is such an inadequate form of housing for a family.  It is an unnecessary cost.  If the local authority buys the house with the tenant<i>in situ </i>we can avoid the financial cost and the emotional and psychological damage done in that instance.<br/><br/>I hope the legislation is passed today and speedily enacted so it can come into effect and provide protection until next April at least.I support the staggered phasing-in of notices to quit.  It gives some time to increase the housing stock but not enough.  Local authorities say the biggest part of the delay in housing is planning.  To deliver from concept to keys being handed to tenants in a new social housing development takes, they say, four years.  They say they build into that a year for planning and that, where there are objections, it adds another three to four years.  When this is passed, we need to tell people to remember the context of this and that these are human lives and homes we are trying to protect for people and to stop objecting unnecessarily or on a whim.<br/><br/>I appreciate this is a direct impingement on landlords' private property rights.  They are citizens of our State and are entitled to have their rights defended.  However, this is an emergency situation, as I outlined.  All of the State's resources are being used, including finance and land, to address the housing crisis and to not impinge on their private property rights.The Minister of State and Government have mandated the housing commission to bring forward proposals on a right to housing in the referendum.  I would appreciate if he would update the House on the progress made.  The commission had a public consultation and we expect a report on that.  Until we as a State decide to insert the right to housing in our Constitution, there will always be this debate and this pushback.  The right to an adequate and secure home is a basic human right and should be enshrined in our Constitution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#C00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  We are dealing with Second Stage but all Stages of the Bill are being pushed through the House.  While I am supportive of the Bill, this is not the way to do business.  I accept these are unprecedented times and this is an emergency but I want the message to go back that it is not the way we should process legislation.  I will support it but I wanted to make that important point.</p> <p>We have 19 amendments, none of them mine.  They will be debated and I thank the Senators who tabled them.  That is parliamentary democracy.  It is important we have an opportunity to engage for those who wish to do so.  I understand the pressures and that the D&aacute;il and Seanad are scheduled to go into recess for a week today.  We are all cognisant of that.  </p> <p>We all know there is pressure on homeless services, limited supply in the rental market and heightened anxiety and worry regarding tenants and tenancies.  While this is a temporary measure, it seeks to protect renters facing homelessness by deferring any no-fault tenancy terminations from taking place this winter.  It is not a long time.  This legislation provides for temporary conditions of stay on tenancy terminations this winter.  The Minister of State set all that out and I will not rehash it.  The Bill will defer no-fault tenancy terminations due to occur during the coming winter months, taking effect until or after 31 March 2023.</p> <p>The Oireachtas committee on housing, of which I and my colleagues to my right, Senators Cummins and Fitzpatrick, are members, agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny.  That is an important point.  My colleague on the left from the Labour Party, Senator Moynihan, is also on that committee.  It is important to note the committee made a strong recommendation that where a notice to quit is issued the relevant local authority be informed, as well as the RTB.  The rationale for that is to ensure local authorities are informed in tandem with the RTB and that would keep councils informed of potential homelessness and homeless risks.  It is an important synergy that the local authority is kept up to speed.  It is involved and the housing authority as well.  That is an important recommendation.</p> <p>The legislation will cover the licensing of tenancies in student-specific accommodation, which is an important point, and student tenancies in the general rental market.  That is a critical aspect of the Bill and one I welcome.</p> <p>While the emergency measures in the Bill are necessary and will provide short-term assistance, it may need to be reviewed.  We have to bear that in mind in our debate on the issue.  We may learn in this process and things may come to light.  It is important that Government has an open policy as to the potential of extending the provision at some point.  The long-term answer, as the Minister of State and I know and everyone in this Chamber knows, is a rapid increase in the supply of new housing in all shapes and forms.  This is where the collective political focus on the delivery of housing construction and targets must remain.  That is where our focus across these Houses must remain in a collaborative way to get more houses through all sources of supply.  That is important.  </p> <p>I support the Bill and look forward to the debate on the amendments before the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for being with us, and his colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for the speedy passage of this legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas this week.</p> <p>This emergency Bill seeks to defer the termination dates of certain residential tenancies that fall or would fall during the period beginning on the day after the enactment of the Bill and ending on 31 March next year.  Its aim is to reduce the level of homelessness that will occur during the winter months as a result of a lack of emergency accommodation and-or alternative accommodation in the private rental sector.  In proposing this termination pause, the Government seeks to balance the rights of property owners with the common good.  That is why the measure is time-bound.  While some will say this Bill does not go far enough, we always have to try to thread the needle when introducing housing legislation between measures that will have a positive impact for one cohort against possible unintended consequences on the other side.</p> <p>It is important in that context to say the deferral of notices of termination from taking effect during this winter will not apply where there is a failure on the tenant's behalf to comply with his or her obligations under the tenancy, such as non-payment of rent, criminality or antisocial behaviour.  That said, Government is clearly of the belief that this emergency measure is needed at this time to prevent tenants being made homeless or having to source alternative accommodation in what is unquestionably a constrained market during the upcoming winter.</p> <p>The number of people entering emergency accommodation has been increasing since the start of this year, due in no small part to the increases in notice of termination from private rental accommodation.  There are many reasons why that has occurred and we teased out many of them with the Irish Property Owners Association, IPOA, and the Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, at a recent joint Oireachtas committee hearing.  The first is rising property values, which have taken many properties out of negative equity.  They also cited the complexity of the RTB process and a tax system that does not encourage them to stay in, rising interest rates, the fact that landlords have been demonised by many in the media and Opposition over a prolonged period, and the reality that some parties, like Sinn F&eacute;in, are calling for policies such as a rental freeze and a requirement that properties no longer be reclaimed for personal or family use, or to sell on the open market. </p></speech>

It is important to say that what I am saying is not my view, but what was stated at the joint Oireachtas committee and I made the preface of that remark in my speech.  I would appreciate if I was not interrupted.  The Senator should go back to the transcript from the joint Oireachtas committee and read what was said.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are all factors that impact on the supply of rental properties.  I have concerns, notwithstanding the intent of this legislation, that these measures could have a negative effect on the other side with more private landlords leaving the market if they are not followed with measures to encourage more landlords to remain in the rental market.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the comprehensive review that will be undertaken by the Minister.  It is very important that the review is fast-tracked and measures are implemented on this side of 31 March.</p><p>As the Minister of State has said, this Bill gives some breathing space but is not a solution.  We must actively pursue the acquisition of homes where notices to quit have been issued to housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants.  Senator Boyhan referenced a suggestion that was made by Senator Moynihan at our private meeting to notify the local authority in tandem and I think that can happen.  Notwithstanding that it does not have to be written in the Bill, there must be a mechanism whereby the RTB can notify a local authority where a HAP tenant has got a notice to quit.  I ask that this provision is put in place in tandem with this Bill.</p><p>Not all properties will be suitable.  One could have a HAP tenant who has a former stake in a marital home.  That aspect must be resolved before he or she can be deemed eligible for an allocation.  Also a property may be unsuitable because it does not meet the required standards.</p></speech>

The Department must put in quick underwritten finance to local authorities to allow them to actively pursue the acquisition of properties.   The local authorities in Cork and Galway mentioned that they have more than 50 and 36 interested applications.  If every local authority acquired 50 properties where notices to quit are in place between now and the end of March then we would go a long way towards resolving some of the issues in this space.  We must also ramp up delivery through schemes such as repair and lease, buy and renew and compulsory purchase orders, CPOs.</p> <p>I feel like I sound like a broken record because I have said umpteen times here and at committee meetings that the Department must put targets in place for local authorities across all of these delivery streams.  Targets have not been identified yet and I do not know why there is a resistance to doing so.  Local authorities will continue to fail to deliver under those streams unless ambitious targets are put in place.  I ask the Minister of State to convey what I have said and consider the measures that we have put forward as Oireachtas Members here and at committee meetings.</p></speech>

So I am not going to listen to either Fine Gael claim to stand up for small landlords or blame Sinn F&eacute;in for the housing crisis.  Sinn F&eacute;in seeks to introduce a ban on evictions precisely because of failures by the Government and Fine Gael.</p><p>I was 19 years of age when Fine Gael entered Government.  We are still here and this is their crisis.  The latest figures for August show that there are 10,800 adults and children in emergency accommodation funded by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That is the highest level ever recorded since modern reporting methods were introduced.  Sinn F&eacute;in has pointed out that the real figure for emergency accommodation is closer to 16,000 when one takes into account the following: 4,500 people trapped in direct provision but have a legal right to stay in this country; the number of rough sleepers; and the number of women and children in Tusla-funded centres who have fled domestic and sexual-based violence.</p><p>We are experiencing the worst housing crisis in the history of the State and it has gotten consistently worse since the Minister took up office.  The targets are too low and, worse again, the Government has failed to meet its own targets.  In 2020, the Government missed its targets by 25% and last year, in 2021, the Government missed its target to provide social and affordable homes by 30%.  All of that is the reason so many people are homeless tonight and the reason the number has increased.  So, 5,969 social homes should have been built under the targets set but the Government has failed to deliver and not even met its own low targets. </p><p>We are now trying to introduce a ban on winter evictions and Sinn F&eacute;in supports this Bill.  Indeed, we have called for the ban for some months and we also wanted a temporary ban on winter evictions.  The fact that a ban is needed is a mark of Government housing failure.  A ban on evictions would give tenants some breathing space but will not fix the problem.  We need immediate action to increase the supply of social and affordable homes over the next five months, otherwise we will be back in the same place in April.</p><p>We need more action on tenants <i>in situ</i>, vacancies and high-quality modular homes.  We also need to cut the red tape encountered by councils and approved housing bodies as it reduces delivery.  The Government's legislation also needs to be amended to provide protection to tenants whose termination date falls before 1 November.  Finally, we need to remove the overcrowding provision and Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled amendments alongside other Opposition groups to do just that.</p><p>This ban has been opposed by Members of these Houses for a long time.  Members of these Houses have been dragged kicking and screaming into a ban on evictions.  Housing protests and Raise the Roof have given people around these Houses food for thought.  We were told that a ban was unconstitutional but it is not.  In fact, a ban is long overdue and we will be supporting the Bill.  We hope that our amendments, particularly amendment No. 9, will be accepted.  The Government must do a great deal more to ensure that we are not in exactly the same position next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1672" speakername="Rebecca Moynihan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#D01500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for addressing the House on this issue.</p> <p>I welcome the move by the Government to put in place this emergency provision and recognising the big impact that homelessness over the winter period has on people.  I wish to take issue with a couple of points.  First, the Minister of State has said that there are "constitutionally protected property rights" in terms of terminating a tenancy.  There is a "constitutionally protected" right to private property that must be balanced against the common good.  For decades, Governments have never been brave enough to take into account the common good aspect.</p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick raised the issue of having a constitutional referendum on the right to housing.  I commend her, from the Fianna F&aacute;il side of things, for pushing a referendum for a very long time.  All official commentary I have heard from both civil servants and the Attorney General is that there is a "constitutionally protected" right to private property so that means one cannot have any balancing rights for tenants.  I make no apology for thinking that one cannot terminate a tenancy on the basis of selling because that is the case in most European countries.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a matter of tenant rights.  If a person is getting into something such as providing people with a home, there are limits placed on that.  That should mean a landlord is not allowed to evict on the basis of selling.  For too long in Ireland, we have treated the rental market in a casual way.  We see it as something people do for a very short time in their 20s when they share a house.  The reality is that this affects families and children.  That is evidenced by the 3,000 people in homeless accommodation now who were in long-term rental accommodation.<br/><br/>In particular, there are 60,000 households in this country that should not be in the private rental sector.  That is the other reason I take issue with what the Minister of State said when he spoke about demonising landlords, and how they are the solution to the housing crisis.  They are not the solution to the housing crisis.  The State is the solution to the housing crisis.  Those households and those children will always be in need of State-supported housing.  They should not be there at the whim of the private rental sector, where we see large numbers of people getting out and selling up because they do not want to be landlords.  Most people do not want to be landlords because most people look at housing as a home and not as an investment.  I make no apology for that.  It is not about demonising landlords.  What it is doing, however, is standing up for the 20% of people who are living in the private rental sector and who deserve the right to a home as much as somebody who owns it.<br/><br/>I welcome the introduction of the eviction ban.  We have proposed a number of amendments to try to improve it, particularly with regard to overcrowding.  I received notice today that one of my amendments had been ruled out of order, namely amendment No. 5, which is related to the tenant <i>in situ </i>scheme.  The reason given was that it would impose a cost on the Exchequer, which it will not.  It is simply asking that when a tenancy is terminated, the RTB is notified, which is a very reasonable thing to do.  We have had this in place since July.  In this case, it says that when a tenancy is notified, the local authority should be notified.  It allows the local authorities to plan the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme.  Too many of us have been in situations where we have been contacted by somebody who has maybe one month to go on his or her tenancy, and the local authority only hears of it after that person has been looking for a couple of months and is not able to get access to accommodation.  We really need to scale up the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme because we need to be taking those rental tenancies back into the State.<br/><br/>The State spent &euro;853 million in 2021 on HAP tenancies.  We are spending, on average, &euro;1,900 per month on HAP tenancies.  They should be in the State sector and not at the whim of the private rental sector and the laws we have around it.  As I said, those 60,000 people should not be in the private rental sector.  The answer to homelessness and the housing crisis is not small landlords.  It is providing people with a safe and secure home, be that through promoting homeownership, State-supported housing, social housing, cost-rental housing or good security of tenure for renters.  That is the key to solving the housing crisis.  There is a fundamental difference between an investment and a home.  Until that penetrates our brains, we will keep making the same mistakes again and again.  A home is not an investment.  There is a fundamental difference in how people should be treated and the rights they should have.  People who are using it for safety, security and shelter should have more rights than people's right to make money.</p></speech>

It is important that we have a debate around the eviction ban.  We mention vulnerable groups, but we are leaving a very important group of people behind, and probably the most vulnerable when it comes to accommodation, that is, the Traveller community within our society.  When this Bill reaches Committee Stage, I will have big questions about why amendments Nos. 3, 16 and 17, which impact on Travellers, were ruled out of order.  I will say not right now that it is discrimination.  The Minister of State will come back to me on Committee Stage and let me know the reason.  However, it better be a goddamn good answer for our community as to why these three amendments were ruled out of order today.</p> <p>It is important that we have these discussions.  I welcome the eviction bans 150%, of course.  It is important that no community gets left behind, however.  We talk about refugees and people living in direct provision.  Unfortunately, the State is looking for them to pay rent for something it created 22 years ago.  There is no harm in us discussing it today.</p> <p>To reiterate, I would like a very detailed explanation of why the amendments were ruled out of order.  It is not for me, however.  I live in good accommodation.  It is for my community.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's amendments in 2020 were accepted.  They are just a little bit different from mine; the wording is slightly different.  I want an answer for the Traveller community as to why they are not being accepted today.</p></speech>

He is doing towering work in his own specific portfolio of responsibility.  That is for another day, however.  I would just like to commend him on that.

Yes, property rights are enshrined in the Constitution but they are not absolute rights.</p> <p>I note, for instance, that this amending legislation is time-specific to 31 March 2023.  That is more about striking a balance.  In my humble opinion, if it were permanent, it would have crossed the line of what we have to deal with.  I refer to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann as it stands at present.  If it were silent and no date were given, I would be worried that this would have crossed the line and been repugnant to the Constitution.  I am in no doubt that under the advice of the Attorney General, this has been thought out very carefully.  There have been challenges in the past, some of which have been successful in the vindication of property rights.  In the hierarchy of rights, however, the right to a home trumps property rights, as is made explicitly clear in the Constitution.</p> <p>Then there is more of a balance in that there are exceptions.  Section 16 of the principal Act, for instance, states the obligations on tenants.  In other words, this does not affect the rights of third parties who can, from time to time, find their families turned upside down by the landlord not taking appropriate and reasonable steps to reduce and eliminate antisocial behaviour.  The innocent third party, that is, the neighbour, is at the brunt end of that.  I am glad to see that survives this emergency legislation.  Like so many in the Chamber, I have a track record in politics.  I make no apologies for it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P.

As a founder of New Beginning in 2010, I saw at first hand the carnage and how it turned families upside down when there was no personal insolvency legislation in this country.  Yet, now we have one of the best personal insolvency regimes in Europe.  At the time, people were worried about how it would affect property rights, but now banks are forced to accept write-downs.  While the Constitution must be respected, I am glad to see that it is not disproportionately stymying the legislator today.  What we have here is a reasonable approach to an extreme emergency.  I say that as someone who has a rental property.  Perhaps I am not considered objective, given my record on this issue and what I have said in the past, but our sympathies must go to tenants in an emergency.  This has been supported by jurisprudence over many years.  A judgment by Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan speaks of the overriding position of the home as a place of repose.  People go home and expect a bit of peace, comfort and safety in the four walls of their own home.  I am glad that this Government has put tenants first.  I would like this legislation to go further, and I am sure others would, but it cannot go further under the current constitutional provisions.  My party supports the right to housing.  That sounds great, but what does it mean?  We have to drill down into it and tease it out to make sure that it protects security of tenure and tenants.  I see more balance and common sense in this amending legislation, which provides that Part 4 rights are not accrued during the deferral period.  That is the point.  It is a deferral and a postponement; it is not permanent.  Otherwise, we would be in uncharted constitutional danger.  I would love this legislation to have gone much further, but I am satisfied that it cannot.</p><p>I commend the Opposition.  I have read the D&aacute;il debates and they have been largely very constructive.  It is not a political issue.  Families are receiving notices of termination.  There are two similarities with Covid in respect of this emergency.  One is the financial pain it visits on families and the other is the uncertainty.  We are not sure when this is going to end.  We have a time-specific date.  I will be happy to come back to the Chamber, review that and extend it, if necessary, next March to protect our tenants.</p></speech>

I do not know what school they are from.  First, I thank Senators for their contributions.  I know we will get to debate some of the issues raised on Committee Stage.  I am confident that the House will be able to agree and pass Second Stage today.  I echo the comments of Senator Martin in thanking the Opposition, in particular, for being so constructive in the debate generally.</p> <p>I would like to turn to some of the points raised.  In response to Senator Fitzpatrick, I can say that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is absolutely committed to issuing a circular to local authorities on the issue of purchasing houses.</p> <p>I recognise the points made right across the House from both sides around the private property rights of landlords, to which I alluded in my speech.  They are an essential part of our housing infrastructure, and it is important that their rights are protected as well.  We are trying to strike a balance.  I think that point was made by Senators Boyhan and Cummins.</p> <p>The Minister is reviewing the private rental market and has committed to acting on that comprehensive review, which will take place in a timely manner.  The point made about the targets for local authorities around all delivery streams is an important one about which I will speak to the Minister.</p> <p>I disagree fundamentally with Senator Warfield's point.  The Minister and his officials are working very hard and are making significant progress.  They are dealing with a succession of crises not of this Government's making.  I think it is important to note that.</p> <p>The points raised by Senator Moynihan, on the constitutional rights versus the common good, have been noted.  I believe an update on the referendum is due shortly.  My understanding is that the wording is being progressed currently.</p> <p>I will respond to Senator Flynn's point on the Traveller community.  It is clear from looking at some of the general trends with Traveller accommodation that many Travellers are opting for mainstream accommodation, for example in private rental or through HAP or RAS.  Certainly, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, has made significant ground in ensuring local authorities are spending their budgetary allocations.  There was an historic failure of local authorities to spend budgetary allocations for Traveller-specific accommodation.  The Minister of State is making significant progress in relation to that.</p> <p>I note the comment made by Senator Martin that this Bill is about a reasonable approach to an extreme emergency.</p> <p>The Government's efforts through Housing for All to deliver supply at scale over the coming months aim to counter the need for longer application of these enhanced tenancy protections.  The Government is acting now, in line with the advice of the Attorney General, to protect and balance the rights of both tenants and landlords.  Housing for All is underpinned by unprecedented levels of investment, with annual Exchequer funding standing at an average of &euro;4 billion a year for the next five years.  Budget 2023 provides &euro;4.5 billion.  This Government commitment provides the construction industry with the certainty and the stability it needs to build housing that the country needs.</p> <p>While global and external challenges have emerged since Housing for All was published, the Government remains focused on achieving its targets.  As committed to last year at its launch, the Government will review and update the actions in Housing for All.  The updated actions will be contained in the next quarterly report to be published in the autumn.  This will allow the Government to respond to the challenges facing the sector and to redouble its efforts in prioritising measures to activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply.  The Housing for All plan is working.  Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures for quarter 2 of this year record the highest number of completed homes in any quarter since the CSO series began in 2011.  This year the Government's target is delivery of 24,600 homes.  In the year to the end of June, just under 25,000 new homes were completed.  Commencements over the last 12 months to the end of September stood at 27,417.  These figures give confidence that the Government's 2022 overall supply target of 24,600 homes is expected to be exceeded, with the Central Bank forecasting 25,000 completions this year, and some commentators forecasting up to 28,000 completions this year.  The Minister has made a number of announcements aimed at stimulating and securing as much supply as possible in the coming months.  The Minister has made it clear to local authorities that where there is a risk of tenants being evicted into homelessness as a result of a landlord selling the home, the local authority will be supported by the Department to purchase the home should it be appropriate.  I reiterate the point that if a reminder needs to be sent out to local authorities, the Minister will do so.</p> <p>Local authorities have been encouraged to be as proactive as possible in the return of vacant properties to use through the use of the voids funding programme, as well as the buy and renew and repair and lease schemes.  They have taken on board the point around targets for that.  Local authorities have been asked to prioritise additional tenancy supports and prevention measures in their homelessness expenditure programmes.  Additional financial support is being made available where needed.  In proposing the temporary pause on certain tenancy terminations taking effect, the Government is balancing the competing priorities of preventing people from falling into homelessness while recognising the need to fairly stem the continued exit of small-scale landlords from the private rental sector.  The Government is proposing a number of exceptions to the winter emergency period provisions to ensure the core rights of the landlord to protect his or her property and to secure a rental income will not be limited in any way by this Bill.  As has been said, we need to retain the landlord's right to deal with antisocial behaviour and any other breaches of tenancy obligations.  We need to maintain a viable rental market and retain the landlord's ability to deal with issues such as overcrowding, which may pose a fire hazard or other health and safety risk to tenants.</p> <p>Given the exit of landlords from the sector, the Minister proposes to include a new measure in the review of Housing for All to be considered by Government shortly, and to conduct a review of the residential rental sector by the end of the second quarter of 2023.  Subject to any final terms of reference, the review will examine the current acute supply constraints within the residential sector, with a view to identifying what measures are required to ensure the long-term sustainability of the sector, ensuring efficient, affordable supply and making it a viable and attractive tenure of choice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A report on policy considerations will be made ahead of budget 2024.

We want to see people get a little more protection during the winter months and the timeframe set out by the Bill.  The longer a tenancy is, the longer the notice-to-quit period.  There are two notice-to-quit periods, one of 196 days and one of 224 days, depending on whether someone has been a tenant for less than or more than seven years.  For someone who gets a notice on 2 November, the 196 days will last until the end of the winter period so the tenant gets no protection whatsoever from this Bill while others get extra protections into May or even June.  Our amendments, Nos. 13 and 14, do not seek to extend the emergency period but give people who get a notice to quit just before or just after the introduction of this Bill a little bit of extra time because they will struggle to find somewhere within that six-month period.  We believe this extra time would be reasonable.</p></speech>

I cannot accept amendment No. 1, which proposes to push out the expiry date of the winter emergency period to the end of April 2023 to help tenants in receipt of relevant tenancy terminations affected by this Bill.  As was outlined earlier on Second Stage, this Bill was carefully calibrated to balance the rights of tenants and landlords.  Tenants facing a notice of termination will receive protection under this Bill, allowing them to stay <i>in situ</i>over the winter emergency period, thereby allowing time for housing supply to increase.  While we are interfering with landlords' constitutional property rights, this interference is limited and applies for a short period of time.  The Bill seeks to reduce the burden on homelessness services and the pressure on tenants and the residential tenancies market during the coming winter months.  The increasing numbers of people experiencing homelessness and significant inward migration are combining to create significant difficulties in the provision of emergency accommodation.  This is placing additional pressure on homelessness services as we enter the winter period, when capacity constraints are extremely tight for emergency accommodation and housing providers generally.</p><p>The Bill is introduced as an emergency measure for this winter period, which ceases at the end of March, only.  The table in section 2(3) of the Bill sets out how the deferment of relevant tenancy terminations will operate.  As can be seen, the deferment dates operate in a staggered fashion beyond the winter period and until 18 June 2023 to ensure there is no cliff edge at the end of the period, which would put unimaginable pressure on the private rental market and homelessness services.  The timing operates so as to provide proportionally greater protection to those tenants with the shortest termination periods.  The aim is to provide additional time to those most in need of extra time to secure alternative accommodation.  Taking into account the advice of the Attorney General, this Bill is designed to enhance tenancy protections over the winter period and is careful to manage the demand in the rental market over the months immediately afterwards until 18 June 2023.  I cannot accept the Senator's amendment.</p><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 13, which proposes to push out the deferred termination date that applies for tenancies of not less than one year but less than seven years with a specified termination date falling during the period from the enactment of the Bill to the end of January from 15 April 2023 to 1 May 2023, nor can I accept amendment No. 14, which proposes to push out from 1 April 2023 to 1 May 2023 the deferred termination date that applies for tenancies of not less than seven years with a specified termination date falling during February or March.  This emergency Bill has been carefully drafted to limit its interference with the constitutionally-protected property rights of landlords.  As I have said, this Bill has been carefully calibrated to balance the rights of tenants and landlords.  The table in section 2(3) of the Bill sets out how the deferment of relevant tenancy terminations will operate.  As can be seen, the deferment dates operate in a staggered fashion beyond the winter period and until 18 June 2023 to ensure there is no cliff edge at the end of the period, which would put unimaginable pressure on the private rental market and homelessness services.  Taking into account the advice of the Attorney General, this Bill is designed to enhance tenancy protections over the winter period and is careful to manage the demand in the rental market over the months immediately afterwards until 18 June 2023.  I cannot accept the Senators' amendments Nos. 13 and 14.</p><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 19 which, as a consequential amendment to amendment No. 1, proposes to amend the Title of the Bill to reflect the pushing out of the expiry date of the winter emergency period from 31 March to the end of April.</p></speech>

This Bill and the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 do not cover local authority housing apart from those where cost rental tenancies are in place.  That said, I know tenancy terminations from local authority housing are rare and I have no reason to think local authorities will move forward with terminations over the winter months. Given that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, indicated in the D&aacute;il last night that he will consider issuing a circular to local authorities on this issue, and the fact that this is emergency legislation, it would not be appropriate to cover local authorities in this Bill.  However, I note the points made by Senator Flynn in relation to the Traveller community.  Certainly, in relation to Traveller-specific accommodation, I am aware that all local authorities have designated wraparound facilities for Traveller communities.  As was stated, evictions from local authority housing are rare and are not covered in this Bill.</p></speech>

Even as we speak, there are many Traveller families being evicted.  This is the harsh reality for Travellers.  I do not mean to sound in any way disrespectful to the Minister of State and it is not personally meant, but I am here and I know exactly what I am talking about.  The Civil Engagement Group worked really hard over the last week with the Irish Traveller Movement.  We did not do it by ourselves but worked alongside other organisations to protect Travellers with this eviction Bill.  Unfortunately, we are not holding the State to account.  Nobody is being held to account for the situation Travellers are in and that is the harsh reality.  The amendments I put forward, and those of the Civil Engagement group, are not being accepted.  It is genuine State discrimination.  Members of this House and the D&aacute;il should be ashamed of themselves for not protecting the most vulnerable people in Irish society when it comes to accommodation.  Once again we are left behind but I will keep standing up and speaking up in this House because I do not have a choice.  The Minister says that accommodation under local authorities is secure.  Local authorities are not held to account.  What we could have done, and what was the right thing to do, was to name it and to accept amendment No. 2 in order to protect members of the Traveller community during the winter.  Again, we are just thrown aside and it is all fine because nobody is held to account.  I will be up to speak on our next amendment as well.</p></speech>

As I have said, however, local authority housing is not covered under this Bill.  Quite a number of Traveller families are renting in the private market, or through HAP or RAS, and they have protections there.  Similarly, regarding Traveller-specific accommodation, local authorities have services in place to support tenancy and stability among families.  If it is of help, I will discuss this correspondence with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and ask that the circular he is going to issue to local authorities be mindful of the specific vulnerability of Traveller families.</p></speech>

I am not going to press this amendment massively.  The more important one is around the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme and having the notice served on a local authority as well.  We have reflected what is in place in France where, essentially, if a tenant is being evicted the property is offered at market value to the tenant.  There are much stronger tenant rights in other European countries where renting has not been normalised exactly but they have certainly made conditions better for renters.</p><p>This amendment relates to the wider Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill, which we introduced in 2021 in the D&aacute;il and is now at Second Stage.  We constantly make the point that we need to restrict the criteria or grounds for eviction, for example by removing the fact that family members are moving in or the sale of a property as grounds for eviction.  We submitted this amendment to make the political point that we still believe this and want to see it happen.  It is the responsibility of the Government to do this; otherwise, we will be faced with these situations every winter and we will see homeless services being overwhelmed.  It will give people who rent, including those who are renting into their 30s, 40s and 50s, long-term security of tenure.  We want to see a move to a situation where we balance the rights of people who rent in this country and we give renters more rights than they currently have.  I have spoken to the amendment but I am not going to press it.</p></speech>

Can the Minister of State confirm that some mechanism will be put in place so that the RTB can notify the local authority when a termination notice is being issued to a HAP tenant?  That is important and the closing of that circle has to be put in place.  It is not necessarily vital that it is in the thrust of the Bill but it has to happen in the background.  Without it, local authorities will essentially be shooting in the dark without knowing which tenants have been given notice of termination.  They will be trying to effect an acquisition of a tenant <i>in situ </i>policy without knowing exactly which tenancies have received those notices.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like some assurance that this will happen in the background because it is a necessity.

The Government promised to introduce no-fault evictions.  When a person signs a tenancy agreement there is usually an understanding that there are X amount of people in Y number of rooms.  Family size can change.  A person can have a partner or children, adult children can move home and so on.  The overcrowding provision is where a landlord can issue a notice to quit if the property no longer meets the needs of the household.  This particularly disadvantages families with large numbers of children, including Traveller and Roma families and families who have been waiting a long time for social housing.  If we allow larger families to be evicted, they are the folks who end up spending the longest periods in emergency accommodation, so much so that in 2020 the Minister gave local authorities the power to buy one-bedroom and four-bedroom vacant properties in order to move single people and large families out of emergency accommodation.  If a large family ends up in emergency accommodation, it takes a very long time to find suitable accommodation for them.  Why are we subjecting families to this?</p> <p>My other concern is that this provision could become a loophole for a small number of landlords who see that they need a loophole.  If landlords cannot evict tenants because they want to sell the house, they could evict them for overcrowding, even if the household has one person too many.  I appeal to the Government to support amendment No. 9.  The small provision in the Bill could result in large families being evicted into homelessness or trapped in homelessness for long periods of time, for which there is evidence.</p></speech>

It is also draconian but, at the end of the day, that is what we are talking about.  With regard to the legislation, in the many years in which it has made judgments, the RTB has never used the word "eviction".  It orders what is called a "termination of tenancy" and may order that the tenants hereby vacate the dwelling by a certain date.  If the tenant does not do so, the landlord goes to the court.  Very foolish landlords could take the law into their own hands but, apart from disturbing the pre-eminent position of the family home, the place of repose, they would, I imagine, face significant damages.  Language is important, as are people's passion and concern.  Politicians use the word "eviction" and the RTB shies away from using that word, which is not in the principal Act.  It is an order of termination of tenancy.  It causes shock and people are dumbfounded if they receive a notice of termination.</p> <p>The Seanad is very good at devoting time to matters.  While this is not for today and this emergency legislation, at some later date, perhaps the Seanad should consider how to get rid of the terms "eviction" and "notice of termination".  I believe there is a way of doing this because I have thought about it for some time.  In future, when a landlord is buying a property, perhaps they could be told in advance that they will never get it back on the grounds of requiring it for a family member or to sell it.  This is what happens in other countries.  In other countries, there are also fewer disputes over deposits because the property is returned completely empty whenever it becomes available.  There is no hassle about aspects of furnishings being damaged and so on.  People rent the property empty and furnish it themselves.  Other countries also have a deposit retention system.  That is a discussion for another day.  One way of eliminating the term "notice of termination" to vacate the property, or dwelling as it is described in the Act, and the word "eviction" is to start afresh.  The only way that would be constitutionally bullet-proof and that property owners' rights would be affected would be if they entered and bought a property knowing explicitly that they would never get it back and the property would just be something for a gain.  We are where we are today, however.  This is an emergency response to an emergency situation.  I agree with the comments of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

To respond to the Senator's comments, what would we call it if it was not called eviction?  Would we call it "putting people out"?  Changing the name would not mean it is not happening, unless it is stopped - full stop.</p> <p>Amendment No. 8 removes all but the more serious grounds for eviction.  Under the current provisions, a tenant could be evicted for painting a wall or for doing something in a house that was not approved by the landlord.  A landlord could look for any old excuse to evict people.  The amendment would deal with that and tenants could only be evicted if they commit criminal damage to the home.</p> <p>Senator Warfield and I will call a vote on amendment No. 9 if it is not accepted.  Given that so many people are living in emergency accommodation, we know that in many cases people have to couch-surf with friends.  Travellers in Cork and Kerry have done a lot of work on this.  We know the figures.  Thousands of Travellers and people from other marginalised communities are couch-surfing.  We must protect those people and amendment No. 9 seeks to do this.</p> <p>Overcrowding and couch-surfing are not the answer either, as we all know.  It is important for quality of life that people do not do that but with the housing emergency, it happens.  We are genuinely not living in the real world if we think people do not have other people staying in their houses.  I was working with two men from Ballyfermot recently who were being evicted.  One was a member of the Traveller community.  They have nowhere to go and no protection.  They are just being put out by their landlord.  These two men are now couch-surfing.  We must look after these people and amendment No. 9 seeks to do this.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 seek to ensure that no landlord can use pre-existing problems to evict people.  I have already given the example of a tenant who paints a wall.</p> <p>We need to keep reminding ourselves that this is emergency legislation.  We are not saying that amendment No. 12 would apply to everybody but it also seeks to protect people.  The Civil Engagement Group looked at these amendments through the lens of human rights and equality and with NGOs and other organisations.  I will keep going back to this point.  This amendments are not the voices of Senators Eileen Flynn, Lynn Ruane, Alice-Mary Higgins and Frances Black.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These amendments are the voices of the people, like all our amendments.

Its provisions are carefully drafted to limit its interference with constitutionally protected property rights of landlords.  On the landlord's right to terminate a tenancy on the ground that he or she intends to sell the property, I wish to clarify for the House that outside the winter emergency period there is no general provision in the Residential Tenancies Act to prohibit a landlord from selling his or her property with a tenant <i>in situ</i>.  However, it is recognised that the landlord is likely to realise a lower sale price for a property sold without vacant possession.  Since September 2016, the Tyrrelstown amendment provides that where a landlord proposes to sell ten or more units in a single development at the same time, the sale is subject to the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ</i>other than in exceptional circumstances.  The Tyrrelstown amendment was carefully drafted to promote security of tenure in the interest of the common social good.  The provision strikes a balance between landlords' right to sell their property and achieve a fair return on investment and a tenant's right to security of tenure.  Any proposal to remove the landlord's right to terminate a tenancy in a case of every rental property being sold would carry with it the risk of constitutional challenge.  Successive Governments have not provided a legal requirement that the sale of rental properties on the basis of tenants remaining <i>in situ</i>taking into account legal risks involved.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 enhanced tenancy protections to provide that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he or she intends to sell a property, he or she must enter into a contract for sale within nine months of the termination date and if not, must offer to re-let to a former tenant.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 also proposes to amend the wording of the termination ground under paragraph 5 of the table to section 34 relating to the substantial refurbishment or renovation of the rental dwelling.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 significantly strengthened the protections around the grounds for termination of a tenancy particularly in respect of paragraph 5.  Where the landlord intends to substantially refurbish or renovate a rental dwelling in a way that requires a dwelling to be vacated for the purpose, a notice of termination must contain or be accompanied in writing by a statement specifying the nature of the intended works and in the case where planning permission has been obtained, a copy of the planning permission must be attached to the notice or a statement that planning permission is not required and specifying the name of the contractor, if any, employed to carry out intended works and the dates on which the intended works are to be carried out and the proposed duration of the period in which those works are to be carried out and that the landlord is required to offer to the tenant a tenancy of the dwelling and the dwelling becomes available for re-letting by reason of the completion of the works of refurbishment or renovation.  In addition, the notice of termination must contain or be accompanied by a certificate in writing of a registered professional within the meaning of the Building Control Act 2007 stating that the proposed refurbishment or renovation works would pose a risk to the health or safety of occupants of the dwelling concerned and should not proceed while the dwelling is occupied.  Such a risk is likely to exist for such a period as is specified in the certificate, which will not be less than three weeks.</p><p>These substantial changes were made in 2019 to strengthen enforcement of tenancy termination protections while respecting landlords' constitutional rights regarding their property.  Owners of rental properties need to be sure that the property rights are protected under the Constitution.  We need to safeguard investment in the rental sector.</p><p>Amendment No. 4 also proposes to amendment section 35 of the 2004 Act.  While the purpose of the winter emergency period is to assist renters who are finding it difficult to source accommodation in the constrained rental market in the short term, I do not believe that it would be appropriate to permanently amend the definition of &quot;family member&quot; to prevent a landlord from terminating a tenancy to enable occupation of their property by a family member such as a grandchild, parent, grandparent, step-parent, parent-in-law, brother, sister, nephew or niece of the landlord as the Act currently provides.  I cannot accept this proposed amendment to the 2004 Act.  It is reasonable to expect that the personal circumstances of many landlords with one or two rental properties might well give rise to a need to provide a home for a family member at some stage.  The investment in the rental sector needs to be safeguarded and measures such as those proposed by the Senators would lead to a loss of units from the sector.  </p><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 6 as I outlined earlier.  The Bill has been carefully calibrated to balance both the rights of tenants and landlords.  Tenants facing a notice of termination will receive protection under the Bill to remain <i>in situ</i>over the winter emergency period allowing time for housing supply to increase over that period.  While we are interfering with landlords' constitutional property rights, this interference is made in a limited manner and applies for a short period.  The interference is also carefully calibrated to affect certain tenancy terminations only.  To provide a requisite balance, exceptions are provided to the application of this law.  The deferment of tenancy termination dates will not apply where there has been a breach of tenancy obligations or where the landlord cites as a ground of notice of termination breach of the tenant obligations, including rent arrears or that the dwelling no longer suits the accommodation needs of the tenants having regard to bed spaces and the size of the household.  We need to safeguard landlords rights in such cases where tenancy termination might be a necessary step to protect their property and livelihood.</p><p>The Senators propose to remove breach of tenant obligations as a legitimate justification altogether.  The reality is that tenants have a number of obligations that must be met under section 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act, which, if not met could result in significant costs such as increased insurance or extensive repairs to the landlord.  For those tenants who are struggling to meet their obligations to pay rent, there are supports available as I outlined on Second Stage, including rent supplement, supplementary welfare allowance and the additional needs payments from the Department of Social Protection.  There are supports in place to help tenants to meet their obligations and the Government will not be found wanting when it comes to protection of the most vulnerable.  </p><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 7.  I understand the motivation of Senators in trying to disapply the protections under the Bill only where there is clear breach of tenant obligations.  Tenants have a number of obligations that must be met under section 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act, which if not met by a tenant could result in significant costs such as increased insurance or extensive repairs to the landlord.  The tenant obligation to pay rent is key to the operation of the rental market.  I readily accept that some tenants are struggling to meet their obligations to pay rent and again wish to stress that there are supports to help.  From 1 August 2020, the Government introduced permanent enhancements to tenancy protections for those in rent arrears.  New procedures require landlords to serve both the RTB and the tenant with both a 28-day warning notice seeking payment of rent arrears and any related notice of termination.  Upon receipt of the notice, the RTB acknowledges receipt from the landlord and the tenant and provides information to the tenant to enable him or her to get advice from MABS and offers assistance to the tenant in obtaining this advice.  Any notice of termination grounded on rent arrears must be copied to the RTB and will be invalid if not so copied, and notice of termination grounded in rent arrears can only be served by landlords on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to the tenant and the RTB and the arrears were not paid within 28 days following receipt of the warning by the tenant or the or RTB, whichever occurs later.  The aim is to ensure that early action is taken to address rent arrears to the benefit of both tenant and landlord.  Again, the Government is acutely aware of the pressure on tenants and is keen to try and put in place what helps that are needed.</p><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 8 but I again understand the motivation of Senators in trying to restrict the breach of obligations in respect of which the protections under this Bill shall not apply.  The amendment seeks the Bill's protection to apply unless there is damage to the property over and above the normal wear and tear, antisocial behaviour by the tenant or visitors to their dwelling.  The reality is that tenants have a number of obligations that must be met under section 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act.  Apart from tenant obligations referred to by the Senators in their amendment, tenants are obliged to pay rent, not engage in actions that would invalidate the landlord&rsquo;s insurance policy on the property, not unlawfully sublet the property and, <i>inter alia,</i>not use the dwelling or cause the dwelling to be used for any purpose other than as a dwelling without the written consent of the landlord.  As I have said, there are a number of obligations that if not met by the tenant could result in significant cost to the landlord.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For those tenants who are struggling, again, supports are available.<br/><br/>I cannot accept amendment No. 9, although I understand the sentiments behind it.  The Government has framed the Bill in line with the advice of the Attorney General and we believe we have struck a fair and defensible balance between the rights of tenants and landlords.  Overcrowding of a rental property could have significant ramifications for a landlord.  A landlord has obligations to his or her tenants and also to his or her neighbours to enforce tenant obligations as may be required.<br/><br/>Since quarter 2 of 2019, notices of termination served on the basis that the dwelling is no longer suitable to the accommodation needs of the tenants have represented just 2% of all notices of termination copied to the RTB.  Landlords must also comply with the Housing Act 1966, whereby a local authority may direct a landlord to reduce the number of occupants of the property to a safe level should a tenancy agreement be breached and the resulting overcrowding may pose health and public safety risks.<br/><br/>Section 63 of the Housing Act 1966 deals with overcrowding and, <i>inter alia,</i>limits the number of people who can occupy the same bedroom.  Where a landlord seeks to end a tenancy on this ground, the notice of termination must specify the number of bed spaces and the reason the property is no longer suitable with regard to the bed spaces and the household composition.  The RTB dispute resolution service will be available as usual over the winter emergency period to assist where issues arise in regard to such terminations.<br/><br/>I cannot accept amendment No. 10.  I am not entirely sure I understand its intent but it seems to introduce a qualifier with regard to the exceptions under section 2(2) on deferment provisions.  To be clear, section 2 applies to notices of termination served on or before the date on which the Bill is enacted.  The exceptions under section 2(2) also apply to notices of termination served on or before the Bill is enacted.  There is a need for the exceptions under section 2(2) to ensure the Bill will provide the necessary balance in its tenancy protections, again for both tenants and landlords.<br/><br/>Similarly, I am not entirely sure what the intent of amendment No. 10, which I cannot accept, is but it seems to introduce a qualifier with regard to exceptions under section 2(2) to deferment provisions.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 11 appears to be similar to amendment No. 10 but restricts its application to cases of overcrowding, which we have discussed.  To be clear, I reiterate section 2 applies to notices of termination served on or before the date on which the Bill is enacted.  The exceptions under section 2(2) also apply to notices of termination served on or before the date on which the Bill is enacted.  There is a need for the exceptions under section 2(2) to ensure the Bill will provide the necessary balance for tenancy protections between tenants and landlords.  I think the intent of the amendment is to allow tenants who live in overcrowded rented dwellings to avail of the protections under the Bill over the winter.  Again, I cannot accept amendment No. 11, for the reasons discussed in respect of amendment No. 9.  It would not be safe for tenants or, potentially, their neighbours.<br/><br/>I cannot accept amendment No. 12, which seeks to allow a tenant who does not pay rent to avail of the protections over the winter.  The tenant obligation to pay rent is a key to the operation of the rental market.  I readily accept that some tenants are struggling to meet their obligations to pay rent and I reiterate that supports are available to help them, which I have outlined.<br/><br/>On 1 August 2020, the Government introduced new permanent enhancements to tenancy protection for those in rent arrears.  The new procedures require landlords to serve both the RTB and the tenant with a 28-day warning notice seeking payment of arrears also related to notice of termination.  On receipt of the warning notice, the RTB will acknowledge its receipt to the landlord and tenant and provide information to the tenant to enable him or her to get advice from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and offer assistance to the tenant in regard to this advice.  Any notice of termination grounded in rent arrears must be copied to the RTB and will be invalid if not so copied.  A notice of termination grounded on rent arrears can be served by a landlord only on the condition that a written rent arrears warning was given to both the tenant and the RTB, and the arrears were not paid within 28 days of receipt of the warning by the tenant or the RTB, specifically whichever occurs later.  The aim is to ensure early action is taken to address rent arrears in the interests of both tenant and landlord.<br/><br/>I cannot accept amendment No. 18, a consequential amendment to the Title on foot of Labour Party amendments the Government does not accept.</p></speech>

It is important to point out in this space that this was another item raised at our Oireachtas joint committee by the IPOA and the IPAV in respect of the process that applies where a tenant fails to pay rent, as the Minister of State outlined.  The landlord has to notify the RTB of the intention and then, perhaps, after the 28 days have passed, he or she has to seek a determination from the RTB, but that is not the end of the process for the landlord.  He or she might have to get a court decision to enable the enacting of the decision of the RTB.  Throughout that process, which can take 12 months or longer, there is a landlord who, potentially, is without any sum coming into him or her which, obviously, is not right.  We have to try to ensure, by some mechanism, that there can be a quick determination in some instances by the RTB where there is a failure to pay rent.  Moreover, there should be a quick implementation of same by the courts system.  It is not sustainable that a tenant would be allowed not to pay rent.</p> <p>It is important to point out this applies to only a tiny number of people.  It is not a widespread issue but rather applies to a small number of tenants who do not pay rent where the landlord has to take the actions I outlined.  In those instances, there are those few landlords who are out of pocket and there has to be a better and quicker way to implement the decisions of the RTB where they have been made.  Given we have this space at the moment, a kind of a holding pattern over the coming months, there is no reason the RTB cannot expedite cases where there a wilful withholding of rent.</p></speech>

They are so simple.  As an example, if I live in rented accommodation and paint the walls after the landlord agrees that I can do that, the landlord could later use that as an excuse, even if it came out of my pocket, and say he or she never gave me permission to paint the walls.  That is only an example but I could be evicted for that.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 seek to protect renters such that they cannot be evicted for, say, painting the walls, for which they had permission, just because the landlord does not want them in the house anymore.  God help the poor landlords; they are really getting such a hard auld kicking with this ban.</p> <p>This applies to the most vulnerable people in particular, such as members of the Travelling community, Roma people, Black people and other people of colour and single parents - the list goes on and on with any excuse to evict them.  In one sense I am delighted I live in the real world, with the communities who are impacted most by this.  It might have come to the landlord's attention that the tenants are members of the Travelling community or that they are a single parent and they might be evicted on those grounds, but the landlord might blame the eviction on something the tenant did the previous year.</p> <p>I encourage the Minister of State to reconsider amendments Nos. 10 and 11 and accept them.</p></speech>

The legislation does not discriminate against any individual in society.  The legislation treats all renters and all citizens equally.  I want to raise the issue of withholding of rent.  It is important that the legislation does not discriminate against any member of society.  It is important that we remember that small landlords are citizens as well.  I want to share with the Minister of State a real-life example of a landlord and his experience with a tenant withholding rent.  This was a man in his 60s who entered into a personal relationship with somebody else, moved out of his home and rented that home.  He did so legitimately, registered the property, charged a fair market rent and was happy to make his home available to somebody else on a fully legitimate rental basis.  The personal relationship broke down and he also was diagnosed with a terminal illness.  He needed to move back into his home and served notice.  In the interim the tenant had been withholding rent over a prolonged period and had been advertising the property on Airbnb, generating many multiples of the rent in income from Airbnb.  The matter went to the RTB.  The RTB took 12 months and only after my intervention did we start to get some satisfaction.  That was a man who had done the good thing in making his home available on a rental basis.  He did not need it and saw that there was a need there.  He had maintained the property, provided it at a fair rent and complied with all of the regulations.  He became ill and needed his home back, and still complied with all of the regulations, even though he had his obligations to pay a mortgage on that property in the absence of receiving a rent and, at the same time, witnessing the abuse of his property, and it being rented out for many multiples of the rent he was charging.  That is a real-life example.  The RTB should not have taken as long as it did to resolve that issue.  It should not have needed a public representative to get involved.  The RTB needs to step up its act for tenants and for landlords.  We need to ensure that we have a secure, sustainable rental market.</p></speech>

Article 40.1 of the Constitution provides that everyone is equal before the law and the State cannot unjustly, unreasonably or arbitrarily discriminate between two citizens.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas were to enact legislation that would do that, it would be exposed to a constitutional challenge.  I do not believe the legislation as proposed is in breach of the Constitution.  If I did, I would not support it.  The Minister of State is acting on good advice from the constitutional officer advising the Government, the Attorney General.</p><p>I would like much greater protections in the longer term for tenants.  People could be watching this debate today and receive a notice of termination in the post.  It is important that those who have received that news realise that we are legislating today and taking all Stages of the Bill, which has been through the D&aacute;il.  Most important, they should know that there are organisations out there to protect tenants.  Threshold does excellent work.  They are advocates for tenants.  It is not a triple lock but there is a triple protection under law for tenants.  The first is that if the tenant feels they received a notice of termination that may not have been served in accordance with law, they can seek an adjudication hearing, which is a private hearing.  Following that, if either party is not satisfied with the outcome of the determination order of the adjudication, it is open to either party to have an appeal in the form of a tribunal hearing.  They can insist on an oral hearing at that stage.  I would much prefer to have more oral hearings and less use of Zoom because it is such a fundamental issue about someone's home.  The tribunal hearing is a <i>de novo</i>hearing and it is binding.  In a sense it is the end of the road but not in respect of a point of law or procedural challenge.  There is an opportunity to go to the High Court.  That is the third option.</p><p>I encourage people who feel they have been treated unfairly to seek expert advice.  It is a relatively informal process.  The RTB is not tooled up with lots of lawyers.  Threshold are excellent advocates.  People are also entitled to an interpreter if they are from a different country and English might not be their first language.  From my experience of the RTB, landlords will say it is a pro-tenant place and they do not get a fair hearing and tenants will say it is a bit pro-landlord.  From my first-hand experience, they treat everyone with the utmost dignity and respect.  I hope that will continue.  There is so much at stake here.  It is such a fundamental point.  I know we have all said that this morning.  It is a person's home, a place of repose and peace.  At the end of a hard day's work or school when the family comes home, they want stability and certainty.</p></speech>

Having regard to the unprecedented pressures on the energy sector, I am pleased to have the opportunity to commend the Development (Emergency Electricity Generation) Bill 2022 to the House.</p><p>I shall open the debate by setting the context for the action to be taken on foot of this Bill, which will provide for emergency measures for temporary electricity generation development to ameliorate and protect the security of electricity supply in the State because of the exceptional circumstances that have arisen in the market for that supply.  Although many Members will be familiar with these issues, it is important to take this opportunity to set out the complex situation in which we find ourselves with regard to the security of electricity supply and wider pressures on the energy sector.  I will also describe the sections of the Bill in detail and why it is needed.  It is critical that this legislation is passed in as short a time as possible to provide for a critical step in the process of providing for temporary electricity generation.  I, therefore, seek Senators' support to achieve that.</p><p>On the factors affecting security of electricity supply, Senators will appreciate that we, in Ireland, face additional pressures due to our geographical location, low levels of interconnection with other countries, fossil fuel dependency and the smaller scale of the Irish market compared with many other European countries.  However, the most immediate factor that will affect the security of electricity supply in Ireland over the coming years is the potential generation capacity shortfall that was identified in EirGrid's all-island generation capacity statement, GCS, published in September 2021.  This potential capacity shortfall arises in periods of peak demand coinciding with low renewable and interconnector availability and it arises largely due to the non-delivery of previously contracted capacity, increasing electricity demand and the increasing unreliability of existing plants.  This is a critical point.  The State needs to react to an unprecedented situation that it has been presented with and has been unfolding over the course of the past year.  This is an electricity emergency and emergency powers have already been used to address it.</p><p>On 7 June 2022, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, directed EirGrid to procure, using the most expeditious means available, approximately 450 MW of additional generation capacity from winter 2023-24 to winter 2025-26 to ensure a secure electricity supply.  This procurement process was provided for in other extraordinary legislation passed through these Houses in the summer in the form of the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022.  EirGrid commenced the procurement process on foot of this legislation.  Until such time as the proposed equipment manufacturer and the selected sites were known, it was not possible to know what time was available to secure the relevant consents in line with existing legislation.  Now, as a result of the requirement for early site preparation works and the long lead-in time for the commissioning of the equipment, it is apparent that extraordinary emergency measures are required to ensure that works can commence to provide for emergency generation by winter 2023-24.</p><p>The legislation before the House will ensure the next tranche of two emergency generation projects, which will provide 450 MW of additional generation capacity, can be delivered by winter 2023-24.  It is the next step in the process.  It is important to note that this will not impede any of our plans for renewables, interconnection, batteries, demand-side response or energy efficiency.  This emergency generation does not replace our long-term ambitions for renewable energy, which will continue at pace.  In order to ensure the security of our electricity supply over the coming years, it is vital that this legislation be passed as expeditiously as possible.  This will ensure the next tranche of two emergency generation projects can be brought forward within a timeframe that would enable preparatory site works to commence as soon as possible.  This capacity will remain available until the necessary replacement capacity has been secured.  Further to the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022, the project will cease operation in 2027, with an option of a further year if required but only if such a resolution is passed by both Houses.  The temporary generation will be used only when needed and will be used as a back-up in addition to existing generation capacity in the electricity market.</p><p>All potential existing options under conventional and emergency planning processes have been considered.  They have been ruled out on the basis that none could enable delivery of the emergency capacity within the timeframe needed.  The Bill is, therefore, required urgently in order to ensure that an application can be made and site clearance works commenced as soon as possible, probably this year.  This is an ambitious timeline but we need to do everything in our power to facilitate the development of this emergency generation.  The State will not be the barrier to progress here.  We are using extraordinary measures in an unprecedented situation.</p><p>I will devote my remaining remarks to the Bill's subject matter.  The Bill seeks to disapply the Planning and Development Act 2000 and defines that the designated development is exempt from the provisions of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive.  It also provides for a new alternative application, assessment and ministerial approval process for the temporary emergency generation projects to deliver power by 2023-24.</p><p>I would like to clarify that by passing this legislation, the Oireachtas is not approving any development.  Rather, it is providing for a predetermination that an exceptional case exists for the purposes of Article 2(4) of the EIA directive and providing for streamlined and accelerated consenting procedures.  Many of the provisions set out in this legislation are already on the Statute Book.  For example, a Minister of the Government may disapply the provisions of the Planning and Development Act by order in accordance with section 181(2)(<i>a</i>) of same.  I have done so for another emergency generation project at North Wall.  The Planning and Development Act also provides that an application can be made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to exempt a development from the requirements of the EIA directive, as set out in section 181(21) of the Act.  These procedures are in and of themselves not streamlined enough for the extraordinary situation that we find ourselves in and alternative processes must be provided for.</p><p>For clarity, I will provide a section-by-section summary of the Bill.  There are 12 sections.  Section 1 is a standard provision which provides for definitions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senators will note the reference to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I am providing for an independent assessment of the proposals.</p><p>Section 2 provides that a specific electricity generation project of up to 450 MW of temporary emergency generation and ancillary works, intended to be located on two separate sites at Shannonbridge and Tarbert generation stations, is a designated development for the purposes of the Bill and is required for the purpose of ensuring security of electricity supply.  This section also sets out that the designated development may take place on a phased basis and is not likely to have significant transboundary effects.</p><p>Section 3 provides for the disapplication of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>Section 4 provides that EirGrid or any other person may apply to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications for approval to carry out a designated development.</p><p>Section 5 sets out that the designated development shall be exempt from the provisions of the EIA directive on the basis that the designated development is an exceptional case allowable under the directive.  It also provides that the Minister shall arrange for an alternative assessment to be carried out and that this assessment is carried out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>Section 6 provides that an assessment of the designated development shall be carried out by An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the purposes of the habitats directive in accordance with the relevant regulations. </p><p>Section 7 provides that, having considered an application and associated assessments, including any mitigation measures, the Minister may approve, approve in part, or refuse to approve the designated development.  The section also provides for processes relating to Article 16 of the habitats directive and the obligation to notify the   European Commission that the designated development is exempt  from the EIA directive.  This last part ensures full compliance with the directive.</p><p>Section 8 sets out that the designated development shall be carried out in compliance with an approval given by the Minister under section 7.  This ensures only works that are subject to an approval are carried out.</p><p>Section 9 sets out the Minister's power to make regulations to prescribe matters of procedure and administration and ensures every regulation made by the Minister under the Act will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>Section 10 sets out the means by which, in performing their functions under the Bill, the Minister and the board shall, insofar as is practicable, take into account the exceptional circumstance and compelling urgent necessity of the designated development, in a manner consistent with the requirements of section 15(1) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.</p><p>Section 11 provides that any expense incurred by the Minister in the administration of the provisions of the Bill, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, be  paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</p><p>Section 12 contains standard provisions concerning the Short Title and commencement of the Act.</p><p>I have outlined the main provisions of this emergency measures Bill and provided additional detail on the sections.  I hope that this will be  of assistance to Senators.  I look forward to an informed and meaningful debate and to working constructively with Senators on all sides of the House.</p></speech>

These provisions will ensure we have enough electricity capacity not so much for this winter but for next winter.  There was a time everybody&rsquo;s house did not have electricity years ago, but we now depend on it for everything, such as charging our phones, working from home, broadband connections and so on.  Not having enough electricity and outages are concepts that people fear.  It is important that the legislation is being brought forward and that these measures will be introduced.</p> <p>As the Minister of State said, it is because of the non-delivery of previously contracted supply capacity that the Government is now asking for the power to make sure we have enough electricity.  I am more than happy, on my own behalf and on behalf of my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, to support the Bill, as I hope all Senators will.  I do not need to delay this process.   I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for being here.  The sooner we get this Bill over the line, the sooner we can have security of supply for next winter.</p></speech>

I compliment him on his informative contribution and for providing great clarity on the Bill, which is very much required.  We are in unprecedented times, without a shadow of a doubt.  This legislation is what we require, not for this winter but for the next, to make sure we have security of generation capacity, which is very welcome.  Such security is required in the market place now.</p> <p>The potential we have over the next 12 months in microgeneration is also important.  We need to be promoting this as best we can.  I refer to the proposal on solar panels.  There was a briefing in west Cork yesterday about the potential most agricultural sheds have to tie into that project.  Over the next 12 months, an important part of the work is that we make sure the capacity of these units can be used so that we can limit the drawing of power from the grid.  If we were to do that, hopefully it would generate some needed capacity and reduce the shortfall nationwide.</p> <p>I refer to the all-Ireland dynamic we have with the industry.  Are there any proposals from the Northern Ireland regarding capacity?  We are in a unique scenario in that we have all-Ireland capacity for energy generation.  Will the Minister of State provide an update on what is proposed in the northern part of the island regarding capacity issues?</p></speech>

We made that clear to the Minister when he proposed that the committee wave pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Government&rsquo;s attempt to get a handle on supply and demand is a fiasco at this stage, as is the fact that more emergency legislation is having to be passed by the Houses.</p> <p>We all know our planning laws are fundamental to the protection of citizens and the environment against poor development, and we know what happens when shortcuts are taken.  It is quite something.  We must all acknowledge that we are now being asked to set aside significant parts of the planning process to secure 450 MW of generation capacity.  That is a huge responsibility and we should all be aware of what we are being asked to do.</p> <p>The Opposition has been caught in a bind because we do not have any option but to accept this legislation, even though we know the risks it entails.  Given what has been going on with An Bord Plean&aacute;la in respect of planning does not give us much comfort either.  We do not have any other option but to support the Bill because we have been walked to the cliff edge when it comes to energy generation, electricity supply, and the risk of blackouts.  There has been a lot of deliberate conflation not by the Minister of State, but in certain quarters.  Even in the audiovisual room yesterday, an attempt was made to conflate energy supply with energy generation, which was deeply unfortunate.  People should be mindful that they are very different things.</p> <p>What is needed to be asked and what was absent from the contributions of Senators Horkan and Lombard is the question of how we got here.  We got here because of failed policy under the previous Government, particularly from Fine Gael, which has been in government for ten years.  The demand for electrify, which has been facilitated by that party having no strategy or planning whatsoever, has led us to this point.  The writing has been on the wall for years.  It is all in EirGrid&rsquo;s generation capacity statement.  We are left with no alternative because the Government&rsquo;s sheer incompetence has left us with none.</p> <p>The terms &ldquo;data centres&rdquo; and &ldquo;large energy users&rdquo; do not appear in the Bill.  My amendments were ruled out of order because they were not relevant to the Bill.  However, they are absolutely relevant to the Bill.  Large energy users are critical to why we are in this situation.  It is interesting to see that Ukraine is referred to in the Bill&rsquo;s Long Title, when we know this is not about gas supply issues; it is about electricity generation capacity.  It is interesting that Ukraine was mentioned in the title.  I wonder if this was done to get the legislation past the EU Commission, as we are seeking an exception from the EIA directive.</p> <p>My amendments that were ruled out of order were on excessive demand from data centres.  It is important to put on record the level of scrutiny that has been given to the Bill.  Some 15 minutes before the commencement of a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, members were sent a letter by the Minister asking that we waive pre-legislative scrutiny, followed by a private briefing by officials.  I welcome that we were given three hours to debate the Bill in the Seanad, but the speed at which it was passed by the Lower House was remarkable.  We know the Minister of State will not accept amendments, no matter the arguments.  The fact that he did not even have the opportunity to finish his opening remarks in the D&aacute;il is particularly damning.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The costs of these provisions are astronomical.  A sum of &euro;350 million was allocated in a Supplementary Estimate, which was scrutinised by the select committee before the summer, with funds that were collected through carbon tax being redirected from retrofitting to pay for emergency generation.  Ireland is failing in its obligations to set out its plans to keep global warming to 1.5&deg;C, yet we are building more fossil fuel infrastructure to facilitate the excess demand large energy users, particularly data centres, are putting on our electricity grid and now on our gas supply as well.</p><p>We will deal on Committee Stage with our amendment to delete the provision regarding alternative appropriate sites.  The legislation, as currently drafted, is too vague.  It is not specific enough to meet the requirement of EU law.  We raised this with the officials when they presented to the joint committee.  Will the Minister of State outlines how he see this being passed?  The Acting Chairman is indicating my time is up but we have three hours for the debate and there is only a handful of amendments.</p></speech>

We all recognise this is an emergency.  There were 126 votes in favour of the Bill in the Lower House and eight against it.  More or less across the board, and certainly in this House, there is support for it.  We agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny for this and for a previous Bill because of the demands that are now on the system.  We have got here because of an increasing demand for electricity generally across the State and because of a failure with regard to the process.  In 2019, there was a failure to deliver from an auction and, more recently, we have seen the problems arising from having older infrastructure than we would like to have.  In June, the CRU allowed for 450 MW of emergency generation and now it has to be delivered, which is what this Bill is about.</p> <p>It is important, as the Minister of State said, that even though we require this emergency generation, it is not the case that everything else is standing still.  We are among the top four countries in the world for generating energy from renewables.  Some days, when it is very windy here, we are the top country.  We are driving on.  There is a revolution across rooftops, with more and more people putting on solar panels.  They all want to be part of the transition.  From next year, solar panels will be rolled out across all schools for free.  That will allow people to get on board even more with solar energy.</p> <p>A total of 40% of electricity in Ireland, or the energy to drive it, comes from renewables.  We want to double that to 80% by the end of the decade.  Even then, however, there will be 20% to be made up, as everybody, I hope, recognises.  I would like to see us investing more in hydrogen facilities.  There is a pilot programme in Galway and talk of another one at Mount Lucas in the midlands.  If we can support and fund these projects, it will demonstrate what can be done with hydrogen.  Green hydrogen will not be useful for everything but there is potential in it.  On a recent trip to Aberdeen, I saw how it is being used for some services there.  We have an opportunity in places like Galway and the midlands to roll it out and see how it would work more generally.</p> <p>We have already contracted 3 GW of renewable energy.  It is a significant amount but everything that needs to be done cannot be done overnight.  We need something for next winter.  I hope everybody supports the Bill.  Like other speakers, I do not like to see the pre-legislative scrutiny process being ridden roughshod over and I agree it is an important part of the process.  Today, however, we have to get on with passing this legislation in order that everyone can feel more comfortable in their homes and not have a sense of anxiety hanging over them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.227" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#Y00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I fully understand the importance of this legislation but the point needs to be made, particularly from the Opposition side, that we live in a parliamentary democracy and how the legislation is being put through is not good practice.  I recall that when the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was a member of a previous Government, one of his constant themes was the frustration he had felt in opposition, with only two Green Party Deputies, at the way legislation was handled.  He is now doing the same thing.  This is nothing personal and I have a lot of time for the Minister of State, whom I have known a long time.  He is a man of integrity who supports engagement with the political process.</p> <p>However, I am conscious the Houses are going into recess today for a week.  We learned earlier that the Government was not in a position to accept any amendments to the legislation we debated before coming to this Bill.  I would say it will be the same in this case.  We need to be honest with people.  Let us not waste people's time, including that of the Minister of State, talking about engagement when the decision has been taken that no amendments will be accepted.  This is an important point and it is part of a bigger issue of reform.  The reality is we have a vast coalition Government that does not even need to have its full complement of Senators in the Chamber to pass every Bill it brings forward.  That is the reality and it is the same in the D&aacute;il.  I do not say that as a negative but as something we need to acknowledge and something that can be frustrating.  However, nothing lasts forever and we are nearly halfway through the Government's term.  At the very best, it can last for another two and a half years and it may come to an abrupt end earlier than that.  The tides will always reverse but that is not a reason to accept the way things are being done.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I will support this legislation because it is important.  I have put down an amendment, which I will speak to on the next Stage.  The real concern I have relates to planning and development, something in which the Minister of State has been involved in the past in his political career.  The Bill "seeks to disapply the Planning and Development Act 2000 and defines that the designated development is exempt from the provisions of [an EIA] directive".  These are the Minister of State's words, not mine.  The Green Party in government is agreeing to do that.  It does not sit comfortably with me and I do not think it would sit comfortably with a lot of the supporters of the Minister of State's party.  However, it is what is happening, as outlined in his speech.  It is on the record of the House.  I thank the colleagues who put down amendments and I look forward to engaging in debate on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.228" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1672" speakername="Rebecca Moynihan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#Y00600"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Chamber for this debate.  This Bill follows on from the EirGrid legislation last summer.  It is the second Bill on energy that indicates we are failing to take long-term energy policy seriously.  Instead, we are legislating as we go in response to events.  On Tuesday night, "Prime Time" had a report on the Derrybrien wind farm, which is not operational at the moment.  When we try to get around or ignore EU environmental legislation, we often end up taking one step forward while taking two steps back.</p> <p>It is worrying that we are in a situation in which we have to legislate on an emergency basis to protect our energy security for next winter.  That is no way to operate and it is not the way to address our long-term energy security needs in the midst of a climate crisis.  As my party leader said in the D&aacute;il last night, this situation is the result of our flawed and failed electricity supply market.  When markets fail, it is incumbent on the State to step in.  We have put forward a number of amendments to the Bill.  We are not laying the blame at the Minister of State's door.  He is simply responding to events as they happen.  We are concerned, however, about ministerial oversight in respect of the potential extension in the Bill of certain powers.  It is important that there be Oireachtas oversight in this regard.  My party and some of the other Opposition parties have put down a number of amendments proposing that some of those powers be brought back to the Oireachtas.  Even if the Minister of State does not accept the amendments, we hope he will consider a process, perhaps by way of going to the climate change committee, rather than simply having these issues left within the remit of ministerial power and responsibility.</p></speech>

I welcome the broad range of contributions.  I will keep my comments focused on the content and purpose of the Bill.  If I have time, however, I will address each of the statements that were made.</p><p>The most immediate factor affecting security of electricity supply in Ireland in the coming years is the potential generation capacity shortfall, as identified in the generation capacity statement.  To be clear, there are three reasons why we have a shortfall of capacity, namely, the non-delivery of previously contracted supply, the increase in electricity demand and the increasing unreliability of existing plants.  The State needs to react to the situation that it has been presented with and that has been unfolding over the course of the past year.  This is an electricity emergency and that is why emergency powers have been used to address it.</p><p>The projects involved are critical.  They are also time-sensitive.  Sites need to be cleared, equipment needs to be ordered and resources need to be directed towards the construction and installation of the generators.  Delivering the proposed legislation will ensure that the preparatory site works can commence in good time for that.  What is being proposed is not new, but it will involve a significantly shorter timeframe and it is required.  There will be a significant prospect of interruptions in electricity supply next winter if this legislation is not passed and if development is not commenced on the selected sites as soon as possible.</p><p>Since the publication of the generation capacity statement in 2021, there has been further deterioration in the availability and performance of a number of existing generators .  The latter will exacerbate the scale of the emergency from the coming winter onward.  This means that customer supply not being met has now become a serious risk.  In May, the CRU made a formal request for the use of emergency planning powers under section 181(2)(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, along with evidence provided by EirGrid to substantiate same.  Based on the evidence presented, I agreed that the use of emergency powers under the Act was required in order to deliver the project as soon as possible and to address the emerging energy emergency.  This development was approved in September and is currently under construction.  EirGrid further updated its capacity assessment in the first quarter of 2022 and recommended that an enlarged tranche of temporary generation would be required.  In June, the CRU, having considered all the information, directed EirGrid to procure using the most expeditious means available the delivery of approximately 450 MW of additional temporary emergency generation capacity.  Further legislation was brought before this House in July to facilitate same.  Experience with the delivery of the first chance of emergency generation in addition to new procurement process launched this summer has resulted in a requirement to devise a new path to consenting the required development so that the additional capacity is in place for the winter of 2023-24.</p><p>It is worthwhile to restate the purpose of the Bill.  The Bill is seeking to disapply the Planning and Development Act 2000 and it clearly states that the designated development, namely, the provision of up to 450 MW of emergency generation, is considered to be an exceptional case for the purposes of exempting it from the provisions of the EIA directive.  It also provides for a new alternative application assessment and ministerial approval process for the temporary emergency generation projects to deliver power by winter 2023-24.</p><p>By passing this legislation, the Oireachtas is not approving any development.  Rather, it is providing for a predetermination that an exceptional case exists for the purposes of article 2(4) of the EIA directive and providing for streamlined and accelerated consenting procedures.  As already stated, many of the provisions set out in this legislation are already on the Statute Book.  In addition, this is a faster process.</p><p>I understand Senators are concerned that the proposal may appear to be open-ended and, as such, that it might be used to approve other projects.  The individual component developments themselves are subject to a current procedure run by EirGrid on foot of the passing of the Eirgrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022, will be the subject of a further assessment by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and then of approval by me.  This is a targeted set of measures that is aimed at ensuring security of supply for winter 2023-24.  It is limited in scale by reference to the 450 MW limit and it is limited in location because there are only a limited number of sites that can technically accommodate the proposals.  It is a matter for the relevant competent authority to review the information presented to it and to provide me with a reasoned opinion in advance of approving the proposed development.  I will also notify the commission at that point in compliance with the requirements of EIA directive.</p><p>These emergency generation units will only be used occasionally during times of peak demand that coincide with low wind and interconnector availability.  Therefore, they are not expected to have a significant impact on our carbon emissions, but this will be assessed.  It is a relevant consideration and something that I know that Senators are interested in.</p><p>I will now address some of the contributions and I will start with Senator Horkan, who emphasises the necessity of electricity for our modern life and he is absolutely right.  It is critical that we have electricity, not just for heating our homes and for lighting, but also for our communications.  Senator Lombard points out the value that comes from having solar panels on sheds and Senator Pauline O&rsquo;Reilly referred to the progress that has been made in that regard.  I would specifically point out the exemptions in planning that have been provided so that one can put any number of solar panels on his or her shed or house without planning permission in most cases.</p><p>Senators have also asked about the potential of Northern Ireland to provide for some of this generation capacity, which is absolutely right because we have a single electricity market, where EirGrid owns the Northern electricity grid.  What I would say is that we are hampered by the lack of a North-South interconnector and that will be critical so that we can balance our electricity generation, North and South.  At the times, when there is excess power available on the grid in Northern Ireland, it is not always possible to redistribute it to the South, or <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>On Senator Boylan's points, I want to thank the Opposition for supporting this Bill.  She asks very reasonably we got here and I gave those three reasons, namely, due to the non-delivery of contracted supply, due to increasing electricity demand and due to the increasing unreliability of existing plants.  Senator Boyhan - rather than Senator Boylan and I never make that mistake - who is not a member of the Government feels frustrated, feels that amendments may not be accepted and so on.  For a start, I am not saying that I will not accept any of the amendments.  It depends.  We are having a debate, we are going to listen to them all and I will see how it goes.  More to the point, we are in this Chamber to debate and I listen to everything that the Senators say.  I genuinely do.  I am always willing to meet with any Senator and I always take on board the suggestions that are made.  There are many ways that debate contributes to development policy.  The civil servants are in the room as well and we all hear what is being said.  It is all put on the record, so it is all a valuable part of the development of our laws.  Senator Moynihan was seeking further engagement in the same way, and I will agree with that.</p></speech>

What amendment No. 1 proposes is to delete the phrase &ldquo;or at alternative appropriate sites&rdquo; from section 2(1).  This is because the explanatory memorandum cites article 2(4) of the EIA directive as the legal basis for the exemption of the development specified in the Bill from the wider application of the directive.  If one looks at the wording of article 2(4) of the directive, however, it explicitly states that member states may, in exceptional cases, exempt a specific project from the provisions laid down in this directive where the application of these provisions would result in adversely affecting the purpose of the project provided the objectives of this directive.  The key term here for us and our concern is &ldquo;specific project&rdquo;.  This is because to apply for the exemption from the EIA directive, it will be quite specific to a specific project.  That is why we think the language around &ldquo;alternative appropriate sites&rdquo; is a little too loose and is not consistent with the stringent criteria that are set down an article (2)4 of the directive.  The use of the term &ldquo;alternative appropriate sites&rdquo; also brings section 5(1) into conflict with the EIA directive, because that section 5(1) a designated development from the EIA directive on the basis of the legally unsound definition currently contained in section 2.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Why is this term included, as it is not consistent with the directive?  What is meant by "alternative appropriate sites"?  When we met with the officials I asked a question about the criteria they had and how many sites there were.  I know people are saying that it is specific, that it only relates to energy generation and that there is a limited number of sites that would be appropriate for this, but we are setting aside planning law and environmental impact assessments.  "Alternative appropriate sites" is a very loose term.  That could mean anything.  We need reassurance that it is not going to fall foul of EU law, which would mean that it is rejected and we would have to go back to the drawing board.  We understand that this is emergency legislation, but it is very vague language for something that involves a very specific derogation from the EIA directive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#AA00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  As Senator Boylan is aware, the EIA directive continues to apply fully.  We cannot pass legislation in this House that overrides the directive in any way.  It must be compliant with the legislation.</p> <p>I understand the concern is that the proposal may appear to be open-ended or that it could be used to approve other developments or projects.  To be clear, what I am asking the House to approve is that the delivery of 450 MW of electricity generation for installation by next winter is considered to be an exceptional case for the purposes of Article 2(4) of the EIA directive and that alternative assessments can be carried out by the State.  The individual components of elements, which themselves are the subject of a procurement procedure run by EirGrid on foot of the emergency legislation we passed in the summer, the EirGrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022, will be the subject of a further assessment by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and approval by me.  The Oireachtas is not approving any development or granting a development consent.  There is an inextricable link between the preferred sites and the procurement process currently being concluded by EirGrid.  Given that this legislation is passing through the Houses while that process is concluding, it is only prudent that we would ensure it will not be necessary to go before the Houses again in the event that an alternative site is needed.  However, it is not open-ended, because as Senator Boylan states, there is a limited number of sites comprising existing power stations that can accommodate the capacity being proposed and supply the power to the grid when required.  While the contractual arrangements are being finalised, it is important that there is a fall-back position out of caution and out of planning.  The legislation specifies that the new generation capacity will be built at Tarbert and Shannonbridge, but there is a very small number of other sites that have the grid connection, are brownfield sites and have had recent environmental assessments that could possibly be used in the event that one of these sites cannot be used.</p> <p>What is important here is that we have sites available to accommodate this temporary generation and that we can move on those sites in the quickest way possible.  We are expecting to be able to commence construction before the end of the year.  The removal of the reference to "alternative appropriate sites" would unnecessarily restrict the application of the processes provided for in this Bill to the two named sites and would provide no back-up options for the State.  In that event, we would have to come back here again.  I am sure Senator Boylan would not thank us for coming back a third time.  The sites brought forward would be the subject of further assessments and public consultation.  The Commission will also be notified prior to the final approval being made in full compliance with the provisions of the EIA directive.  What is critical here is time.  I cannot concede to an amendment that would tie the State's hands to the detriment of its citizens.  I am satisfied that this approach is compliant with the EIA directive and I have sought the Attorney General's advice in this regard during the preparation of the Bill.  I appreciate that Senators may have their own interpretation, but for that reason I am not accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

Clearly, criteria were used in the assessment of the sites that could possibly be used for such a project.  The two that made it through the assessment made it for a reason.  The question is why the other sites did not make it.  Is it the case that they did not make the selection relevant to the EIA and the planning criteria?  That is our concern.  If two sites were above all the others as being most appropriate, yet we are now leaving it open to some of the other sites that were not judged to have made the mark, could those other sites be used if the two earmarked sites do not work out?  There is a concern if the process is open-ended because we do not know what the criteria were.  We asked the officials if they would share the criteria with us and they said they would but we still have not seen them.  What was it that made these two sites meet the mark and the others fail to do so, yet we are still leaving the door open to them?  Is that relevant to what we are trying to waive here in terms of the EIA and planning?</p></speech>

Another is that we must have a brownfield site that already has a power station on it.  We are looking for sites that have had recent environmental assessments carried out, which can help us with our future assessments and give us an idea that we are going to pass the environmental assessment.  We also want to consider whether we expect that this is going to be the shortest planning application process that is going to be required.  We have measured all of the sites on that basis.  We have come up with the two sites that we thought were best.  There is really only a very small number of sites that are possible, but it is all part of the same project.  It is normal in a project that the project has a scope, which is the delivery of 450 MW of power by the winter of 2023, and there is an available set of resources that may be used, but we do not want to limit ourselves whereby if anything goes wrong on the critical path the whole project stops and has to be restarted.</p></speech>

They relate to the insertion of an additional Oireachtas approval between the assessment of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the approval to be issued by the Minister.  I propose to reject these amendments as they would add an unnecessary step to the process that could delay the commencement of on-site works.</p> <p>The second amendment requires the Minister to only approve the designated development further to an additional process set out in amendment No. 3.  That process requires the movement of a resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas, with additional reports and conditionality over and above what is set out in the legislation.  I reiterate that the purpose of the legislation being proposed is to remove all unnecessary administrative steps so that the relevant approvals can be issued as soon as may be possible.  There is already a process available to the Minister to approve a proposed development to address an emergency under section 181(2)(a) of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has done this for a development at the North Wall power generation station.  What the Senators are proposing here goes beyond the existing provisions, and it would seem counterproductive to concede to such an amendment where time is of the essence.  What is proposed here is shorter than the one that is already on the Statute Book.  I have set out why that is necessary.</p> <p>I want to address some of the potential concerns.  The proposed legislation requires the Minister to arrange for an assessment of the proposed development in advance of approval.  This goes beyond the strict requirements of the EIA directive, whereby member states are required merely to consider whether an alternative form of assessment would be appropriate.  We will be carrying out the alternative form of assessment.  The assessment will be carried out, although it may happen in a phased manner, something that is suggested in the Commission guidance on this matter.  Moreover, provisions are included to comply with the birds and habitats directives to ensure Ireland complies with its obligations therein.  These are set out in section 6.  It is my intention to ensure there is public consultation on these assessments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=27"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I also draw the Senator's attention to section 7(1), under which the Minister is required to take into account the assessments of the board and any conditions recommended by it when approving a development.  It is the Minister's intention to do that.  During the debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday, it was claimed that the wording of section 7 meant the Minister did not have to take into account the assessment of the board.  I disagree with this assertion and note that the reference to "may" relates to the options the Minister has in terms of the types of decisions.  However, in coming to that decision, he or she must take into account the assessment of the board.</p><p>What the Senator is proposing goes beyond this and requires, in effect, that a second assessment be carried out by Members of both Houses.  In that regard, not only would the amendment add an unnecessary step to a process in which time is of the essence, but it would be a retrograde step in respect of powers already available to a Minister in the planning Acts.  I therefore reject these amendments.</p></speech>

It sets out that within six months of the passing of the Act, a post-enactment review of the legislation would take place.  This is the second time in a very short time that we have voted on emergency legislation in the House to deal with our crisis in electricity demand and power capacity.</p><p>Those of us who are members of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action are often very frustrated that there are even disputes between some of the actors involved in sorting out this crisis.  For example, we were told by EirGrid that growth in electricity demand of 9% was completely normal.  When we pressed for international and EU comparisons, it was shown that it was not normal and that average growth in electricity demand is between 0.5% and 1% annually.</p><p>We are calling for a post-enactment review so that we do not end up back in the House in another six months having to deal with another crisis in our electricity capacity.  It is not much to ask that we have a review.  It would give some sort of comfort to those of us who are uncomfortable with what we are being asked to do today but who feel we have no choice but to support the legislation.</p></speech>

I agree with this but the requirement to report to the committee within a specified timeframe is not necessary.  This is a project of critical national importance and every endeavour will be made to ensure it succeeds.</p> <p>The Minister brought the Bill before the Oireachtas in a public manner that demonstrates openness and a desire for cross-party support.  The Minister, EirGrid and the CRU have appeared before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action on the serious issue of energy security, and they will continue to do so.  Furthermore, the provisions of the Eirgrid, Electricity and Turf (Amendment) Act 2022 require that EirGrid report to the CRU on at least a quarterly basis on any measures taken pursuant to the Act, of which these measures are part.  The CRU is answerable to the joint committee in the performance of its functions and will be able to further inform the committee of the progress and implementation of this legislation.</p> <p>There is, therefore, no need to legislate for this in the Bill in such a specific and limiting manner.  The joint committee is entitled to ask about the progress of this or any other policy measure within my remit, and it is only right and proper that it does so.  Requiring this midway through the delivery process is unnecessarily binding.  I, therefore, reject the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is probably very much aware of the tensions between EirGrid and the CRU.  They are hardly speaking to each other.  It is not easy for the committee to get answers when both parties disagree about how we got to this point.  If we cannot include in legislation the provision of a post-enactment review after six months, we should at least have a debate, some sort of conversation or even a report back to the joint committee on how effective this legislation is and whether it is has been successful in achieving what we want.</p></speech>

As amendment No. 7 has been ruled out of order, this is the last amendment.  None of the amendments have been accepted so far.  I do not know what that means for this amendment but in any case I will get to the point quickly.  I ask that the following be inserted on page 7, after lines 25:</p> <blockquote> 	The Minister shall, within twelve months of the passing of this Act, produce a report detailing how Ireland shall adapt a grid-connected battery designed to increase grid stability under adverse weather conditions and energy shortages or outages similar to the Hornsdale Power Reserve Australia grid-connected energy storage system. </blockquote> <p>To keep my contribution short and stop me wandering off, I have prepared a few thoughts on the rationale for the amendment and conscious of how progressive Australia is in this regard.  It is using giant batteries, which the Minister of State will be familiar with, that pull energy from the grid at off-peak times, store it and push it back into the grid at peak times.  This would be a much better way to proceed given it could use renewable energy as opposed to the carbon-based fuels we hear so much about and on which the Minister's solution relies, with his recently announced new fleet of jet engines.</p><p>The Hornsdale battery concept is the most sustainable and ecologically friendly solution.  It would never have to be decommissioned unlike the turbines that run on the fossil fuels we hear so much about.  The battery would aim to prevent backlogs during a period of network instability by providing grid support services, capturing and storing excess energy from sources such as wind farms and feeding into the grid during peak times or periods of outages.</p><p>As I said, the Minister last week announced that a fleet of jet engines will be bought to add power to the country's energy supply if outages loom.  I understand the Minister has said he hopes some of the &euro;350 million it will cost to purchase these turbines might be recouped by their onward sale.  That is an interesting comment.</p><p>That is the rationale behind the amendment.  I am interested to hear the Minister of State's considered response.</p></speech>

I have raised the need to prioritise battery storage a couple of times at meetings of the joint committee.  In Britain, battery storage is now displacing gas-powered generation.  One of the concerns is about hybrid power plants for which we do not have the legislative framework, although it is part of the programme for Government.  I would like to see that progressed so that battery storage can replace fossil-fuel generated electricity capacity.</p> <p>Another area of concern is that this process is being controlled manually by the grid because the grid needs a software update to facilitate batteries providing that emergency capacity.  We know batteries take power from the grid to charge up and then put that power back into the grid.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-10-27a.269" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022102700002#CC00200"><p>It might be unexpected but I like this proposal.  However, I question its relevance to the provisions of the Bill.  This Bill is to provide for an exemption from the provisions of the environmental impact assessment, EIA, directive and for an alternative streamlined consenting process rather than determining particular types of storage technology.</p> <p>The Senators appear to be proposing a policy paper to be produced on battery storage.  I imagine that is to address issues they consider could contribute positively to the energy security issues that are at hand.  While I am rejecting the amendment, I would like to take the opportunity to address this particular policy area.  I hope I can reassure Senators that I share their concerns and interest in storage as a way to address these concerns.  Work is already under way to investigate this area.  The amendment is not, therefore, necessary.</p> <p>Electricity storage refers to an array of technologies with the ability to capture energy at one time for use at a later time.  Storage will play an essential role in the decarbonisation of the electricity sector because it can support the integration of high volumes of renewable generation and provide critical system services needed to manage a low-carbon electricity system.  It can also support security of supply by storing electricity during times of excess supply and releasing it during periods where there is a shortfall between supply and demand.</p> <p>Programme for Government: Our Shared Future contains a commitment to strengthen the policy framework to incentivise electricity storage.  Building on this, the climate action plan in 2021 included a commitment to develop a storage policy framework that supports the achievement of electricity emissions targets, namely, action No. 124.  My Department has committed to developing a storage policy that supports the 2030 Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, targets, with the policy to be published early next year.  A consultation on the new storage framework will commence very shortly.  In combination, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, will be reviewing the regulatory treatment of storage including licensing, charging and market incentives, which is to be completed by the end of 2023.</p> <p>However, it is also reported that a number of battery projects have been contracted via two mechanisms, that is, the single electricity market, SEM, capacity options and DS3 system services.  These routes offer different but essential services to the power system on the island of Ireland.  Therefore, while I am rejecting the amendment, I am sure the Senators will appreciate that policy work really is happening in this area.  A consultation is about to start and the report is due to be published at the start of next year.  I look forward to engaging with any Senators who wish to discuss the detail of it as it progresses.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has been given a script to read, which I respect; I know how this all works.  I welcome his comments regarding the need for a policy paper on battery storage.  As a matter of fact, I thought his commentary, or that of the civil servant which he read into the record, was quite positive and favourably disposed to the general rationale and concept I set out in the amendment.  I do not take the Minister of State's contribution as being a negative.  I thought it was very favourable and supportive.  As he said on the record of the House, he was just not in a position to accept it.  I accept that too.</p> <p>I welcome the idea and would like to see some sort of policy engagement in terms of battery storage.  When we look back on green policy, the Minister of State personally has been a strong advocate in this area of battery storage.  It is something his party has very much promoted in the past.  I ask him to perhaps provide detail on the public consultation.  Things are moving on.  As the Minister of State knows, we are on a political timetable with a countdown.  We are halfway through our term in office, or I should say the Government's term in office.</p> <p>Will the Minister of State take another look at or ask his officials to take on board Hornsdale and the Australian model?  I think it is a good one.  There is much information about it on the Internet.  It is worth looking at that particular model.  There is an important question around the whole issue of storage.  Senator Boylan also touched on a number of issues about storage that are pertinent, although they are not necessarily for today; we do not have that sort of time.</p> <p>I hear what the Minister of State is saying.  I do not doubt his commitment to the area but we need to have more consideration of this issue.  The Minister of State told us there will now be a public consultation, of which I was not aware.  I welcome that.  He might continue by telling us about the timelines for the public consultation he announced today.</p></speech>

It is very important to look at what is happening in other jurisdictions.  That is cutting-edge technology and we will certainly look at that.  Senator Boyhan should make those suggestions known when he is contributing to the public consultation, which I am sure he will.</p></speech>

The Senator will be familiar with Turlough Hill.  In total, in Ireland, we have 792 MW of storage.  Of that, 500 MW is from battery.  Therefore, we already have some battery storage in use.  Those batteries have an average duration of less than one hour providing system services.</p> <p>In addition to that, there is the 292 MW of pump storage at Turlough Hill, which provides system services to the grid and helps to balance the electricity supply and demand.  Based on current activity, the system operator tells us that by 2026, it expects to have an additional 400 MW of batteries to provide further capacity and storage to the all-island power system.</p> <p>I expect that the consultation will probably start within the next 30 days.  That is something for the Senator to look forward to.</p></speech>
