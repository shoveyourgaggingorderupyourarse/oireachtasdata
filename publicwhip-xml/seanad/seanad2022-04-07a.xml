I understand he is not responsible for this matter but I appreciate his ear and I am sure he will take the message back to the Minister for Education in this regard.</p> <p>Gaelscoileanna are the cornerstone of the spoken Irish language community in Ireland and against all odds have seen a welcome growth in our communities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de, Ros Com&aacute;in, is one such school that has seen a surge in enrolment since first opening its doors 22 years ago.  It was founded through the desire of parents and teachers for children to attend a Gaelscoil and to promote the spoken Irish language in our community.  Its principal, Orla N&iacute; Chuinneag&aacute;in, and her team of dedicated teachers and staff have continued a strong history of Irish language and culture in County Roscommon.  Education through the Irish language in the county is now represented solely by Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de, which is the last remaining school continuing our history of education through the medium of Irish.  Historically, during the Penal Laws of the 17th century, there were more hedge schools in County Roscommon than in any other county in Ireland.</p><p>The parents, teachers and students of Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de have long awaited the construction of a new purpose-built school that will reflect both the growth in demand for places and the present-day teaching needs of the primary school curriculum.  At present, the school is based in a converted residential building that is limited by non-purpose design, inadequate space and leasing agreements.  The good news is that there are plans for a new eight-classroom primary school building for Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de in the Government's large-scale capital programme, as part of a shared education campus for Roscommon town.  The parents and teachers would encourage this development, which still is at the planning stage, to move as quickly as possible.  It will be hugely beneficial to the students and for education in County Roscommon.  I know the Department is committed to dealing with this as quickly as possible but it does not address the current accommodation crisis.  A new school is a solution for the future but the children who are completing their primary education at this time are suffering because of inadequate space and the inability to provide all the facilities that are needed, which means they are losing out on part of the curriculum.  There must be action immediately to provide the new building.  It must not be pushed further into the future while valuable learning opportunities for young people are lost.</p><p>In addition, the Government must respond to the present needs of the children attending the school.  That is the point I really want to make today.  Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de needs two mainstream teachers.  There are seven children with special needs, with the current special needs assistant, SNA, allocation working out at 1.5.  This is way below what is needed.  The allocation is based on the school profile and an average figure for the country.  However, it is clear than an allocation of 1.5 is not adequate.  More SNAs and more mainstream teachers are needed.  I accept that the new campus will be a little way down the road.  It can be speeded up as much as possible and it is important that this be done.  Right now, however, the school needs extra teaching staff.  It would be a pity for the pupils who attend the Gaelscoil, and for those who promote Gaeilge, that they should be left behind in any way in the education system.</p><p>I have a number of questions for the Minister of State.  Why are Gaelscoileanna students currently in some of the largest classes in Europe?  Why are Gaelscoileanna not receiving additional special educational needs support, despite the benefit it offers to students?  Why are teacher resources based on only one variable, namely, student enrolment numbers?  There are a number of other points that I may refer to in response to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Madigan.  The Senator has raised a number of questions.  I wholeheartedly agree with him regarding the value of Gaelscoileanna.  My children are being educated in Gaelscoil Osra&iacute; in Kilkenny, which started off in a prefabricated building and now has more than 500 pupils.  It is a hugely successful school and does a fantastic job of passing on our language through education.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, wants to stress that enabling students with additional needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is an ongoing priority for the Government.  She assures the Senator that students with special educational needs attending schools, including Gaelscoileanna, are treated in an equitable and fair way in regard to the allocation of special education teacher hours and SNA provision.  All schools have access to a similar range of supports.  Each child has unique skills and characteristics and it is vital that we ensure our schools and school staff have the resources and knowledge they need to provide a flexible and tailored approach to supporting all children, particularly those with additional needs.</p> <p>The Department of Education funds a continuum of education provision for children with special educational needs.  This extends from a placement in a mainstream class with the necessary additional teaching and care supports provided, through to a placement in a special class or special school.  The policy aims to ensure students with special educational needs are educated alongside their peers where that is possible and appropriate.  This approach is in the best interests of all children, including those with special needs.  In Ireland, most children with special educational needs are educated in mainstream settings.  That is the right way to do it.  In circumstances where children and young people with special educational needs require more specialised interventions, a special class or special school places are provided.  These settings cater for children with the most complex needs and attract much reduced ratios of teachers and SNAs to pupils, depending on the nature of the disability.  The nature and level of the educational response, including placement in a special class or school setting, is based on the professionally assessed needs of each individual child.</p> <p>This continuum of special education has been prioritised by the Government in recent years.  This year, the Department of Education will spend in excess of &euro;2 billion, or more than 25% of its total budget, on providing additional teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs.  This represents an increase of over 60% in total expenditure since 2011.  Significant additional investment in new teacher and SNA posts is provided for in 2022, which will expand provision across the continuum of special education.  There is provision for 287 additional special classes, with 1,700 new places for the 2022-23 school year.  This will bring the total number of special classes to 2,435.  An additional 1,165 SNAs will be allocated to provide support to children with special educational needs, bringing the total number of SNAs to 19,169 by the end of December.  There is provision for 980 new teaching posts in special education.  There now are more than 14,000 special education teachers, SETs, in schools, who support the inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream classes.  Two new special schools have opened in Cork and Dublin this year, with a further new special school announced for Rochestown in Cork for the 2022-23 school year.</p> <p>The Department works closely with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to ensure children with special educational needs receive an education.  A network of special educational needs organisers, SENOs, who are located across the country, are working closely with families and young people to access suitable school placements.  I will follow up with the Senator on the other issues he raised.  He asked about a new-build project, which is not really addressed in this response.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that he is answering on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  To be fair to both of them, I raised an additional issue in inquiring about the shortage of space and the plans for a new build.  My question really was around the current shortage of teachers to deal with the number of students and the need to ensure all children get a fair crack of the whip in terms of education, particularly in Gaelscoileanna.  Perhaps I should not have mixed up two separate issues.</p> <p>The Minister of State noted that the Department of Education is allocating 25% of its budget, amounting to &euro;2 billion in expenditure, to additional teaching care supports for children with special educational needs.  However, as I said, the allocation is based on a school's profile and is taken as an average for the country.  Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de has seven children with special needs and an allocation of 1.5 SNAs.  The school unquestionably needs at least one additional SNA.  There must be a little flexibility in this regard.  I intend to continue this fight and to talk directly to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister, Deputy Foley.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for coming to the House to listen to my case and to take the message back to his colleagues.</p></speech>

I will discuss with her the additional resources he is requesting, as I am sure he also will do.</p> <p>The Senator also raised the issue of capital expenditure and the new campus to which he referred, which is critically important.  As I said, looking at the expansion of Gaelscoil Osra&iacute; and other Gaelscoileanna across the country, they tend to start off small and then the demand for places grows.  It is fantastic to see it.  Similarly, Gaelscoil de h&Iacute;de will, with the support of the Department, continue to grow.</p></speech>

I also compliment the others who contributed.  It was a moving day and our hearts go out to the poor people of Ukraine.  Bualadh bos duit.</p> <p>The serious issue of the continuous underfunding of roads over the past decade has been raised on an almost monthly basis by councillors in Monaghan, Cavan and many other parts of rural Ireland.  In Monaghan, Councillors P.J. O'Hanlon and Seamus Coyle in particular have consistently raised the issue of the underfunding of local and regional roads.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we in County Monaghan do not have any multinational, so it has been down to the good people of the county to create their own employment through indigenous enterprises in agriculture, including agrifood, and engineering.  It is a unique situation, given the number of small enterprises that are located up boreens and small local roads that are connected to regional roads.  These local and regional roads are essential so that businesses can get their goods to the marketplace.</p> <p>Like many other counties, Monaghan and Cavan are unique in the large proportion of their populations living in rural areas.  Many people, including parents taking their kids to school in the morning and people travelling to and from work, are travelling on substandard roads.  While those roads have received funding, the amount of which has increased in recent years, that funding is not adequate to address the roads' condition.  Monaghan has had no rail service since 1958, so the road network is the only show in town for people who have to get to and from their workplaces and for their social needs.</p> <p>While I welcome the increased allocations, we will get fewer kilometres of road done throughout Ireland because inflation in the cost of materials is on the rise.  The Government needs to take this point into consideration.</p> <p>These small enterprises are dependent on the road network to get their goods and supplies to and from the marketplace.  The road network is also critical for communities in getting from A to B.  In many cases, roads are the only show in town.  There is no doubt that increased funding is a must.  We have been calling for it for years.  Funding was cut in previous years, and while I am glad that the allocations have increased recently, much more needs to be done.</p> <p>I welcome the Government's announcement on the local improvement scheme, LIS, two days ago.  A total of &euro;11 million has been allocated across the country, but it is inadequate to address the situation at hand.  For example, County Monaghan will receive &euro;351,000 while Cavan will receive &euro;371,000.  In Monaghan, there is a list of 131 lanes to be done.  Some of them have been on what's called an historical list since 2005.  While we are grateful for the &euro;351,000, it will only do approximately five lanes.  There are 13 people on the historical list who will be waiting the guts of 20 years to get their lanes done.  That is not good enough.  I welcome the funding, but this is another illustration of how more needs to be done.  For rural Ireland, there is no other show in town.  We have no rail or Luas.  We need the local road network to get by.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-04-07a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022040700002#C00300"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis on Seanad&oacute;ir as ucht an cheist seo a ard&uacute;.  I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  The Senator made a good case for small enterprises in County Monaghan.  Such SMEs are just as critical to our economy as the multinationals.  They provide employment for small numbers of people - five to ten employees - and this has a positive knock-on effect on families, employability and rural development in their areas.  The Senator also raised the issue of inflation, and while the LIS is welcome, it will never cover what is needed across the country.  It is always oversubscribed.</p> <p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on these roads are funded from councils' own resources, supplemented by State road grants, where applicable.</p> <p>The major cuts to funding for regional and local roads during the post-2008 recession resulted in the build-up of a substantial backlog of works across the country, which the Senator referenced.  The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion.  Due to the pressures on regional and local road networks, approximately 90% of available Exchequer grant assistance to local authorities for regional and local roads is being directed to maintenance and renewal works.  This is vital.</p> <p>While funding is not at a level that would allow the backlog of roadworks across the country to be addressed, there have been significant increases in Exchequer grants for regional and local roads in the recent years.  The 2022 allocation for regional and local roads is approximately &euro;597 million - &euro;46 million in current expenditure and &euro;551 million in capital expenditure.  This represents an increase of approximately 46% compared to 2017.</p> <p>The main regional and local road grant programmes are targeted at the following specific policy objectives: pavement sealing to protect the road surface from water damage under the restoration maintenance grants; road strengthening based on pavement condition rating to lengthen the life of road pavements under the restoration improvement grants; and a discretionary grant that allows for a range of activities, including pothole repairs, edge strengthening, renewal of signs and lines, and winter maintenance.  These three grant programmes account for most of the grant funding and are allocated based primarily on the length of the road network in a particular local authority area.</p> <p>Within the available budget, the Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads funding is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities.  In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility, with some account taken of traffic.  It is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on this basis.</p> <p>Basing regional and local roads grant allocations on road conditions could result in an uneven distribution of Exchequer funding.  For example, local authorities that allocate higher levels of own resource funding to regional and local roads will have a larger proportion of roads with a higher condition rating than those with lower levels of own resource funding.  Basing allocations on road condition could, therefore, disincentivise local authorities from allocating own resource funding to roads maintenance.</p> <p>The Department appreciates that, within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programmes to allow for this.  It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.  In this context, the Department has supported the development of a road asset management system for regional and local roads &ndash; MapRoad - to provide the data needed for each local authority to manage its network as effectively as possible, including the prioritisation of works for inclusion in its maintenance and renewal works programme.  The road pavement condition information generated by the MapRoad system forms the basis for the National Oversight and Audit Commission's performance reports each year.</p> <p>While this reply does not entirely satisfy all of the questions raised by the Senator, I hope that he appreciates this year's increased allocation for local and regional roads.</p></speech>

By all means, I welcome any funding that is provided to a local authority, as it is needed.  I have made the case for many counties in rural Ireland, but particularly counties Monaghan and Cavan.</p> <p>In many ways, it is a false economy not to keep roads at a certain standard.  If adequate funding is not allocated to local authorities, the road network will get worse and it will ultimately take more money to repair it.  The Minister of State can appreciate that there is a case for increased funding.  For counties like Monaghan and Cavan, roads are the only show in town because there is no other mode of travel.  It is essential that they be maintained to an adequate level.  I ask that the Minister of State take that point back to the Minister.</p> <p>An invitation has been issued to the Minister by the elected members of Monaghan County Council to visit the county and see at first hand the black spots in question.  If the Minister of State also passed on that invitation on my behalf, I would welcome it.</p></speech>

There is a significant increase in capital moneys from the Department, but I am sure the local authority will be innovative in trying to find solutions at a local level.

I am delighted he is here to answer the question because it relates to the mid-Shannon wilderness park, which I am sure he is familiar with.  The issue is Bord na M&oacute;na promised that once it had finished removing peat, the bog would be handed back to the community.  After spending generations harvesting peat, the local community decided it wanted a network of bogs that would be turned into a wilderness park.  This was supported by the Longford senior planner in 2013.  Mr. P&aacute;draic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust has made a wonderful podcast on this issue, including the history of the plans for the wilderness park and the potential richness of its biodiversity.  In the episode, he reviews the original plan for the wilderness park and describes what needs to happen.</p> <p>In short, very little needs to be done on this site.  A modest amount of intervention is sometimes needed to retain water in shallow lakes.  Wilderness requires that we keep our hands off and let an ecological equilibrium that is in tune with the altered conditions establish itself.  Left to their own devices, or rewilded, these cutaway bogs would generally flood once the pumps are switched off and, as the Minister of State knows, quickly revert to scenic areas with reeds and birch trees colonising them.  In the process, we turn the bog from a carbon source to a carbon sink.  We all know that if biodiversity is given the space it needs, it will flourish.  The local community and economy would have a wonderful amenity they would be able to enjoy it, in addition to a tourism industry to sustain them.</p> <p>The reason I raise this matter is the community was shocked to hear that Bord na M&oacute;na's plan for that site was to build a wind farm on it.  While there is lots of misinformation about wind turbines killing birds, the types of birds that would use this particular site are cranes, white-tailed eagles and whooper swans.  Wind farms would be a threat to them.  Furthermore, when wind turbines are installed, the water must continue to be pumped, which results in net carbon emissions.</p> <p>We know Bord na M&oacute;na withdrew its original application on this site.  It was before a judicial review.  I understand the reason Bord na M&oacute;na withdrew the application was it knew it was going to lose but, unfortunately, we now hear there is a strong possibility it will submit a new plan for a wind farm.  It has been pumping water off the site throughout the winter, despite the high biodiversity value of the area.  I recommend anybody to follow the Mid Shannon Wilderness Park social media account.  One will see the place is a hive of activity when it comes to wildlife.</p> <p>The crux of the question is that I urge the Minister of State to intervene now before the planning application is submitted to ensure the original proposal for the wilderness park goes ahead.  The mid-Shannon park would go some way towards mitigating our climate and biodiversity crisis.  Why is Bord na M&oacute;na pumping water off this site?  I ask the Minister of State to directly intervene regarding that site and to support the community in its plans.  As part of the just transition, it wants to see a wilderness park on this site.  That is a win-win for everybody in terms of climate change, biodiversity and just transition.  Why is Bord na M&oacute;na continuing to pump the land?  Will the Minister of State intervene to ensure the mid-Shannon wilderness park, which is in the peatlands strategy, goes ahead?</p></speech>

I will set out the vision of Ireland's national peatlands strategy, which is "to provide a long-term framework within which all of the peatlands within the State can be managed responsibly in order to optimise their social, environmental and economic contribution to the well-being of this and future generations".  The strategy sets out a cross-governmental approach to managing issues that relate to peatlands, including compliance with relevant national and international environmental legislation, climate change, forestry, water quality, flood control, energy, nature conservation and restoration, land use planning and agriculture.  It is underlined by 25 key principles and commits to undertaking 32 actions across various sectors and themes including, among others, tourism, agriculture, forestry, conservation, energy, water quality and climate change.  The strategy was developed in partnership between relevant Departments, State bodies and key stakeholders through the Peatlands Council.</p> <p>The strategy was established to cover the period 2015 to 2025 and included provision for a mid-term review.  The original principles and actions of the strategy were a positive attempt to stake out a plan in a rapidly changing context, with the understanding that circumstances were evolving and that goals and actions would need to be updated to match them.  It was always intended to be a living document.  The purpose of the mid-term review is, therefore, to provide a broader assessment on where the strategy currently is, what it can achieve over the coming years and, if necessary, to propose changes to the actions set out in the strategy to refocus it in line with its overall goals and the current context.</p> <p>Internal drafting and consultations began in 2020 on the review with stakeholders consulted in the preparation of a draft mid-term review document.  A public consultation on the mid-term review concluded at the end of June 2021, with a sizeable number of submissions received from individuals and bodies involved in the sector.  The review proposes that the actions set out in the strategy be updated into a new implementation plan, which focuses on refining outstanding actions and prioritising measurable, achievable objectives.  It is intended that the annual progress report will be published at the end of June 2022, with the outcome of the review published, subject to Government approval, shortly thereafter.</p> <p>One of the strategy's actions relates to the consideration of the creation of a national peatlands park.  My Department intends to undertake a feasibility assessment this year that would inform the establishment of such a park and examine existing and potential visitor facilities in the ownership of public, semi-State and voluntary bodies, such as the mid-Shannon wilderness park.  The strategy also sets out the principles for the after-use of industrial cutover peatlands, climate change and the restoration and rehabilitation of sites.  As part of just transition, under the enhanced decommissioning, rehabilitation and restoration scheme sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and regulated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department, with Bord na M&oacute;na acting as the operators of the scheme, 33,000 ha of Bord na M&oacute;na peatlands that had peat extracted for electricity generation will be rehabilitated.  The rehabilitation will take place on 82 bogs over a five-year period.  Funding of &euro;108 million is allocated for this scheme under the climate action fund but, subsequently, full funding was secured from the EU recovery and resilience facility.</p> <p>It is my understanding that some mid-Shannon bogs, such as parts of Derryadd Bog and the Mountdillon Bog group, are included in scheme.  I further understand that if the operator intends to sell, charge or carry out any development or economic activity on rehabilitated peatlands, it must first provide substitute lands with equivalent benefits as the original and to the satisfaction of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, as regulator.  Any proposed development on peatlands will be subject, as required, to the planning process, associated environmental assessments and public participation mechanisms required under national and EU environmental law.  Considerations regarding the use of peatlands are also an integral part of the current national land use review being undertaken as part of the programme for Government to ensure that optimal land use options inform all relevant Government decisions.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the reference to the operator, if it intends to sell, charge or carry out any development, being required to provide substitute lands with equivalent benefits because this site is already proving its value.  Even if the national peatlands strategy is a living document, principle 16 states "cutaway bogs that flood naturally ... be permitted to flood unless there is a clear environmental and/or economic case to maintain pumped drainage".  In addition, principle 18 states, "Environmentally, socially and economically viable options should be analysed to plan the future use of industrial cutaway[s] ... in conjunction with limiting factors as outlined in Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s Strategic Framework for the Future Use of Peatlands".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is concerning if there is any hint that Bord na M&oacute;na will just substitute this location with another location because all we need to do is stop the pumping of the water.  This site is an amenity for the local community and its biodiversity is thriving.  That is a concern for me.</p></speech>

This is a matter for Bord na M&oacute;na, which is a semi-State company.  Our involvement is through the national peatlands strategy.  The ultimate goal of the National Parks and Wildlife Service is to achieve the maximum value of biodiversity for Ireland.  We have major objectives as regards nature under the next national biodiversity action plan.  The specific issues raised are largely a matter for Bord na M&oacute;na.  The engagement between Bord na M&oacute;na and the mid-Shannon wilderness park group is vital for that group.  We all want to achieve the same objectives for nature and it is critically important that any proposals that are made are subject to all the environmental rigours that any other project would be subject to, particularly where there are such environmental and biodiversity sensitivities.</p></speech>

Based on statistics from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in 2016, some 143,178 people were renting in Ireland.  There will most likely be an increase in this number after the current census figures come out some time next year.  The number of people renting is rising, with more apartment complex developments and build-to-rent schemes.  These people, however, need to be protected during any disputes that may arise.  Landlords also need support if they have any difficulties with tenants.</p> <p>The Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, was established through the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to act as a service to mediate and provide dispute resolution between landlords and tenants.  If someone is living beside a rented property and has an issue, the RTB can also assist him or her through mediation and appeals.  The role of the RTB is to be an independent body, providing both support and knowledge for tenants and landlords and ensuring both parties know their rights and responsibilities.  Unfortunately, the RTB has been poorly promoted with many tenants and landlords not being aware of the board or its function.  Moreover, many landlords and tenants are contacting their local county councils regarding disputes.  County councillors are not trained in mediation and can unfortunately only do so much to help with issues raised by those renting or letting.</p> <p>The RTB has also experienced a shortfall in resources in recent years, with many cases taking a significant amount of time to be solved.  I can personally attest to such a case.  We had an issue when someone moved into a rental property beside my house and we were asked to go that route with the RTB.  To be honest, I would not go that route again.  I had to go the legal route because it was the only way to solve the issue we had, which ended up in court.  Renters and landlords need to be made aware of the board, particularly those not from Ireland who may not know who they can contact if they are experiencing an issue.  The RTB needs more power and adequate resources to deal with any disputes that may come before it.  The number of people renting is increasing dramatically every year and both landlords and tenants need to be aware of the role of the RTB in the rental sector.</p> <p>Along with my colleague, Councillor Deirdre Forde from Cork, I am working on drafting a Bill that will provide an adequate mediation service for homeowners experiencing neighbourhood nuisance.  This Bill will require that the Legal Aid Board provide mediation services to resolve neighbours&rsquo; disputes as many people are unable to afford the high costs of the court system if they have to go down that route.  Mediation is extremely important as both parties can co-operate and avoid unnecessary conflict or even court proceedings.  However, there still need to be more resources allocated to the RTB.  Many people do not want to use the RTB, including me in my case were it to happen again in the future, due to the backlog of disputes which is leading to more court cases and creating another backlog in the legal system.  We have established a board to prevent disputes going to court but we need to allocate more resources to it and ensure it has adequate power to deal with those disputes.</p></speech>

It is important that young people get to see our democracy in action.  I thank them for being with us.</p> <p>The RTB was established as an independent statutory body under the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 to operate a national tenancy registration system and facilitate the resolution of disputes between landlords and tenants.  The RTB is quasi-judicial and its mediators, adjudicators and tribunal members have independent decision-making powers in the same way as a judge.  The RTB replaces the courts for the vast majority of landlord and tenant disputes.  It can award damages for breaches of obligations under the Residential Tenancies Acts of up to &euro;20,000.  Since July 2019, Part 7A of the Acts, on complaints, investigations and sanctions, provides the RTB with enhanced powers of investigation and sanction in respect of improper conduct by a landlord.  Where it is found that a landlord has committed improper conduct the sanction imposed can be a written caution and a fine of up to &euro;15,000 and up to &euro;15,000 in costs, or both.  The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 are kept under constant review and any necessary legislation will be introduced to enhance their efficiency and effectiveness.</p> <p>The RTB was allocated &euro;11 million in Exchequer funding for 2021, an increase of &euro;2 million on the previous year to reflect the expansion of the RTB's core functions as a result of new powers and functions conferred on it in 2019.  In order to ensure that the RTB continues to be fully resourced to deliver on its mandate, &euro;11 million was secured to fund the RTB's operational costs in 2022.  Following recommendations in the RTB workforce plan for 2018 to 2021 and engagement with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the RTB has received sanction for an additional 41 staff since 2019 to ensure that its enhanced powers and the new legislative provisions are fully implemented and enforced.  This includes the sanctions granted in 2021 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for two new full-time permanent senior posts at principal officer level and also for the remuneration of the director or CEO, to be set at assistant secretary level.  The director was previously remunerated at the salary equivalent of principal officer.  The authorised staff complement for the RTB is now 106.4 whole-time equivalents.  The Department continues to engage with the RTB to guarantee that it has the funds and staffing it requires to effectively discharge its functions in the residential rental sector.</p></speech>

It is frustrating for landlords, tenants and neighbours that when they engage they are looking at a two-year process, which is not acceptable.  Is it possible to get a review of the figures that have been sanctioned and to find out what the current position is?  Have these principal officer and staff level positions been filled?  Can we get a report on where we are with regard to the number of disputes that have been logged and settled and the length of time it takes for them to go through the process?  If it is going to take two to three years to settle a dispute, that is not acceptable.  I would be grateful if those figures could be provided and if the report on that could be forwarded to me.  I am also hopeful that when I come with the Bill I mentioned, which we have been working on with the Bills Office and drafters, it will be supported.  I forgot to say hello to the students who have joined us.  I will say goodbye to them and I hope they enjoy their day here.</p></speech>

It is not just for the people of Dublin 15 and west Dublin, whom I work for, but for the whole country.  People came to the park for the visit of the Pope in 1979, which was my first visit.  They come to visit Jinpa, the red panda, in Dublin Zoo.  They come to play GAA or cricket, which is the fastest growing sport in west Dublin.  They use it for a weekly walk.  The Phoenix Park is not your average park and there are very strongly held views about how the park is managed.  It is a busy, living and breathing park, and we want it to be used and enjoyed.  We must also ensure it is protected as a home for biodiversity and nature.  It requires a balance of needs and those needs have changed over the past decade, and need to change further, based on our sustainability and climate change agendas.</p> <p>The transport and mobility study last year gave us an opportunity to debate and discuss the changes required and the needs of the park.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Minister listened to people who said they want better and safer cycling facilities and walking trails and paths, and better and safer links to the park, including by public transport.  They do not want the park to be used only as a commuter highway into town or as an all-day car park for commuters.  Can we please not throw the baby out with the bathwater?</p> <p>Every week, I receive voicemail messages from older people who used to use Chesterfield Avenue, which runs the length of the park, for parking to access walks in areas that are unspoiled and are not congested.  They cannot find places to park anymore.  They need alternatives to be able to enjoy the park and spread out across it.</p> <p>I thank the OPW for its engagement with Dublin Zoo to address its parking needs.  Additional spaces have been provided on North Road.  Councillor Siobh&aacute;n Shovlin from Castleknock has suggested age-friendly spaces and says the needs of our elderly are not being addressed.  I agree with her.  We need alternatives and more information about how people can access parking.  Perhaps an application could tell people where car parking is available across the various pockets of the park.</p> <p>I would like to hear about the progress of the trial for a bus to run from Heuston Station to the Cabra gate.  I believe that, as part of the trial, it was found that the bus did not fit through the gate.  I reiterate the views of the community, who would prefer a shuttle bus that brings people to all different parts of the park.  We should consider a dedicated and climate-friendly electric bus to bring people all over the park.</p> <p>The 30 km/h speed limit on Chesterfield Avenue is not working.  I am all for such a speed limit, especially in densely-populated areas such as estates, where there are volumes of children.  That would apply to certain areas of the park but Chesterfield Avenue is a straight road on which people are highly alert and enjoying the scenery around them.  Drivers are trying to observe the 30 km/h speed limit but with the best will in the world, they are not doing so.  This is where people get frustrated.  We are trying to bring them on a green and sustainable journey with us, as we need to.  When people see things like that speed limit, it frustrates them.  The limit is not workable or practical for people and is putting them off.  Can we be green and practical?</p> <p>We have heard loud and clear from the OPW that cars are not welcome in the park but that also affects people who visit the park.  The OPW has tried to close three of the gates to exiting traffic and is not providing alternative parking spaces.  The 30 km/h speed limit is not workable for cars.  The OPW is telling us that cars are not welcome but when there are not sufficient public transport links, it is telling us that people are not welcome.  There is a fear that the OPW is working alone and not with county councils.  When the OPW makes decisions, it impacts on the surrounding communities and the county councils are having to deal with those impacts.  We want co-operation.  Everybody wants to reduce car use and traffic but the OPW must work with the area, as has been said by Councillor Colm O'Rourke of Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

The Senator has outlined the challenges facing this hugely popular resource for the people of Dublin.  It is one of the largest public parks in Europe, as far as I am aware.  It is important that the park should be a living, breathing space for everyone, and for all other species, including exotic species, that occupy the park.  It is critical that we get this right.</p> <p>I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, who is deeply committed to ensuring that the sustainable use of the park continues into the future.  The post-consultation report for the Phoenix Park transport and mobility study was launched last summer.  The consultation process saw over 2,200 people engage with the OPW on their vision for the Phoenix Park.  The Phoenix Park transport and mobility options study recognised the diverse and complex functions that the park serves, including its historic landscape, biodiversity habitats, visitor attractions and recreational spaces, along with its significant institutions and places of work.</p> <p>The study proposed that the recommendations would be undertaken in three phases over the next seven years.  Within the study, five common themes emerged in the areas of walking and cycling; access, gates and roads; public transport; movement within the park; and public consultation.  The study proposed that the recommendations will be undertaken in three phases over the next seven years.  I am proud that works are well advanced for the projects identified in phase 1. </p> <p>A pilot study has been implemented for nine months for culs-de-sac on the North Road and Upper Glen Road.  This commenced on Monday, 28 February 2022.  The North Road has new road markings and signage, and is operating a one-way system in the city direction only.  The OPW has erected signage at both entrances to the Upper Glen Road notifying motorists of this.  Bollards delineating the cul-de-sac have been installed to allow cyclists, wheelchairs and people with buggies access.  In addition, there are two cycle lanes clearly marked on the North Road.</p> <p>The design and plans for the 8 km permanent one-directional cycle lanes along both sides of Chesterfield Avenue, linking Castleknock to the city, are currently being advanced with the National Transport Authority and Dublin City Council.  Baseline topographical surveys are currently being undertaken.  The OPW has installed traffic lane separators along the entire length of Chesterfield Avenue, on both sides of the road, providing a safer environment for cyclists.  More than 8 km of temporary cones have been removed and these new durable and strong lane separators will ensure a safer experience for both cyclists and vehicles using Chesterfield Avenue.  In addition, more than 40 new bike stands have been installed throughout the park, with another 70 planned for 2022.</p> <p>A 30 km/h speed limit was implemented in the park on 28 February.  The reduction of the speed limit for all traffic will preserve the park as an access route to Dublin, while safely accommodating access for all.  I take on board the points opposing it but it is critical that the 30 km/h limit be retained.  It was introduced in the interests of public safety and there has been a significant reduction of speeds within the park with a noticeable change in driver behaviour, which is what this is all about.  Drivers may not slow to a speed of 30 km/h but they are keeping their speed lower, which is critical.  It makes the park a safer place for all visitors.  While there may be some frustration regarding this reduction in speed, studies have shown that lower speeds reduce the risk of fatalities dramatically.  It should be noted that when motorists exit the park towards the city, the same 30 km/h speed limit applies.  This speed limit has been adopted in many other urban areas across Europe, including in cities in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, not only for safety reasons, but to reduce noise, air pollution and CO2 emissions.</p> <p>Parking remains a concern in the park.  There are approximately 2,000 dedicated parking spaces available for the public to use.  These include five car parks linked to Chesterfield Avenue and all of these car parks are served by surfaced footpaths traversing the park.  As part of the pilot one-way scheme on the North Road, the OPW has created further car parking spaces to facilitate visitors to the park and visitors to Dublin Zoo.  The OPW is undertaking a parking strategy for the park.  A commencement meeting is due to take place later this week with the appointed consultants.  This six-month study will include a baseline review, identify options, undertake public consultation and make a series of recommendations.</p></speech>

People want to make the park work for everybody.  I have noticed a decrease in speed and I accept that, overall, things are improving.  However, people should not be penalised for not observing the 30 km/h limit.</p><p>I do not know where the 2,000 parking spaces are.  I welcome the parking strategy.  Perhaps the issue is around communications, but the frustration is there.  Elderly people and people who are not mobile need to be able to access the park in the way that they could before.  It is brilliant that we are progressing on active travel, but we also have to make sure visitors who want to enjoy the park are able to do so and, most important, that they feel welcome in the park.  At the moment, communities are telling me they do not feel welcome.</p></speech>

I did not respond to the issue the Senator raised around the shuttle bus.  We have implemented similar schemes in Glenveagh National Park, and we are looking at this because there are increased visitor numbers across our parks.  The National Transport Authority is reviewing bus options for a pilot bus route linking the Phoenix Park to Heuston and Broombridge stations.  That might be an option.</p> <p>The Minister and the Office of Public Works are deeply committed to ensuring that the Phoenix Park is for everybody and that people can access it and feel safe in it.  That is critically important for people of all ages.  Long-stay commuter parking, as well as high levels of illegal parking around the perimeter of the park, were identified as major issues in the transport and mobility study.  Therefore, those issues have to be addressed.  We have to look at this outside the context of the park itself and look at parking options as well.  We want the park to be a sustainable place for everybody to enjoy.  It is a huge amenity for the people of Dublin.  As I said, the Minister of State, Deputy Donovan, is committed to ensuring the park is available for everybody to enjoy.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State will be aware, the Curragh is a jewel in the crown of Kildare.  It is something we are truly proud of as Lilywhites.  It is incumbent upon us as political leaders to ensure we do everything in our power to protect the Curragh's heritage and ecological value and ensure we use it to its fullest potential.</p> <p>The Curragh is home to the Army, the racing industry and, of course, many sheep.  Many hundreds of years ago, it was also home to Fionn mac Cumhaill and the Fianna, and of course St. Brigid.  It is a place of great importance from an ecological, archaeological and cultural perspective, with the film "Braveheart" having been filmed there.  It is a great place for local people in which to walk and enjoy as it is bordered by Kildare, Newbridge, Milltown, Athgarvan, Kilcullen, and Rathangan.  During the two years of Covid, it provided a great leisure facility for people.  Local people have a great respect for it.  For this and many other reasons, it should have the highest level of protection, while affording the opportunity for people, both locally and nationally, to enjoy its beautiful surroundings.  We should seek UNESCO world heritage status for the Curragh because it is an important focal point in County Kildare.  Some months ago, I also raised a Commencement matter on this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  UNESCO world heritage status is the Holy Grail we should aim for.</p> <p>The Curragh has its own unique administrative arrangements enshrined in law, in the Curragh of Kildare Act 1961.  For several years, there have been ongoing issues with illegal dumping and encampments on the Curragh.  These completely take away from its beauty for those who wish to use it daily and can deter people from utilising a local amenity.  Earlier this week, there was an illegal encampment of 25 caravans.  I thank Inspector James Molloy for his help in ensuring the group in question was disbanded, but we must do more in this regard.</p> <p>In July 2021, there were a number of online focus group workshops on the Curragh Plains.  These were initiated by the director of services at Kildare County Council, Joe Boland, and the Department of Defence.  The Paul Hogarth Company was also involved.  It undertook a conservation management plan and a branding, wayfinding and interpretation plan for the Curragh Plains.  Such was the interest that 4,000 people responded.  There is significant scope in that work to secure the long-term viability of the Curragh.  The aim of the project is to help protect and conserve the special status of this landscape, manage more effectively the diverse yet critical uses of the plains and realise the Curragh's potential as a destination of value to locals and visitors alike.</p> <p>I have been calling and lobbying for many years to see the Curragh designated national heritage status, and I believe such a designation would further protect the Curragh in the longer term.  It is a truly unique landscape and a wonderful amenity.  It was used as a meeting site during pre-Christian societies.  The Curragh is shrouded in a mist of mythology.  It has a close connection with the Hill of Allen as well as St. Brigid.</p> <p>The 5,000 acres of the Curragh are under the care and protection of the Department of Defence and it is considered to be the oldest and most extensive such tract in Europe.  It provides the setting for one of Ireland&rsquo;s most significant prehistoric landscapes.  There is no doubt of its significance or potential.  However, we need to do more to protect this vital heritage site.  We have seen unacceptable levels of dumping and fly-tipping, as well as significant damage at key sites such as the Gibbet Rath.  That is wholly unacceptable.  I am pleased that the circular economy Bill will pave the way for use of CCTV to detect and deter illegal dumping and littering, and I am hopeful that this will be utilised to protect the Curragh.  What will the Government do to help that process?</p></speech>

The Minister has asked me to convey his regrets to the House that he could not be here and has specifically asked me to reassure the Senator that in both his current role and as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who oversaw the development of newly constructed racing stadium, he has a keen appreciation of and affinity with the Curragh.</p> <p>Needless to say, as a local Deputy for the area, I am passionate about the Curragh Plains, as I know the Senator is.  We are acutely aware of the huge potential that exists but also the challenges in terms of its ongoing management on a day-to-day basis.</p> <p>The affinity we have is not just based on the military, sheep or horse racing sectors.  The Government is keen to see those activities continue, but it is important that the 5,000 acres of unique grassland, as a place of significant natural beauty, should be protected for generations to come.  To that end, the Department of Defence together with Kildare County Council have embarked on a unique collaboration aimed at finding a way forward in addressing the many challenges involved in managing and developing the Curragh Plains.</p> <p>The key objectives of this collaborative work are to implement best practice to protect the landscape, care for its natural qualities and uniqueness while balancing the needs of its different users and potentially improve the recreational and educational value of the Curragh as a resource to local people, while also increasing visitor numbers on a sustainable basis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Martin Heydon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2286"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2286&amp;amp;pid=MartinHeydon&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Obviously that would of huge benefit to the local south Kildare economy.</p><p>A public consultation process commenced in March 2021 which, given Covid restrictions, was conducted through the Curragh Plains website.  The response, as the Senator has touched on, was phenomenal.  Over 3,600 responses were received thus demonstrating the strength of feeling about the Curragh Plains.  This was followed by a series of targeted virtual workshops with various stakeholders, which involved several Members of both Houses as well as local councillors.  The Minister has asked me to thank all of them for their participation.</p><p>In terms of the next steps, a conservation management plan for the Curragh Plains is due to be submitted to the Department of Defence and Kildare County Council in the coming weeks.  That will be followed by an interpretation and branding plan that is centred around the potential development of the plains as a cultural and amenity attraction.  I, like many others, look forward to exploring these reports in depth and the potential they have for the improved management of the Curragh Plains from a conservation perspective, and into the future.</p><p>While the study is scheduled for completion by June 2022, the Minister is prepared to see the deadline extended if needed as it is essential that we get this once-in-a-generation opportunity right, as the Senator will no doubt agree.</p><p>I conclude by thanking the Senator for raising this matter and look forward to answering any additional comments that she may make.  The main takeaway point is that the Government is determined to protect the Curragh and enhance and develop all of its great attributes for the benefit of everybody whether that is local people, tourists and visitors, or stakeholders who depend on the Curragh Plains as part of their livelihood.  The Government is determined to do so in a sustainable way that protects the unique history of the Curragh Plains, which the Senator referenced.</p><p>The process has taken time but it is really important and a great opportunity for us.  I am delighted to discuss this matter with the Senator here today.</p></speech>

While the study is scheduled to be completed in June 2022, I am not sure that we should seek the deadline to be extended because we need action sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Earlier I mentioned the illegal encampment.  In the coming weeks I will re-introduce a Bill, which I introduced in the D&aacute;il, to ban any encampment on this key site without a licence.  Will the Minister of State support my Bill?  I also ask the Minister and the Minister of State present to support the notion of the Curragh receiving national protection as a national heritage park and that we consider submitting an application for protective status to UNESCO.</p> <p>I accept that the Minister of State is here on behalf of the Minister for Defence and to read the speaking note that was provided.  However, as the Minister of State is a Deputy who represents Kildare, I ask that he supports all that I have asked.</p></speech>

I am aware of her recent announcement that she intends to introduce a Private Members' Bill on the permitted use of the plains.  While I do not wish to assume the outcome of the study I think that we can both agree that there is a need to place the management of the plains on a modern footing with which I am sure everyone who lives in proximity to the Curragh Plains will agree.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned the recent illegal encampment.  We are aware that on a very a regular basis during spring and summer the Department of Defence and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work closely together to deal with illegal encampments and trespassers on the plains, and particularly during the summer months.  This was a feature of a significant number of comments that were received during the public consultation phase, which is no surprise to anyone who has been a public representative for the area.  It is very clear and important that the challenge must be dealt with as part of a conservation management plan.</p> <p>Sadly, fly-tipping is a feature of the misuse of the Curragh Plains.  While the Department of Defence has a waste collector on-call to clean up, it is very difficult to prevent such anti-social behaviour but the issue cannot be ignored and we must proactively manage the plains into the future.  I note all of the Senator's comments and will convey them to the Minister, including applying to UNESCO for protective status.  My view of the ongoing management of the plains is that we must strike the right balance between conservation and proactive protection yet not shut off the plains from the people who depend on and use them.  I think that we can get strike the right balance with this process.</p></speech>

I give a shout-out for an event, Calves for Ukraine, happening in Kilcullen Mart.  The sale of 50 calves is happening on 20 April and has been organised by the Kildare and west Wicklow branch of the Irish Farmers Association.  It is great to see so many different factions in our community supporting Ukraine.</p> <p>The Deputy Leader will remember we had a debate in the House on maternity leave for councillors.  I initiated it with the support of Senators from the administrative panel.  I am happy to say, following a meeting between members of the women's caucus and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, it is hoped legislation will be put in place before the summer to enable maternity leave for councillors.  There will be that element of flexibility around supports in a financial way for secretarial support if councillors wish to remain on and not take maternity leave.  There will also be options around having a substitute if the councillor wishes.  I thank the Association of Irish Local Government for all its work on this.  Three Acts will need to be amended.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and all Senators for supporting this debate and ensuring this will happen.</p> <p>I mention also an event happening tomorrow morning.  It is the turning of the sod for a Primark facility in Newbridge.  I mention it because it is a &euro;75 million development for Newbridge and it is going to provide employment but it is also providing significant levies.  The figure is &euro;3.5 million.  When we put that with the development levies that came from the recently-built Lidl extension, which were also &euro;3.5 million, we then have &euro;7 million in such levies.  Under Kildare County Council, 71.8% of commercial development levies go to roads and 8.4% go to recreation and amenity.  I thank Richard Kelly for digging out the figures and doing some of the sums on this.  There is another &euro;7.2 million in development levies coming in from residential and of those a smaller percentage, 47.5%, goes to roads and 34.5% to community and recreation.</p> <p>My point is that &euro;60 million is coming into the council for that area in Newbridge and at the moment there is a huge imbalance between the number of developments and housing that has been built and what is being spent on community recreation versus roads.  The biggest issue, which I have spoken about here before, is the need for a second bridge into Newbridge.  On my accounting, &euro;7 million has come in for roads in development levies and &euro;3 million for community.  We need to see that spent on a second bridge and we need oversight from the Department with responsibility for local government to ensure development levies are being spent in the very best way they can to service the needs of the community.</p></speech>

I refer to the tragic loss of life and the impact of the illegal war in Ukraine as well as the suffering and plight of people and the number of them who have had to leave their homes and seek refuge elsewhere.  This is of course having an impact on Ireland and all our citizens.</p> <p>The main drivers of inflation are commodity and energy prices.  Oil is up 40% on average since January and gas was up 60% compared with the average January prices.  The cost or raw materials, such as those needed in construction, has increased.  In agriculture, we know of the increases in the cost of fertiliser and the fuel costs affecting the sector too.  These factors are impacting on the cost of living for all our citizens.</p> <p>The Government has responded.  Prior to this becoming a major issue the Government acted by increasing the standard cut-off rate for a single person by &euro;1,500, by raising it from &euro;35,300 to &euro;36,800.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a &euro;50 increase in personal tax credits and a remote working deduction of 30% of vouched expenses for heat, electricity and broadband.  All of those measures are positive and do help.  In February, we also saw the energy credit increase to &euro;200, including VAT, and the fuel allowance lump sum payment of &euro;125, the drug payment scheme reduction to &euro;80 and a 20% reduction in public transport fees.  In March, the excise rates for petrol and diesel were reduced by 20 cent and 15 cent, respectively.</p><p>We must continue to keep the cost-of-living impact under review.  I am asking for an early debate on this area with the Minister for Finance and other relevant Ministers.  We should provide time to discuss this very important issue, which affects all sectors of society, from businesses and households to elderly people and farmers.  The electricity or gas element of the household benefits package has been &euro;35 per month for some time.  Increasing it by &euro;5 would equate to a &euro;60 annual increase for the 476,000 householders who benefit, at a cost of &euro;29 million. This would be a positive step, particularly for those over the age of 70 who are facing particular cost-of-living challenges.  I can only hope and pray that we have decent weather this year but we have no control over that.  I hope we do not have cold spells and wet weather for silage harvesting, saving hay and the harvest in the autumn.  That would be detrimental in what is already an expensive and challenging year for farmers.  I ask for an urgent debate on the cost of living after the Easter break.</p></speech>

We must of course acknowledge the terrible things that have been happening in Syria, Yemen, China and many other places in recent years.  Rightly or wrongly, it is much more shocking for us that our continental home, Europe, is again the scene of the kinds of atrocities we associate with the Nazi era.  In Vladimir Putin and the actions of his government, army and paid mercenaries, we see the silhouettes of Hitler, Stalin and Mao.  Perhaps we see also the shadow of smaller generals who, in the name of irrational nationalism, atheistic materialism, blasphemous religious fear or bigotry, or just human greed, have, in past centuries and in recent times, visited cruelty and terror on the innocent.</p> <p>I commend Sister Bernadette MacMahon - Dr. MacMahon indeed - of the Sisters of Charity and her associates from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice and Family Carers Ireland on their report, Care and Home - Costs of Care Arising from Disability, which was presented to Deputies and Senators on Tuesday at an event organised by Deputy Marian Harkin.  We could have a very good debate, and perhaps take this report as starting point, on the challenges facing people who care for a loved one with a disability.  This carefully prepared report takes a case study of a family living with an only child, a 14-year-old with a profound intellectual disability who is living with incontinence, using a wheelchair, is not independently mobile, is attending a special education facility and is healthy but prone to infection and occasional hospitalisation.  The report compares the cost of a minimum essential standard of living for a family in that situation with that facing a family with one adolescent child who has no such disability.  The minimum essential standard of living includes the costs of transport, caring, personal care and so on.  It costs the family living with a disability 50% or &euro;244 per week more to reach that minimum essential standard.  This is a very careful and close study of the differential in families' financial needs.  It shows that a higher salary would be needed - &euro;32,000 per year compared with &euro;25,500 per year - just to get to that minimum standard.  Those on the minimum wage have a deeply inadequate income but the depth of inadequacy is deepened when there is the disability factor.  I commend this report to colleagues, the Government and all those responsible for the State's financial planning.</p> <p>I also express my disquiet at the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union on the issue of retention of data for the purposes of investigation of a crime.  It remains to be seen what the implications are of this decision for the conviction of Graham Dwyer, but it seems to me to be perverse that data can be retained for commercial and litigation reasons by telecoms companies, whereas we can have a limitation on the requirement to retain records for criminal investigations of a kind that would invalidate and prevent the kind of persistent, painstaking and patriotic detective work that led to the conviction of Graham Dwyer.</p> <p>I do not blame the Court of Justice.  The abandonment of common sense that led to such a law is what makes many people suspicious of the European Union, even at a time when the potential of the EU for driving a common, moral, economic and security purpose in the face of Russia is needed.  I want to hear a clear expression of dismay from our Government at this decision and I want steps to be taken towards changing the law.  The retention of data is not the problem; the issue is the need for careful definition of who may access it and how.  When it comes to the investigation of murder, the higher demands of justice must always be respected.</p></speech>

We may not agree on some issues but there is one on which we may share common ground.  While we may not agree on what should happen with the carbon tax rise - I do not believe it should go ahead in the next month or two - in the budget before last I raised the issue that the fuel allowance goes to too few people.  I will give a clear example.  A minimum wage worker in this country does not qualify for the fuel allowance.  This means that working families who are put to the pin of their collar, with increase after increase in key costs, have no recourse to the fuel allowance.  This issue should have been dealt with in previous budgets.  In fairness to the Deputy Leader, I remember her acknowledging this as an issue, but here we are two years into this Government and it has not been dealt with.  It would be useful if the Seanad could collectively agree on that and see if we could send a clear message to the Government that the fuel allowance issue needs to be tackled.  Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals on the fuel allowance in our most recent pre-budget submission were for an extension to the allowance by two weeks, an extension of eligibility and, crucially, a &euro;15 million discretionary fund to help struggling families with bills.  Those were sensible proposals and it is a pity the Government did not take heed of them.</p><p>The second issue I raise relates to the legislation we will deal with this afternoon, the Safe Access to Termination of Pregnancy Services Bill.  I emphasise the importance and urgency of this Bill.  I will quote the words of some people to emphasise why this Bill is so important.  These statements are from women who have experienced such protesters in recent times.  The first is as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	I struggle with anxiety and felt very intimidated walking past the protesters.  I ended up having a panic attack in the waiting room of the clinic and had to ring my boyfriend to come and pick me up to get me home as I was extremely distressed and could not face walking past them again. </blockquote> <p>The second woman said: &quot;It was shocking.  They were waving a photo of dead babies.&quot;  The third woman said: </p> <blockquote> 	I have been receiving treatment for cancer, which means I won't be able to have children.  I find passing the protest is really, really upsetting as it is a reminder of my situation </blockquote> <p>The final statement is as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	We finally have access to abortion services in our own country after a long-fought battle.  The women of Ireland deserve peace.  It is 2022 and we have had enough. </blockquote> <p>The Deputy Leader will know that there is only one Bill on the books at the moment with regard to safe access zones.  I appeal to the coalition of the willing across all parties to work again today to ensure the Bill completes its passage through the Seanad.  A photo call will take place in ten minutes and I apologise to the Deputy Leader as I must leave to attend it.  I encourage colleagues to do likewise if they can.  It is a cross-party photo call for the Together for Safety campaign.  I acknowledge the support of members of all parties in relation to the Bill.</p></speech>

The critical issue now is what will happen to it.  As Senator Gavan said, it is the only Bill we have, notwithstanding that commitments have been given by the Minister for Health in this space.</p> <p>Almost two years ago, on 9 April 2020, 955 people lost their jobs by email when the Debenhams stores closed overnight.  In the weeks that followed, the Government rightly said that it was determined to ensure that no other workers would find themselves in a similar situation in which they would be effectively locked out of their workplaces in the manner in which the Debenhams workers were locked out, with the State having to stump up the statutory redundancy payment to the workers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We are two years on now.  What has the Government done to follow through on those commitments that were made throughout the spring and summer of 2020?  There is an urgency to the need to put protections in place.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, will cease by the end of this month and redundancies are coming down the tracks because of a variety of factors.  A number of manufacturing companies, in particular, are under increasing pressure.  Where are those protections the Government committed to in 2020?  Ten months ago, it published its plan of action and we were told there would be an employment law review group and amendments would be made to company and employment law, but we have not seen them.  We need to see an urgency to that employment law review group.  It is simply unacceptable that workers have been left waiting so long.</p><p>The other issue I raise follows on from one I raised yesterday relating to the arts space in Dublin and throughout the wider country.  I raised the issue yesterday in the context of Richmond Road Studios and the 21 artists who are still waiting to hear from the receiver of the building in which they are tenants.  Despite our appeals, we have yet to hear from Kroll, and I again extend my appeal to the firm to engage.  In the context of the wider crisis, I highlight in particular the circumstances in Dublin.  In 2021, Dublin City Council undertook a cultural infrastructure audit and found there were 2,500 artists and 25,000 creatives in Dublin, yet there were only 392 individual and shared arts spaces.  Even in Dublin, therefore, there is a significant shortage.  What is the Government going to do to secure arts spaces if it is the case that we value art in this country?</p></speech>

I found that very empowering for us as a country, in that we are recognised not just for our culture of drinking or music but also for the community development role we play in the world.</p> <p>I am a qualified community development worker, so I know the value of community work, how it can benefit people in marginalised communities and how it can empower people.  It empowered me to be where I am today, and it plays a key role in my everyday political work in Leinster House in working for a common goal, being strategic and working with people.  Community development work can empower groups and open people's eyes.  There is an expression whereby once someone's eyes have been opened to the world, it is very difficult to close them again and to pretend he or she cannot see what is going on around him or her.</p> <p>In that context, I call for the Minister of State with responsibility for community development, Deputy Joe O'Brien, to come to the House to speak about how important community development work is in Ireland and the key role it can play in communities, as I outlined.  Most important, following the most recent economic crash, our sector was, unfortunately, the most severely hit and there was a lack of jobs and so on.  Some people with expertise in economics might say we are heading towards another crash and that circumstances for people in Ireland are getting worse.  We in community development work are somewhat fearful for our sector, although Community Work Ireland is working hard to secure our future.</p> <p>While we in Ireland do not always value the sector and it can be undermined in that people might consider someone who is a professional community development worker to be no more than a "community worker", community development is at the heart of what we do and it is exactly what we are doing now for Ukrainian refugees.  It is work we do every day.  Our sector's safety should be guaranteed and we should be treated like the professionals we are.  Again, therefore, I call on the Minister of State to come to the House to give us an update on the sector and on what will happen for us in the near future.</p></speech>

I congratulate them on all their tireless work every week to make our towns and villages and byroads and high roads aesthetically better.  They foster such community spirit and greatly improve our communities.</p> <p>Nevertheless, I would like a debate to be held on the circular economy and the lack of ambition in the new Circular Economy, Waste Management (Amendment) and Minerals Development (Amendment) Bill 2022.  The State is asking Tidy Towns volunteers to be heavy lifters and to collect bags and bags of rubbish every week.  In our new circular economy, there will be levies for plastic cups and so on, but there will be no incentive such as a digital deposit return scheme and there has been no effort to ensure every local authority will have proper litter wardens who can enforce the law in respect of littering.  Moreover, there are many people who fly-tip.  County Louth is a blackspot for people dumping mattresses and other objects on the side of the road and no one has the authority or role within Louth County Council to go after these people.  The resources are just not there.  I want to ensure our Tidy Towns committees will not be seen as rubbish collectors.  They should be people who merely tidy our towns, such as picking up the odd crisp packet left on the road.  They should be planting our community gardens and organising community projects.  They are not there to be litter collectors.  We need the circular economy Bill to provide for those resources in local government and to be more ambitious by providing for a digital deposit return scheme.</p></speech>

We are 40-plus days into the war and thousands of refugees have come to Ireland.  On Tuesday last, 42 refugees turned up in Clonakilty, where there was no accommodation, after leaving Dublin Airport at 2 a.m.  They arrived in Clonakilty in the afternoon to be met with no accommodation and had to be shipped off to Killarney.</p> <p>I am really concerned about where we are regarding accommodation for these refugees.  A really unfortunate war is putting unbelievable pressure on our housing and economy, but how will we deal with this issue in the longer term?  We are only 40 days into the war but we are already at a crisis point.  We have taken the easy option so far by filling up hotels and the others forms of accommodation that came easily to us.  The roll-out of the so-called Red Cross rooms in private homes has not really begun, from what I have seen.</p> <p>A long-term strategic plan needs to be discussed and we need to find out how the local authorities, which constitute one of the leading drivers in the crisis in that they represent a central point of contact, will deal with this daily, and it will be a daily issue.  Busloads of young women and children are coming and we do not have accommodation lined up for them.  I am very concerned about how we will work this.  We need to have a rolling, weekly debate in the House to get updates on where this accommodation is going to be provided and how we will adequately serve the thousands of people who will come.</p> <p>I am fearful that we are not prepared.  While the roll-out was really positive at the start, cracks are now forming.</p></speech>

Many have contacted me in recent days about longer term solutions.  Families' intentions were sincere at the very beginning, but that enthusiasm has faded.  We are only one month into this and we are already seeing the cracks in the system.  We have fantastic volunteers in Duleek and Bellewstown who have been tirelessly working and supporting refugees, of whom we have nearly 200 in our communities.  The volunteers have been getting them set up with social protection, medical cards, schools and local clubs.  I thank the volunteers.</p><p>Yesterday, I highlighted an issue to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney.  I would like the Deputy Leader to write to him because I did not get a response from the Department.  A live fire exercise is to take place at Gormanston camp from 19 to 29 April, but the camp is currently being used as a reception centre for refugees.  I do not think it is appropriate to run a live fire exercise in a camp where there are children who have come here from a war zone.  It could cause the Ukrainians further trauma, especially the children.</p><p>I wish to issue a warning.  It is about an important issue, so I would like the Cathaoirleach to allow me some time.  I want all the Ukrainians to know &ndash; I hope someone translates this &ndash; that there are people who may seek to exploit them when they get to this country, but no politician or citizens' advice centre charges for giving advice.  No one needs to pay anyone to keep a roof over his or her head or to get him or her a job.  Please, do not be intimidated by anyone.  Irish people are here to help.  I have already seen charlatans swooping in, posing as friendly faces and trying to victimise our new residents.  As politicians, we need to ensure that this does not happen in any of our communities.</p></speech>

He died at the rugby match between the Irish and Scottish parliamentary teams on 19 March.  I will be watching the service online, where it is available if anyone would like to watch it at 1.30 p.m.  Some Members have been able to travel to the service.  Unfortunately, I was not able to because I have a long-standing engagement here, but I wish to remember him and think of his family, friends and colleagues on this sad day.  His committal to a crematorium will take place this afternoon.</p> <p>I acknowledge the departure of the Portuguese ambassador, Mr. Miguel de Almeida e Sousa, who is leaving on Sunday.  He has been a great friend to Ireland since his arrival in October 2017 and I acknowledge his great commitment to the Irish-Portuguese relationship.</p> <p>I wish to join in the theme of Senator Keogan's suggestion of a whole day on Ukraine and the issues involved in Ukrainians coming to Ireland, how we accommodate them and how we bring them into our school system, health system and so on.</p> <p>If anything, the past six weeks have shown us how dependent we are on fossil fuels generally.  We have all been talking about this issue for a long time, but perhaps there has been a lack of urgency about it.  Perhaps we could have a green day or a green week to discuss how we will try to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, be it through retrofitting, electric vehicles or wind farms, how we will deal with agricultural emissions and all of the various other issues in a holistic way.  In this House, we tend to spend half a day, an hour here or there or two hours on another day discussing these matters, but we need to put an emphasis on how we go forward and do everything we can &ndash; recycling, reducing, upcycling and so on &ndash; to reduce our consumption.</p> <p>I wish to pay tribute to all of the staff of the Houses as we go on the Easter break.

According to the figures released today, inflation is at its highest level in 22 years after jumping from 6.7% from 5.6%.  That is a staggering figure.  A debate on the cost of living is urgent because, notwithstanding the immense work that the Government has done through mitigation measures, a significant proportion of working people in our country are the squeezed middle.  T&aacute; siad faoi bhr&uacute;.  It is not good enough just to talk about it.  We need to have a debate and, arising from that, action.  I ask that working families &ndash; those who are in the middle, pay for everything and get no handouts &ndash; be given recognition by the Government in what is admittedly an extraordinarily volatile situation.  The Government has acted, but prices have increased by 1.9% and, in the coming weeks, we will see significant inflation in food prices.  There is an onus on the Government to act on behalf of the squeezed middle.  I hope that the Deputy Leader will arrange for the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform to attend the House for such a debate after the Easter recess.</p> <p>I thank the officials and staff of all parts of the Oireachtas for their courtesy during this term.

It relates to the census.  Well done to everyone involved in what is very important work.  It will be a long time before it is all read, of course.  I received a call from a lady in the west who is now a widow and lives on her own.  She asked me what I thought she should write in the census time capsule.  I told her to write whatever she wanted to.  She spoke to me later and told me that she had written a simple line: "My hope is that people of my age [she is in her 80s] will be able in the future to remain in their own home."  For me, this was profound.  She will not be around in 100 years' time, but her aspiration is for people to remain living in the west right out on the coast.  Her family has moved on, her husband has departed and she is on her own, but she is enjoying life, is happy and can rely on the support of her community and friends.  This hammered home for me that here was a person who was investing in the future, thinking of a new generation and hoping that she herself might somehow be assisted.</p> <p>There is a challenge in this for us.  We all want to remain in our own homes as long as we can.  We want independence and dignity and to play a role in our communities.  We need a greater debate on how we can support people in staying in their homes for longer.  Disappointingly, ageism is alive and well in this country across a range of areas.  We need to tackle it.  We need to support people who wish to stay in their own homes and communities.  I ask that we have a focused debate at some point on older people who wish to be active in their communities and to live safely, securely and independently in their own homes.  There is a need for this approach, particularly in rural Ireland where people do not have the support services that those in urban areas do.</p></speech>

There will be major changes in the plan's costs because of inflation in the price of materials, diesel in most cases and, due to shortages, labour.  I hope that the Deputy Leader will arrange for such a debate.</p> <p>The collapse of Roadbridge is having a considerable effect on our area in Mayo as well as in Roscommon.  What will happen to the Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge road?  The work on this carriageway project is valued at more than &euro;400 million.  Will it be retendered?  I hope that the Department will consider this significant and badly needed road into the west and act on it quickly.  Roadbridge was also the main contractor at the Oweninny wind farm, which is the largest wind farm in the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The ESB is the project leader and I have no doubt that it will sort out the matter in a short period.

This week, which had Trans Day of Visibility, the Tory Government moved to ban conversion therapy for so-called members of the LGB community but not for the T or trans family.  Conversion therapy is a discredited, dangerous and unethical practice that has long-lasting psychological impacts.  Research shows that trans people are more likely to endure this practice that absolutely and utterly has no place in a modern world.  The UN has called for a global end to conversion therapy and says that it may amount to torture.  Currently only five countries have a full ban on conversion therapy.  Why does Ireland still not have a law against conversion therapy?  Why has the UK recognised that conversion therapy is a cruel and abhorrent practice for the so-called LGB people but not for trans people in 2022?  I cannot imagine how frightened trans persons must be right now.  My heart hurts and I am really frightened for my trans family across Europe, in the UK and in Ireland.  I also know that they are frightened.</p> <p>I once again want to put on the record that trans people are loved, and they have a right to live as their authentic selves, free from hatred, questioning or attempts to change them from who they are.  My office and my politics are safe spaces for all of them and they are always welcome.  I hope that we, as a nation, will continue to fight against this sweep of transphobia and see this unfounded moral panic for what it is.</p> <p>When will we get movement on the ban on conversion therapy, which has been promised?  It is a frightening day for all of the LGBTQ community; there is no LGB without the T.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of us before the House goes into recess not to acknowledge the great work that teachers, supervisors, boards of management and, indeed, the Minister for Education and the officials in her Department, have done throughout the pandemic over the past two years.  Most important of all, I wish to acknowledge all of the students.  I wish each and every one of them the very best of luck.  Some students must sacrifice what should be their downtime with their families over Easter to facilitate the orals and the practical exams.  I am very cognisant of the fact that a number of those students will be the class who did not sit their junior certificate and, therefore, the oral and practical examinations will be their first experience of an official State exam.  Any exam is trying and the junior certificate will break the ice for many students before they undertake the leaving certificate, which is the more important acid test.  I am mindful of the students who did not have an opportunity to do the junior certificate but now over Easter in what should be holiday and family time must face their very first official State exam.  I wish them all the very best of luck and I thank the teachers, supervisors and scrutineers who have facilitated these exams so that the leaving certificate can happen this year.</p></speech>

She also referred to the progress that has been made by the women's caucus, of which she is chair, in advancing legislation to provide maternity leave for councillors, following a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  It is great to see progress and she thanked all of the Senators for supporting the project.</p> <p>The Senator acknowledged the sod turning event tomorrow for the new Primark store in Newbridge.  In particular, she acknowledged the development levy of &euro;3.5 million that will go to the local authority and will be used locally, which is a significant amount.</p> <p>Senator Kyne raised the impacts of the war in Ukraine.  He specifically asked for a debate on the increasing cost of oil and gas and the cost of living.  Senators Gavan and  Buttimer requested a similar debate.  I can inform the House that we have requested a debate on the cost of living with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, and await a date from his office.  A request has now been made to the Minister for Finance to come here to speak on the same issue.  We will arrange a debate as quick as possible.</p> <p>Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen acknowledged that there are conflicts in other countries apart from the Ukraine.  He referenced Syria, Yemen and China and the is need to acknowledge the other conflict zones.</p> <p>The Senator also referenced the report by Family Carers Ireland that was published last Tuesday entitled Care at Home: Costs of Care Arising from Disability, which I think was mentioned in the Seanad that day as well.  The report compares the cost of caring for somebody with a disability with a household that does not have a person with additional needs.  He said that it has been estimated that it costs &euro;244 per week extra, which is a significant amount, and called for us to support those families. </p> <p>The Senator mentioned another important issue, which is the recent decision by the European Court of Justice on the retention of data and the implications that the decision might have for the Graham Dwyer case.  The Senator made the compelling argument that justice should rank higher when balancing rights.  There is a requirement for the Government should respond to the potential implications of the decision.</p> <p>Senator Paul Gavan requested a debate on the cost of living.  He also spoke about the carbon tax and, in particular, the fuel allowance, which is an issue that he has raised previously in this House, in particular, the need for the scheme to be expanded to bring more people into the fold, especially those on lower incomes and the minimum wage.</p> <p>The Senator referenced the Safe Access to Termination of Pregnancy Services Bill 2021, which will be debated in the House later.  He stated that the legislation has cross-party support.  He has raised this legislation on numerous occasions as has Senator Sherlock.  I reiterate that many Senators support reaching the objective of providing safe access zones and I certainly do as well.  I am aware that it is the only Bill on the issue that is currently tabled but Members will be aware that the Minister is working on legislation, through his Department, and will bring that through both Houses.  This evening's Bill is not opposed and there is support to achieve that objective.  My view is that whatever Bill is published we must be prepared for the potential of challenges that may try to test the legislation in court and, therefore, it is important that the legislation is as watertight as possible and that it is enforceable so that we can provide safe access zones for all women who try to access legal services in the State.</p> <p>Senator Sherlock mentioned the safe access Bill.  She also mentioned that it has been two year's since the workers in Debenhams were told awful news.  The way that they were treated is appalling.  She is correct to request an update but I am sorry that I do not have one.  Perhaps she might talk to me or the Leader of the House about a debate or a Commencement matter to begin with and we will try to get some progress on that as quick as we can.</p> <p>The Senator raised the issue of the Richmond Road Studios and the artists.  I watched the piece on RT&Eacute; from the artists.  I wish them well and hope that they find a space to continue their work.  I was disheartened to hear artists talk about having to down tools because they do not have enough space in which to work.  There is an onus on us to place a value on their work that is not always an economic or monetary and provide a space to the artists to do work that is of huge cultural importance to this country.</p> <p>Senator Flynn spoke eloquently and pointedly, as she always does, about President Zelenskyy's address to the joint sitting of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->His reference to our fantastic community work here in Ireland is something she values very closely.  The Senator said she is herself a product of that community work in getting to where she is today.  She requested a debate with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, on providing security for the community sector and ensuring its viability in the long term.  We will request that debate for Senator Flynn.</p><p>Senator McGreehan spoke about the launch of the 2022 Tidy Towns competition by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and wished all participants well.  I will reiterate the point that Tidy Towns committees do not have sole responsibility for keeping the streets clean.  That is ultimately for the local authorities and they should be supported to do that work.</p><p>Senator Lombard raised the issue of Ukraine and the refugee situation, in particular the huge pressure to provide accommodation for refugees entering the country.  Every part of the country is feeling that now.  He referenced a particular issue in Clonakilty where there was no space for those who had arrived.  Senators Keogan and Buttimer also raised the need to have a debate on this issue.  We have requested a debate with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, who I hope will be in the Chamber with us over the next few weeks to have that debate on supports for refugees and the accommodation situation.</p><p>Senator Keogan asked for a similar debate and referenced an issue with Gormanston Camp, which is currently housing refugees, and the fact a planned live firing exercise is planned between 19 April and 29 April.  Obviously, those exercises are a completely normal part of Defence Forces business as part of training and development for serving members.  I take on board the Senator's comments, however.  She might perhaps liaise directly with the Leader's office to try to get a response on that.</p><p>Senator Horkan spoke about the sad passing of Mr. David Hill and pointed Members to the fact that his funeral is taking place today.  It will be streamed live online at 1.30 p.m. for those Members who would like to tune in.  He also requested a debate on the Ukrainian situation.  We will have rolling debates, if we can call them that, on different aspects.  We are trying to get a debate at the outset on supports for refugees, which will cover many of the issues raised by Senators.  We will then keep abreast of what is happening and schedule debates as they are needed.  The Senator also paid tribute to the staff here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We all concur with that and wish everybody a happy Easter.  They do fantastic work.  When we head off out the door, they are very often left behind to do all the other work that is required once the sittings have concluded.  I acknowledge that work.</p></speech>

Senator Buttimer highlighted that today is World Health Day and commended all the healthcare workers.  He said we will require a debate on health at a future date in the coming weeks to keep on top of that issue.  He also raised the issue of the cost of living.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan spoke about the census that took place within the past week and referenced in particular the need to protect people living in their homes, which was a wish of a woman to whom he spoke.  When asked whether she was putting something in her time capsule and what that might be, she said it was her wish that people her age, in their 80s, could remain in their homes.</p> <p>Senator Burke spoke about the national development plan, NDP, and the need for a debate because of the increase in the cost of materials and labour, which have seen a significant change that will undoubtedly impact the delivery of the NDP.  We very recently had a debate on the NDP with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath.  We will request a second debate on the NDP in the coming weeks, it is hoped before the summer recess.  The goalposts have shifted and things have changed because of the cost of everything.</p> <p>Senator Hoey spoke very eloquently about the rise in transphobia.  I saw the passion with which she spoke this morning.  I do not know how conversion therapy is considered a therapy or treatment in any way.  We have long passed that.  I would certainly urge people to stay away from that.  The Senator is right, however.  There is probably the need to put that on a statutory footing or find some way to protect people who may not be making those decisions for themselves.  That is a very important point.  We have to keep an eye on that issue and have a debate in this House if and when it is needed.  I am sure we will have future debates on that issue.  The Senator is right to say there is no LGBTQI without the "T".  It is a very succinct way of putting it for that community.</p> <p>Senator Paul Daly spoke about students who are taking their oral and practical examinations.  It is very good to point out that, for many students, it is their first State examination.  It is a nerve-wracking experience.  It is very well for all of us who have been through it many years ago to say it is fine and, once it is over, they will not be thinking about it again.  In reality, however, it is stressful when a person is going through it.  The junior certificate examination is an opportunity to have a trial run, in some ways, in that people get to see what it is like to sit a big State examination.  Those students are doing these examinations this year without the benefit of that experience.  I wish them well as they enter into those examinations, and, obviously, the teachers and school communities.  I hope they all get through it and get the results they are hoping for.</p> <p>That concludes the Order of Business.</p></speech>

As it stands, if two people were in a caf&eacute; within 100 m of a service provider and person A said to person B that he or she has been thinking about birth control bills and person B gives him or her any advice on such, either for or against, then person B has committed an offence under this Bill.  One might respond that this is ridiculous.  It is but that is what this Bill does.  It gives legal effect to such a scenario and this amendment seeks to change that.  This is not what this Bill sets out to do but this is exactly what it does, despite the dubious claims of the Bill's architects that it was drafted by legal, criminal and constitutional law experts.  Any indoor area should not be considered a safe access zone.  If the staff or owners of such a premises have an issue with campaigners, that can be dealt with under the current laws on trespassing.  As this amendment would in no way impact the intended effect of the Bill, there is no reason for this amendment not to be accepted.</p></speech>

When we had that campaign and when the Seanad was threatened, much was made of the fact that the Seanad was an important tool of our democracy and a necessary protection against the excessively hegemonic approach to power that a government might take through its majority in the D&aacute;il.

Its provisions are so wide-ranging and radical that we have only begun to try to address them in amendments which seek to limit the harm they would cause to civil liberty and respect for differences of opinion in our society.  My point is that proceeding with such a Bill in the way we have so far and the fact that it has even reached Report Stage shows a remarkable disrespect for the Seanad.  It essentially says that what goes on here does not matter and that there will not be any serious attempts to deal with this until it gets to the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

This point came up between Senator Pauline O'Reilly and I the last day.  Sometimes amendments are proposed to try to make an egregious situation somewhat less harmful and toxic.</p><p>On the last day we debated this Bill, in February, I pointed out that this legislation was so restrictive of free speech that there could be a situation where people could be sitting down in a coffee shop in a hospital, the subject of abortion might come up and a person might mention that he or she was involved in providing terminations of pregnancy upstairs and a person might say he or she is upset about the fact that the change in our abortion law has led to a major increase in the incidence of abortion in Ireland, which it has.  That would fall under the definition of what this Bill attempts to prohibit; an innocent conversation, even if it is overheard, where one person would express a sincere opinion.  Even if one said innocently and respectfully that one wishes abortions were not being carried out in a hospital because innocent lives are being lost, and even if that was only overheard, that could be a criminal act as this Bill is worded.  It is remarkable that since this was pointed out on Committee Stage, no attempt has been made to rectify such a draconian provision.  In some kind of a limited way, this amendment seeks to at least provide that a conversation that might take place inside a building that might fall within the 100 m defined safe access zone would not be criminalised.  One could just as easily argue that no conversation should be criminalised, even if it took place in the coffee shop of the hospital where the procedures were taking place.  Our amendment does not address this.  This is a limited amendment that intends and seeks to point out just how draconian, intolerant and radical the provisions of this Bill set out to be.</p><p>There is a massive disrespect for civil liberties, the right to free expression and the right to dissent at work in this Bill.  I say this with a heavy heart because at an individual level I am delighted to call every Member my colleague and we all get on well.  I do not stand in moral judgment of anybody; I have no right to judge anybody and none of us has a right to judge any other person.  However, we have a right to try to assess and judge each other's actions and I have to say that this Bill flirts with fascism because it seeks to criminalise respectful free speech-----</p></speech>

We are not talking about somebody who would shout: "Fire" in a theatre.  There are situations where we have to curtail free speech where somebody is immediately put in danger but the idea that two people cannot have a conversation about abortion within 100 m of where an abortion is taking place lest they be under the definition of this Bill is wrong.</p> <p>Let us be clear about this.  I am not exaggerating the position; I wish I were.  We are trying to amend the section that states that what is restricted is the expression or demonstration of "support for or opposition to a person&rsquo;s decision to access, provide, or facilitate the provision" of abortion.  If I express opposition to a person's decision to provide abortion, I might be criminalised for doing so.  We have to go to section 3(2) to see what is meant by that.  It includes "advising, persuading or informing... any person concerning issues related to termination of pregnancy services".  The Minister of State is an intelligent person and she can read writing the same way I can.  This is not about harassment or observing and besetting.  There are other sections of the Bill that are perfectly reasonable in plenty of contexts.</p> <p>It is worth noting the Garda Commissioner's remarks on this, as we did on Committee Stage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Garda Commissioner said there is no need for such legislation.  The law is there to deal with any of the activity that we would all object to.  Not only that, he pointed out that there were not reports of any objectionable activity that would require amending legislation.  Therefore, this legislation proceeds from a desire to crush dissent; nothing else.  It proceeds from a desire to erase any memory that a third of the people voted against the provision of abortion services, presumably because they regarded it as a violation of the right to life of vulnerable children.  However, whatever their reason for opposing it, they did and still do.  This legislation is not about addressing any cruel or reckless behaviour of the kind that we should all unite in opposing.  It is about silencing dissent.  That is why I say it flirts with fascism.</p><p>I will return to the provision in the Bill we are trying to amend, which relates to expressing opposition to the decision to provide abortion and doing so by informing any person about issues relating to the termination of pregnancy.  If it comes up, however casually, in a conversation in a hospital that somebody is involved in providing abortions in whatever way upstairs, and I am there in good faith and say, &ldquo;Well, I really wish this was not happening at all; did you know that our law does not provide for any precautionary pain relief where abortions take place late-term under our new law?", that could be seen as informing people on abortion services.  </p><p>This goes much further than addressing the person who is contemplating abortion and trying to change their mind.  The people who proposed this Bill want to go much further than that in the way they attempt the criminalise the free and respectful exchange of information.  Can it really be the case, at a time when all of us know the threat to democracy that is going on in our world, and when we know the horrors associated with that, that responsible legislators want to criminalise free speech to the extent that this legislation does?  Of course, the reality is we do not really know what they want because they have the luxury of proposing this legislation knowing that the Government does not want to be seen to be against anything that the abortion lobby wants.  Therefore, this will go through with minimum opposition.  The Government has the luxury of saying that it is only the Seanad; and there will be a more serious discussion in the D&aacute;il when various voices are heard.  That is no way, I submit, to go about legislating.  It is no way to treat the national Parliament.  It is no way to treat the electorate.</p></speech>

I want to be clear.  These amendments are nothing to do with what Senator Mullen said about one third of people being ignored, about such people being unable to express their conscience and about these measures being an attack on freedom of speech.  The intention behind the actions of people who stand outside maternity hospitals and clinics is to create a chill effect that ensures people are unable to access abortion services locally.  That is why only 10% of GPs provide abortion services.</p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about "the abortion lobby".  However, there is a worldwide pro-life, or anti-choice, grouping.  We see the full might of them at the moment in Texas and Poland.  Women have to drive for ten or 12 hours at a time to travel from Texas to neighbouring states.  Now attempts are being made to bring in restrictive abortion laws in Oklahoma.  This is not about freedom of expression.  For 40 years, that lobby has chilled people into not providing healthcare for women.  I want to be clear about that.  It is healthcare in a healthcare setting.  </p> <p>As somebody who has had two pregnancies in six months, I got exactly the same treatment in both cases.  It brought home to me, more than anything else, that this is healthcare.  It is exactly the same provision one would get for a miscarriage or in other situations.  It is not about ignoring one third of people.  Nobody is forcing those people to do anything that is against their own body and against their own choice.  They accuse us of flirting with fascism.  They are being allowed to make that accusation in this House, exactly as they have done over the past 40 years in Ireland, from 1983 onwards.  They are bedding in to create a chill effect with the aim of disallowing women from accessing basic healthcare in their local settings.  Women are still travelling.  They might be travelling intercounty, but they are still travelling in this country.  How dare he accuse us of flirting with fascism?</p></speech>

The idea that there would be a safe access zone outside of a building, but everybody inside would be allowed to engage in intimidation, is bizarre, quite frankly.  If I were inside a place where I was receiving healthcare and an abortion, I would not want to go to have a cup of coffee only to have somebody try to intimidate me while having that coffee and waiting for a service I am legally entitled to.  This amendment is absolutely nonsensical.  Obviously, we will not be supporting it.  It is also quite cynical.  The Senator spoke about respect for differing opinions.  People choose to go to these facilities.  You are able to have free conversations in any other place, in any other coffee shop and in any other part of your county.  If you say it is at that point that you decide you want to have a conversation about abortion, I do not buy it for one second.</p></speech>

I simply want to say that the amendment proposed by Senators Keogan and Mullen is arrant nonsense, exactly for the reasons pointed out by Senators Moynihan and O'Reilly.

It is worth noting that protests outside hospitals not only intimidate the women, their partners and other support, who are accessing termination services, they intimidate everybody going into that facility.  </p> <p>Pregnancy is a very complicated time in a woman's life.  A lot of things can go right and a lot can go wrong.  It creates different dynamics within the home, workplace and community.  It is a trying, roller-coaster ride for people.  Protests outside a health facility, by people who have no business being there, are very disempowering for the woman.  It puts the woman in a very vulnerable position.  I would not like to see anybody protesting outside any facility, particularly for the people who are accessing termination services.  Everybody should be able to access their healthcare with dignity and privacy and to not have their business spread among their community.  Everybody should be able to access services in their own community with a bit of privacy, with nobody reporting back as to who has been seen going in and out of a facility.  That is the chill effect.  It impacts everybody who is accessing health services.</p> <p>I commend this Bill and the campaigners who have worked very hard on it.  I commend everybody who is working positively towards ending discrimination against women and allowing people in this country to have autonomy and privacy across all aspects of their reproductive healthcare.</p></speech>

This amendment is fanciful and deliberately tabled to allow access to people within a building and within the proximity of a clinic.  It is laughable, if it was not so serious and the sinister reasoning behind it was not so serious.</p><p>Anyone with a basic rudimentary understanding of criminal law will know that there are two elements to the prosecution of an offence.  For somebody to be found guilty of an offence, he or she has to have the <i>mens rea</i>and <i>actus reus, </i>a guilty mind and guilty act.  Where two people are having a conversation in a coffee shop and it is overheard, who is going to report or prosecute that?  Where within that would the two elements that are essential for the prosecution of a criminal office be found?  They would not be found.  It is akin to a mother or father saying to a child, &quot;If you drop that, I'll kill you&quot;, being prosecuted for threats to kill and cause bodily harm.  It is as fanciful and ridiculous as that.  It is tabled to deliberately give a platform here to absurd, insulting and offensive notions, as stated by Senator Moynihan and my colleagues.  It should be utterly rejected in its spirit, as well as its intent.</p></speech>

I laid her in the box and put a little towel over her and then I walked through the maternity ward to the reception desk where other midwives very kindly brought me to the morgue.  They also gave me a little piece of curtain-type material.  My daughter was so small.  I was given a Polaroid camera so I could take photographs of our little baby girls.  These are things one does not think of.</p> <p>When women go to avail of obstetric and gynaecological services, very often it is an exquisitely painful moment in their lives.  I absolutely and unequivocally support the right of all women to choose and to assert their bodily autonomy, but that is not the environment where someone should have to run the gauntlet of people holding posters.  I do not care if they are across the street, they do not belong there.  It is not an environment where one wants to hear a conversation about that particular moment that one is living in one's life.  I do not believe that this suppresses freedom of speech.  If people want to protest, they can do so outside the gates of Leinster House.  There are particular environments, including outside GP surgeries and hospitals, where this should never ever take place.  </p> <p>I commend the Bill.</p></speech>

I do not think anybody has read the amendment.  It does prevent people protesting within the confines of the hospital or GP setting.  This is about within 100 m of that zone.  This is about the coffee shop that might be within that 100 m.  It is about facilities outside of the hospital or GP setting.  Under this Bill, anybody who brings up a conversation in regard to birth control or abortion outside the hospital setting but within that 100 m zone can be prosecuted.  This is what it means.</p> <p>Senators have misrepresented me.  They have misrepresented what this amendment seeks to do.  That is exactly what they have done.  They are supporting the criminalisation of people outside the coffee shop that is 50 m down the road from the hospital or 50 m down the road from the GP setting.  That is what this Bill will do.  If this amendment is not accepted, we may as well kiss goodbye to free speech and free assembly in this country.  I am very disappointed.  Senators have been very disingenuous with regard to what is proposed in this amendment.  They have totally misrepresented it.  </p></speech>

This is to enable the continuation of peaceful, non-confrontational prayer vigils in the vicinity of hospitals, which harm no one and are an important part of free expression for some people in this country.  The Bill intends to prevent harassment, but it actually bans peaceful and respectful citizens from praying silently for pre-born children.  The architects of the Bill know that and, I am sorry to say, seem to desire this to be the case given the explicit inclusion of "prayer" as a prohibited action.  This is clearly an unconstitutional overreach of the Bill and should be rectified.</p></speech>

On Committee Stage, we heard at length from Senator Mullen about how people wanted to pray outside hospitals and that we needed to respect their right to prayer. I pointed out to the Senator that the women were telling us they found those prayer vigils to be intimidating when they walked past them and that we needed to listen to the women and their experience of what they felt when they walked past those prayer vigils.  I also said that we are always hearing how we have to understand and respect the people who voted &quot;No&quot; to repeal.</p><p>On the back of me saying that on Committee Stage, my contribution was clipped for social media.  It was circulated that I was calling for the abolition of any prayer and that I was against any praying.  That led to a complete pile-on.  These so-called decent individuals who just want to pray, are law abiding and just want to exercise their freedom of expression and religion led to me getting a series of emails.  I want to read into the record what some of those emails said because it is important from the point of view of the supporters of those so-called upstanding decent Christians who just want to pray outside medical facilities.  The emails started with:</p> <blockquote> 	...you Liberal retarded wanker.  F--- multiculturalism, f--- diversity, f--- lgbtq you are ALL ANTI CHRISTIANS in a Christian land.  Question - just how do you f----s think Christians will react when, as a fair few are, Awakening to the bullshit. Keep caring about you're money, none of you can take it with you when God through Jesus destroys you Anti Christian TURNCOATS. </blockquote> <p>There then followed, in another email from the same individual, &quot;[do] you ever get the feeling people are watching [you] ... [you] Sick whore&quot;.</p><p>That is what I got because I said it may be that people want to pray, but they can pray 100 m down the road.  Nobody is stopping them from doing that, but they are praying outside a healthcare facility, be it a GP's premises or a hospital, and whether women are going to access an abortion or whatever healthcare facilities, they do not need to run the gauntlet, as Senator Clonan said, of walking past individuals.  It is just wrong.  Even in my own family, I have had someone who has to carry a stillborn child out.  She cannot walk past Holles Street hospital, let alone with protests, because of her experience, but you want them to walk past so-called decent, law-abiding citizens who send this type of muck to democratically elected individuals.</p></speech>

People need to go to these particular places to access these services.  People can pray literally anywhere.  I go back to my point on amendment No. 1; it is pure cynicism.  The idea that somebody thought he or she would stand outside a hospital and pray for no real reason is also ludicrous.  There is a purpose behind it, for the most part, because if it were just prayer they were after, they would go to a church, sit in their living room or go anywhere else.  There is a purpose behind the place they choose to go.</p></speech>

The fact is no constitutional right is unlimited.  They are all balanced against the rights of others.  There is also a constitutional provision that we are allowed to regulate for the termination of pregnancy.  That is also a constitutional right that we have been attempting to facilitate and it has been thwarted by people who feel it is all right to weaponise faith.  That is what this is about.  It is about weaponising one's faith by standing in a particular part and trying to undo what was democratically elected in this country.</p></speech>

Abortion is healthcare and people are accessing healthcare facilities.  People can pray wherever they want.  This is not about prayer.  This is simply about intimidation.  It is about a chill effect.  It is part of the tactics they always use.  Do not buy into this thing that there is an overreach in terms people's right to pray.  There is a very particular reason people are trying to pray outside healthcare clinics and it is that they are doing it to intimidate women who are accessing the healthcare that is available.  Abortion is healthcare and is no different from other forms of reproductive healthcare women will access.</p></speech>

I want to make sure everybody knows that from my own point of view and, I suspect, from Senator Keogan's point of view, there is no desire or any point in trying to filibuster this Bill.  This Bill will pass today because people do not really care about the content.  They just want to make the point.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am only interested in addressing anything I hear that is false or perverse in the arguments being made for the Bill and in explaining the reasons for the amendments Senator Keogan has proposed and I have supported.  I wanted to make that point.</p><p>My second point is I have noticed that despite the fact the amendment proposes the deletion of the phrase "prayer or counselling" from the relevant section of the Bill, all the contributions I have heard so far have to do with prayer.  It seems to me it is because there is an element of paranoia and neuralgia around religion in our society, in some quarters, and how it intersects with these difficult social issues.  I say that as someone who has spent my Seanad career addressing some very controversial issues.  I have always sought to make arguments that do not depend on any other person's faith, or indeed my own.  I make arguments based on human rights and human dignity and ones intended to appeal to people of good faith or of all faiths or none.  Despite this I always find, when I hear people discussing these debates, especially from the point of view that proposes and supports abortion rights, there is always an attempt to demonise religious people.  That proceeds from a recognition some of the controversies touching on the church in Ireland have meant there is a lot of neuralgia around religion and there can be a weaponisation of hostility towards religion but it is the unborn who have been the victims of that in recent years.</p><p>Let us make arguments based on things we all agree on, or are supposed to agree on, that is, democracy, human rights, the rule of law, respect for free speech, respect for free expression and dissent and the minimum curtailment of free expression done only in order to safeguard essential rights and safety of people.  That is what most democrats agree on.  That is why I have today said this legislation flirts with fascism because it shows a complete disregard for the necessary public good of being able to express oneself in a free way.  I do not mean in an abusive way, a harassing way a way that should attract censure and prosecution, but the necessary expression of dissent is vital in a democracy.</p><p>Let us therefore talk about counselling, which the other contributors have not mentioned so far but which is essential to the first of these amendments.  I made the point even an innocent conversation in a coffee shop, if overheard, could be criminalised.  Senator Seery Kearney sought to set that aside by asking who would ever report such a thing.  My answer is exactly the kind of people who would propose such draconian legislation in the first place.  They would be only too happy to make such a report and seek to get the Garda involved, as this legislation does, and seek to get one fined up to &euro;3,000.  The degree of intolerance is already on display in this legislation.  Say one is a mother accompanying one's teenage daughter and one finds oneself sitting in a coffee shop.  If the mother is upset at what her teenage daughter wants and were to seek to provide information or indeed counselling to her daughter who is considering having an abortion, that mother could unintentionally fall foul of this law and leave herself open to criminal penalty.  That is a fact and nobody here has denied that today.  They have simply tried to suggest nobody would attempt to report it or prosecute it but the idea such a thing-----</p></speech>

I am not sure it was deliberately intended but there is such a broad sweep underlying this legislation that there is not any interest in considering whether there could be unforeseen or unintended consequences, such is the visceral nature of the proposal here.  Let us be clear, counselling of a kind that is intended to assist a person and which is consensual between people should not directly, indirectly, or accidentally be criminalised in the way that applies in this legislation.  It is simply irresponsible to contemplate letting this legislation pass without addressing at least that issue.</p> <p>On the neuralgic issue of religion in our society, I speak as somebody who has never taken part in any prayerful or other kind of vigil protesting abortion services.  It would actually be very hard to do it in the way people think it is being done and the way it is done in other countries where there are abortion clinics and it is known people going into a building are doing so for a very specific purpose.  Then there are people who may demonstrate outside in different ways.  Some of them might demonstrate in objectionable ways.  It has been known to happen, sadly.  There are very irresponsible people out there who, from time to time, communicate in a very irrational or unpleasant way.  That has happened in other countries.  What also happens is there are people who offer, in a respectful way, counselling or support to people who might be conflicted, might want to change their mind or who might be open to changing their mind.  There are people who might want to bring information into the public domain and yes, there are people who, in their own personal way, feel prayer might influence the situation for the better.</p> <p>Senator Boylan says the test is not whether those people intend kindness or not.  She says it is how the person passing by feels that determines whether one should have a right to communicate, however respectfully.  Let us think about how elastic that concept is.  Is there any other situation where people might be availing of a legal service in a country, where if one were to in any way signal dissent or disagreement with it, no matter how carefully or respectfully, the fact somebody else might say: "I feel intimidated by you" can immediately put one at risk of either being moved on by garda&iacute; or prosecuted if one does not.  That is why I say this Bill is so antidemocratic and why it flirts with fascism.  I am not making that phrase up for dramatic effect.  This is a remarkable piece of legislation in how far it seeks to go to prevent other people from expressing respectful dissent.  No responsible democrat should have anything to do with it.</p> <p>I have not even talked yet about what Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann says about the free expression and practice of religion.  The Bill's proponents know this would be unconstitutional yet they persist in proposing this legislation as a form of virtue-signalling that is frankly not virtuous because there is respect in our Constitution and a presumption in favour of prayerfulness.  Though I do not have any plans to ever take part in such vigils myself, I defend good people who do and who will.  I made the point in this House on the last occasion that I am aware of at least one case where the uncle of one of our Government Ministers has taken part in these and I am sure that person is perfectly decent and not out to harass, intimidate or make anybody feel bad.  The other side always fails to remember that for those of us opposed to abortion, it is not because we want to limit anybody else's life but because we want to enhance respect for life in the country because we regard abortion as the tragic loss of an innocent human life that is there from the first moment with the 46 chromosomes and all that stuff we learned in our biology classes at school.  That concept of human dignity is what motivates those who oppose abortion.  It is not hatred or dislike for anybody else.  I sympathise with Senator Boylan when she talks about unpleasant stuff being put up online but she does not have a monopoly on victimhood in that regard.</p></speech>

Before I Informed colleagues today that I thought this legislation flirts with fascism and the action it supports flirts with fascism, I was very careful to say that there was nothing <i>ad hominem</i>in what I am saying.  I attack and I attempt to judge no person.  I have a duty as a Member of this Oireachtas to tell the truth as I see it on the basis of the facts as I apprehend them, and to make a judgment on legislation that I believe to be deeply harmful.  It is harmful to our democracy, disrespectful to people and utterly disrespectful of the unborn who die as a result of abortion.  It is also disrespectful of women because it disrespects those who experience a complexity about the decision to have an abortion and are open to respectful exchanges with their loved ones and people they do not know but who might have a concern and respect for them and simply want them to make a different choice for their sake and for the sake of the child involved.<br/><br/>It is not a lot to ask that a person who wants to communicate in this way, silently by their presence in the vicinity of a facility where abortions are taking place, verbally where there is a consensual approach to the exchange of ideas, or informally in the coffee shop within or without a facility where abortions are taking place, should be able to communicate ideas respectfully without fear of somebody overhearing, reporting them and trying to get garda&iacute; involved in their life in a way that would not last a second before our courts but which the legislators here today have no problem advancing because it satisfies a political goal of signalling enthusiastic support for our abortion laws, to the point where we will crush all dissent in a way that is not befitting a mature and healthy democracy.<br/><br/>I will make one last point.  In Ireland we do not have abortion clinics.  We have GP facilities and worryingly we now have abortions taking place through telemedicine, with no concern being expressed by supporters of abortion for the risk this entails around coercive abortions taking place or abortions taking place that would facilitate, mask and prevent the discovery of abuse of women above and under the age of consent.  There is no concern about that at all because nothing that ever challenges abortion can ever be discussed.  That is the impetus at the heart of all of this.<br/><br/>We do not have abortion clinics in Ireland.  We have facilities that people may approach for thousands of reasons.  There is no visibility of the person who approaches another person for abortion-related services.  It follows from that that even if people of ill-intent wanted to harass or intimidate, which is something we would all oppose, they simply would not be able to do it because of the structure of the situation in Ireland.  This is perhaps why it was clear to the Garda Commissioner, if not to the Minister for Health, that we actually do not need this legislation at all.  Those are the issues.<br/><br/>These amendments simply seek to allow people to communicate respectfully in a way that a democracy should always allow.  They recognise that if people want to pray, which may not be my style in that context, respect for other people's rights never ends with just the things you agree with yourself.  The test is whether you are willing to put up with the things that do not suit you and you do not normally roll with.  There is no sign of that inclusiveness here today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-04-07a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1643" speakername="Lorraine Clifford-Lee" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022040700002#Y00500"><p>I said I would not make any further contributions but I feel compelled to comment further.  I am happy to virtue signal my enthusiastic support for safe access zones.  There is nothing wrong with that.  There is nothing wrong with showing strong support for something.</p> <p>With regard to the issue of religion being demonised, that is not the case at all.  I am a religious person, as I have always said, but I do not believe there is any conflict between my religious position and trying to support women accessing healthcare.  There never has been a conflict.  I have always been an enthusiastic supporter of a woman's right to choose.  I have certainly never displayed any intolerance towards religious people.</p> <p>There has been a lot of talk around human rights aspect of freedom of expression of religious positions.  There is a human rights aspect to accessing healthcare, and that trumps.  To access healthcare is one of the most basic rights that anybody has and access to abortion care is healthcare.  It is on the same spectrum as any other form of healthcare.  I strongly believe that.  Religious expression, as set out in the Constitution - there is plenty of case law on this - relates to wearing a cross around one's neck, or the wearing of the hijab or the Jewish kippah.  This is the expression of religion.  Ireland is an overwhelmingly Catholic country but I have rarely seen people praying randomly praying on street corners.  It does not happen.  Religious expression through prayer happens in a church generally.  The only people I have seen praying on the streets are those who are outside health facilities.  It is not an integral part of religious expression; it is done with the intent to intimidate.</p> <p>On the idea of counselling women who may be undecided or conflicted in their decision, if they are going into a health facility, they have already made a decision.  If they are going to get any counselling, it will not be on the street from some random with no qualification.  There are many excellent counsellors who provide an excellent service.  As to the idea that someone might be swayed outside at the point of going in the door, that just does not happen.</p> <p>Senator Mullen also raised the point that Ireland does not have abortion clinics, so praying outside is not to intimidate any one person going in.  This speaks to the point I made earlier, whereby anybody going in to access any sort of service could potentially be intimidated.  One does not know what a person is going in to face.  Senator Clonan's contribution was very powerful.  Many people are going in for happy moments but they may be going in for very traumatic moments in their lives.  Over the course of a nine-month pregnancy, there may be many happy moments or many tragic moments.  It is a constant roller-coaster, and I have been on it a few times.  It is a very difficult position to be in and to think that anybody would be intimidated going in to access healthcare is mind-boggling.</p> <p>Senator Mullen spoke about telemedicine.  This has actually been a very welcome and progressive step and anybody who thinks there is anything negative about telemedicine would really want to talk to the providers.  The providers I have spoken to have been very happy with it.  It deals with the complexities of women's lives.  Women have a lot of other responsibilities and may be facing childcare constraints.  It is because we do not have wide access to abortion care in Ireland that many women cannot travel long distances with patchy public transport.  Telemedicine has been a very welcome measure.</p> <p>I will leave my comments at that.  I hope I will not be compelled to correct the record any further.</p> <p>Senator Boylan spoke on the correspondence she received.  It is not even that statements were randomly put out online.  This was direct correspondence directed at the Senator.  That is much more intimidating than some randomly post.  I thank the Senator for sharing that.  Unfortunately, we have all received correspondence like that but it is important sometimes to put on the record of the House that we are still receiving it.</p></speech>

Those comments are awful and as Senator Clifford-Lee said, many of us have experienced something similar.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The vitriol in those emails was horrific, and I am very sorry the Senator received them.  It is not acceptable.</p><p>I want to quickly address three points.  There has been a lot of talk about decent, free speech and this, that, and the other.  One would swear we were putting a safe access zone around the entire island.  We are not putting a safe access zone around the entire country.  The zones will be 100 m outside the place where a person can get an abortion.  That leaves a whopping amount of landmass within which people can do these activities according to their own free will, and no one will stop them from doing so.  People can do anything they want in those other areas.  A zone will be 100 m in diameter around one of these facilities.</p><p>In the context of democracy, we understand the basic concept of not being able to do certain things within a certain distance of a polling booth.  We recognise it is important for democracy and for all sorts of reasons.  We are not saying that such a provision is anti-free speech or is stopping people from doing what they want.  We just recognise that it is a basic common sense thing to do within the vicinity of a polling booth.</p><p>I am astonished by the way in which this is being portrayed.  There is literally an entire country within which people can do those things.  We are asking for a 100 m zone through which women and pregnant people can pass with dignity and without fear of individuals coming up to them, after they have made up their minds, made this decision, gone to the registered counsellors, engaged with their GPs, discussed it with their families, or indeed none of the above.  We voted to allow them to do that, and that is their business.  It has been said that it is doing no harm and that it is just quiet things.  I have spoken to and heard from women for whom that was one of the most traumatic and difficult experiences.  I just think that is very upsetting.</p><p>It is wild that we are even having a conversation about this sort of stuff and flirting with fascism.  Under fascism, it would be within a god's whistle and a prayer that a woman would be able to get access to an abortion or birth control pills.  It is not exactly a common state of affairs under fascism.  I refer to the Rocco Code under Mussolini.  That is certainly a twisting and topsy-turvying of the situation.  I hate to think what this country would look like under fascism.  It would be appalling.</p><p>There is absolutely and utterly no country or jurisdiction of which I am aware that has introduced safe access zones legislation in any guise.  Ealing Council said that it believes the zones were a proportionate response in order to balance the human dignity of those seeking abortion.  Nowhere in this world - I stand open to correction on this - has anyone been prosecuted for having a chat and a coffee.  That has never happened.  We are talking about a red herring.  We are talking about something that has never occurred.  It has never happened under safe access zones legislation.  Safe access zones legislation works perfectly fine anywhere it has been introduced.  The zones provide for the human dignity of those who are going in and out of those service providers, hospitals, GP clinics or wherever.</p><p>There is near hysteria and moral panic over something that has simply never happened anywhere else.  It just seems crazy.  I hope we can get through this.  We have 40 minutes left and we would certainly like to see this legislation passed for all the people who have travelled here today.  This is moral panic over something that I have not seen happen anywhere in the world.</p></speech>

The first relates to counselling.  The key point about counselling is that professional and therapeutic counselling is entered into by the distressed person.  That person makes a choice.  One cannot have counsellors walking the street looking for sad people and saying "Hey, do you want some help with that?"  That is not how counselling works.  I am conscious of the fact that an anti-choice Deputy has suggested that what has been going on has been counselling, which is nonsense of course.  It is nothing of the kind.  I wanted to address the issue of counselling because I know Senator Mullen was keen that we would do so.</p> <p>We have heard the phrase "flirting with fascism".  Let me describe the reality of flirting with fascism in Limerick right now.  There are activists in this Chamber who have been called at work by anti-choice activists to ask them why they are supporting this Bill.  There are activists in this Chamber who have had their pictures taken down from social media and Photoshopped to look like witches.  Leaflets have been printed and shoved through the letter boxes of their neighbours and friends in their communities.  We talk about flirting with fascism; we know exactly which side is flirting with fascism.</p></speech>

The right to prayer is in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann.  The people of Ireland are being told that they do not have the right to pray outside designated premises of a service provider or healthcare professional who is involved or believed to be involved in the provision of termination of pregnancy services or contraceptive services, or a building in which they reside.  The other day, there was a peaceful prayer gathering on Grafton Street.  I believe it was outside a pharmacy.  I am sure there are contraceptive services available there.  It was for the Ukrainian war.  That would not be allowed in the future under this Bill.  That is how serious the position is with regard to the wording in the Bill.  I will be pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

In any urban area, planning a route for any such demonstration would virtually be impossible under this legislation.  General practitioner clinics, pharmacies and even bars with vending machines selling condoms could have a 100 m zone surrounding their premises in which a march would be prohibited.  After all, "designated premises" means any premises at which contraceptive services are provided.  Perhaps the idea of the annual March for Life becoming unsustainable brings great glee to the pro-abortion activists, who desire nothing more than to shut down opposing voices and enforce their ideological orthodoxy.  Perhaps, however, they would benefit from thinking about the shoe being on the other foot.  The Bill does not draw a distinction between speaking in favour of abortion and speaking against it.  Therefore, all pro-choice rallies would similarly be constrained.  Neither should be constrained, of course, and the freedoms of assembly and speech should be protected rather than outlawed, as they are under this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-04-07a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022040700002#BB00800"><p>This amendment brings out an issue that highlights yet again the at-best sloppy and at-worst malicious nature of the sheer scope, width, breadth and reach of the draconian measures set out in this Bill.  With regard to the right to assemble &mdash; it is a constitutional right &mdash; and then to go in company with others of like mind to make a political point or several and seek to influence those who govern us and legislate for us, most people instinctively know that the curtailment of any such right should take place only in circumstances of extreme necessity.</p> <p>We had debates about this recently in this country in the context of Covid and the restrictions on people gathering.  We saw how many people chafed under those restrictions, rightly or wrongly, and did not feel it was the business of the Government to tell them when and where they could assemble and how far from their homes they could do so.  Of course, the Government had a very statable argument: it was about public health, public safety and saving lives.  Most of us sympathised with that and understood it.  Even though there was a conflict of loyalty and many of us intensely disliked the restrictions on our freedom, we knew at the same time that somebody had to legislate for the common good and take decisions, including unpopular ones, to protect us all.</p> <p>To use a phrase I used before, it is part of the democratic contract that we accept the limitations that policies, laws and other measures impose on us, but we do so on the understanding that they are the minimum necessary and do not seek to go further than they need to go.  We do so on the understanding that restrictions are imposed in a transparent way and that, where the approach is concerned, sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  We do so in the knowledge that if my rights are being restricted in the circumstances, so too are the other person's rights.  It is important not to have laws that casually, or otherwise, restrict some people's freedoms more than others.  All these considerations are important in a democracy.  They promote maximum public buy-in to the democracy and maximum public support for the institutions of the State and laws that bind us.</p> <p>I have often said, occasionally when giving talks to schools, that one of the reasons we have two Houses of the Oireachtas is that legislation is a serious business.  It limits our lives, be it criminal justice, environmental protections or the legislation we enact to put the budgetary measures through.  The point is that law governs our life and limits our choices.  We have a D&aacute;il and Seanad to ensure laws are thoroughly considered and that we do not have unforeseen consequences and excessive interference with people's rights and freedoms.  In fact, the balance that law seeks to strike involves being the minimum necessary to promote the good and protect the vulnerable while never going so far as to interfere unnecessarily with people's freedom.  Laws restricting freedom should always be considered with great care, and measures to enact such laws should always be introduced only with great consideration and respect for the public they seek to serve.  The Cathaoirleach Gn&iacute;omhach will not be surprised to hear me say this legislation disrespects all those finer points, delicate balances and important considerations.</p> <p>I do not tend to march myself.  I have the privilege of being an elected representative.  I have often thought that one of the things I am really grateful for is the chance I get to say things in the Oireachtas and speak not only about my own deepest concerns but also on behalf of the many who often thank me for representing their point of view.  That is a great privilege.  It is probably the case that those of us who have this privilege, unless we are seeking to curry electoral favour, do not necessarily have the same urge to get out onto the streets.  This is because we have a chance to speak when the laws come to be made.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many people do not have that chance and they feel disempowered by that sometimes.  They especially feel disempowered if they feel that they matter less in the democracy than other people.</p><p>I first started thinking about marching in earlier decades when terrible things were taking place in the North.  I think back to the events at the Garvaghy Road and we all remember the competing arguments in that context, with people declaring their right to use the public highway.  Of course, we also knew those marches could be extremely intimidating for and disrespectful of people in their home areas.  Those marches were sometimes taking place in areas where most people were opposed to them.  Add in to that experience as well the banging drums, the sectarian slogans and the disrespect for people that some of that marching entailed.  We knew, though, that there was a balance to be struck and that the freedom to use the public highway was not an absolute right.  Even if it was a legal right, then there had to be some kind of negotiated solution to ensure more aspects were considered than just people's legal rights.  I refer to the need to do the work of reconciliation, of encouraging people to accept and understand one another's differing perspectives and preferences and to find some way to adjudicate between those aspirations.  That is why we had the Parades Commission in the North.</p><p>There is no parades commission here.  What we have here is a law that would single out, exclusively, concern about abortion, that concern which many hundreds of thousands of people in our society continue to have.  This proposal says that people could be on the wrong side of the law and caught by the provisions of this legislation if their demonstration, if we want to call it that, march, walk or ambulatory public witness, because people are walking, passes in the vicinity of any kind of facility providing any of these services.  As I asked already, is this sloppy or is it malicious?  Whatever it is, it is fundamentally disrespectful of people's freedom.  Nobody should come in here with proposed legislation that could even accidentally be as draconian as this.  Nobody should do that who cares about democracy, the importance of our hard-won freedoms and people's right to go out and express ideas with which other people disagree.  Those are the only ideas which need to be defended, because there is never a problem with those we all agree on.  Therefore, nobody should come in here with legislation like this and as badly drafted as it is, for whatever reason.  I do not know whether it is deliberate or accidental.</p><p>What I do know is that it will pass, because the powers that be in this country are here to make a point today.  This is yet another example of the draconian sweep of this ill-composed, unfair, mean-minded and disrespectful legislation.  Our amendment attempts to address one aspect of it which concerns people going on a walk.  As I said, even if the amendment were to be successful, there is still much that is harmful and disrespectful of democracy and of people in this legislation.</p></speech>

If the Bill is passed in its current form, garda&iacute; will have full discretion to break up and end any assembly near a safe access zone, as they need only suspect that a person intends to stray into such a zone to clamp down.  It will then be an offence for any person to fail to comply with a direction to leave a vicinity without reasonable cause.  I would be grateful for the words "reasonable cause" if this were a practical guideline that one could follow, but it is not.  How are ordinary persons supposed to know where they stand if garda&iacute; attempt to break up their demonstration?  If a protester in this scenario were to disobey garda&iacute; on foot of what he or she views as a reasonable cause or a reasonable excuse, the protester might potentially have to go through a costly and mentally taxing criminal trial before he or she could be acquitted of wrongdoing.</p> <p>Under this Bill, law-abiding demonstrators can be compelled, under duress, to forgo their right to protest.  It is not just those who are opposed to abortion who are threatened by this legislation.  Section 3 of the Bill prohibits both demonstrators who support and demonstrators who oppose a person's decision to access abortion services.  If this Bill passes, demonstrators campaigning against church ownership of the national maternity hospital could all be arrested and prosecuted if they disobeyed a Garda order to move outside a 100 m safe access zone.  The campaigners for this cause recently picketed outside D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  They had previously demonstrated outside the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital.  It is ironic that a Bill designed to criminalise those seeking to protect the right to life could end up being used against those who campaign against abortion restrictions.  It is a naive voice, indeed, that trumpets in support of censorship while it is in power, not seeing that it is undermining its own freedoms as it does so.</p> <p>If a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sees a crime committed under this Bill, he or she can arrest the person.  The garda does not need any additional powers to direct people as it is already an offence not to follow the order of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This section follows the style of the rest of the Bill.  It is over-reaching, unnecessary and not thought through.  It should be removed.</p></speech>

They are quite happy that the legislation would potentially subject those who would wish to express support for abortion to being caught, if only so they can be seen as being even-handed as they seek to terrorise those who would dare to express opposition to abortion, even in a peaceful way.  It is also worth saying that the legislation already provides, in section 3(3), for offences in respect of the provisions of section 3 and any breaches under subsections (1) and (2) that there would be an offence and that a person would be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding &euro;3,000 or imprisonment for up to a year, and on indictment to a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to five years.</p> <p>However, the Jacobins behind this legislation were not happy with that.  There must be more offences in the Bill and we find them in section 5, whereby garda&iacute; have power to give a direction.  They can give those directions where they suspect with reasonable cause that a person intends to breach any of the provisions of sections 3 or 4.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It needs to be said that in respect of section 4 of this Bill, there is very little with which one could disagree.  The only point I will make is that if this Bill was confined to section 4, the Garda Commissioner has said it is not necessary and that the legislation already exists.  Senator Keogan has pointed to that.  It is the radical intolerance of much of the content of section 3 that has taken up most of our time this afternoon.  Of course, what is in section 3 is also dealt with in the section 5 power the legislation proposes to give to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, because it is where the person intends to breach, is about to breach or is attempting to breach any of the provisions of sections 3 or 4.</p><p>We are back again to the three people having a conversation in the coffee shop, perhaps with somebody who is involved in the provision of abortion services, across the road, but within 100 m or indeed upstairs in the building, which would certainly be within 100 m.  A person may disagree.  There may be a lively discussion about abortion and a person may, in good faith, bring in information about the impact of the abortion law in this country since it was passed.</p><p>This impact includes the lack of precautionary pain relief; the increase in abortion statistics; the failure of the legislation to provide for significant notifications in terms of gathering information about what abortions are taking place or why; the one-sided nature of counselling on abortion brought out by a recent survey of students, which showed the Positive Options people are pretty much shuttling people in the direction of abortion, without giving any serious airtime to positive alternatives to abortion; the absence of any desire at the heart of public policy to reduce the numbers of abortions and the implications that has had for abortion, as it is now taking place in Ireland.</p><p>All these issues were to some degree, albeit in a limited way, ventilated.  There was very little chance to ventilate them during the abortion referendum campaign and little enough opportunity to get any consideration of them during the subsequent legislation in 2018.  Any discussion of these overheard by a Jacobin supporter of abortion rights could lead to a report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and a person being directed to leave immediately that place, get out of the coffee shop and being told one is not allowed discuss abortion or give information about abortion there.</p><p>As little as informing a person concerning issues related to termination of pregnancy services could lead to that.  It is a very low threshold or rather, is it a high or low threshold of intolerance?  What I am trying to say is that one would not need to say very much in order to put oneself the wrong side of the law.</p><p>I refer to the idea that we would give the Garda the power to direct people to leave the premises for having a respectful and reasonable conversation where they bring information into the conversation that is adverse to the provision of abortion services.  Already this morning, I spoke up clearly for the rights of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to do its job, when I deplored the recent European Court of Justice decision about the retention of phone records and the implications that might have for patriotic, painstaking and persistent investigation of crime.  I stand with the right of members of the Garda to do whatever they have to do to keep the peace and to investigate wrongdoing.  However, they have a hard enough job without putting them in the position of having to get involved with something such as this, where no person is being harmed and people are simply exercising their right to free speech.  It is shameful to try to implicate the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into such activity.  It is yet another disrespect in this legislation.  In this case, it is disrespect for the good work that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has to do and does in this country.  Trying to set the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up in opposition, through this legislation and this section, to good people who are not harassing people under section 4 but simply are sharing information out of concern for human life and dignity and are doing so in a way that means ill or harm to no one and putting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into a position where it would have to hustle or harass good people in that situation is nothing short of a disgrace.</p><p>I do not know whether this legislation will pass the D&aacute;il or get the casual support that it had from most sides of this House.  I hope that it will not be so easy when it goes to the D&aacute;il because it will bring the whole Oireachtas into disrepute, not just the Seanad, which is being brought into disrepute today.  However, if the legislation is passed by the D&aacute;il, with or without serious discussion, this is yet another reason it will not last jig time before the Supreme Court.  Were it to do so, should President Higgins refer legislation to the Supreme Court for a ruling on its constitutionality, which surely he would almost certainly have to do under Article 26, it would be a sad day for this country if something as intolerant, disrespectful of diversity and as fascistic as this were to be considered in keeping with the provisions of our Constitution.</p></speech>

Most of the same points regarding the threat of legal action and law abiding demonstrators being compelled to give up their rights to protest under duress also apply to section 6.  The same level of caution the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, exercises before bringing cases to trial does not apply in civil cases.  The fact that activities in relation to our right to protest would not be subject to the standard of guilty until proven innocent, but instead a preponderance of evidence, risks eroding our rights.  It is also worth noting that the risk of financial ruin is greater as a result of section 6 because the right to legal counsel does not exist in civil cases.</p></speech>

That is how I feel when I contemplate the many appalling casual and damaging provisions of this legislation.  I do not know what I should think about the provision of the Bill that states that somebody who is "the victim of the course of conduct in question" may bring a civil claim for any breach under sections 3 or 4 of the Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->First, we are given no guidance.  We are being told, basically, that an area of statutory liability is being established here, a statutory wrong, a tort.  We are not being given any guidance as to what amount of damages might be payable in the event of a breach of this provision, how the damages might be calculated or what evidentiary tests might be necessary in order to establish, presumably on the balance of probabilities, that the tort had been committed.  To realise just how ludicrous, to the point of being very offensive indeed this latest provision is, we only have to consider yet again what an actual or apprehended breach under sections 3 or 4 might be.  The casual conversation whereby a person might offer advice or seek to inform any person concerning any issues related in whatever way to the termination of pregnancy services is a tort.  Of course, our courts are not very busy.  They do not have anything to be doing.  We might as well create another statutory wrong on which the courts can be invited by a claimant to adjudicate.  It is a tort if that mother sitting with her teenager or that pensioner having her cup of coffee, on learning that abortions are taking place upstairs, expresses her sadness at the defeat for humanity that abortion is, and hopes for a better way of dealing with the challenges of a crisis pregnancy, a way that is generous to mothers and their unborn babies, who brings information to people's attention, advising about how wherever abortion has been legalised it has led to a diminished respect for human life and an increase in abortion rates, and increasing demands as well for further ease of access to the procedure and a disregard for questions about the possible cruelties involved in certain abortion procedures.  None of that could ever be discussed, not the mildest, most meek or diffident expression of dissent or any information touching on that dissent could be expressed.  I might attribute it to Senator Seery Kearney because she was the one who expressed doubt that anybody would ever report such a person, but not only can the officious bystander, if we can call them that, to use another legal term, who overhears that report it and ask for the Garda to move the person on but presumably the abortion provider upstairs, when they hear that such a conversation was taking place in breach of this Sinn F&eacute;in and Labour Party-led legislation, could in theory bring an action, hold themselves out as a service provider, as being the victim of this illegal course of conduct.  All that is possible.</p><p>There is possibly some kind of an unintended compliment to the legislators of Texas, and perhaps Idaho, in recent times who have managed to vindicate the life of the unborn by establishing that it can be a civil wrong to provide abortions but that any person might bring such an action.  We all know that it has succeeded at least for the moment, where others have failed, in enacting protections for unborn babies.  There is perhaps some kind of unintended compliment to that approach to law by establishing certain civil wrongs associated with the conduct that the Bill seeks to prohibit.  Perhaps there is an unintentional compliment to all of that in the addition of an extra section here on damages, as broad in its sweep as it is.  Let us be clear: this is not the person who is being harassed under section 4, with whom we would all sympathise; this is anybody who is a service provider or who holds themselves out as a victim, even of casual or intended, respected, accurate speech.</p><p>This is what our democrats here today want to enact in the law of Ireland.  It is probably not as bad as the criminal provisions set out here, because criminal offences are damaging to people's reputations and, where successfully prosecuted, lead to the restriction of their freedom.  We could say when it comes to bringing an action for damages that it is only money, but Senator Keogan has pointed out that it could be the livelihood of a very vulnerable person.  It could be a very impecunious person who could be targeted by this provision.  It is yet another casual cruelty of this legislation that it sets out in its sweep and its scope to oppress anybody who dissents in any way with abortion and who would dare to do so within the prescribed proximity to the facilities, as this legislation sets out.</p></speech>

I have listened to Senator Mullen speak again about how it is a crime for women in our country to seek safe access to having an abortion.  I come from a very religious family and I am very religious myself, but the women of Ireland and Ireland as a whole spoke in 2018.  We voted to repeal the eighth amendment.  In this country, and as a legislator myself, in terms of what we are doing here, we should not be made to feel crap because we want to support women to have safe access to a termination.  We should not have to be made to feel bad about that as women in these Chambers.  I remind Senator Mullen that the people of Ireland voted to repeal the eighth amendment and also that it is not a crime for a woman in this country to seek abortion if she needs or wants to do so.</p> <p>I do not mean to be smart or disrespectful by saying this, but if the granny does not need an abortion and it is nothing to do with her, she should move along and mind her own business.  I do not say that in a bad way or anything, but that is just the truth of it.  I do not mean to undermine Senator Mullen, but if a woman does not want an abortion, she should not have to get one.  If she does not want it, she should not get it but in 2022, we should not look on it as being a crime.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to our activists in the Together for Safety campaign right across the State who have campaigned tirelessly and brilliantly to get us this far.  Of course, we are only halfway through the journey but it is a tremendously good day for the Seanad where people of all parties have come together behind this excellent Bill from Together for Safety, because women and pregnant people should not have to wait one further day to get safe access zones so they can access the services that they have a right to since the referendum to repeal in 2018.</p> <p>I salute everybody here today for co-operating so well.  This is a good day for democracy and it is a good day for the Seanad.  Let us wish a very swift passage of the Bill through the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I want to address the comment made earlier that we are looking at a hegemony here: we are not.  People do have different views regarding a large number of issues.  I also draw Members' attention to the fact that Deputy Neasa Hourigan and I wrote to the women's caucus back in September looking for progress on the Government's safe access zones Bill, because that is a core part of our programme for Government.  It is a key commitment for us in the Green Party but I am aware it is a key commitment across Government.  When we brought this letter forward to the women's caucus, while there were women with a variety of views on abortion it was interesting that everyone agreed on safe access zones.  We do not want our hospitals to be battlegrounds.  That is fundamentally what this is about.</p> <p>In all of the contributions where dangerous language is being used around fascism and all of those things it shows that this is exactly what can happen when one does not have safe access zones.  We have seen it in the US.  We need to stop and ensure that our society does not turn into that.  People have had their say, we had a referendum in 2018, and regardless of what one's views are on that, I believe that we are united, certainly across Government, when it comes to safe access zones, and across the majority of the Opposition.</p> <p>This is something we have all worked on together.  I commend Senators Gavan and Moynihan for their work, and also to the activists who are here today.  I feel very passionately that we need an update on where the Government is on this.  I have asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, for this previously and now I also ask, respectfully, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for an update.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-04-07a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022040700002#KK00700"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it for her presence here.  I remember feeling real sorrow when the eighth amendment was repealed and deleted from our Constitution.  I thought that something really good, which recognised the dignity of everybody in our society, had been lost.  I felt sorrow when the quite wide-ranging legislation for abortion passed subsequently.  At the time I said, and I will say again today, that there is a generation of people of all ages coming forward who see clearly that the dignity of the human person is a fundamental value for a civilised society, and that once we start excluding categories of people from the protection of society and the protection of the law, that we have gone down a bad road.  Those people are to be commended for the work they continue to do.  It is not primarily outside facilities where abortions are taking place that one sees their good work.  We see their good work in the many exchanges with friends, colleagues and family members in colleges and so on, where they seek to advance a vision of authentic human rights that leaves nobody behind.  That, essentially, is what the pro-life position is about.  It is caring for mothers and caring for babies.</p> <p>What we see here today is the negative outworking of the repeal, or some aspect of the negative outworking of the repeal of the eighth amendment, and the subsequent abortion legislation.  At the time I wondered, and I continue to wonder and many of us continue to wonder, how far are those who want to secure abortion rights willing to go?  The demand is for ever more restrictions on dissent.  That is a very sad thing for our democracy.  I do not believe that we are going to become a dictatorship overnight, but I use the words "flirting with fascism", which I used very carefully, because there are overtones of fascism around any attempt to curtail the respectful free expression of ideas.  It does not happen in any other area.  There is a particular worrying intolerance in those quarters that had the majority on their sides and which got the legislation that they wanted, but we have politicians here today pandering to what is actually now a very intolerant element in our society.</p> <p>The people whose freedom to express a different idea, which is an authentic vision of human rights that includes everybody, does include some of the grannies of Ireland and the mothers.  I was very sorry to hear them spoken of so disrespectfully today.  It was from my mother, not from any bishop or religious leader, that I gained the pro-life sensibility that I believe is essential for a civilised society.  She is a nurse.  Another relative of mine was a nurse in Scotland and she told me of her experience of seeing abortions happening over there.  I will never forget the moment when she described it as the tick, tick, tick of the little unborn child, in a late term pregnancy situation, expiring after an abortion.  These things happen in our world and nobody wants to talk about them.</p> <p>We have this lopsided debate where people rightly concern themselves with the vulnerability of those in crisis pregnancy, and we should all concern ourselves to address and assist in that area.  I have spent a lot of my political career stressing that point.  However, there is a complete absence and invisibility and the refusal to consider the humanity of the unborn, which sticks out remarkably and is a real indictment of our society.  Nobody ever talks about the unborn child, who he or she is, what potential he or she has to make a fantastic contribution to the world, and what is lost when an abortion takes place.  It is not to judge any other person to talk about the tragedy of that.  It is to seek to find better ways for the future.</p></speech>

Let us be honest; there are other Members of this House who have the same concerns that Senator Keogan and I have.  We should all ask ourselves what it says about our democracy that only two Members would stand for any of these votes.  Many of the Government politicians will canvass people and express private sympathy with their concerns about this.  They will stand outside churches and canvass since Members are talking about religious people.  Let us accept that it is more than two out of 60 as a percentage of our society who have a concern with this draconian legislation.</p> <p>I was going to make the point that there was a time when people like the Clintons talked about abortion being safe, legal and rare.  It is worth noting that such language is not allowed now.  In the established view one is not allowed to suggest that abortions should be rare because that is somehow to admit that abortions are regrettable.  That is how things have disimproved in our society as a measure of the extent to which the claims of the unborn for our care and attention should be allowed to be ventilated.  I will conclude with that but I make no apologies for expressing my concern in detail about a Bill which reflects a fundamental denial of respect for human dignity.  It is a shame on us all, I hope it does not pass the D&aacute;il and I will be fairly confident that the Supreme Court will have no truck with it.</p></speech>

It is gut-wrenching to hear Senator Mullen talk about fascism.  To describe this Bill as fascist is completely disingenuous and he should retract those comments.  We know the people have campaigned and the people decided on the repeal of the eighth amendment during a long national discourse.  This legislation is warranted and necessary because it is never appropriate in any shape or form to harass pregnant women or persons trying to access medical treatment.  I want to again thank the Senators who brought this legislation before the House and the activists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-04-07a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022040700002#LL01600"><p>I did not speak earlier because I did not want to impede the passage of this legislation within the specific time.  However, because of filibustering in the Chamber, we had to go over time.  This debate and the result of it are important but I also want to acknowledge that the Minister of State had an important meeting at 3.30 p.m., which she postponed to be able to stay with us.  I want to acknowledge the Minister of State's time and commitment to dealing with this right through to the final outcome, which means the Bill has passed.</p> <p>I want to thank those who led on this, particularly Senator Gavan.  I was pleased to join with Together for Safety for the photocall outside of Leinster House to show the cross-party support for this, which was important.  No one should be harassed, insulted or intimidated in any way when accessing healthcare services in our country.  A right of access applies to women who need to access termination or abortion services.  The will of the people was made clear in the referendum and I know Senator Mullen was trying to rerun the referendum several times today.  We have a duty to act on the will of the people and ensure that everyone who needs to access vital and legal healthcare has the opportunity to do so.  To use talk about dictatorship, flirting with fascism, Ministers pandering and negative outworking from repeal is repulsive.</p> <p>We have all heard stories and read newspapers and we have listened to stories today of how people have been intimidated.  There is clear evidence that anti-choice protests and activities are adversely affecting women's ability to access healthcare, including abortion care, freely and without interference.  There is also evidence that demonstrates that healthcare providers are being adversely affected.  The point has been made that freedom of speech is a cornerstone of any democracy, including ours, and I fully support individuals' right to associate and speak their minds.  However, no one has the right to block another person's access to vital healthcare.  Every person in this State has a right to attend a medical appointment, whatever it is, free from fear, intimidation and harassment.  We must provide compassionate and dignified termination of pregnancy services and the most important aspect of that is that women accessing the service can do so with certainty about the quality and safety of the care they receive.  We owe that to the women of Ireland because we have not always treated them with the respect and dignity they deserve.  As a society we have not always valued women in a meaningful way and that it is as true of healthcare as it is of any other sector of Irish society.</p></speech>

We are not going away when it comes to this.  We will continue to fight for free, legal, safe and local abortion.  The Senator might think he can run down the clock and put a chilling effect on Members in this Chamber, activists outside or healthcare providers but he cannot do so.  We are passionate about allowing women access to basic healthcare because abortion is healthcare.  The Senator will not intimidate us out of doing that.</p></speech>

I am a proud Member of the Seanad today and it is one of my proudest days in the last two years.  I can now be a proud woman and gender equality activist in saying that women in our country will feel a little bit safer in having access to healthcare services without feeling intimidated.  I want to make a note to Senator Mullen.  I respect what he says in that we cannot judge all people.  We cannot judge women or pregnant people who need to seek abortion.</p></speech>

People have different opinions on abortion and no one denies that.  It is reasonable that people take their own personal views on it and there is no objection to that.  However, feeling entitled because of one's personal views to stand, even silently, outside of a clinic, a general practice or a hospital in a manner intended to inhibit a woman or pregnant person's right to choose to go in there to terminate a pregnancy for one's personal choice and reasons is a sinister act.  There is no question of that.  We have heard characterisations today that are beneath this House and its honour.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=07"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have heard terms such as "fascism".  When we look at the news we see what happens when organisations and countries such as Russia think they can influence other democracies.  In June last year the European parliamentary forum for sexual and reproductive rights, of which some Members of the House are members, published the Tip of the Iceberg report.  It spoke about funding coming from Russian oligarchs to organisations throughout Europe, including organisations in this country that have taken anti-gay rights stances and pro-life stances.  People should look up the Tip of the Iceberg report.  It is fascinating to see the organisations that are funded.  When we stand up here and speak about fascism we need to be very careful that our associates are not equally involved and that those whom people think are on the pro-life end of things are not involved and being funded.</p></speech>

I thank my colleagues.  It takes work as an Independent to table amendments.  All of the arguments I have made today in favour of the amendments are valid.  They certainly were not made to run down the clock.  I take my work very seriously.  My only issue is to protect the right to assembly, the right to protest and our right to prayer in public places.  As long as there is breath in me I will defend these rights.</p></speech>

I thank Senators Gavan and Moynihan for tabling the Bill and working so tirelessly to get it to where we are today.  I acknowledge that amendments have been tabled and debate was allowed on them.  This is democracy at its best and it was all facilitated.</p> <p>I am taking this Bill on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  He apologises for not being here as I explained earlier.  The Acting Chairperson asked a question when she was contributing from the floor.  From speaking to the Minister and his officials I know that in the past two weeks, and the Senator is aware of it, they have met the health committee and there is progress on crafting the legislation.  A powerful debate has taken place here in pulling it all together.  I hear the respect of all parties and other Members in support of safe access to health care with nobody being intimidated so people are able to access healthcare facilities.  I am delighted to be here to facilitate debate.  I was supposed to meet Brain Injury Ireland and it is important to acknowledge that meeting was dropped and Brain Injury Ireland facilitated me being present for this debate.  If the Minister were here he would have wanted to ensure the Bill completed its passage through the House and I thank the Seanad for allowing it.  I also acknowledge the work of the people in the Gallery.  They have been here for the past number of hours and have seen democracy at its best.  As Senator O'Loughlin said, they have engaged over a long period of time on this issue and I acknowledge their presence.</p></speech>
