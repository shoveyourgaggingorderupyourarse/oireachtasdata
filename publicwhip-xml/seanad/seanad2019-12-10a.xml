She is very welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-12-10a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019121000002#B00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I want to discuss terms, conditions and pay in the hospitality sector and the need for the Government to be much more proactive in trying to establish a joint labour committee in the sector.  I have raised this with a number of the Minister of State's colleagues and I will ask her some of the same questions.  I regret to say I did not get any answers on previous occasions, but I am optimistic today.</p> <p>I will get straight to the heart of this issue.  The average rate of pay in the hospitality sector according to the Government's CSO statistics for June this year is &euro;12.54 per hour, a figure which includes the highest paid people in the sector.  The bulk of the people in the sector, that is, the people who are changing our beds, serving our drinks and working behind counters get considerably less than &euro;12.54 per hour.  For the large part, they are earning the minimum wage or just above it.  A EUROSTAT comparison done by Michael Taft showed that compared with people working in hospitality in other parts of the EU, our people would need a 50% pay rise just to gain equity with them.  I have stated these statistics because I am sometimes told I have picked some bad examples.  These are the statistics for the hospitality sector as a whole.  People in the sector are paid 50% less than their European counterparts.</p> <p>The terms and conditions in the sector are pretty appalling.  I will give one example from the best hotel in Limerick, which I will not name.  A contract states, in respect of a working week, that, "As a casual employee your hours will be communicated to you by the departmental rota."  In other words, people do not know what hours they are working from one week to the next.  I checked with some colleagues in hotels last week whether this is still the case, and nothing has changed since new legislation was introduced.  Not only are hotel workers paid appallingly, most of the time they do not know what hours they will work from one week to the next.</p> <p>I will read out some of the details of the findings of an independent research study by Dr. Deirdre Curran from NUI Galway on how people are treated in the sector: 76% of respondents to the survey said they experienced verbal abuse sometimes or often; 64% of workers in the hospitality sector said they experienced psychological abuse sometimes or often; 15% said they experienced physical abuse sometimes or often; 52% said they do not get the breaks they are entitled to; 42% said they had no written record of their contract term; 16% said they had no access to payslips; 55% said they had witnessed or experienced harassment based on sexuality, age or race, I know the Minister of State will be aware that most of the people we are talking about in the sector are women; 63% said they had experienced or witnessed bullying; and 48% said they had no voice or access to union representation.  </p> <p>My point is that we need action from the Government.  We cannot let this appalling treatment of workers continue in the sector.  I hope the Minister of State will have something positive to say today. </p></speech>

I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys.  As we know, joint labour committees are bodies established to provide machinery for fixing statutory minimum rates of pay and conditions of employment for employees across certain sectors.  They are composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers and workers in an employment sector.  The committee meets under an independent chairman and industrial relations officers of the Workplace Relations Commission appointed by the relevant Minister to discuss and agree proposals for terms and conditions to apply to specified grades or categories of workers in the sector concerned.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If agreement is reached on the terms and conditions the joint labour committee, JLC, publishes the details and invites submissions from interested parties.  After consideration of the submissions, the committee accepts the proposals.  It then submits them to the Labour Court for consideration.  The court will then make a recommendation to the Minister and, providing the correct procedures under the legislation have been followed by the court, an order known as an employment regulation order, ERO, will be signed into law.  There are currently eight JLCs in place.  Of these, two are relevant to the hospitality sector, one is in the hotels industry and one is in the catering industry.</p><p>Separately, sectoral employment orders, SEOs, set out the terms and conditions for workers in the economic sector to which they apply.  There are currently three SEOs in place in the construction, electrical contracting and mechanical engineering sectors.  The process to put an SEO in place begins when a request is formally made to the Labour Court under the legislation to review the terms and conditions for workers in a particular economic sector.  A request to the Labour Court can be made separately or jointly by organisations that substantially represent employers or workers, such as a trade union or an employers' body.  Again, the role of the Minister is to ensure that the Labour Court has followed the procedures set out in legislation.  I must emphasise the voluntary nature of Ireland's approach to industrial relations.  Our role is to provide a statutory framework within which parties can come together voluntarily.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-12-10a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019121000002#C00200"><p>I appreciate that the Minister of State is standing in for a colleague, but that is a particularly disappointing response.  I am aware of the statutory framework.  The fact of the matter is that the employer bodies have refused to engage with it.  That begs a question to which no-one has been able to give me an answer.  If someone works in the hospitality sector, how does he or she get a pay rise?  I have not heard anyone explain that to me.  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor will be the third Minister I have asked.  I have had no response whatsoever.  I have reeled off statistics to show the appalling rates of pay.  These are Government statistics.  This is not a handful of hotels, but a statistical representation of the sector.  There are appalling rates of pay, appalling terms and conditions and precarious work, but the members of the Government appear to be sitting with their arms folded, saying it is nothing to do with them.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

I emphasise the voluntary nature of Ireland's long-standing approach to industrial relations, including the JLCs.  I nearly said "language" there because it was in my head.  I was previously before the Seanad to speak about English language schools.  I was the one who proposed an employment regulation order for teachers in English language schools.  I am not sure if the Senator knows about that.</p></speech>

To return to the Senator's question, it is the role of the State to ensure an appropriate legislative process.  We have a strong suite of legislation covering employment rights in areas such as minimum rates of pay.  Regarding the area I was in charge of, I am really proud that I put an ERO in place, working with the various stakeholders and the Labour Court.  I am really glad I was the one who proposed it and we now have that order for English language schools.</p></speech>

Most people and most families would like to own their own home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a credible ambition for most people.  Unfortunately, under the tenant purchase scheme, people who live in what are called Part V houses, that is, houses provided under Part V of the legislation, are excluded from that option.  This clearly discriminates against those who live in such properties.  Amending the tenant purchase scheme would facilitate a positive transfer of wealth to a section of society which does not always have the opportunity to purchase a home.  There are more than 4,000 Part V houses in the country, of which approximately 160 are in counties Monaghan and Cavan.  I have been contacted by many young families who are heartbroken because those living in Part V houses are prohibited from buying out their home under the tenant purchase scheme.  Unfortunately, the dream of owning their home is out of their reach until this scheme is amended.  </p><p>Not everyone living in a Part V house will wish to purchase their home but the legislation needs to be amended for those who wish to do so.  I know of many families who, when allocated a Part V house a number of years ago, did not realise the legislation prevented them from buying their property.  In many housing estates around the country people in Part V houses living alongside other local authority tenants see neighbouring tenants who wish to buy their properties do so, while they are not allowed that luxury.</p><p>The sale of Part V houses would generate much needed income for the State which could be ring-fenced for housing in each local authority area.  It would also save local authorities money in the long run as there would be no need for ongoing maintenance.  I earnestly ask that the Government change the regulations to allow people in Part V houses to purchase them if they wish to do so.  Those who dream of owning their own home, many of whom have spent money on the houses they rent and are keeping them very well, would like the option to purchase.</p><p>I raised this issue 12 months ago and the Minister of the day indicated a report on the tenant purchase scheme was imminent and would be published shortly.  That was November last year and we are still waiting for that report to be published.  I would like the Minister of State, if possible, to give us an update on the report and provide assurance to those people living in Part V houses that the dream of owning their own home, if they wish to purchase their home, will be within reach.</p><p>I also ask the Minister of State to comment on the position regarding people living in houses provided by social housing bodies as I understand they are also prohibited from purchasing their properties.  I ask her to comment on the thresholds for those who qualify for social housing.  There are some discussions under way in that respect.  I understand the thresholds will be raised, as they must be, to allow more people to avail of social housing or local authority housing, where possible.  I look forward to the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.</p></speech>

The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is unavailable today and has asked me to take this matter on his behalf.</p> <p>The Housing (Sale of the Local Authority Houses) Regulations 2015 provide the basis for the tenant incremental purchase scheme for existing local authority houses.  The scheme, as the Senator will know, is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum and having been in receipt of social housing support for at least one year.</p> <p>The 2015 regulations governing this scheme provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2284"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2284&amp;amp;pid=MaryMitchellOConnor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These include: houses provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act, as amended; houses specifically designed for older persons; group Traveller housing; and houses provided to facilitate people with disabilities transferring from institutional care to community-based living.  The provisions in Part V of the Act, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed-tenure, sustainable communities.  Under the terms of the tenant incremental purchase scheme 2016, Part V homes, regardless of when they were tenanted, are excluded in order to ensure that homes delivered under this mechanism will remain available for people in need of social housing support and that the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time.</p><p>The continued development of mixed-tenure communities remains very important in promoting social integration.  Local authorities may, within the provisions of the regulations, exclude certain houses which in their opinion should not be sold for reasons such as proper stock or estate management.  It is a matter for each individual local authority to administer the scheme in its operational area with the overarching provisions of the governing legislation for the scheme and in a manner appropriate to its housing requirements.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this matter does not relate to her brief.  The reply is disappointing.  If I were to rewind the clock 12 months, I would have got a similar reply.  It is disappointing for those who are waiting for the review and the recommendations of the Government to be published.  For those who aspire to own their own homes, and who are currently in Part V housing, the dream is still beyond them.</p> <p>I derive some hope from the final paragraph of the reply, which states that the intent is to bring the measures of reform to the Government very shortly or in the near future.   Perhaps she will clarify this.  Could she give me the Government's definition of what constitutes "the near future"?  What period are we talking about, bearing in mind that the lifetime of this Government is, according to the Taoiseach, due to come to an end by May?  Perhaps the Minister of State can give me a timeframe for when the Government intends to bring the new measures forward.</p></speech>

We are here to talk about Rush Garda station once again.  I have been raising this matter constantly over the past couple of years.  Rush is a town in north County Dublin and it has a population of approximately 10,000.  It is growing rapidly.  Its Garda station was closed in early 2012, causing great disappointment and shock among the people of the town and surrounding area.  The surrounding towns - Lusk, Skerries and Donabate - are also expanding rapidly so there is a great need for better and more frequent policing in the area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The closure of Rush Garda station came as a blow to the town.  The people of Rush demanded it be reopened and in November 2017, it was announced it would be one of the Garda stations to be reopened following a period of refurbishment and upgrading.</p><p>We were told the refurbishment and upgrading would be complete by the end of July 2019 and the Garda station would move from the hands of the Office of Public Works, OPW, to those of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which would be responsible for staffing and opening it.  We were then told it would happen at the end of September of this year, but it is now the middle of December and Rush Garda station has still not reopened.  It has been refurbished and looks great from the outside.  The works were ongoing for a number of months and people want to know what is causing the hold-up, why the refurbishment appears to have stalled and why the station has not been handed over.  Has the work been done and will the station be handed over soon?  If so, when will it reopen?</p></speech>

A brief of requirements for Rush Garda station was received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in early 2018.  The OPW undertook an assessment of all stations identified in the pilot programme of stations reopening, based on the Garda brief of requirements received.  The OPW undertook a technical survey of the station and building condition reports were completed.  In April 2018, the OPW advised An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the works required and the indicative costs involved.</p> <p>In July 2018, the OPW received confirmation from the Department of Justice and Equality that funding was available and conveyed instructions to proceed with the implementation of the reopening of the six pilot Garda stations, including that in Rush.  Following the procurement process, work on the site commenced in August 2019 and was due to be completed by the end of September 2019.  The contract completion date was extended by agreement to 25 October 2019, due to delays in the delivery of installation of new external doors and windows.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the ESB connection was reactivated.  The works requirements were submitted to the ESB and are being scheduled in accordance with the ESB workload.  It is hoped the execution of the works will take place in the near future.  All other works have finished, and the handover of the building to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will take place as soon as the ESB connection has been completed.  The exact date for the opening of the station will be an operational matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

I hope the station will be handed over soon, ideally before the end of the year.  A great deal of wonderful work has taken place, as the Senator rightly noted, but sometimes the work is out of our control and in the hands of contractors.  The ESB, in particular, has an overload of work but it has given a commitment to being on site as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is important that Cork, in conjunction with other cities and large towns, have access to PrEP and its availability be widespread.  The availability of PrEP is just one part of a sexual health programme, along with the excellent work done by the Sexual Health Centre in Cork to provide rapid HIV testing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government has announced a national programme around HIV PrEP.  Roll out of the programme in Cork is sadly awaited.  Cork is a designated centre for this programme in the south.  This means that people will travel to Cork to avail of the service but we have been waiting for it for the past month.  Funding is available which means the provision of PrEP under the sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme should be expedited as a matter of urgency.  It is already available in Dublin and Limerick.  If it is administered and available outside Dublin, then it is important it is made available in Cork.</p><p>The Minister of State will be aware Cork University Hospital recently opened the Galtee suite providing a new space for HIV care in Cork.  This significant positive development is to be welcomed.  It is the first time a designated space will be available in Cork University Hospital for HIV treatment.  Arising from that, it is about putting in place pathways and access to care for people.  I commend all those involved in working on sexual health and HIV in Cork University Hospital.</p><p>This is an important matter, particularly at a time when HIV figures are increasing and the Department of Health has invested significantly in this area.  It is about assisting the work done by the Cork Gay Project and the Cork Sexual Health Centre.  I commend all those in the Cork Sexual Health Centre, under the directorship of Martin Davoren, for their work.  For example, the rapid HIV testing saw 1,000 people in Cork tested.  It is not just about going in and out to get tested.  It is about a discussion around the whole issue of sexual activity and ensuring there is a referral pathway.  This programme is important.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State and access to PrEP being rolled out promptly.</p></speech>

This was evidenced by the publication of the National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020, the first major strategy to tackle this vital area.  We have made good progress with implementation of the strategy since 2015.  The Department of Health, along with the HSE's sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme, has worked hard to build important partnerships with a range of community and voluntary groups, all of which are working with us to implement a range of important sexual health initiatives.  We will begin work on a new strategy in 2020.</p> <p>One area of concern to us all continues to be the rise in new diagnoses of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.  This year has seen several major actions launched to combat these rising rates of infection.  In June, Ireland formally became a member of the HIV fast-track cities initiative, a major global partnership committed to accelerating local HIV/AIDS responses.  Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway have joined this network with &euro;450,000 in funding provided in 2019 for the implementation of local actions, such as increased access to HIV testing.  Cork Sexual Health Centre has benefitted from this funding allocation.</p> <p>The most significant development this year has been the introduction of a national programme of HIV PrEP.  This involves the pre-emptive use of anti-retroviral medication to prevent HIV infection within a holistic prevention service which includes regular monitoring and testing, as well as advice and counselling on safer sex practices.  Funding was provided in 2019 to services which met national standards and were ready to commence a service.  Since 4 November, eight public sexual health services in Dublin, Portlaoise, Galway, Limerick and Waterford have commenced providing a HIV PrEP programme.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A number of private providers who meet national standards for PrEP have also been approved.  Funding of &euro;5.4 million has been secured for 2020 to allow a full national roll-out of a high quality, holistic programme and fund the additional staff and other resources required to provide HIV PrEP within a broader sexual health and HIV prevention programme.  I am pleased to inform the Senator that funding has been approved for a HIV PrEP service in Cork University Hospital, CUH.  Cork University Hospital has been providing HIV services for over 20 years.  Over that time the services have developed and currently provide care to approximately 700 people with HIV.  As part of the ongoing developments in CUH, a PrEP clinic will commence shortly.  The recruitment of the necessary personnel to support this development has commenced and currently is progressing.  A PrEP service in CUH is therefore expected to start in February 2020.</p></speech>

We had been promised 4 November.  It is important that we instill confidence in the service to augment and support the work being done locally and that February is not an arbitrary date, but one that can be met.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State and the Department to ensure that it is met.</p></speech>

I am glad he has welcomed the funding and I commend him for his work on this issue.  In addition to the important initiatives on sexual health which I outlined in my opening statement, I would like to conclude by providing some further information on other measures being taken in this important area of health and well-being.</p> <p>A key element in the prevention of infection is condom use.  The national condom distribution service works directly with at-risk groups and in 2018 the service provided 409,000 condoms to 67 organisations working with at-risk groups.  This service is currently being expanded to provide services to third level students, by way of condom dispensing machines on third level campus facilities.</p> <p>A particular focus of the sexual health strategy is on equipping our young people with the knowledge and skills to meet the challenges of relationships and sexual health.  I will also bring the Senator's message on the February date back to the Minister, Deputy Harris.</p></speech>

The Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, said at the weekend that garda&iacute; respond to approximately 30,000 domestic incident calls each year.  This equates to between 500 and 600 such calls each week.  Given that domestic abuse is characterised by silence, I suspect that these figures are the tip of the iceberg and that far more domestic violence and domestic abuse is occurring in Irish homes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Between 2016 and 2018, there were 40 domestic homicides.  During the same period, which was bloody in the context of gangland crime, there were only 26 gangland related homicides.  While I do not mean to diminish that lower figure, we should be focusing on domestic violence and homicides within the home much more.  These figures are very stark.<br/><br/>The offence of coercive control was added to the Statute Book a couple of years ago.  Initially, the Government was not in favour of that move but it will significantly help people who are in abusive situations.  However, more education is needed in order to highlight the signs of coercive control, not just for the Garda but also for people working in schools, health facilities and communities.  They all need to know the signs of coercive control and we need a wider public discussion on what constitutes such control.  We need to know how to spot it and we need to teach children in school what it is so that when they grow up and enter relationships, they will be able to identify it from an early stage.<br/><br/>That leads me on to the need for a serious discussion on the progress of the promised family law complex at Hammond Lane.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions since my election to the Seanad.  Last October, the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality recommended that funding be allocated as a matter of urgency in order to allow this complex to be built.  A coalition of 11 groups has formed Courting Disaster, which was launched in Dublin earlier today.  The 11 groups involved in the coalition are: Barnardos; the Children's Rights Alliance; Community Law &amp;amp; Mediation; the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre; the Family Lawyers Association of Ireland; Free Legal Advice Centres; the National Women's Council of Ireland; One Family; the Council of the Bar of Ireland; the Law Society of Ireland; and Women's Aid.  This coalition was established to seek action on the delivery of the family law complex at Hammond Lane.  Some of the most vulnerable people in society are accessing the courts and are seeking their help in resolving some serious issues in the context of access, maintenance, custody and childcare and their protection in cases of domestic violence.<br/><br/>The family law courts are unfit for purpose.  They are really in a bad state and I say that as someone who was a practising family lawyer until recently.  There are no meeting spaces and there is no privacy for people.  We have a huge hole in the ground near the Four Courts in respect of which action and delivery are needed.  That is not mention what is happening in the context of the District Court and the sittings thereof in towns, such as Swords and Balbriggan, in the constituency in which I live.  The courthouses in those locations have completely inadequate facilities and the people working there are meeting their clients on the streets in the rain.  I raised this issue last December after a judge was held hostage in the family law court and a man threatened to use an explosive device.  Four years ago, at the same time of year, a judge was assaulted in Dolphin House.  This lack of facilities is causing great distress.  Family law proceedings are held <i>in camera</i>.  They are often forgotten and they are certainly forgotten by this Government.  We need action now and we need that family law complex delivered.</p></speech>

Interestingly, the Finnish Government's coalition now has five women leaders who are all under the age of 40.  It will be interesting to see how business in the Finnish Parliament progresses in the coming months.</p> <p>I also want to mark the passing of Paul Anthony McDermott, a wonderful barrister and a great author.  He will be sadly missed for his interviews on RT&Eacute; in which he made complex matters simple for people.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p> <p>There has been much discussion about the FAI in recent days and months.  I received a communication last night that I find deeply disturbing because it would appear that not everything is out in the open.  A number of questions relating to the FAI remain unanswered, such as how much has the association received in grant support for the senior league, licence compliance, underage development, disability football, football for the deaf, women's football and numerous programmes  Were these moneys used for the purposes they were intended or were they used to pay wages and service debt?  The maths do not stack up.  For example, the Irish Football Association in Northern Ireland received its annual licence compliance grant and distributed it to clubs to assist them.  In the case of the FAI, I understand that board members were never told how much the FAI received or where the money went.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also understand that the regional development officers who were part paid by local authorities, were employed to promote the game and assist clubs, but again, I understand that this was never done.  The development officers were forced to sell summer camps, training camps and other activities that would enhance the FAI's revenue stream.  Development programmes within the FAI fell to clubs, parents and sponsors, which is an absolute disgrace.  I am informed that everything within the FAI in the past ten years was about revenue generation to service debt that was unsustainable.  Now football at all levels is on its knees and will take a long time to recover.  There is now a major concern that regional development officer will be laid off as local authorities will no longer fund those programmes.  We need assurances on the matter.</p><p>I am informed that the FAI had a rule that all potential club sponsors must in the first instance be passed by FAI headquarters.  Once the FAI headquarters became aware of a potential sponsor for a club, people from headquarters - I am not sure who they were - would approach the sponsor and seek to do a deal on corporate seats or whatever it took to get the money directly into the FAI and away from the club for which it was intended.  What has been happening in the past ten years is that the FAI used every club, player, coach, parent and everybody else as a revenue source while putting nothing back into the game.  At one stage, I understand that the financial director tried to resign but was told he would have to stay on to present the financial report at the AGM.  He resigned while everybody was away in Armenia.  Rumour at the top table was that he was assured the FAI had met its target of selling corporate seats in the Aviva Stadium so the FAI could draw down money from the bank.  This target had never been met.  He felt his integrity was compromised and he was not willing to stand over a set of accounts he did not believe in.</p><p>What went on in the FAI has destroyed people's faith in the sporting world in Ireland, in particular when we see how some senior people walked away with greatly enhanced moneys in their pocket while clubs are starving.

I gather Virgin Media is also now offering union busting at no extra cost, unless of course one happens to be one of the 400 employees in its call centre in Limerick.  Management has decided to run roughshod over a collective agreement reached in 2008.  It has ignored a Labour Court recommendation for a pay increase and is apparently trying to tear up an agreement on redundancy payments.  I heard a horror story this morning of employees being told that they were being made redundant and that they could sign up to the company's new offer, which is half that of the old offer agreed with the union, by 5 p.m. that day or else just receive statutory payments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is what is happening in Virgin Media today.  Somehow, I doubt it will be covered on "The Tonight Show".  Staff voted overwhelmingly for industrial action.  It is an appalling way to treat people at any time, but particularly in an age when one would expect media companies to treat people with respect.  It is part of a bigger story in terms of what is happening in communications and media.  I understand the staff, apart from being very angry, are absolutely resolute in resisting the imposition of redundancies and the refusal to implement a Labour Court pay increase, and have voted to take industrial action up to and including strike action.  I call on Virgin Media to act as a responsible employer and sit down and engage meaningfully with its staff, rather than head into the industrial chaos which will follow.  </p><p>I want to raise the related issue of Lyric FM.  It has been discussed in recent weeks but we have heard nothing since.  I spoke to Lyric FM staff today who told me they still have not received any information from RT&Eacute; about the projected cost savings in Limerick.  From an industrial relations point of view, that is completely unacceptable.  We seem to have an agreement across the Chamber that it is wrong to close the Lyric FM office in Limerick, yet RT&Eacute; is not sharing the proposed cost savings because they amount to a hill of beans.  We need political responsibility and I call on the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, to come to the Chamber and explain where he stands on the issue of closing Lyric FM in Limerick.  It is not good enough for him to fold his hands and say it is up to RT&Eacute;.  The people of Limerick will not stand for it.  </p></speech>

I was horrified to hear the stories of what some women have gone through and their horrendous pain and fatigue.  Some remained undiagnosed for years.  As it was a woman's health issue, the way these women were treated was awful.  Endometriosis is estimated to affect between 2% and 10% of all women in the general population.  That means over 100,000 women in Ireland are affected.  The stories told by the women were very upsetting.  The life of a very good friend of mine was destroyed by endometriosis in many ways.  Her work was affected, she was constantly exhausted and the pain she went through impacted many relationships in her life.</p> <p>Those giving the briefing wanted to highlight the issue.  It was almost like a breath of fresh air.  I felt it was time this issue was highlighted.  I call on the Government to examine education on this issue in schools.  Funding healthcare for women with endometriosis is vital, as is funding proper research into the disease.

Last week we had a Commencement debate about crime and the impact of drugs in our cities, especially in disadvantaged areas.  There has now been a crisis in the FAI.  I am not going anywhere dangerous with this, so the Cathaoirleach can relax.  The outlet for many young people in disadvantaged areas is training three nights a week and a football game at the weekend.  That is a healthy outlet for young people.  It burns off energy and builds social skills through working with groups.  Many football clubs are very important in the south inner city, and so are the development officers.  We have touched on this.  It is not about the summer camps.  Development officers do important work training coaches, building up expertise in the community and developing coaching skills among so many volunteers.  The things that happened regarding governance and the money paid to the chief executive were not victimless crimes.</p></speech>

My fear is that those services will be lost.  I want to have a constructive dialogue about this.  I believe there is a way to fund the development officers and their important work, even if we need a short-term measure to make sure services are maintained within those disadvantaged areas.  Development officers are not on huge money.  Their average salary is between &euro;35,000 and &euro;43,000 a year.  It is not a huge gap to get over for a couple of months.  It has to be sorted out.  Disadvantaged communities cannot be the ones that pay the price.</p> <p>I welcome the action the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has already taken and the funding he has put into the women's international team.  That money has been ring-fenced so it does not go into the black hole of FAI debt.  The Minister has acted responsibly.  I am disappointed that the FAI will not be attending tomorrow's committee meeting organised by Deputy O'Dowd.  I compliment the Chair of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport for organising it.  At the very least it would have given the opportunity for senior members of the FAI to come in and apologise.  One word that has not been used as of yet is "apology".  I am talking about an apology to the many parents, volunteers and players in the League of Ireland and in our local parks day in and day out.  They have been betrayed.  I do not use that word lightly.  Let An Garda carry out its investigations, but let us work together to ensure that the supports for disadvantaged areas, the development officers and the coaches, are kept in place.  We must work in a constructive manner to put a structure in place to allow that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not know whether that should be done by way of a debate in the House or in committee.

We need more houses built from timber grown in Irish forests to help us reach our climate change targets.  We grow trees faster than anywhere else and we need to put this timber to work in our built environment.  Houses, apartments, offices and schools could all be built with timber.  A modest residential extension could easily lock up 3,000 or 4,000 tonnes of carbon.  Advances in science during the past ten years have made durable timber buildings possible and these could be at the heart of our national building programme.  Timber is a material that absorbs rather than emits carbon.  Our forests absorb 3.8 million tonnes of carbon each year.  That is equivalent to emissions from 60% of the 2 million cars on Irish roads.  The timber industry provides 12,000 jobs in rural Ireland.  To put it simply, trees act like large vacuum cleaners in removing carbon dioxide.</p> <p>The current regulations do not allow for timber-frame construction of office complexes, schools or larger and taller buildings, which is a pity.  This matter merits a detailed examination as timber-frame construction could be very much part of a climate change agenda in addition to creating jobs.</p> <p>It is estimated we need 250,000 new homes.  According to an estimate released today, a large number of homes need to be built every day.  The figure may have been 90.</p></speech>

The issue I want to address is our allowing allow office complexes, schools or taller buildings to be built using a timber frame.  My understanding is that the current regulations prohibit buildings that extend to a certain number of storeys from being built using a timber frame.  Everything about building commends itself to a re-evaluation in the context of the climate change agenda and better building methods.</p></speech>

He had a very distinctive voice.  He died at the very early age of 47.<br/><br/>Since we are in the business of paying tributes, I would like to mention briefly the late Professor John Gilmartin.  He was a most refined, elegant man who gave his life in very large part to helping to preserve Georgian architecture.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish to mention a rather curious person, the late Randal MacDonnell.  I read his obituary, reprinted from <i>The Telegraph</i>, with a degree of sadness.  He was a Walter Mitty figure.  I remember him parading himself as Lord of the Isles until I pointed out that that title had been extinguished and absorbed by the title Prince of Wales after the Highland rebellion of 1745.  He then described himself as MacDonnell of the Glens, which came as a bit of a surprise to the Earl of Antrim, whose title is actually that.  I remember Randal parachuting from a helicopter, wearing a kilt and no underwear, into the college races at Trinity, somewhat to the surprise of Mr. &Eacute;amon de Valera.  I would like to think Mr. de Valera's defective eyesight meant he did not catch a glimpse of the undercarriage as it floated earthwards.  Randal could be charming despite his Walter Mitty character.  I was sad to learn that he died in a one-room hovel in Tangier and that there was not enough money left to bury him.  That is a sad, but perhaps appropriate, end to a very colourful career.  I know he would have been really thrilled to get practically half a page of an obituary from <i>The Telegraph</i>.  I would like to think he would also be pleased that he was mentioned on the record in Seanad &Eacute;ireann today.</p></speech>

He is very welcome back.  One's health is the most important thing in life.  It is great to see the Cathaoirleach back in charge again.</p> <p>I support Senators Craughwell and Humphreys regarding their comments on the FAI.  I will not indulge myself in speaking about this because I wish to raise another issue.  I requested the Minister to attend last week on two occasions because I had a fair idea of what was coming up on Friday.  It is a mistake that the representatives of the FAI are not appearing before the committee tomorrow.  We will discuss it at another stage.</p> <p>I was scanning the Sunday newspapers at the weekend.  I usually skip the full-page advertisements of the multinationals and so on but I could not help being struck by the fact that the price of alcohol, particularly spirits, seems to be lower this Christmas.  Bottles of whiskey are available for &euro;18 each, or two bottles for &euro;35.  Bottles of Baileys are available for &euro;10.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 was passed over a year ago.  The commencement of the section on minimum pricing was held up because we wanted to proceed along with Northern Ireland when its Administration was back.  It is not back, however, so it does not look like there will be movement on legislation in Northern Ireland.  Scotland was at the European Court of Justice at the time and it won its case.  It is now revealed that alcohol sales in Scotland have dropped to the lowest ever level since minimum pricing was introduced in May 2018.  Therefore, it does work.  In fairness to the Minister, he indicated in the past six weeks or so that he was seeking approval from the Cabinet to sign off on the relevant section of the legislation.  I am not asking the Minister to come to the House but I ask the Leader to seek an update.  The Minister indicated his intention six weeks ago.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John O'Mahony:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2202"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2202&amp;amp;pid=JohnOMahony&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not refer to responsible publicans or small off-licences but rather to the large multinationals that seem to sell alcohol as a loss leader.</p></speech>

Since I raised the matter in the House, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine last week granted approval for 14 of the 18 applications, effectively giving approval for an area the size of 40 ha that can now be used for harvesting with trestles Pacific oysters and clams.  The local community are deeply annoyed at the decision, taken swiftly by the Minister, in light of the fact that, in general, such applications take up to two years for a decision to be made.  The decision in this case was made within approximately six months of the applications being submitted.  There are significant questions to be answered about the public consultation process, given that the local community were not provided with the opportunity to make submissions prior to the Minister's decision.  Their only option is to appeal to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, which is an expensive process, with each appeal costing &euro;200.  There are 14 licences, and if any group or individual appeals all the applications, it will cost &euro;2,800.</p> <p>The Minister has got the matter deeply wrong.  He spoke in this House and the D&aacute;il, and has blatantly ignored the public concerns over the issue.  While nobody wants to deprive people of a livelihood or an economic benefit garnered through farming or aquaculture, the public good, as well the destruction that could be forced on a small bay, needs to be taken into consideration.  That did not happen, however, before the Minister arrived at his decision to grant the licences.  It is most unfortunate.  I ask the Leader to facilitate a debate on the processing of aquaculture licences.  Although it may not be possible before the Christmas recess, I would like the Minister to come before the House to discuss the issue in general terms early in the new year.</p></speech>

I welcome Senator Clifford-Lee back to the House following her excursions during the by-election campaign and wish her well in her future endeavours.  She raised an important matter earlier that needs to be highlighted more frequently.  She is correct that domestic homicide has not received the same level of attention as gangland crime, and I stand with her regarding the starkness of the figures presented in the report today.  As somebody who sits on the joint policing committees for Cork city and county councils, I welcome the fact that divisional protected service units will be established in Cork.  It is important to reaffirm the commitment of the Government and of all of us - I hope universally - to the promotion and support of victims of domestic violence, which has a devastating effect.  The Government has been proactive on the matter, taking a range of legislative decisions and passing a suite of Bills.  In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continuously works to improve its specialist services and there has been a significant allocation of funding for the matters raised.</p> <p>On the point the Senator made in respect of Hammond Lane, all of us want to see the issue resolved and it is a priority for the Minister for Justice and Equality.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Up to &euro;80 million of capital funding has been made available from the Department for a new children&rsquo;s court complex.  It is important the Office of Public Works and those involved in the Courts Service sit down to conclude the negotiations.  The points made by the Senator this afternoon are important, in particular the issue of mediation and people being able to discuss their affairs in the privacy of a secure environment.  I am happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss this matter.</p><p>Senator Craughwell referred to the new Finnish Prime Minister, Sanna Marin, who will be installed today at the age of 34, the youngest Prime Minister in the world.  We wish her every success in her tenure.  The decision of the Finnish Government is a wonderful acknowledgement of the role of diversity, inclusion and gender.  She was a former member of a city council in Finland and has proved her mettle as a politician of repute.  It is important we promote women in all aspects of political and civic life.</p><p>The Cathaoirleach and Senator Norris referred to the sad passing today of Paul Anthony McDermott.  On behalf of the Fine Gael side of the House, I join with the House&rsquo;s words of sympathy to his family on his sad and young passing.  He was an insightful and bright mind.  His ability to cut to the quick of a matter, whether it concerned legislation or another legal matter, was one from which we all benefited.  We send our sympathies to his family.</p><p>Senator Norris also referred to the passing of Professor John Gilmartin and Randal MacDonnell.  We also extend our sympathies to their families.  I did not know them but we offer our sympathies to them as well.</p><p>Senators Craughwell, O&rsquo;Mahony and Humphreys referred to the issue of the FAI.  It made for sad reading at the weekend to learn of &euro;55 million of net liabilities being exposed.  It is a gargantuan mess.  Those of us who are sportspeople are concerned by the effect this will have on the FAI brand and, more importantly, grassroots football which is supported by many thousands of volunteers, week in, week out.  Senator Humphreys referred to football in disadvantaged areas.  It is important that young people in disadvantaged areas do not suffer because of this.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, gets much criticism in this House.  To be fair to him, his decision to withhold the money and find a mechanism by which that money can be diverted to grassroots football is one we should support.  It is disappointing that the FAI will not attend the sports committee tomorrow.  Equally, however, what is Sport Ireland doing?  It is the oversight body of the FAI.  This &euro;55 million deficit did not just happen last week or the week before.  It has been going on for some time.  It is important we have proper oversight.  Those of us involved in sport at grassroots level recognise the importance of funding, fundraising and trying to keep a club going.  Last week, a rugby club in Kildare was threatened with being put out of business because of insurance costs.  Many of us in this Chamber are involved in our own local clubs and sport.  It is important Sport Ireland is also held to account for the oversight role it plays.  None of us can condone or support what is happening in the FAI at corporate level.  It is just not good enough.</p></speech>

We should all remember that with the &euro;2.9 million of Government money or other moneys going into the FAI, it is not the persons involved but the organisation which benefits.  That is why probity with other people's money is important.  Senator Craughwell referred to a letter with which I am not familiar. The Cathaoirleach said the matters are <i>sub judice</i>.  It is important regional development officers are not affected.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The development of the game at grassroots level is important.  Women's soccer is the fastest growing sport in the world.  We must continue to support and encourage it.  It is not good enough that the women's national football team has to tog out on a portakabin or bus, or that they must go cap in hand to get jerseys or gear from someone.  That is why it is important that we draw a line here, getting answers but ensuring that the future of the FAI is secure so that we can promote all aspects of Irish football.<br/><br/>Senator Gavan raised the very important matter relating to staff of Virgin Media being able to have representation at union level.  I make no apology for saying that they should not be treated as they are.  I am not entirely familiar with what he spoke of although I have seen some articles.  I read that the company was looking for 65 redundancies, and in the end it was 40, as part of collective bargaining, although it may not be collective bargaining.  The honest answer is that I am not sure but I do stand up for the right of people to be able to join unions so that they can protect their rights and entitlements.  That is something that I will never recoil from.  It is disappointing that this is happening and I do not support it in any form.  The Senator is right.  It will not be featured on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; tonight, there will be no discussion on it, and Ivan Yates <i>et al </i>will make their usual comments, which we have come to expect of them.  However, what is important is that people's right to join a union, to be protected, to have their pay and entitlements, and their right to collective bargaining are looked after.  I stand with the Senator on that.</p></speech>

She will be aware that the Government has formed a women's health task force.  Women's health is very important to this Government and it has been prioritised in many things the Government has done.  Proper education is important, not only from health and medical professionals but also in our education system.  I hope that endometriosis will be part of the work of the task force.  It is not only in the Republic of Ireland that there are issues around this but also in Northern Ireland and Britain.  Some very high-profile women have gone on the public airwaves to discuss it.  Education will create awareness.</p> <p>Senator Joe O'Reilly referred to timber-framed and durable timber buildings.  I support his call on this, particularly looking at the change in regulations around taller buildings, including office blocks and public buildings.  I would be happy to have a debate on this with the Minister.  It might be a combination of Ministers, namely, Deputies Eoghan Murphy, Bruton and Doyle.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill raised the issue of aquaculture licences in Ballyness Bay, County Donegal in the context of 14 of 18 licences being awarded and one or two not being awarded.  I do not have the information on this to hand.  I know licensing is a very vexing area.  It is about ensuring that jobs are created, protected and enhanced.  I take his point.  He had a Commencement Matter on this recently and if I can have the Minister before the House before Christmas, I will.  However, it will probably be in the new year.</p> <p>I wish the Cathaoirleach well in his full health now he is back.  He is on temporary light duties.  He gave us all a bit of a fright, as I said last week.  I hope he is taking notice of the advice of people such as the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, and others to take it easy.  This is a marathon, not a sprint.  We are glad that he is back and we hope that he will take it easy.  We will guide him back in gently and try not to give him too much heartache on this side of the House anyway.  It is good to have him back.</p></speech>

This Bill was passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann last week and I hope we can progress it through the Seanad this week in order that it can be enacted before the end of the year.</p> <p>As it progressed through the various Stages in the D&aacute;il, there were good discussions on the principles and provisions of the Bill as it relates to the regulation of approved housing bodies, AHBs, which are incredibly important for the delivery of much needed social homes.  It is important to have robust and effective regulation of the sector.  I am pleased to say that there has been a great level of support for this Bill, including in the context of the amendments made in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>Prior to today, Senators will have received a briefing note setting out the background to the Bill, outlining amendments made and some additional information on the regulator and the AHB sector.  I hope this has been useful.  This is a balanced and proportionate Bill which provides for the regulation of AHBs for the purposes of supporting stronger governance within and the financial viability of that sector, with a particular focus on safeguarding the significant public investment being made in the delivery of social housing by AHBs.  Similarly, the Bill will provide stronger assurance to tenants, the public and potential investors that the sector is well regulated.  We need to keep our focus on the tenants, who are the people going into housing body homes under social housing agreements.</p> <p>Senators will be aware that AHBs provide thousands of social housing homes in Ireland.  They operate as independent, private, not-for-profit organisations, formed for the purpose of relieving housing need, which is often of a certain type.  AHBs have a particular expertise in meeting that need, be it for people with disabilities, those coming out of homelessness or individuals with special needs.  AHBs have played this role since before the foundation of the State.  Consider, for example, an organisation such as the Iveagh Trust, which has being doing this work for many decades.</p> <p>Under existing legislation, housing bodies are granted approved status by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 for the purposes of being able to receive funding from local authorities in order to provide social housing.  This arrangement has been in place since that time and, although operating well, it is acknowledged that a more modern regulatory system needs to be put in place to oversee a sector that has developed significantly in the interim.  Ahead of the establishment of a statutory regulator, which is the aim behind the Bill, an interim regulatory office for AHBs has been in place based in the Housing Agency since 2013.  The interim regulator, supported by the regulation office, oversees implementation of a voluntary regulation code for AHBs.  This existing framework will ensure that the statutory regulator, once established, can become fully operational much sooner than would otherwise be the case.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We hope this can happen in 12 to 18 months once the Bill is enacted.  Regulation is currently conducted through Building for the Future: A Voluntary Regulation Code for Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland, and is underpinned by financial, governance and performance standards.  At present, there are 275 AHBs, including all of the larger tier 3 AHBs that have signed up to the voluntary code.  My Department&rsquo;s register indicates there are 552 AHBs in existence.  However, many of these are inactive and an exercise will be carried out to delist inactive AHBs from the register.  Preliminary work has already commenced in this regard.</p><p>As the Senators will be aware, the Rebuilding Ireland action plan for housing and homelessness recognises the key contribution approved housing bodies make to the delivery of social housing.  AHBs are committed to delivering one third of the 50,000 new social housing homes that are to be provided over the period of the plan through a blended delivery of build, acquisition and leasing.  Last year, the AHB sector was responsible for 38% of the delivery of social homes.  The target for delivery of new social housing in 2019 is up more than 20% from 7,869 to 10,000 this year.  The target for new build homes has almost tripled from 2,260 in 2016 to 6,545 in 2019.  Next year will be a record year for social house building.  We will build more social housing homes than we have built in any of the last 20 years, including the boom years.</p><p>Approved housing bodies receive significant levels of funding from the taxpayer to take people from our housing lists and they build on local authority land.  They are part of our new and more sustainable approach to social housing, where delivery is not dependent on one single stream like it was in the past, but social housing is now delivered in a number of ways, protecting would-be tenants from any adverse shocks to the economy or the sector.  They complement but do not replace social housing delivery by local authorities.  In cases of particular need, such as those with disabilities, for example, they have the required experience in providing the most appropriate housing.  I have big ambitions for this sector.  I want it to continue to grow and to continue to provide the quality homes for those most in need.  I would like to pay tribute to the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH, the Housing Alliance and all involved in what was a record year for them in 2018 for the delivery of new social homes.  This Bill will support and strengthen that ambition by demonstrating to all that the sector is well regulated.</p><p>Let me now move to the detail of the Bill itself.  The Bill contains 70 sections in nine parts, together with one Schedule.  In Part 2, the approved housing body regulatory authority - the regulator - is laid out in sections 7 to 24, inclusive, providing for the establishment of the regulator and sets out the functions and the organisational structure of the regulator, the appointment of a chief executive, staff, preparation of a strategy statement and other related matters.  The functions of the regulator are set out in section 9, namely: to establish and maintain a register of AHBs; register persons as AHBs; prepare draft standards for approval by the Minister under section 38 and publish the approved standards; monitor and assess compliance by AHBs with this Act, in particular the approved standards; carry out investigations under Part 5; under Part 6, protect tenants and AHBs and cancel the registration of AHBs where necessary; encourage and facilitate the better governance, administration and management, including corporate governance and financial management, of AHBs by the provision of such information and advice, in such form and manner, as the regulator considers appropriate; with a view to promoting awareness and understanding of this Act, make available such information as appears to the regulator to be expedient to give to the public about the operation of this Act, in such form and manner as the regulator considers appropriate; collect such information concerning AHBs as the regulator considers necessary and appropriate for the purposes of the performance of the regulator&rsquo;s functions; and, publish such information, including statistical information, concerning AHBs as the regulator considers appropriate.  Section 9(1)(f) originally provided for the regulator to intervene in the functioning and management of housing bodies and cancel the registration of housing bodies under Part 6 of the Bill.  This was raised by Deputies on earlier Stages of the Bill and I therefore proposed an amendment, which was accepted on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, to better reflect the fact the regulator will not be involved in the day-to-day running and management of housing bodies.  Rather, one of its functions is to protect tenants and housing bodies and cancel the registration of AHBs under Part 6 of the Bill.</p><p>Sections 14 and 15 are important oversight provisions which provide that the chief executive shall appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and other relevant Oireachtas committees when requested to do so.</p><p>I know some Members have raised queries about having too many regulators.  I agree it is a crowded regulatory space.  However, section 23 will require the regulator to agree memoranda of understanding with other regulators, such as the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, the Charity Regulator and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, for example.  This will ensure there is no regulatory conflict and will ensure clear lines of competence between regulators.  It is an important provision.</p><p>Part 3 provides for the regulation of approved housing bodies and includes sections on the registration procedures for AHBs and their entry onto the register, as well as the drafting and approval of standards.  To be eligible to register as an AHB, the persons or bodies must be: a company with at least five directors; a registered society; a friendly society; or a charitable trust with at least five trustees.  The persons or bodies must include in their constitution the provision or management, in the State, of housing for the purpose of alleviating housing need as well as provisions prohibiting the distribution of any surplus, profit, bonus or dividend to members, directors or other persons and requiring that its assets and profits be applied solely towards its primary object or objects.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Sections 26 and 27 provide that the regulator will establish and maintain a register of AHBs and set out where and when the register may be inspected, along with setting out procedures for those persons or bodies who wish to apply for registration and what should be included within the application.  Section 34 enables existing housing bodies approved under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 to be deemed registered.  Sections 28 to 33 enable the regulator to grant or refuse applications.  Section 35 provides that a person who knowingly provides false or misleading information to the regulator as part of an application will be guilty of an offence.</p><p>Part 4, comprising sections 38 to 43, inclusive, provides the regulator with the powers to monitor compliance by housing bodies with the standards.  Arising from the assessment, if the regulator deems that a housing body is not complying with the standards, it may require the body to draw up and submit a compliance plan.  Section 42 deals with the failure of a housing body to implement a compliance plan.  Where the regulator takes the view that the housing body is failing to implement a plan or is not implementing it in accordance with its terms; the regulator may issue a notice on non-implementation.  Section 43 provides that the regulator shall enter on the register details of a non-implementation notice.</p><p>Part 5, comprising sections 44 to 52, inclusive, relates to investigations.  It provides the regulator with powers to appoint inspectors and undertake investigations into the affairs and performance of housing bodies.  It also sets out the powers of the inspectors and the mechanism for the production of inspectors' reports.</p><p>Part 6, comprising sections 53 to 60, inclusive, relates to interventions.  It allows for intervention powers to be afforded to the regulator in respect of assets of a housing body where an offence has been committed, a housing body has failed or is failing to comply with the provisions of the Bill, there has been misconduct by a director, officer or member of staff or the financial viability of a housing body is threatened.</p><p>Section 54 empowers the regulator to seek a High Court order if he or she suspects that: a housing body has committed an offence under the Bill; a housing body is failing to comply with provisions under the Bill; a housing body is misusing or mismanaging property in such a way that endangers the property; there has been misconduct or mismanagement by a director or employee of a housing body in relation to its affairs; there has been unlawful or improper use of funds; there is a serious risk to the financial viability of the body; it is necessary for the purpose of the protection of the tenants of dwellings provided or managed by a housing body; or where there is information indicating any of what I have just outlined.  In such circumstances, the court may issue an interim, interlocutory or permanent order.  Such orders may include: removal or suspension of any director or officer or employee of the body; appointment of other people to be a director or officer of the body; vesting of any or all of the property of the housing body with another housing body identified by the regulator; prohibiting the removal or sale of the property without the regulator's consent; non-payment by a debtor to the body for a specified period; or the restriction or prohibition of a housing body to enter any agreements.</p><p>Section 58 enables the regulator to cancel a registration on the following grounds: that the housing body:has been convicted of an offence under the Bill or any other indictable offence; has failed or is failing to comply with any provisions under the Bill; no longer satisfies the eligibility criteria for registration as a housing body, or is deemed to be a housing body under section 35 and has been deregistered under the provisions of that section.  The section also provides for the procedures that the regulator must pursue in cancelling a registration, including allowing the housing body to make representations and allowing a housing body to appeal the decision to cancel registration.</p><p>Part 7, comprising sections 61 to 64, inclusive, concerns appeals.  It provides for a housing body to submit appeals to an appeals panel where the regulator exercises its powers in relation to registration, compliance plans or cancellation of registration.  Section 61 provides that the Minister shall establish an appeals panel to determine appeals under the Bill.  It sets out the qualifications and number of members, terms of office, grounds for removal of members and disqualification for appointment and the provision of resources to support the work of the panel.  Section 63 provides for the process that the panel should follow in considering an appeal.  It also provides that the panel shall be independent in the performance of its duties.  Section 64 allows for any party to an appeal to appeal the decision to the High Court on a point of law within three months.</p><p>Part 8, comprising sections 65 and 66, inclusive, covers miscellaneous issues.  Section 65 prohibits the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information.  It makes it an offence for a member of the regulator, staff member, inspector, adviser or any other person engaged under contract with the regulator to disclose confidential information acquired during the course of performing their duties unless they are required to do so by law or with the regulator's permission.  The section does not prevent the disclosure of such information to the regulator or a Minister of the Government by or on behalf of the regulator or in compliance with provisions of the Act.  Section 66 is a new section which was inserted on Report Stage.  It requires the Minister to commission a report, within 12 months, relating to the transfer of dwellings provided by housing bodies, which have received funding through the various funding schemes for housing bodies from the Department.  The amendment ensures that there will be consultation with key stakeholders and that any matters arising, including legal and financial matters relating to transfers, will be examined.  This report will be important in determining and evidencing if any further policy initiatives are required in respect of stock transfer.  The Minister is obliged to lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas and to publish it online as soon as is practicable thereafter.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Part 9, comprising sections 67 to 70, inclusive, covers consequential amendments and transitional provisions in detail. </p><p>Several amendments were made to the Bill on Committee and Report Stages, as I have outlined.  I have referred to some of these amendments as I discussed the contents of the Bill, but there are two others to which I would like to draw Members' attention now.  A particularly notable amendment was the deletion of the section on fees.  This was discussed at length on Committee Stage and I was pleased to bring forward amendments in the D&aacute;il on Report Stage to reflect that positive engagement.  As the Bill now stands, fees may only be charged under two subsections.  Subsection 26(3) provides: "The Regulator shall make a copy of an entry in the register available, on request, on payment of such fee (if any) as may be determined by the Regulator".  Subsection 62(2) provides: "An appeal shall be accompanied by such fee (if any) as may be determined by the Regulator with the approval of the Minister".</p><p>Another amendment of note was proposed by the Opposition on Committee Stage.  This was to delete paragraph 56(1)(g), which required a housing body to notify the regulator if it received a determination order within the meaning of section 121 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The Irish Council for Social Housing expressed the view that to notify every order made by the Residential Tenancies Board would be disproportionate and unnecessarily onerous.  I agreed to accept this amendment. </p><p>I restate that this is a balanced and proportionate Bill.  It will support stronger governance and the financial viability of the very important housing body sector, safeguard the significant public investment being made in the delivery of social housing by housing bodies and provide stronger assurance to tenants, the public and potential investors that the sector is well regulated.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We will also be discussing amendments on Committee Stage.  I want to ask one simple question.  The programme for Government contains a promise that regulatory impact assessments would be carried out on all legislation.  This Bill will obviously put a particular onus on many housing bodies.  Has a regulatory impact assessment been carried out to determine the impact this legislation will have on the housing sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-12-10a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019121000002#GG00400"><p>I welcome the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and his officials to the House.  The briefing he provided on the Bill and the various amendments that have already been submitted was very useful.  It is a comprehensive Bill which will ensure oversight of the entire approved housing body sector.  The Minister knows that I was involved in the early stages of the Bill's development and I am delighted that it is now coming to its final fruition and passing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Hopefully it will be in place by Christmas.</p> <p>The Bill is essentially intended to ensure effective governance and regulation of the approved housing body sector.  As the Minister said, the primary focus is to protect tenants who use approved housing body housing and to ensure that any public or private investment in the approved housing body sector is made with proper oversight and accountability.  This Bill does this through the establishment of the regulatory framework and the board which will act as a regulator in this sector.  Most, if not all, of us agree that approved housing bodies play a significant role in the provision of social and sheltered housing.  One hears from time to time that too much investment goes to approved housing bodies and more should go to the councils and local authorities.  I will come back to that but, irrespective of the debate, it is important that in the interests of confidence there is adequate oversight, transparency and accountability in the approved housing body sector.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide that oversight and governance and to provide for a register of approved housing bodies.  That is important.  There are quite a few approved housing bodies, some very large and some quite small.</p> <p>It is also important that we have full compliance with the standards in the provision of social housing set down by the Minister or any of his successors who review them.  It is important that there is a proper structure and framework in place by which reporting and investigations, where necessary, can be carried out in a fair and balanced way, with the right of appeal.  That is provided for in this Bill.  A framework is also needed where interventions are necessary, whether in a management or a capacity role, and where assistance is needed for approved housing bodies.  We must remember that the directors and staff of many of these approved housing bodies are voluntary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There may be times that interventions and supports are necessary to support those who are willing to give their time and expertise to provide more housing in this sector.  That is a positive and it should be seen in that light.  Also, there is an important role to be played in promoting awareness of and providing information on the sector to the public, where appropriate, and on its performance in retaining statistics and data that could be utilised to improve efficiencies in delivery as we see fit.  By and large, the vast majority of approved housing bodies perform extremely well.  We acknowledge that but there is a need for governance and oversight of the sector where interventions are needed.</p><p>The primary people involved are the families and tenants who utilise social housing governed by approved housing bodies.  We can all point to numerous examples of sheltered housing, housing for the elderly and disabled and other types of housing in which the approved housing body sector has been involved.  I commend those working in the sector and thank them for their efforts in working to provide homes for those in most need.</p><p>Some approved housing bodies in my area in Waterford are long established.  One is the well-known Respond housing association, which provides housing and apartments for people in need throughout the country.  Cl&uacute;id Housing is another well-known body and there are hundreds of others.</p><p>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that, sadly, the approved housing body sector lost a great advocate recently with the death of Simon Brooke, the head of policy for Cl&uacute;id Housing Association.  I had many engagements with Mr. Brooke over the years and he was a passionate advocate who always put the tenant first.  His buzzwords were "providing great homes".  Cl&uacute;id has certainly lost a great man and I extend my sympathies to Mr. Brooke's family.  The sector is at a loss on his passing.</p><p>The Minister outlined the increasing number of social housing units being delivered.  I acknowledge he has substantially increased the building and delivery of housing units throughout the country.  As he correctly noted, unprecedented funding is being provided for housing provision.  I commend him on that.  It is a difficult challenge we have all faced.  If we stick with the task and support all the stakeholders who are working assiduously to deliver more housing, I have no doubt we will get there.  The challenge of housing provision cannot be resolved in a simplistic way.  We cannot wave a magic wand to solve it.  There are many stages and steps involved in the provision of housing.  We must acknowledge the increased number of houses being built, refurbished and let.  Substantial progress has been made but more still needs to be done, as all of us will agree.  At the end of the day, it is a matter of supply and delivery, which are critical.  </p><p>We need to continue working with all the stakeholders, including the Oireachtas and the Minister on the policy side, the Department and its officials and the housing authorities, namely, the councils, and their staff.  We need to keep the bar high and the foot to the pedal.  We need our elected officials - councillors around the country - to support that aspiration and effort.  I also mention the State agencies where lands are available.  Much work is going into unlocking potential lands to provide more housing.  There is capacity in the private sector to continue to provide more houses.  I also mention those in the construction sector who are available and willing to build more houses.  Of all of those stakeholders, a very important one is the approved housing body sector.  Many of these bodies are passionate about housing.  They will continue to invest their expertise and give their time voluntarily in an effort to provide more housing.  This is a good day for the approved housing body sector in that it builds confidence for further investment in that area.  It is an important stakeholder which will continue to deliver additional housing and will need continuous support to do that.</p><p>We will deal with the Bill in more detail in the coming days.  I note all the amendments that have been made to improve it and the Minister outlined the reasons they were made.  I wish the Bill well and look forward to further debate on it in the coming days.</p></speech>

As colleagues have said, the Bill establishes a regulator for approved housing bodies but also puts them on a statutory footing.</p><p>While voluntary housing bodies and co-operative housing models are somewhat underutilised, it is our hope that once we can establish a statute in this area, we can allow these types of models to flourish.  Many of the bodies do great work in providing housing, for example, to the elderly, those with disabilities and the homeless, in respect of whom our State has not delivered.  It should be noted that, as with other registered charities, the bodies act where the State has failed.  Ideally, the State would have such a robust social and affordable housing model that the objectives of the bodies would be met and there would be no need for them to intervene.  While these bodies are approved under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 for the purpose of accessing assistance from local authorities for housing provision, some level of independence is needed for the sector, and the execution of the Bill needs to be robust in that regard.</p><p>I agree with my D&aacute;il colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  I, too, am disappointed that social housing is exempt from these regulations.  While it is always the aim of the State to build good social housing that lasts, it does not always work out that way.  I believe the State should subject housing, both public and private, to a high threshold of standards.  With the lack of application of the minimum rental standards regulations and the fire safety defects that are rife in apartment blocks, we are entering a quality crisis as well as a quantity one.  In this regard, tenants should have a voice.  While social housing stock is severely limited, not having the same resolution process means a tiered version of tenants' rights, which is unreasonable.</p><p>We have concerns regarding EUROSTAT and the Central Statistics Office in respect of the level of Government control of the sector.  These concerns relate not just to financing but also to governance and policy.  If we were to manage getting approved housing bodies off the balance sheet, matters such as a no-deal Brexit would not hinder them to any great degree, bearing in mind the current economic framework.  Where capital expenditure is limited, it will have consequences for delivery.  I would be interested in the Minister's thoughts on this.</p><p>I would like the Minister to give us an update on the establishment of a special purpose vehicle for credit unions.  The credit unions can and want to make a contribution in housing.  They have the ability to invest in approved housing bodies.  Society will reap the benefits as more housing stock will be generated as a result.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has the capacity to provide &euro;347 million annually for an approved housing body loan for social housing.  It proposes to build up incrementally to a funding position of &euro;1.42 billion over the period of six years.  It seems to me like a no-brainer if the Government is ambitious in allowing this and establishing good regulation in that regard.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in will support the Bill.  I hope the Minister will take away from this debate the fact that there is a genuine belief in approved housing bodies in both the D&aacute;il and Seanad, but we need further discussions outside the scope of this Bill on how we allow them to flourish.</p></speech>

Simon was a friend and I send condolences to his family on his untimely passing.</p> <p>I broadly welcome this Bill, which introduces the regulation of approved housing bodies.  I speak as a current member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and former chief executive of Cork Simon Community, which was itself an approved housing body.  I was for many years a member of the Irish Council for Social Housing, which I am aware was very constructive in the drafting of this legislation.</p> <p>I welcome the Bill because we need activist, well-run approved housing bodies if we are to tackle the housing crisis and, in doing so, meet the needs of the 3,800 children living in emergency accommodation.  Approved housing bodies have an important role to play in turning this around so no child will be without a roof.</p> <p>I acknowledge that a significant number of issues identified in respect of the Bill have been dealt with on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il and through the examination by the Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  These issues included my own concerns about proportionate regulation for very small approved housing bodies with voluntary boards, which often provide small-scale, though much-needed, special needs housing in rural areas and communities, including, for example, the senior citizens' housing in my town, Macroom.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colette Kelleher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2484"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2484&amp;amp;pid=ColetteKelleher&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We do not want to squeeze out such small-scale providers and small-scale AHBs with overly bureaucratic or duplicate regulation.</p><p>I was glad to hear there will be a memorandum of understanding among other bodies such as HIQA, the Charities Regulator and the Residential Tenancies Board.  A voluntary housing board with eight or ten houses will not want to be drowned in unnecessary bureaucracy, although some is necessary.  Small-scale AHBs are very much part of the effort to address the lack of housing and have made a great contribution, not least to special needs housing.  Issues relating to finance and reporting as well as functions including control, overshadowing directors and governance have been addressed to a large extent.</p><p>Members of the regulatory authority will come through the Public Appointments Service and such transparency is important and welcome.  It is also welcome that a compromise approach has been taken to the categorisation of special needs housing in that section 37, on standards, refers to "different accommodation needs of different categories of tenants".  Nevertheless, the definition of special accommodation needs in housing should be revisited, perhaps through future legislation on housing needs assessment and support.</p><p>I have proposed a few minor amendments, which I hope the Minister will accept.  They will provide that in the preparation of strategy statements, there will be sector agreement with AHBs and it should be part of the strategy preparation to ensure full consultation with the most important parties.  We would not want the regulator to develop a strategy without consulting the groups it will regulate.  Given that publication of an interim report may be damaging to individuals without recourse to the full due process of a finalised investigation, I have proposed the publication of one report without having a possibly unfairly damaging interim report.</p><p>Although the Minister has answered the following question to an extent, I will need his explicit reassurance.  What protections will tenants have if the regulator refuses to register, or cancels the registration of, the AHBs?  Who in law will be the tenant's landlord in that event?</p><p>I broadly support the Bill and hope the Minister will take on board my feedback and accept my minor amendments.  I ask that he will offer some clarity as to tenants' status in the event of a refusal of registration.</p></speech>

I attended a public private partnership meeting between a builder and representatives of a local authority.  The quality of the houses the local authorities build is outstanding and is a credit to them.</p> <p>I will support the Bill because it is important to have regulation of AHBs, given that, as the Minister noted, there are 552 of them.  There have been finance issues with one or two of them in Kildare.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Anthony Lawlor:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2283"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2283&amp;amp;pid=AnthonyLawlor&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that there is some regulation in this area.</p><p>What sort of budget will be required in order to run the regulator&rsquo;s office?

I was hoping that some of the fees would go towards the cost of the office itself.</p><p>The Land Development Agency will be a significant influencer, particularly in the context of the landbank held by the State.  Is there a possibility that some of that land will be made available to high-quality AHBs?  As Senator Kelleher mentioned, there are smaller housing bodies which might find it difficult to acquire land.  Could they work in conjunction with the Land Development Agency to ensure that they will not be squeezed out of the market, leaving only three or four main housing bodies?</p></speech>

I was quite shocked when Senator Coffey mentioned that he had passed away because I had not known about it.  Simon was a great supporter of AHBs for decades.  I worked closely with him in the 2000s when we tried to bring performance standard requirements into Dublin City Council in respect of AHBs.  One housing body decided that it would report me to my party's leader at the time, Pat Rabbitte, because it felt I was bringing in requirements for AHBs that were too harsh.  Simon Brooke said to stand fast and do not give in.  He had a great sense of humour and will be deeply missed.  Again, my sympathies to his family.</p> <p>There is much covered in the Bill before the house.  One of my concerns with AHBs relates to 30-year mortgages.  While I am not painting all AHBs with the same brush, in other jurisdictions some housing bodies sold off their housing stock in valuable areas.  The argument was that they were selling the stock to develop more housing in other locations.  Those other locations tended to be miles away from city centres, however.  Much of our approved housing stock is in and around Dublin city centre.  Are there safeguards in this regard?  There are safeguards in respect of mortgages and loan periods.  In the early days, the term of a mortgage was 25 years.  However, there was nothing to stop an AHB selling off the stock after 25 years.  I accept that some provision is made in section 66.  Will that provide protection at a later stage when the mortgages or the initial leases are have ended?  AHBs have approached Dublin City Council in order to get some stock in expensive landbanks.  I would hate to see the properties involved moving out of the social housing mix, regardless of whether it is in 25 or 30 years&rsquo; time.  A social mix within Dublin city is important.</p> <p>The performance standard requirement was published earlier this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I become a little worried when we hear people speak of performance standard requirements on maintenance.  I have encountered an issue around value for money and tenant satisfaction with approved housing bodies.  In one case where we sought maintenance to be undertaken, the approved housing body argued on value-for-money grounds that the level of maintenance required was not sufficient to send workmen to the property.  It was waiting until a certain amount of maintenance was necessary before sending someone to carry it out.  The tenant in question had to wait six or seven weeks for the maintenance to be carried out because the approved housing body argued it would not represent value for money to do so.  There is a balance to be struck between value for money and tenant satisfaction.  I would like to see a clear definition of that.  It goes back to the performance and standard requirements that Dublin City Council developed with the assistance of the Simon Communities.  It specified the number of weeks within which maintenance had to be done, with various items graded.  A leaky roof would have to be dealt with immediately, whereas the response time for a broken handle on a door would be six to eight weeks.</p><p>Much of the housing going to approved housing bodies consists of apartment blocks in cities and towns.  Has any consideration been given to end of life for those blocks and how that will be funded?  This has been an issue in private apartments developed in the 1960s which are now approaching end of life and the sinking fund does not necessarily cover the costs of that.  This means full demolition and rebuilding is required, as opposed to deep retrofitting.  As the Minister will be aware, in several blocks in Dublin Bay South an extra floor has been added to cover the costs of bringing the blocks up to meet building standards.  Guidelines are needed to address end of life housing.</p></speech>

It is a very impressive, concrete building.  While the house will be A-rated, it will cost no more per square metre than a regular house built with concrete.  The annual energy bills for the property will amount to about &euro;100.  This is undoubtedly a house of the future.  The firm has been engaged in Castlebar to construct a small development on behalf of an approved housing body.  The heating comes from photovoltaic solar panels on the roof and goes into each individual room.  The foundations are also insulated and there will be less heat loss.  It is very impressive.</p> <p>There is an affordability challenge for people trying to buy houses.   Under the current criteria, borrowers can borrow 3.5 times their gross income.  This means people cannot get loans of the size needed to buy a house or construct a new house.  We are aiming to increase stock but builders cannot get enough money to make it worthwhile to build.  It is a catch-22.  Will the Government raise the borrowing limit with the Central Bank?  If a household's energy bill will be &euro;100 annually, surely people will save a lot of money in energy costs over their lifetime?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Surely what I am saying has to be fact if we believe that energy efficiency measures and renewable heat sources work.  I believe they do.  Why should people who are buying new houses that are A rated, such as the one I described, not be able to get an increased multiple of their gross incomes?  Why can they not be entitled to borrow more, given that they will save money elsewhere?  This issue needs to be taken by the horns.  It is impeding the construction of new houses for people who would otherwise be in a position to service mortgages for their houses.  By coming out of rented accommodation, it means that-----</p></speech>

Senator Mark Daly asked about a regulatory impact assessment, RIA.  One was done in 2015 and was published during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  Obviously, there has been a time lag between then and this point, but in the interim we were beefing up the voluntary regulator in the Housing Agency.  That important preliminary work means that, once we pass this Bill, we can move quickly to having an official regulator in place, given that the regulator is already up and running in many respects.</p> <p>Senator Coffey mentioned the Bill's support for the housing body sector.  When we talk about regulation, it is not just all stick.  There is a carrot as well.  This legislation is there to help those housing bodies that may not be as up to speed with regulations, governance and standards as others to get to that position and improve certain aspects of their performance in a way that is not overly onerous on them.  To take up the Senator's point, we must recognise that many of the small housing bodies have volunteers who are putting in their own time.  With every extra form we ask them to fill out, we take up an extra hour of their time that might be better spent doing something else for their respective tenants.  In every regulation we introduce, we must find a balance.</p> <p>The Senator also spoke about Mr. Simon Brooke of the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association.  The D&aacute;il had a chance to speak about Mr. Brooke last week and note his passing.  He is deeply missed by everyone he worked with, not just in Cl&uacute;id, but in the wider ecosystem of housing in which we are all involved.  Mr. Brooke talked about great homes.  That is an important thing that we are now seeing in housing policy.  It is not just a question of throwing up any old house or block of houses.  The homes that we are building are the best that are being built in the State at the moment.  I have visited many of them - public housing and private housing, there is no difference.  Nor should there be.  In many instances, the social housing is better because it has better performing energy, heating and ventilation systems owing to the needs of the people moving into those homes.  It is important that we have that hardwired into our future housing policy.</p> <p>The Senator from Sinn F&eacute;in lamented the fact that we were not regulating local authorities in this Bill.  While local authority provision of housing is social housing for people coming off the housing list, it is a different mechanism of funding, oversight and governance.  As such, it would not be appropriate to have the regulator for housing bodies over the local authorities.  Where standards are concerned, these are the best homes ever built by the State.</p> <p>It is one thing for Sinn F&eacute;in to come to the Chamber and talk about the great work that housing bodies do, but when we debate the provision of social housing, Sinn F&eacute;in refuses time and again to count social housing homes that are delivered by housing bodies.  For some reason, it refuses to recognise them in the official numbers.  I cannot understand it.  The Iveagh Trust has been building social housing homes since before the existence of this State.  Many housing bodies build fantastic homes, including homes for people with particular needs that the local authority may not be best suited to delivering whereas the housing body has been doing it for decades.  Why would we not count those homes?  It is part of the hypocrisy that we see in the housing debate that people will say one thing and do another.</p> <p>I recognise the contribution that Senator Kelleher has made, not just to this debate, but to people's housing needs.  She is right, in that this is not just about the big tier 3s, the housing bodies that are in the Housing Alliance.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are fantastic in what they do and they have big plans and vision.  I fully support that.  I know some of the smaller ones in my constituency and they are meeting very particular needs.  They must be with us too.  They do the smaller and more specific stuff that has a real impact on families.  These are the tier 1 and tier 2 bodies.</p><p>When we look at the number of housing bodies that we think are inactive, we hope that, through some work, some of the smaller bodies will come together where it makes sense for them to do so.  That has already happened in my constituency, where a couple of smaller housing bodies formed decades ago felt that they some of their volunteers were coming to the end of their ability as a result of their age.  Those bodies were happy to amalgamate.  That has happened.  We are not trying to force anybody into that position.  Where a smaller housing body needs help, it will, as Senator Coffey stated, will be provided.</p><p>The memorandums of understanding between this new regulator and the regulators already in existence are very important.  Nobody should be duplicating work or demands on housing bodies.  At the same time, nobody should be missing anything and there cannot be a gap that allows something to fall between the two regulators.  The memorandums of understanding are very important in that regard.</p><p>The measure relating to the recognition of special accommodation needs was not being put in the appropriate part of the legislation.  It may not be appropriate to the legislation.  One of the inherent reasons for a housing body to exist is to meet those particular needs.  It is a good definition and I gave a commitment to try to find a place in which to put it in other legislation.  In doing so, we could all point to what we mean when we speak about certain special needs in housing being met.  There must be consultation on the strategy statement but we must ensure the independence of the regulator.  It must be independent in its functions.</p><p>We debated the merits of an interim report on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  We must absolutely ensure that there is a process in place and that person's good name can be protected.  We can imagine a position whereby an allegation might be made against a housing body regarding improper financial or governance conduct.  The benefit of an interim report is that if the report is done in a phased way, it may be possible to say at an earlier point that there is no improper financial conduct, thus helping to clear a name earlier and before the work is finished on the governance aspect.  All of these matters will be handled with due care so no information will enter the public domain that is not meant to do so without the housing bodies having the right to answer calls being put to them.  That is important.  I definitely saw a space whereby an interim report might help rather than give the wrong impression to the public about a housing body before it had a right to respond.</p><p>There was mention of the cancellation and deregistering of housing bodies.  In part, this comes from the amendment I accepted that within 12 months a report will be produced in this regard.  We will likely see a case where a housing body might, for whatever reason, need to be deregistered or have its assets transferred.  We must put the protection of tenants at the centre of that.  The regulator would have the power to intervene with another housing body and transfer assets and responsibility in that regard.  If a regulator cannot continue to regulate a housing body, it may still receive some funding from my Department through a local authority in order to keep tenants safe until we find a proper route for such assets under the housing body.  The legislation provides for that by again putting the tenant at the centre of these issues.  We do not want to find a tenant in a precarious position all of a sudden after a housing body gets into difficulty, leading to people getting hurt.  It is what we are trying to avoid with the legislation in place and with some of the amendments brought forward.</p><p>Senator Lawlor referred to fees.  We do not want this to be self-financing.  The regulatory office cannot be self-financing.  If there were fees, they would only cover part of the cost of regulation.  We recognise there will be work to be done, particularly with smaller housing bodies, and we did not want to impose any additional or onerous costs on them.  They have costs because of the annual registration of tenancies with the RTB and we did not want to hit them with something else.  We removed section 11, which provided for fees in the future, but we have allowed for the charging of fees if an appeal is made or if a person is seeking a copy of the register.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If there is to be fees for regulation in the future, they will have to be brought by way of an amendment in a future Bill.  We have done that to safeguard housing bodies, to do with their finances, in the immediate future.</p><p>Yes, it will be possible for the Land Development Agency to work with a housing body to achieve the minimum 40% of social and affordable housing on the LDA landbanks.  So there is nothing precluding them from doing that.</p><p>In terms of the Housing Agency, there are 16 staff working there at the moment. </p><p>On the voluntary code for regulation, I imagine they will transfer across to the full regulator.  We will want to hire more staff on top of that and I would say at least five, if not ten, but that will be determined by the regulator as needs be.  We have provided funding of about &euro;2.25 million between now and 2021.  That is for the next two years but the funding also covers some of this year to allow all of that work to be done in terms of getting the regulator up and running, and doing its first piece of work in terms of the automatic registration of existing housing bodies and then looking through the list of those that did not register under the voluntary code.</p><p>Senator Humphreys asked about maintenance and standards.  What we are talking about are standards around governance, finance and management of the stock.  He referred to issues of performance criteria for managing the stock.  The regulator will set out standards after a period of consultation as to what good performance might look like.  Then it will mandate for transparency in terms of the housing body reporting on those things.  What we will not do in that space is step on the toes of the RTB.  If there is an issue around the actual standard of the accommodation, for example, where the housing body's landlord is not meeting its responsibility as a landlord, the reference there for the tenant will be to the RTB.  That will all be agreed with the memorandum of understanding between the AHB and the RTB.  It is clear that we have a delineation between responsibilities but that is what will happen with the standards piece.</p><p>In terms of apartments and end-of-life, the points that have been raised are relevant to apartments in the private housing sector and what happens at the end-of-life point.  There is a piece of work that needs to be done here.  As I have mentioned before, and I think I mentioned this in the Seanad, we want to do something around this and see how best we can do it.  This matter currently does not reside in my Department.  I will engage with the Minister for Justice and Equality to see how we can go about putting in those protections for when one gets to later on in an apartment development's life when it might need a more serious amount of funding to bring it back up to a fit standard, but also where management companies have not put in place a sinking fund where they should have done so.  </p><p>When it comes to a housing body, particularly the tier 3s, they are the developer but they are also the management company so it is a separate issue for them.  One of the things that we have put in place in terms of what happens towards the end-of-life cycle is, obviously if a housing body ceases to meet the housing needs of people off the housing lists or starts to make a profit, then it no longer becomes a housing body.  So a whole separate set of consequences come in for that housing body at that point in time.</p><p>I shall address the following to Senator Kelleher.  There is an onus on the regulator to make sure that tenants do not find themselves in a position where they would be in that precarious position where the assets were about to transfer and they did not have somewhere to live.  The powers are there for the regulator to deal with that.  Section 53, in particular, contains the powers for the regulator to step in and protect tenants where needed.</p><p>Senator Mulherin mentioned the quality of new homes that are being built today. </p></speech>

Every time I visit a new housing estate and meet new families who have already moved in, because sometimes I meet them a couple of months after that, the first thing they talk about is the comfort of the home, how their home is always warm and there is always hot water.  Some of them have even gone so far as to say they have noticed an improvement in their health because many of these new homes have new ventilation and airflow systems.  Computers run these homes, which is interesting to see.  These people also talk about how cheap it is to heat their homes, etc., compared with what they spent previously on fuel and how their bills have been dramatically reduced.  That is something important to recognise because people sometimes question the cost of building new homes.  It is a lot more expensive to build new homes today than it was ten years ago because we have improved the standards so much.</p> <p>In terms of Central Bank lending and the macroprudential rules, the Central Bank is independent of the Government.  One of the things that is interesting, and we continue to shout about it, is that under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan a 3.5 income multiplier does not apply.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While one has to have a 10% deposit for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, the affordability criteria is based on being able to use one third of one's income to service the mortgage.  It is an exception to the Central Bank rules because it is targeted at people who may not be able to get a mortgage from one of the banks because the interest rate charged is too high or because of the macroprudential rules.  It would be interesting to see data on the Central Bank's exception policy.  It can give limited exceptions to either the 3.5 income multiple or the 10% deposit to each bank.  Is it giving those exceptions to people who are on lower salaries or is it giving them to people who are already on very high salaries and able to afford a home to allow them to buy an even more expensive home?  Should the exceptions be targeted at people who cannot afford to buy a home but who could with an exception?  Data from the Central Bank on what the banks are doing in that regard would be very interesting but the Central Bank is independent of Government so we cannot interfere.  </p><p>We are, however, perfectly able to express our opinions as to where we believe these exceptions should be targeted.  The whole point of the macroprudential rules is to make sure that people are not borrowing an amount they cannot afford to pay back should there be a shock to their circumstances.  We have to recognise that people who might be starting off in very good jobs, such as a teacher, a nurse or a garda, will always be needed.  We will always need them to perform that role and they will always have a certain guaranteed income.  Why exclude them from the exceptions which individual banks may deploy?  Again, it is a matter for the Central Bank to decide on that.  I just believe it would be interesting to discuss given that we are able to give out mortgages based on what people can afford to pay based on one third of their income through the local authorities.  Obviously, we have robust criteria in place to make sure that we are not lending to people who cannot afford to repay.  That is, however, tangential to the Bill we are discussing, which relates to housing bodies.</p><p>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I note that all of the Senators who contributed were aware of exactly what was in the Bill and of the changes that were made as the Bill came through Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  Everyone is aware of what is in it.  I would like to conclude this Bill as quickly as possible and get this regulator up and running because housing bodies will again deliver thousands of social housing homes next year and even more in the following year.  This is long overdue.</p></speech>

First, we should remember what is not in this legislation because this is probably the last finance Bill this Government will introduce.  There are some things that I deeply regret are not in this legislation.  I have spoken about them before in this House and I am not making party political points but the non-inclusion of these matters should be recognised.  One of those is a matter I was dealing with today in the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, namely, the proposal by the committee that the Revenue Commissioners be given the function of collecting a broadcasting charge instead of what the Government has done in kicking the can down the road with a five-year tender process leading to a delay of between five and seven years in reform of the manner in which public sector broadcasting is financed.  It occurs to me the Revenue Commissioners is the obvious body to carry out that function.  I do not want to get involved in broadcasting policy except to say that at the moment An Post engages in collecting payment for the television licence from many homes.  It is an inefficient system that requires inspectors, research and a many other things of that kind to be done.  If we had-----</p></speech>

The universal social charge, which was due for abolition in the term of this Government according to certain parties that I will not name because of the Christmas spirit and charity that is around, is still in place.  We should mark that point as well.</p> <p>Fourth, I acknowledge that this is a minority Government which has to govern with the input of others.  Nonetheless, the entry point for the top rate of tax plus the universal social charge for many ordinary workers is far too low.

In the context of the point Senator McDowell made, I made the point in the House last Thursday, and I ask to be let make this point without interruption, because it is an important one, that we have established citizens' assemblies to examine many different issues around gender.  I made the point last week that we should also look at the role of local government.  The issue of RT&Eacute; and the licence fee collection and the level of licence fee payment should also be part of a citizens' assembly, that we should not kick the can further down the road, and that we should have an honest debate about it.  We cannot have it here.  Pat Rabbitte attempted it and he was pilloried by sections of the Fourth Estate.  We need public sector broadcasting.  &quot;Sunday Miscellany&quot; and arts and sports programming are examples that show there is a real need for public service broadcasting.  There is an opportunity to expand the remit of the citizens' assembly being established in January to include the role of RT&Eacute; and the amount and collection of the television licence.</p></speech>

I will start with the point at which average income earners move on to the higher rate of tax.  It has been identified as a significant negative for taxpayers earning an average income in Ireland.  We know it is an issue in terms of getting FDI jobs into Ireland.  We know people move on to the rate of higher tax too quickly, when they earn &euro;35,300 per annum.</p><p>We are an unusual jurisdiction, probably one of very few in the OECD where average industrial earners move on to the higher rate of tax at the average point.  It is something we have said we want to deal with and that we want to move the dial.  The Taoiseach has said that we need to move towards a system like that in the UK, where the point would be &euro;50,000.  The equivalent figure in the UK is &pound;50,000.  We will try to get there over time if we are returned to government.  It is our objective that people can earn more money, pay less tax and make a determination themselves about how they spend their money.</p><p>The receipts for capital gains tax totalled &euro;415 million to the end of November, an increase of &euro;69 million against profile.  It is coming in at quite a substantial rate.  We do not know whether it will increase unless we cut it.  What Senator McDowell said is correct historically, but it may not happen again.  Some people believe it will, but others believe it will not.  We think 33% is an appropriate rate right now.  It was 40% and was reduced to 20%.  The rate of 33% is a little higher than the midpoint between those two rates.  Right now we believe it is the appropriate and correct amount.  We do not have wealth taxes, beyond capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax and the local property tax.  In total, those taxes bring in a little more than &euro;1 billion of the &euro;60 billion we collect and spend throughout the year.</p><p>I wish to touch on one final aspect.  There was a little bit of a barney last week as a result of some of the commentary in the House.  I take offence, on behalf of the hospitality sector, which employs a large number of people throughout the country, at what was said by some of my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues as Members of the Oireachtas.  They sullied the name of people who employ many staff around the country.  They were wrong to say what they said about the finest of business people throughout the country.  The comments should be withdrawn because they were wrong, ignorant and ill-informed.  I am very grateful for the employment provided by the hospitality sector.</p><p>I thank everyone: my officials from the Department of Finance and Senators who participated in the debate.  I want to finish with a quote from Keynes.  David McWilliams, when making a point about foreign direct investment in a newspaper at the weekend, quoted him as saying, &quot;It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.&quot;  I believe this Government's policies are broadly accurate.  The left is merging and seems to be getting ready to form the next Government, in its mind at least.  A lot of kisses are being blown between Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il.  The current Government has the finances of the country broadly accurate.  The emergence of a left alliance that wants to enter the next general election will have policies that will be precisely wrong.</p></speech>

I do  not see the reason for grouping it with the others.  There may well be reasons that the others have been grouped.  One of them refers to practising barristers.  The others refer to the basis for qualification for appointment.  For example, amendment No. 49 refers to the Legal Services Regulation Act.  It is a Government amendment.  It seems to be a technical amendment and relates to a particular Act.  It has nothing to do with amendment No. 13.</p></speech>

It states: "In this Act and in the Act of 1961 ... "practising barrister"&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in section 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 ... [and] &ldquo;practising solicitor&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in section 2 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015."  This amendment refers to the definition of particular terms.  The reason we put forward this amendment is that the Bill uses the term "practising barrister" but, as far as we can see, it does not define what constitutes a practising barrister.  The Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 contains the most up-to-date thinking on this and includes a comprehensive definition of "practising barrister" in order to bring all practitioners within an appropriate regulatory framework.  Colleagues will recall that the previous Seanad engaged in a lengthy debate on that legislation previously.  Section 2(1) of the 2015 Act provides that "practising barrister" means a person who is a qualified barrister and provides and provides, or holds himself or herself out as providing, legal services as a barrister which applies whether or not a fee is charged, whether or not services are provided under a contract of service or a contract for services, and whether or not he or she described himself or herself as  a barrister or otherwise uses one of the titles of &ldquo;barrister&rdquo;, &ldquo;barrister-at-law&rdquo; or "counsel&rdquo;.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a very clear definition in section 2(1) of the 2015 Act.  On the other hand, the Minister may have a much narrower definition in mind.  Prior to the 2015 Act, one might well have said that a practising barrister was one who practised at the Bar and the definition was different and perhaps more global but less precise.  If one had used the phrase &quot;practice at the Bar&quot; before 2015, it would have meant holding oneself out as being willing to advise a client on the instructions of a solicitor, in other words, through a solicitor, and to represent a client in litigation as an advocate before the court, again through a solicitor, although there are limited direct access schemes in place now as well.<br/><br/>One way or the other, it is clear that since 2015, the law has provided for at least two definitions of what it means to be a practising barrister.  We have the 2015 definition in section 2(1), as I outlined, which is the more precise and detailed one, and also the older definition of someone practising at the Bar.  The latter, which one could say was derived from common law, was endorsed by the Supreme Court in 1981 in the case of State (Walshe) <i>v.</i>Murphy [1981] Irish Reports 275.  In that case, the Supreme Court held that a person appointed as a judge had been invalidly appointed because he had not in fact been a practising barrister.  That case alone demonstrated, if it were necessary, that this is not just an academic, theoretical or hypothetical question and that having a definition within the legislation has a very specific purpose.  It seems sensible to all the Senators who proposed this amendment that there should be a clear and unambiguous linkage between the definitions in this Bill and the definition in the 2015 Act, which is the most recent definition and the only one clearly set out in statute, so as to avoid any ambiguity and to ensure that the previously understood common law definition would not be the one that would apply in any interpretation or application of the Bill.  <br/><br/>This is what the Minister may regard as a constructive amendment.  It is seeking to draw a direct linkage with existing legislation, the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, which had widespread support.  It seems to be sensible to avoid any ambiguity as to what is meant by &quot;practising barrister&quot;.  I have searched the Bill for another definition and I do not believe there is one.  This is a sensible amendment and I recommend it to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-12-10a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019121000002#VV00200"><p>I echo what Senator Bacik has said.  I know the Minister may be suspicious of this but this is an effort to be constructive and to have the legislation make sense.  If we had said, prior to the Chairman's ruling a few moments ago, that this was something that had to be considered in conjunction with amendment Nos. 51 and 52, the Minister would have noted that there is a subtle difference.  Amendments Nos. 51 and 52 define the term &quot;practising barrister&quot; for the purpose of being appointed a judge but only for that purpose, whereas the term &quot;practising barrister&quot; is also used in the definition term to exclude people from the category of laypersons, which is not covered in the ministerial amendments.  Senator Bacik is correct in that in the case of State (Walshe) <i>v.</i>Murphy, which concerned the validity of a public servant's appointment as a district judge when the public servant in question was not in practice at the time or was not in any substantial way in practice as a barrister at the time of his appointment, the decision laid down what the term &quot;practising barrister&quot; means in law.  In that context, the term &quot;practising barrister&quot; in law was what the Supreme Court held it to be.  Senator Bacik's amendment has the effect of introducing throughout the entire Bill, including in the definition of a layperson which we have been dealing with, a clear indication of who is or is not a practising barrister.</p><p>There was a time when whether one was a practising barrister largely meant but did not exclusively mean whether one was a member of the Law Library subject to the disciplinary rules of the Bar Council.  The new Legal Services Regulation Act introduces a different category of people who have nothing to do with the Bar Council and who may not be members of the Law Library and who are subject to professional regulation by the King&rsquo;s Inns.  Some of them may practise in partnership with solicitors, while some of them may practise on their own and carry out functions which are effectively legal advisory in nature and do not involve them appearing in court at the Bar.  That is the point that Senator Bacik was making so eloquently.  The amendment makes great sense in that the other references to practising barrister and the redefinition are in amendments to other statutes about eligibility to be appointed a judge, whereas this amendment applies to the definition of practising barrister insofar as it refers to somebody who cannot be viewed as a layperson.</p><p>I will go back to the effect of the amendment that we have just made to the Bill to reduce the period of 15 years down to three years.  That is highly important.  It means that people who have ceased to be a practising barrister or practising solicitor, after a quarantine period - as if that was necessary - of three years, will be eligible to be considered lay people.  Given that under the Legal Services Regulation Act, every barrister and solicitor must register with the authority, it is going to be very clear that one is either a practising barrister or one is not a practising barrister because one will be either registered or not registered.  There will be no lack of clarity if Senator Bacik's amendment is accepted.  It makes eminent sense to cover all the bases on this and say that &quot;practising barrister&quot; means what it means now as a matter of law, namely, that one can be a practising barrister who has nothing to do with the Bar Council and does not practice under that rubric.</p><p>This is not an alternative to the Minister's subsequent amendments because they propose to amend prior statutes on who can or cannot be appointed judges.  Those amendments are specific to specific sections in prior Acts, whereas Senator Bacik's amendment is for the purpose of this Bill.  If enacted, it will have a simple effect that if there is any argument as to whether someone is or is not a practising barrister, that person will either be registered with the authority or not.  That will be the basis upon which people will be determined as being laypersons and or non-laypersons for the purposes of the legislation.  On another important point, this will also have the effect that the 15-year quarantine period will effectively be measured by when a person ceases to be a registered practitioner.  That makes eminent sense.  </p><p>I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.  He may be suspicious of anything that comes from anybody other than a Senator on his own benches but this amendment makes eminent sense and will improve the Bill.Dare I say it but even the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, should be happy with this amendment.</p></speech>

That is not the same as my amendment, which is a far more general application.  It seeks to import the definition from the 2015 Act to this legislation and the Act of 1961-----</p></speech>

The amendment I propose, which is amendment No. 13, seeks to import a definition of "practising barrister" and "practising solicitor" from the 2015 Act into both this legislation and also the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961.  It has a far more general impact than any later amendments the Minister may be proposing that refer just to the definition of "practising barrister" for the purpose of a particular section.  This amendment seeks to have a more general effect.  It is a very important point because, if it were adopted, it overrides the pre-existing common law definition of "practising barrister".</p> <p>Senator McDowell has pointed out that the 2015 Act made a significant change to our understanding of what is a practising barrister.  The other important point is that my amendment also refers to a definition for "practising solicitor", which is defined nowhere else in the legislation or any of the Minister's amendments.  It is a sensible and constructive amendment that seeks to provide for a clear connection between other existing legislation, which is specifically the 2015 Act.  It seems sensible to do this and avoid any ambiguity in the definitions of what are practising barristers or solicitors.</p> <p>Given the extremely strict parameters that will be placed on those eligible to seek judicial appointment, it is very important we have precise wording in place for the definition of practising barrister or solicitor, particularly with the quarantine period that we have already discussed in respect of other amendments.  It makes it all the more important that we have a very clear definition and that we use the most up-to-date definition clearly set out in statute.</p></speech>

Paragraph (b) states: &quot;In this Act - (b) a reference to recommending the name of a person to the Government under <i>section 44</i>is a reference to the making, under that section, of a recommendation to the Government that the person be appointed to a judicial office specified in the recommendation.&quot;  To understand the significance of this amendment one must look at the Long Title to the Bill which states:</p> <blockquote> 	An Act to establish a body to be known as [...] the Judicial Appointments Commission; to provide for the making, by that body, of recommendations in respect of appointments to certain judicial offices; to make provision for persons of a lay character, as well as judges and legal practitioners, to be members of that body; to amend the qualification requirements for appointment to judicial office; [and this is the important part] to enable, through other procedures, the making of recommendations in respect of appointments to senior judicial offices that do not fall within the remit of the foregoing body. </blockquote> <p>The remit of the &quot;foregoing body&quot; is the remit of the proposed judicial appointments commission.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When the Bill was under consideration in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, perhaps on Committee Stage or Report Stage, the Members of that House, in their wisdom, decided that the arrangements the Minister was proposing in respect of appointments to certain senior positions, namely, those of Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal or President of the High Court, be taken away from the judicial appointments commission and be subject, where vacancies arise, to a different procedure whereby a committee of senior judges and the Attorney General would be established in order to make a recommendation to the Government.  The Select Committee on Justice and Equality decided that this was wrong and that the separate channel for promotion to one of the offices I mentioned should be overseen by the Government, on the recommendation of the commission, and substituted the commission, which the Minister had proposed, for the committee.  I am completely opposed to that for various reasons.  The choice of Chief Justice is not a matter for the judicial appointments commission in any circumstance.  The Chief Justice is not merely an officeholder of great eminence in the legal system, he or she is the President of the Supreme Court, the highest constitutional court in the land.  The decision as to who should or should not be Chief Justice is vested in the Government under the Constitution, and the choice of persons to be Chief Justice is one for the Government alone.<br/><br/>The amendment made in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to section 44 is in direct contradiction to the Long Title and has the effect of giving the function of recommending a person to be appointed Chief Justice to the commission that will oversee all other judicial appointments.  The same function was handed to the commission in respect of the presidencies of the Court of the Appeal and of the High Court, both of which are constitutional offices, the choice of people to serve in which falls within the remit of the Government alone under the Constitution.  Why should those offices be distinguished from the other judicial positions to which the Bill applies insofar as the involvement, in certain cases, of the judicial appointments commission is required?  It could be argued that the positions are greatly determinative of the character of those courts.  After all, the Chief Justice ultimately assigns cases to divisional courts of the Supreme Court, while the President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the High Court do the same for their respective courts.  More importantly, an office such as the Presidency of the High Court carries with it the obligation and power to make important decisions of which most people will be unaware.  For example, the President of the High Court is the effective enforcer of discipline on those in the profession of solicitor.  Ultimately - I am glad to say in a tiny number of cases - he or she has to take the unpleasant tasks of disqualifying people from being solicitors, of imposing penalties or of upholding the decisions of the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.  In addition, the President of the High Court has a function in respect of wards of court.  He or she does not simply organise the business of the High Court, which is done by means of practice directions and so on, he or she is also an <i>ex officio</i>member of the rules committee and of many bodies that have a profound effect on not merely the administration of adversarial justice between parties in courts but also on that of non-adversarial justice.  I refer, for example, to the case of wards of court, whereby the President of the High Court takes personal responsibility, as the law stands, for the protection of people of unsound mind or minority in respect of their estates.  That role does not simply apply to the protection of people in those contexts but also to taking people into wardship for their own protection.  Where, for religious purposes, parents decide that they will deny their child a blood transfusion, the President of the High Court's jurisdiction to take the child into wardship and to direct that certain steps be taken to save the child's life is very important.<br/><br/>The three offices I outlined carry such functions with them in one way or another but they are not simply the functions of ordinary judges of the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.  It seems that the decision as to who should hold the offices is envisaged by the Constitution to be taken by the Executive - the Government - having considered the matter and received the advice of the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General.  It is for the Government to make up its mind on that issue.  More importantly, it is not for members of the Judiciary to apply for approval or recommendation to appointment of those positions to a commission comprising a majority of laypersons.<br/><br/>Section 44, as amended by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, would have the effect of attempting to rob the Government of the unfettered discretion as to whom it appoints to the offices and would substitute a system whereby it would have to subject the various candidates to some kind of vetting process by the commission and seek a shortlist from the latter.  As the Bill stands, the Government would have to consider the shortlist submitted in the order of preference of the commission.  It is the case that, under the Constitution, the Government cannot be restrained by any recommendation of the commission.  We will soon come to that matter in discussion of one of the Minister's amendment<b></b>and I do not wish to trespass on that debate.  Nevertheless, section 44 is a repugnant provision in its present form.  On this Stage, even though it remains part of the Bill, it is entirely reasonable to remove the reference to section 44 because of the amendments made to it by the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>I should say for completeness that it is my strongly held position, as the Minister knows well, that no sitting judge of the superior courts should be obliged to submit his or her name to the commission for appointment to any other position in those courts.  I have made the point on a number of occasions and will not repeat it at length now, but in this context it is important.  I do not want to be seen to agree with the principle of section 44 at all, but if, unfortunately, it is to stand part of the Bill, it should certainly not have any role for the commission.  Even in that context, the Minister's original formulation, as put before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and rejected by that Chamber, should be reinstated.  Every member of the High Court and the Court of Appeal, as a matter of statute law, is entitled to sit on the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, respectively, on the invitation of the President of the Court of Appeal or the Chief Justice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=12&amp;amp;day=10"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not a question of having to decide who is suitable or capable of functioning as a judge in those courts.  It is an important constitutional point that the law already provides that every member of the superior courts, High Court and Court of Appeal is already eligible to serve as an ordinary judge in the Supreme Court when invited to do so.  Every member of the High Court is entitled by statute to function as a Court of Appeal judge when invited to do so.  The idea of asking those people, if a vacancy in one of those courts arises, to submit themselves for interview and evaluation by a group of people who are, in the majority, lay people, who are inexpert in what is at issue, almost by definition, is wrong and repugnant to the Constitution.  It is an invasion of the judicial independence of each of those persons who is, on appointment, eligible to serve in either of those courts as an ordinary member at the invitation of the president of either court.  </p><p>The reason that section 3 should be repealed is that it provides for the operation of section 44.  Section 44, as amended by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, is deeply repugnant to the principles of constitutional law in this country and deeply subversive of the role of the Government in choosing the presidents of those courts.  On that account I move the amendment.</p></speech>

He would also have acknowledged what I said repeatedly in the context of Committee Stage on the restoration of the senior committee.  He will also be aware that the recommendations are made to the Government and not to the Minister.  Therefore, I am not prepared to accept the amendment and will await deliberation at a later stage on amendment No. 68 which, to my mind, meets the concerns as put forward by Senator McDowell.</p></speech>

The removal of this subsection as stated ensures that there is no ambiguity on this.  It is the prerogative of the Government and not a new quango who it recommends to the President for appointment as it has done on almost 61 occasions during the lifetime of this Government.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this point and go along with us on this issue.</p></speech>

I am well aware of that but I am dealing with it as it stands now, and as it stands now is repugnant.  Even if the Minister does have a majority in this House for the reinstatement of section 44 to correspond roughly to the format it was in before he brought it before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, there is no guarantee whatever that if he brings it back to that august Chamber he will persuade that majority of people who took it out and handed this function back to the commission that the Minister, who is a member of a Government without a majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, will be able to guide section 44 through in the form that he would like.  The only place I can make objection to that is here in this House.  The only stage at which I can make a valid objection is at the very first opportunity, although that does not preclude me from objecting later to the Minister's amendment and suggesting amendments to it.  If I was to say that section 3(b) was to remain in place, at the moment I would be approbating section 44 as it stands.  This would be the last opportunity that this House would have.  The Bill, when it gets back to the D&aacute;il, may be amended in precisely the same way as the Minister failed to prevent it from being amended on the last occasion.  For that reason, it is not hyperbole on my part to anticipate that the D&aacute;il might do exactly the same thing to the Minister's text as it did on the last occasion.  I am trying to protect the public, the Constitution and the role of the Government from that unfortunate possibility.</p></speech>
