Others are in development.  We also need to recognise the sacrifices of the majority of Irish people during this crisis.  Of course, we cannot let our guard down over the next two weeks.  I also acknowledge front-line staff in our health services for their hard work and sacrifice.  It has been a horrendous year for retail and hospitality, which are part of the fabric of all our towns, villages and cities.  We acknowledge the employment these businesses create, both full-time and part-time jobs, as well as the very important revenues for the State and our local authorities.</p> <p>The Government needs to act now to ensure there are no stumbling blocks to providing short-term exemptions for retailers to extend opening hours without the need for planning permission.  If retailers that wish to extend their opening hours can do so, they can get the most out of this very important Christmas period.  This will ensure that more of the Christmas spend stays in this country this December.  If ever there was a time to encourage people to buy Irish and buy local, it is this year of Covid.  Ensuring we have extended opening hours will reduce the numbers queuing both in shops and on our streets and thoroughfares, so this is a public health matter as well.</p> <p>We need to ensure the retail sector has every incentive and that there are no stumbling blocks to allowing extended opening hours.  We need to ensure that any regulations or legislation are passed to provide the flexibility that is needed for the three-week period leading up to the Christmas shopping period.  I ask that we would engage with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to ensure there is no disincentive and no stumbling blocks and that our retail businesses can open for extended hours if they so wish in December up to Christmas Day and the holiday season.</p></speech>

I must take up two or three issues with her.  One relates to No. 3.  I have a problem with anybody who tells me I cannot do anything.  I do not think it is good parliamentary practice to come to a House and propose a motion without debate.  There is some confusion, although I am not confused.  The Deputy Leader might clarify this later.  On 13 November 2020, we were furnished with two motions on this issue.  One was to approve the motion while later, we had motion No. 2 - they are both with me as I printed them off - which refers to today's proposal to send this to the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I think that is the right decision.</p> <p>My concern is the lack of detail.  I will make a proposal regarding Standing Orders of the House in respect of this in future.  I do not believe any motion should come to this House without an explanatory memorandum.  This issue related to a total aggregate of money that can be given to the horse and greyhound racing industry by Government, not the amount given every year.  This was limited to &pound;200 million in 2001.  This limit can be increased by regulations and motion, and this is what this motion will attempt to do.  The limit now stands at &euro;1.36 million.</p> <p>This motion is due back in this House next week.  If it is approved, it will add &euro;96 million to the limit, which is a significant amount of money.  In respect of suggesting that we come in here to talk about a motion without debate, it is more fundamental because it deals with an awful lot of money.  I am happy to support today's arrangement but I respectfully put down a marker and ask the Deputy Leader to bring this up with the Leader's office.  I do not think we should have any motion before this House without an explanatory document.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Orla Murray in the Leader's office who facilitated me as regards some content last night and provided me with more information.  I understand the Department has now agreed, through the Leader's office, to provide an explanatory memorandum, which I hope we will see today.</p><p>With regard to the Criminal Justice (Hate Crime) Bill 2020, the Deputy Leader has done a lot of work on this in the OSCE.  I have been with her there so I know her track record and form.  It is suggested that we can have only 90 minutes to discuss this critically important Bill, to which the Deputy Leader is a signatory and I commend her on it.  This should be increased to two hours, which is standard practice for Private Members' business.  Will the Deputy Leader agree to my reasonable request to extend the debate by a further 30 minutes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-11-17a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1631" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020111700002#C00200"><p>To follow previous speakers on the issue of living with Covid, we have statements on that tomorrow, which I welcome.  The figures of recent days have been disheartening, to say the least.  All of us are hoping we will see a turnaround in the next two weeks while we are still at level 5.  This indicates even more clearly the need for a clear exit strategy and a clear message from the Government, in particular on the very difficult issue of people coming home for Christmas and how we manage this.  There is very welcome news of a vaccine but we need to ensure that over the coming months we have a clear strategy in place.</p> <p>I join with others who called for a debate on domestic violence.  I understand we are due to have that debate next week and I very much welcome it in light of the very alarming figures from Safe Ireland last week, which showed that an average of almost 2,000 women and 411 children were in receipt of support from domestic violence services in each month since March.  We already know from various reports the extent to which the risk of domestic violence has been heightened and exacerbated during the pandemic.  I commend the Garda and NGOs that have been working on this during the months that Covid restrictions have been in place to ensure supports remain in place for women and children in particular who are enduring this level of violence.  It is a very serious matter.  As we approach the international day for the elimination of violence against women and girls next week, it is timely that we would have this debate in the House.  I thank the Deputy Leader and Leader for organising it.</p> <p>I call on the Deputy Leader to arrange a debate on conditions for asylum seekers pending the implementation of the Day report recommendations and pending the abolition of direct provision.  We know this is promised in the programme for Government and steps are being taken.  In the interim, we need to ensure the conditions in which those currently living in direct provision and seeking asylum in Ireland live are not simply let slide while we await the overall reform.  I note that this week the Irish Refugee Council called for the urgent implementation of vulnerability assessments for asylum seekers and to prioritise children coming into Ireland.  It is a real concern that this is not happening.  Ireland is legally obliged to conduct a vulnerability assessment within 30 days of arrival under the reception conditions directive.  It must be a concern if we see this is not happening, or if we see that perhaps we have let our attention become less focused on the conditions for families and children in particular in direct provision.  I know organisation such as Nasc as well as the Irish Refugee Council have raised this issue.  I would welcome a debate on this over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Like my colleague beside me, I do not think this is a healthy practice.  I propose a change to the Order of Business whereby we have a debate before any appointment is made.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not accept this motion without debate and nobody else in the Chamber should either.  Unless people have been in a coma for the past fortnight, they will know that when the T&aacute;naiste was Taoiseach he passed a confidential document to the then head of the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, and we also know a Deputy has lodged a formal complaint over this action to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.  Today, we see the Government wishing to appoint, without debate, a former professional lobbyist for the NAGP to SIPO.  The former lobbyist can then adjudicate on the issue of the confidential document released to the NAGP by the T&aacute;naiste.  The person in question only ever lobbied for one organisation, the NAGP.  I understand she lobbied on no less than eight occasions for the NAGP in 2017 and 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->You could not make this up.  The arrogance and the apparent stance to the effect that there is nothing to see here are astounding.  I am looking across the Chamber to see if there is anyone at all on the Government benches who is prepared to say that perhaps they should pause this process and that we should have a debate on this topic before proceeding any further.  This is also yet another example of the cosy insider club that operates across this body politic.  It appears that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have for years been operating an arrangement whereby they take it in turns to fill this position with one of their own each time it comes around.</p><p>The second issue I wish to deal with is that of Fine Gael's sister party, Fidesz, which, as Senators will know, has today scuppered the EU budget.  I have personal experience of Fidesz.  I met a number of its Government Ministers two years ago when they were cracking jokes about the final solution in the context of immigrant children.  I went to see two teenage children, the same age as my own, who had been imprisoned in a cage for a year without ever being let out.  I need to ask the following question this morning: when will the Fine Gael Party decide to call for the expulsion of Fidesz from the European Peoples' Party, EPP?  We have been talking about this for long enough but it has not happened.  It is frankly beyond comprehension that Fine Gael can sit comfortably with an openly fascist party as a member of the EPP.  It is high time we had a debate on that topic as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-11-17a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1632" speakername="Frances Black" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020111700002#D00200"><p>I raise an issue which I have previously brought to the attention of the House.  It is a very important matter.  It is essential that we discuss the plight of the Debenhams workers and their appalling treatment by the company in their redundancy dispute.  The Irish branch of Debenhams, which operated 11 stores, was put into liquidation on 9 April.  The stores' closures came once the UK parent company entered administration and ended its financial support to the Irish business.  I have been in contact with a number of workers who have picketed for over 200 days and many of these workers have been picketing 24 hours a day, seven days a week for more than half a year.  Some 1,000 staff and a further 1,000 working in concessions have lost their jobs.</p> <p>What has driven the former Debenhams workers to commit to one of the longest pickets in Irish history?  They are seeking redundancy terms of two weeks' per year of service and statutory entitlements of two weeks' per year of service.  The workers have claimed this agreement would be to match the negotiations between the retailer and the unions carried out in 2016.  The workers' trade union, Mandate, has attempted to reach an agreement with the liquidator, KPMG, that would have the workers share a &euro;1 million allocation as well as statutory entitlements realised from the sale of stock.  However, this has since been withdrawn.  Shop stewards said they would not accept it as a 2016 agreement was much higher.  Ninety per cent of these workers are female and many of the voices I heard from are in their third decade of working for Debenhams.  They have given so much to the franchise and now feel utterly forgotten.  Many of these women are grandmothers who said that they enjoyed their work thoroughly.  They have now been picketing for over half a year in harsh weather conditions and they will continue to do so.  They have made it clear they will not stop until they are honoured with a better offer.  They feel this is about loyalty.  We need to listen to their voices and see some definite action for these workers.  It is essential we discuss this issue in order to come to a satisfactory resolution to this dispute.  It is simply not good enough.  These workers deserve so much better than this.</p></speech>

Last night, the RT&Eacute; documentary on Bloody Sunday expertly captured the events of the day in a very detailed way, from the morning of the raid by Michael Collins' Squad on British officers, during which innocent people were also killed, to the deaths in Croke Park in the afternoon.  The executive producer, Mr. Michael Foley, used archival interview footage involving those who were there on the day to recall the events, as well as transcripts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He also set out how the Crown forced people back in the ground with volleys of machine-gun fire from Jones' Road on one flank and The Hill on the other and, in doing so, caused a crush that led to more deaths.  It was particularly harrowing.  Of course, the military files were only released 79 years later and showed the extent of the British cover-up on the day.  I also acknowledged the RT&Eacute; Radio 1 "Documentary on One" programme, which aired on Sunday night and which was narrated by M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, as part of its coverage of the event.</p><p>Most striking of all was the difference in the funerals.  The British officers were transferred back to London and given military honour funerals at Westminster whereas the British ordered the funerals of the 14 souls killed at Croke Park be minimalist and that there be no speeches.  Indeed, many of those 14 souls lay in unmarked graves for over 90 years.  I acknowledge the role of the GAA, which has always been more than sporting organisation.  Led by its president, Mr. John Horan, it initiated a programme of rectifying the position by providing headstones for those who lay in unmarked graves in Glasnevin Cemetery and, indeed, the memorial at the rear of the Hogan Stand.  I wish to afford particular praise to the GAA Museum, which for the last number of months throughout this year culminating in this week led an educational programme examining the lives of the people involved.  It is 100 years later but they were real people on the day, from Jane Boyle, aged 26, who was due to be married and held her fianc&eacute;'s hand as she fell and died at Croke Park, to young William Robinson who, at 11 years of age, was the youngest and first to be killed on the day.  He was in a tree at the Canal End and was shot out of it.  Of course, there was Michael Hogan, probably the most famous of all the people on the day because the Hogan Stand is named after him.  I rise today to say let us remember them this weekend and not forget the events of that particular day.</p></speech>

They did a great professional job of remembering this tragic period in our country's history.</p><p>I congratulate the Burren Ecotourism Network on being the only tourism initiative from this country to be considered as part of the thirty great experiences in the <i>Lonely Planet</i>guide that was announced today.  This is on top of other awards the Burren Ecotourism Network received in recent years for the unique and splendid way in which it does business.  The Burren Ecotourism Network is a world showcase on what can be gone when communities collaborate.  It is a network of 60 businesses in the tourism area which promote and do their business in a sustainable way.  The Burren is a world example of sustainability and farming for conservation where the people who live on the land and on the farms, and the farmers who farm the land, also act as ambassadors for the area.  The best possible tourism product is where the people who live, breathe and work in the area become the ambassadors, storytellers and guardians of the product.</p><p>This is a great day for County Clare, north Clare, the Burren and Ireland.  It shows what we can do in a sustainable way, in a manner that protects our environment and what we have inherited from previous generations, and what can be done in terms of protecting it for future generations.  Projects like this will definitely help us get out of our current challenges and difficulties because millions of people want to travel and visit environmentally-friendly areas in our country to protect, cherish and celebrate our environment.  I salute and congratulate the 60 people involved in this latest world award achieved by the Burren in County Clare.  I wish them well in their future endeavours.</p></speech>

She is 100% correct about the Debenhams workers.  It always amazes me that when these companies go bust, they walk away and leave behind a trail of utterly decimated workers, some of whom end up on the breadline.  I fully support what the Senator said.</p> <p>It is time we had a debate on bullying in the workplace.  I was horrified last week to hear on "Today with Claire Byrne" the way staff are treated by some of us in these Houses.  We have a unique relationship with the people who work with us.  We depend on our personal assistants and secretarial assistants.  Mine go way beyond the call of duty and I know that the rest of us around here feel the same way.  That said, I listened on that programme to stories of people crying in their offices and on the way to work.  Those people were totally decimated by the treatment they received here.</p> <p>I have worked with a bully and looked into the eyes of a bully.  Bullies attack the strongest and best liked in an organisation.  They target people and set about their mental destruction.  That is the way they work and there should be no place anywhere in this country for bullies, certainly not in the workplace.  We need legislation to criminalise bullying in the workplace.  People have committed suicide as a result of being bullied.  I worked with a man who committed suicide and I know he was bullied.  It is horrendous.  I am asking that we bring the Minister for Justice in here and have an open and frank discussion on bullying in the workplace and on how we, the lawmakers, might tackle it in this House as an example to all other workplaces.</p></speech>

Further suffering is now being foisted upon students in particular as a result of them entering into contracts for accommodation in many colleges and universities.  In order to secure accommodation for the year ahead, students had to pay somewhere between &euro;5,000 and, in some cases, &euro;10,000 in advance, only now to be told that the contracting party was not aware that there was going to be a lockdown, the contract has been entered into and they must suffer the loss.  Those students have paid the money but have no access to the accommodation or requirement from it.</p> <p>I am seeking a debate on this matter.  The resolution of this cannot be on the basis of contracts entered into being enforced.  These students have suffered enough.  I am familiar with cases where the parents of such students have lost their jobs and the &euro;5,000, &euro;7,000 or &euro;10,000 that was given over to secure accommodation was borrowed money that has to be paid back.  In many cases, the people affected do not have the wherewithal to do that.  It cannot be beyond all of us to come up with a solution, whether through some kind of grant that supports those in particular hardship or through a tax write-off that can be attained over a number of years.  In most cases, it is the parents who are affected but some students have taken out loans on the basis of a hope that they could work part-time in the hospitality sector during the college year.  We now fully accept that there will be very little opportunity for students to work through this period.  I would like the Leader to organise a debate at the earliest opportunity in order to give some sense of direction as to how this matter might be resolved.</p></speech>

Recent changes in legislation have meant that harbour companies were abolished and their responsibilities were transferred to local authorities.  That is welcome.  Any element of local democratic involvement in the operation of harbours was removed in 2009 and councillors were removed from the boards of those companies.  Harbours are now being administered by local authorities and the cost implications of that are significant, perhaps nowhere more so than D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown because the harbour there was transferred to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council with an estimated liability of &euro;45 million attached.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a huge burden, both capitally and in terms of the revenue budget of the council on an ongoing basis.  We as a House need to recognise that this is repeated in other local authorities throughout the country and we need to take stock of that.</p><p>D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour is an enormous historical asset for the country, as the location through which so many emigrants left this country and for its Victorian architecture, what it is and what it represents.  However, it suffers from a lack of investment because D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council does not have the money to make the significant repairs and maintenance that needs to be carried out.  As we approach the end of the month, with the council's budget meeting scheduled for 24 November, it will be a difficulty for councillors to find that money.</p><p>There are knock-on effects for other important historical harbours, such as Bullock Harbour and Coliemore Harbour, where recent damage has rendered the harbour virtually unusable.  The House needs to take stock of the fact that this burden has been transferred from central government onto local authorities, notwithstanding the fact that, in the case of D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, the D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company essentially ran the harbour into the ground and failed to take care of the maintenance obligations it had.  We have allowed a burden to shift onto local authority and thereby onto the residents of the area that we need to deal with as a House.</p></speech>

Today is day 222.  That is 222 days on strike.  They are going to be outside the D&aacute;il at 1 o'clock today and I support Senator Black's call for a debate in this House.</p> <p>I raise the urgent need for additional secondary school places in south Kildare and for a new secondary school based in the Curragh of Kildare to alleviate the problems in surrounding towns and villages.  The campaign has been going on for a long number of years.  Recently in parliamentary replies to my Labour Party colleagues, we were told the identification of the site for this new school was imminent but, due to commercial sensitivities, its exact location could not be disclosed.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education into the House because, commercial sensitivities aside, there is a crisis for parents looking at secondary school places for their children.  I have been contacted by parents with this worry from Newbridge, Kildare town and down to the village of Nurney.  Parents are being told their children are on long waiting lists, causing great stress to them and their children alike.  Kildare's population continues to increase but despite repeated warnings from public representatives, community groups and many parents, the urgent need for school places has fallen so far on deaf ears.  I hope additional classes, more school places and, as urgently as possible, a new school can be provided.  Anything else will cause an educational crisis in the coming years in the county.</p> <p>The second issue I will raise is one I have raised previously in the House, as have colleagues.  It is an issue for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and if he could come into the House, it would be appreciated.  There are a number of housing co-ops in County Kildare.  Some have been built for more than 30 years.  The residents of many of these houses took part in these schemes on the proviso that they would in time be able to buy out their homes.  In all cases, this has not happened and they have been refused at every attempt.  These residents ask that the same opportunities be afforded them as are given to those in local authority housing.  They ask that the tenant purchase scheme be altered to allow those living in co-op housing the opportunity to buy the homes where so many of them have lived all their adult lives.</p></speech>

As we all know, adults are at risk of different types of abuse or neglect in their family homes and residential settings around the country.  Many such adults are older or dependent and may have disabilities or mental health issues.  There has been no targeted national messaging campaign throughout the Covid period regarding these vulnerable people.</p> <p>I will provide some figures from the report, particularly in relation to CHO 7, which contains my county and constituency.  The 2019 annual report highlights a serious backlog and failure to respond to preliminary screenings.  For example, in 2019, 1,000 preliminary screenings were submitted which have received absolutely no response.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That figure doubled from 438 the year before.  If that trend continues, it means 2,000 preliminary screenings could have received absolutely no response in 2020.  </p><p>This is appalling and essentially means there has been no clinical oversight of safeguarding within those reporting organisations.  There is major concern about this, which I share.  There is a lack of understanding and an appropriate response to people who are vulnerable to harm and abuse.  I call on the Deputy Leader to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House for a debate on this issue.</p></speech>

The Government has done all it can in terms of education.  Reopening the schools was the best thing that could have been done. However, we do not yet know what the long-term impact of the pandemic on children will be.  Last weekend my nine-year-old daughter said the number one thing that she wanted for her birthday next week was an end to Covid, despite the fact that she is in school and is happy.  She also said that she will remember this time for the rest of her life.</p> <p>With that in mind, let us turn now to the adults who last weekend put everything we have achieved thus far in jeopardy.  They have not thought about the legacy they are leaving for our children.  Over the past nine months, we as a Government have done our utmost to support businesses, put in place supports for workers and put the physical and mental well-being of our community to the forefront.  </p> <p>What were the adults who were drinking on the streets of Dublin last weekend doing?  They were putting all of that in jeopardy.  We know that vaccines are on the way, but we cannot throw caution to the wind at this important time.  I ask people not just to think about the vulnerable people in our communities that we all know need to be supported but also about what they are doing now that will have a deep and lasting impact on the development of the younger age group as we go forward.</p></speech>

They are not a panacea and there is a long road ahead, but I am cautiously optimistic.  I see them as, it is to be hoped, a pathway to the rejuvenation of the economy and some sort of normal life.</p> <p>Those who are vulnerable and front-line workers will be the first to be vaccinated, but we should have a proper debate on whether teachers should be included as a priority when the vaccine is rolled out.  We have to acknowledge the huge amount of work they have done since September to keep our schools open and provide some sort of normality.  There is a low incidence rate in schools, but teachers are at the front line and should be given priority when it comes to the roll-out of a vaccine.  As we know, we will be given a limited supply of it. </p> <p>I was worried yesterday when Dr. Ronan Glynn remarked that this is the first time in history that anti-vaccine campaigns are being organised before a vaccine is available.  This is extremely worrying.  We are already seeing large amounts of disinformation and it is incumbent on us as policymakers and public representatives to ensure that facts are relayed to the public to counter disinformation about vaccines.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must remember that vaccines work and have saved millions of lives around the world.</p></speech>

In the current climate, we have talked a great deal about the impact of Covid and the many other issues facing communities and community groups.  It is vital that we have an opportunity to hear specifically from the Minister of State with responsibility for the Irish language and Irish-speaking communities about Government supports and strategies.  More broadly, to give him his due, the former Leader of the Seanad in the previous term regularly provided time for statements on the Irish language.  For understandable reasons, we had a lot of issues come down the track but we need to have statements on the Irish language before we break for Christmas for all of the logical and fair reasons that everyone understands.</p> <p>Agus &eacute; sin r&aacute;ite agam, a cheannaire gn&iacute;omhach, I respectfully note - I am also at fault for this - how little Irish has been spoken in this Chamber in recent months.  I respectfully encourage Senators to consider how we can improve the situation.  We have lost a number of Gaelgoiri from the previous Seanad.  Those of us who advocate for and champion the Irish language have a responsibility.  We must ask, through the office of the Cathaoirleach, the Leader's office and as individual Members, how the Irish language can feature more regularly in the day-to-day business of this Chamber.</p></speech>

The legislation in question relates to scrambler and quad bikes and the social use of them in our communities.  I live in the constituency of Dublin Central and I am aware that the use of these bikes has been an issue right across the city and outside it.  The Road Safety Authority stated that there were more than 40 injuries and fatalities over a three-year period and that more than half of the individuals involved were under 18 years of age.  This issue is affecting young people and their families.  The Private Members' Bill that will be introduced this evening is part of a response to try to regulate the use and control of these quad bikes and scramblers.  There is no doubt many people enjoying using them off the road in a responsible way.  However, scramblers are available cheaply to purchase for young people under the age of 18 and for others.  They do damage in residential, built-up communities such as Cabra, in those communities along the Royal Canal, in beautiful parks such as Tolka Valley Park and to sports pitches.</p> <p>Of critical importance is the fact that the proposed Private Members' Bill will amend the Road Traffic Act to the effect that the Garda will have the power to enforce the law and prosecute people if there is not registration or insurance on the bikes and it will also have the power to seize them.  This House should appeal to Government to support that Bill and appeal to parents and young people not to buy quad bikes and scramblers this Christmas and to enjoy a safe Christmas.</p></speech>

BusConnects, in principle, is visionary.  The idea of upgrading our cycling infrastructure and of public transport in the city being more accessible is fantastic.  However, it will involve an enormous infrastructural change to our capital city.  To give due regard to the National Transport Authority, it is running public advertisements, virtual rooms and having one meeting per corridor.  It is in this regard that we need to have a discussion.  The public meeting aspect of this is happening on a 90-minute Zoom session where any public representative or only a nominated community representative may enter one question.  Not everybody on the call is getting to ask a question.  Consequently, there is no real public meeting aspect.  It is limited to a six-week consultation period but six weeks is not enough, not in the middle of a pandemic.</p> <p>While I applaud the NTA's creativity and effort in the manner in which it is trying to engage and get the information out, confining the consultation to a six-week period and a 90-minute meeting per corridor is completely and wholly inadequate.  There are major concerns.  For instance, it has gone to get lengths in the context of traffic modelling but there are concerns about, for example, the area in the Dublin South-Central constituency where there is a confluence of three corridors.  When I asked if traffic modelling has been done in respect of this matter, I was informed that it would be done at the planning permission stage.  That needs articulation right now.  We need the Minister to come before the House for a debate on instructing the NTA to extend that consultation period to at least the end of the February.</p></speech>

In 2019, almost 900 communities and groups entered the Tidy Towns competition.  We are deeply indebted to all those groups, individuals and volunteers who do such excellent work in our villages and towns each year.  If I can be a bit parochial, we were particularly proud last year that the beautiful village of Glaslough, County Monaghan, scooped first prize.</p><p>This year, all those groups and communities have continued to work throughout the pandemic, while adhering to social distancing and other health guidelines, to ensure villages and towns were kept in pristine condition.  They did that while knowing that there would be no judges this year, but that did not stop them from doing their work and ensuring their villages and towns were well kept.  I commend them on that excellent work.  While I welcomed the news from Government that the Tidy Towns competition would go ahead in 2021, I was somewhat taken aback by the fact that the Minister made no reference to funding for those groups.  Those groups get minimal funding each year to assist them in their work.  I ask the Leader to contact the Government and ask it to make the announcement that is made every year so that these groups and communities can plan for the work ahead in 2021.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-11-17a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020111700002#L00200"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and all the Members who contributed to the Order of Business.</p> <p>Senator Kyne welcomed the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which is a positive development.  I agree with the Senator that we should take a sensible approach to the opening hours of our retail sector.  They should, of course, be allowed to extend their hours.  Some shops are considering a 24-7 operation when they are allowed to reopen and that will help with safety, so that people can shop at different times.  It would allow those retail sectors to try to claw back some of what they have lost.  This is the time of year when many businesses make the money that will see them through to the summer months.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan raised the issue of the explanatory memorandum regarding motions before the House.  I completely agree with him.  I am aware of the conversations that he has had with the Leader's office and the Department.  I thank him for his contribution and for giving notice that he expects this to happen in future.  It is a reasonable request, which would help all Members, both Government and Opposition.  It is a sensible suggestion and we will follow through on it.</p> <p>Senator Bacik raised the domestic violence debate.  That will go ahead.  Many Members raised the Safe Ireland report last week.  It is extremely worrying.  It is predominantly women and children who suffer and the long-term impacts will be quite severe.  It is the hidden cost of the pandemic that goes on behind closed doors and we often do not see it.  It is an important debate to have but this should not stop at that debate.  We have much work in the pipeline to do on that issue.  It has been left for far too long.  I agree that it is disheartening to see the week's figures for Covid-19.  We made such great strides.  Many of us are focusing on those outside drinking scenes but there are other sectors of society where meetings are still happening.  We all need to knuckle down in the next couple of weeks and hope that we can claw back those figures, but, as Dr. Ronan Glynn put it, we are not where we need to be.  Hopefully, we can turn that around.  We still have time to do so.</p> <p>Senator Gavan moved an amendment to the Order of Business regarding the motion to appoint an ordinary member to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The Senator did not have a difficulty with the appointment of the chairperson but mainly with the ordinary member.  He went on to link that to the T&aacute;naiste's actions in releasing a confidential Government document to his friend, Dr. Maiti&uacute; &Oacute; Tuathail.  I know Geraldine Feeney personally.  In the crossfire between Sinn F&eacute;in and Fine Gael, with a seemingly quite aggressive battle going on, it is unfair for the Senator to link a person who is not in the House and cannot defend herself to that particular incident when she had nothing to do with it.  I will not accede to the Senator's request to amend the Order of Business.  If there is a disagreement between two parties, we should not let an individual who did no wrong get caught in the middle of that.  It is quite unfair.</p> <p>Senator Black raised the issue of the Debenhams workers.  I thank her for bringing it to the floor of the House.  I listened to one of the workers this morning on "Newstalk Breakfast".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is disingenuous of KPMG to offer them less than what they were originally offered and that they rejected.  It shows no willingness on KPMG's part to settle the matter.  The lady who spoke on radio this morning - her name escapes me - spent 24 years of her life working for that company, which is still in operation in the UK but not in Ireland.  She called for people to think twice before purchasing from <i>debenhams.ie</i>because the Irish business is no longer in operation but the workers have been standing outside for the past 222 days.  I hope to see some movement on this situation, given how difficult it is for the workers.<br/><br/>Senator Cassells mentioned that this weekend would be the 100th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.  I thank him for that.  It is incumbent on us all to remember it.  The documentary did a good service to what happened that day.  I was struck by the Senator's comments on the funerals of those men here compared with the lavish funerals of the officers in Westminster.  His remarks have some standing today in terms of the restrictions currently in place, the importance of having a proper funeral and burial and how much it means to people to be able to honour their dead.  To take that away from people following the incident in question compounded the hurt and aggravated the situation.  I concur with Senator Buttimer's request to acknowledge that in some way at the Cathaoirleach's discretion.<br/><br/>Senator Conway mentioned the Burren Ecotourism Network.  I congratulate its members on behalf of this side of the House.  It is remarkable to see the network being recognised by Lonely Planet in its 2021 guide.  This shows the considerable work being done in a beautiful and fascinating part of our country, one that we sometimes take for granted because it is on our own doorstep but that is widely appreciated across the globe.  I do not doubt that, when travel reopens, we will see many new visitors flocking to see what is one of our national treasures in the Burren in Clare.<br/><br/>Senator Craughwell raised the issue of bullying in the workplace.  I concur with him.  The news story that some staff members of the Houses of the Oireachtas had been treated that way made for damning reading.  We need to do something about it.  It is not right or acceptable in any workplace, and our workplace is no different.  In fact, we should be leading by setting a higher example than any other workplace and treating our staff with the utmost respect and dignity at all times.  Clearly, we have a great deal of work to do in that regard.  I hope that any staff member who believes that he or she is not being treated fairly feels that he or she can come forward.  There are mechanisms in place to deal with bullying.  People should never feel silenced.  There is somewhere to go for help and people are not on their own.<br/><br/>Senator Dooley raised the issue of student accommodation, a matter that has also crossed my desk.  I have managed to resolve a couple of cases, in that the college eventually came around to refunding the students in question the moneys they had paid up front.  Although there was a contract in place, it was on the basis in one case that classes would be held in person in at least a blended learning experience, something that will not now happen.  Many students were only told of the scheduling changes after they had committed to their accommodation and paid their fees up front.  This is about goodwill and doing the decent and right thing.  The situation is changing at a fast pace.  Students are suffering enough and many parents have taken out large loans to afford the accommodation.  If students do not need to use it and are not having classes, the colleges must not use student accommodation to buffer themselves against their lost finances for the year.  That is not what students are there for.  Those colleges that did not look after students in their time of need will be remembered.<br/><br/>Senator Ward raised the issue of local harbours being transferred into the ownership and authority of local authorities and the financial burden of same.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour is close to his heart and I think of Westport Harbour in my county of Mayo.  The transfer is a significant outlay.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine should be able to assist and find specific funding.  A harbour is a local amenity, one that needs to be protected and invested in rather than just maintained at its current standard.  The Department has work to do in this regard.  It might be worth raising the topic as a Commencement matter in order to get the Minister to answer in the House.<br/><br/>Senator Wall raised the issue of school places in south Kildare.  I agree with him on the answer to the challenges at second level.  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in has discussed the matter of students getting places based on their parents having attended the same school previously, but I agree with Senator Wall's approach.  This is a question of the amount of school places.  That is what needs to be addressed.  If we do, then there will be no difficulties.  School places do not arise as an issue in many rural areas, for example, my county of Mayo, but it is a major issue in the commuter belt around Kildare and Dublin.  Rather than tinkering around the edges of the rules, the only solution is to create more school places where there is demand and an increasing population.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is clearly demand in Senator Wall's area of south Kildare. <br/><br/>Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin raised the issue of the HSE national safeguarding office report in respect of adults in residential care being very vulnerable.  I agree that Covid-19 and the pandemic have really highlighted the deficiencies right across the health sector in protecting the most vulnerable.  I think straightaway of the nursing home situation where many people have lost their lives because the proper plans were not in place.  Vulnerable adults who often do not have anybody to speak on their behalf can often be forgotten in the chaos and mayhem that surrounds a situation like this.  It is unacceptable that over 1,000 screenings have still remained without a response.  That is a failing of those individuals who were left without their case being dealt with and this needs to be addressed immediately.<br/><br/>Senator Dolan, as always, puts Ballinasloe on the map, not that it needed to be done.  I drive past it on my way up here all the time.  She mentioned the website shop<i>ballinasloe.ie.</i>It is an important reminder to all of us that retail is struggling.  There is a sticking plaster there currently because of the temporary wage subsidy, the supports that are there and the money that has been provided directly to businesses to keep the wolves from the door.  Come next April and beyond, the cracks will start to appear in those businesses that may be running out of that cash flow.  We can help to prevent some of this happening by all of us, as public representatives in our own communities, encouraging people to shop and spend locally.  As somebody said we must not let Jeff Bezos win by shopping on Amazon.  We must shop locally as we can get everything we need right here in Ireland and it will make a big difference.<br/><br/>Senator Pauline O'Reilly raised the issue of the difficult year it has been for children in quite a poignant remark by her nine-year-old daughter wanting a birthday present that Covid-19 would just end.  It is difficult to comprehend what it must be like for a child of that age to be dealing with a pandemic.  They are being asked to stay in, not to play with or hug their friends and they cannot see their grandparents.  Children are very resilient and will come through this but there is an impact.  They often do not have the same voice that we have.  The voice of the child and listening to children is so important in understanding the impact that this has had.  This is a very important point and is something that we must be cognisant of as a Government and Parliament.<br/><br/>Senator Ardagh raised the issue of the Covid-19 vaccines and the anti-vaccine campaign, which I listened to on the radio this morning.  Dr. Glynn mentioned at the briefing I believe, yesterday, that Dr. Tony Holohan, Dr. Glynn and the health professionals&rsquo; team will not say much about the vaccines at this point because they want to get more clarity.  They are welcoming them, however, as a positive move.  They are acutely aware of the already emerging anti-vaccine campaign which is really dangerous and may prevent this country from reopening at the pace that we want it to, will result in people getting sick, and much sicker than they would have been if the vaccine had been widely accepted.  There is a job of work to be done to reassure people.  These vaccines have come around at a much faster pace than ever before.  Of course, there will be caution and an element of suspicion and people will fear that they are not fully safe.  We need to see the data, as has been said by many health professionals.  I am not an expert in all of this but there is certainly a job of reassurance to be done whenever we do get our hands on those vaccines.<br/><br/>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile asked for statements on the Irish language.  I will certainly make that request to the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to come before the House at the earliest opportunity.  The suggestion that we use the language as much as possible is a good one.  <br/><br/>Senator Buttimer wants a real debate on the reopening of the economy post-December 1 because of Covid-19.  We have sometimes a far better and more robust debate in this House than we have in the D&aacute;il because there is at least the opportunity to go back and forth a little more.  I understand the point that the Senator is making and it is something that we will have to have a regular discussion on because the pandemic is not going to end on 1 December.  <br/><br/>I join with Senator Fitzpatrick in welcoming the Bill being put before the D&aacute;il today by Deputies Lahart and McAuliffe on scramblers and quads, and the dangers they pose, in particular, for younger people who may perhaps need to be better informed and protected because they are young adults.<br/><br/>Senator Seery Kearney raised the issue of BusConnects and the challenges posed by public consultation.  This is a very genuine and reasonable issue to raise.  Public consultation on a change of this scale is completely necessary.  If people feel that the consultation process is not inclusive and facilitative of proper debate then that is something the Minister should consider.  I will ensure that his office is aware of that.  This is a significant development and there will always be resistance to change.  Change scares people and people prefer the <i>status quo</i>.  The only way that change can be brought about is by bringing people with it and ensuring that they are properly informed and included in the process.  At the very least, the debate and consultation needs to be broadened out.<br/><br/>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of the Tidy Towns programme for 2021 being opened up again.  That is very welcome.  This is a big deal for many communities right across the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know that in my own county of Mayo it is a huge source of pride for every small town and village.  It can take years to achieve first place, like Senator Gallagher's town of Glaslough in County Monaghan.  It takes years to reach that standard and I have no doubt that is why they kept going in 2019, as did lots of communities.  If a community lets a year drop, they will know about it the next year when it comes to the rankings.  It is fantastic for local communities.  The funding should absolutely be provided because it is an outlet for many communities and a source of pride.</p></speech>

It is one that I hope will continue to grow.  The question today is about how we manage those data and how we ensure citizens' data privacy.  I hope that the Minister of State will express the Government's view about the recent judgment in the Schrems II case.  Max Schrems and others would have argued that much of this litigation was unnecessary.  Had the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, made a decision based on the original case presented by Max Schrems and the responses provided by Facebook and others, it could then have been open to either party to challenge the decision of the DPC, but the DPC did not choose to go that route.  Does the Minister of State believe that that was the correct approach by the Data Protection Commissioner?  In general, does the Minister of State believe that moving to litigation is the correct approach?</p> <p>When this case came before the European Court of Justice, the Data Protection Commissioner was alone in arguing that the standard contract clauses were invalid.  The State and Max Schrems argued a contrary position.  In light of that approach, I would be grateful, regardless of whether or the Government agrees with the Data Protection Commissioner's approach, to ask what are the total costs to the State of the Schrems II case.  What are the total costs to the State in litigation since Max Schrems initially raised a number of privacy concerns with regard to Facebook?</p> <p>I know have raised this issue before.  Is the Data Protection Commission adequately resourced?  Does it have a sufficient number of staff and sufficient expertise?  The overall question of the architecture of the Data Protection Commission and its decision-making processes is also crucial.  We have one Data Protection Commissioner.  Is it the view of the Minister of State and Government that we should have one commission or a Data Protection Commission with three commissioners making decisions as is the case in other jurisdictions?</p> <p>I am torn between the resources argument and the decision-making process when we compare Ireland's situation with data protection commissioners in other countries.  The Spanish data protection commissioner issues fines almost weekly for data breaches.  In the Irish case, only two fines have been issued for breaches of general data protection regulation, GDPR, since 2018, in the cases against Tusla.  The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, was here last week.  We talked about one of the challenges with banks and financial institutions, the breaches that have happened there, and whether the DPC has acted strongly enough in that regard.  My concern in all of this relates to the reputational risk to Ireland if we do not get this right.  There are concerns for individual citizens, businesses and companies if there are data breaches.  If we are at the heart of trying to regulate all of this, especially given the important role that the social media giants play in our economy, we have to ensure that we have it right.  I question whether our approach in this case was correct.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What is the Minister of State's view on the future role of the DPC?

It is important to note that the DPC is independent in the performance of its tasks and the exercise of its powers.  Therefore, the Senator will appreciate that I cannot comment on legal proceedings in which the commission was or is involved.  Nor can I comment on findings of the courts, given that they are also independent in the exercise of their duties.</p> <p>The case referred to arose from a complaint referred to the DPC in June 2013 concerning the transfer of personal data to the US under the European Commission's safe harbour adequacy decision.  In October 2015, the court struck down the safe harbour policy and the original case in the High Court was reformulated to challenge the transfer of EU citizens' personal data to the US via the use of standard contractual clauses, SCCs.  It is a matter of public record that the DPC was involved in these proceedings and the court referred a number of questions to the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  In its ruling in July, the ECJ upheld the use of SCCs to transfer data but struck down the EU-US privacy shield adequacy decision on the basis that the US did not provide adequate and enforceable safeguards and redress mechanisms where EU citizens' data were forwarded by US companies to US intelligence services that then processed them.  Concerns about the lack of enforceable protections were raised about the use of SCCs to transfer data to the US.</p> <p>More recently, Facebook and Mr. Schrems have instigated separate judicial review proceedings against the DPC in the High Court concerning mattes raised in both ECJ judgments.  I will not comment any further.  However, I will reiterate that the Government respects the judgment of the court and is fully supportive of the need to protect citizens' data through enforceable safeguards and proper redress mechanisms.</p> <p>The Senator will appreciate that the GDPR provides for high data protection standards, imposes detailed obligations on bodies that process personal data and provides a range of possible sanctions, some of which are significant, for when those standards are breached.  The GDPR specifies how bodies are to be regulated and all parties must adhere to these obligations.</p> <p>Enforcement of the GDPR is a matter for the DPC - where it is the lead authority in the EU under the one-stop-shop mechanism - and other independent supervisory authorities across the EU in accordance with the processes set out by the GDPR.  The Government has every confidence in the DPC in meeting its responsibilities to enforce and protect the data protection rights of EU citizens to the high standards required by the GDPR.</p></speech>

While the DPC is independent, the language the Minister of State is using is pretty much the language we heard in the run up to the financial crash, when people were told that the Financial Regulator and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement were independent agencies and the Oireachtas could not interfere.  Ireland is potentially facing a significant reputational risk in terms of the misuse of data and in challenges such as the one brought by Mr. Schrems.  The Government does not have its eye sufficiently on this industry.  Senior levels of government face a challenge in understanding the importance of these issues.  As the Minister of State knows, one of the major challenges that we will face in the coming years is the relationship between the State, the EU and other state actors and the social media giants.  I respectfully suggest that the Government needs to examine how the DPC is functioning in dealing with these cases and ensure that Ireland is best positioned to protect the privacy of individual European citizens and the country's reputation.</p></speech>

Moreover, we will ensure that Ireland delivers on its responsibilities under the general data protection regulation.</p> <p>The DPC finds itself at the fore of many key data protection decisions in the EU due to the presence of many of the world's leading technology companies in Ireland.  As the Senator is aware, the GDPR is fast becoming the internationally recognised data protection standard.  I assure the House that the Government will continue to engage with the DPC to ensure that the latter has the tools, support and resources it needs to perform its important role.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Government is committed to supporting the Data Protection Commission in its work.

More than &euro;19 million has been secured for the commission in the 2021 budget, which is more than a fivefold increase on the 2015 allocation.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to the House and it is good to have him here to put this Commencement matter in context.  do not know what the visiting teacher for the visually impaired is.  When I was a young boy back in County Clare with a visual impairment and attending mainstream schools, a visiting teacher used to come once a year.  He was a very nice man by the name of Tim O&rsquo;Connell from County Cork and he liaised with the family and the teaching staff to see what structures and services were needed to ensure that I would prosper in education at that time.  Back then this involved arranging typing lessons, which might seem somewhat trivial but it was groundbreaking for me at the time.  I had more or less forgotten about the visiting teacher programme until I received an email last April or May during lockdown from a parent who was very frustrated by the lack of contact from the visiting teacher with her regarding her adolescent child who was starting secondary school.  I started probing then and discovered that the programme had evolved successfully since my days in school but, unfortunately, there has not been a great deal of consistency in the continuity, standardisation and updating of the service with the latest in ICT, various supports and so forth.</p> <p>I discovered that the system was reviewed a number of years ago but this was done within the Department with the stakeholders and the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, at the time.  Various bodies were involved in this review, which was effectively about delivering the management of the service.  I am looking now for a fundamental review of this service.  This service enables people who are blind and visually impaired to avail of mainstream education because for too long they have had to attend a special school for the blind and visually impaired people in Dublin.  We are all trying to achieve and create fully integrated mainstream education.  The visiting teacher from that perspective is very important.  I want a review and evaluation of the visiting teacher programme.  That needs to be independent of the Department and headed up by an academic to include, of course, representatives of the Department and the visiting teacher programme, but also representatives from organisations such as the National Council for the Blind and representatives of parents.  This evaluation and review is important in trying to bring standardisation and the visiting teacher programme to a new level, where proper integration with the other support services that are available is fine-tuned and standard as opposed to being excellent in Cork, for instance, but not so good in Meath.  I have discussed this with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, in a conference call.  I want the review to happen now with a tight timeline for it to come back with recommendations.  I am very happy to engage with the Minister of State&rsquo;s office regarding the structures of this review as it is important. </p></speech>

The visiting teacher service for children with hearing and visual impairments in Ireland provides support for the education of children who are deaf or hard of hearing and for children who are blind or who have significant visual impairment.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Support is provided for parents in schools at the preschool stage and at primary and post-primary school levels.  An independent review of this service was concluded in 2013-14 by two UK-based specialists in hearing and visual impairment.  Their report, "Review of the Role, Organisation and Management the Visiting Teacher for Children with Hearing and Visual Impairment (VTHVI) Service, Ireland", was completed and published in June 2014 and it is available on the Department's website.  </p><p>The 2014 review of the service recommended that: an appropriate structural framework be developed with clear lines of governance and a new management and leadership structure be developed to ensure that the direct management of the sensory support service is undertaken by a person with a specialist qualification in the field of either visual or hearing impairment.  </p><p>Following the publication of this review of the services, in February 2015, the then Minister for Education and Skills announced the establishment within the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, of a new support service to assist schools in supporting children with special educational needs.  The visiting teacher service for children who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind or visually impaired was transferred to the NCSE with effect from that date, consistent with the recommendations of the review of the service.</p><p>Since that time the visiting teacher service has been managed by the council.  This change was designed to ensure that schools can receive a better and more integrated service from the new support service.  It also meant that the visiting teacher service could be incorporated into the overall support service provided through schools by the NCSE, including the services provided by special educational needs organisers, the special education support service and the national behavioural support service.</p><p>The service offers longitudinal support to students, their families and schools from the time of referral through to the end of post-primary education.  Professional oversight is provided by the sensory specialist lead with specialist qualifications in the area of sensory disability.  Operational oversight is provided by the sensory operational lead.</p><p>During the school closure period, the visiting teacher service continued to support parents and pupils remotely, while a range of additional resources have also been available online.</p><p>The NCSE is also continuing to improve the services.  Continuous professional development is provided for visiting teachers, which includes access to the relevant postgraduate programmes for teachers of students who are blind or visually impaired.  The NCSE is also seeking to further integrate the services within its regional teams to provide greater levels of support and training for schools.  Accordingly, at this time there are no plans carry out a further review of the support service for the visually impaired.  In conclusion, the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, thanks the Senator for giving her the opportunity to outline the important and sensitive work that the NCSE support service does for families with children who are visually impaired.</p></speech>

I accept the work that was done by the previous review and it was appropriate that the service was transferred to the NCSE, but we need to evaluate whether the taxpayer getting value for money from this particular service.  The visiting teachers cannot be expected to be at the top of their game when it comes to ICT and the range of services that are there.  Are there proper linkages and service level agreements with various other stakeholders that can help in that support structure?  We need another review and evaluation - and not a review of the management of the programme, because I am quite happy that it is being managed in an appropriate way.  However, I am not convinced at all that it is delivering the results that it could achieve and the benefits it could derive for young people.  It is performing well, but it could perform much better.  The Minister of State has committed to carrying out an evaluation and a review to me privately, but that is not contained in the reply, which is disappointing.  I would like to know whether she is going to stand by the commitment that was given to me that a review and evaluation would happen.</p></speech>

I am delighted that my Commencement matter is being taken but it is interesting that I have come here from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, where both the Minister for Education and the Minister of State at the Department of Education are appearing.  I asked whether this Commencement matter could be deferred but that was not possible.  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, is present on behalf of the Department of Education but we need to find a way to work out the issue better.</p> <p>When I tabled this matter, it felt a little like Groundhog Day because I spent almost four years in the D&aacute;il talking about the severe shortage of places at secondary level for primary school children in Newbridge and Kildare town.  The South Kildare Educate Together, SKET, campaign did incredible work during those four years.  Its research and statistics suggest that at least 415 students will be without a place in Newbridge and Kildare by 2025.  That research was conducted four years ago but things have accelerated since then.  Much building is happening, and while new homes are always welcome for those who need them, the infrastructure has not been put in place.  Parents have contacted me day after day, week after week, over the past five years, and already this year, that has started for next year.  I contacted every primary school within the catchment area of Newbridge and Kildare town between yesterday and this morning.  For the current sixth classes, in the case of every school, at least five children have not got a secondary school place for next September, while the numbers for fifth class are even worse.</p> <p>Parents in Newbridge, for example, have come to me who work and live in the town, whose children attended primary school there and whose older children attended secondary school there, but they cannot get a place.  In Nurney, a small village within the catchment of Kildare town, children cannot get a place in their local school in Kildare town.  The whole issue became more difficult because of the problems with St. Paul's Secondary School in Monasterevin where, thankfully, classes have now started.  Children in fourth class are now having to try to find a place in another school because they feel there might be a better chance of getting into secondary school two years later.</p> <p>This is incredibly frustrating for everybody - parents and the school community - but it is not the schools' fault.  More than two years ago, a commitment was given by the then Minister for Education and Skills that a new 1,000-pupil school given to this area would replace the Curragh education and training board school and serve the needs of people in Newbridge, Kildare and the Curragh but nothing has happened.  The most recent update I got suggested that a particular site was being considered, but nothing happened in the year and a half between December 2018 and the present Government coming into place.   It is now a crisis.  School communities have been impacted so greatly by Covid-19 and young people, as we know, are feeling the negativity and stress.  They and their parents are further stressed by the possibility that their child will not have a secondary school place.  I would greatly appreciate the Minister of State taking this on board.  I am looking forward to hearing his response.  I will take the matter up with the Minister for Education when I return to the education committee meeting after this debate.</p></speech>

As the Senator may be aware, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  Kildare, Newbridge and the Curragh are three of the designated school planning areas.</p><p>Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one or a combination of the following, namely, utilising existing unused capacity with a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or the provision of a new school or schools.</p><p>As a result of demographic analysis, 47 new schools have been announced to open between 2019 and 2022, including two new post-primary schools to serve school planning areas in County Kildare, in Kilcock and Maynooth.  The requirement for additional school places is kept under ongoing review and a current exercise to examine updated data, taking cognisance of demographic trends and planned residential development in the school planning areas, is at an advanced stage.  A significant number of other schools in Kildare have current capital projects and details of these are available on the Department's website, <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p><p>Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector to meet demographic and other demands.  The capital programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040.  I wish to advise the Senator that the current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, including projects in Kildare, the Curragh and Newbridge, may be viewed on the Department's website.  That information is updated regularly.  In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.</p><p>The capital programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  Details of schools listed on this programme can also be found on the Department's website.</p><p>The existing Curragh Post Primary School is a multi-denominational community college under the patronage of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB.  </p><p>The Department is aware that post-primary enrolments in the Kildare, Newbridge and Curragh school planning areas have been increasing in recent years and it is expected that this pattern will continue in the short to medium term.  </p><p>It is intended that this demand will be addressed by the planned provision of a new 1,000-pupil school as a replacement for the existing Curragh Post Primary School.  This new school will also provide capacity to cater for demand arising in the Curragh and adjoining Newbridge and Kildare school planning areas.  There is capacity in the existing Curragh Post Primary School building pending delivery of the new school building.</p><p>As the Senator will be aware, the Department is also currently advancing or recently building projects in a number of post-primary schools in the Newbridge-Kildare-Curragh area school planning areas, which will provide additional capacity.  The current status of each of these projects may be viewed on the Department's website, which is updated regularly.  For the Senator's convenience, I will outline the current status of the major projects.  In the case of St. Conleth's Community College, Newbridge, an extension project was completed in 2018 to provide for a capacity of 750 pupils.  The school had an enrolment of 547 pupils in 2019-20.  In the case of Patrician College, Newbridge, the project is at the early architectural planning stage to provide for 1,000 pupils and is being managed and delivered by the National Development Finance Agency.  The school had an enrolment of 884 pupils in 2019-20.  Similar to the process adopted for September 2020 readiness, the Department will be engaging further with patron bodies shortly in advance of identifying specific September 2020 capacity pressure point priorities, which will necessitate specific action.</p><p>In a normal year, addressing the increase in demands for school places, while challenging, is manageable, generally through utilisation of existing spare capacity within schools, rental, temporary accommodation or other short-term measures pending the delivery of permanent accommodation.</p><p>A new site will be required for the replacement post-primary school and the Department is currently at a very advanced stage in the process of identifying a suitable site for the new school building.  This site acquisition process has been progressed in respect of the requirement in question and in line with standard acquisition protocols.  The Department is liaising closely with Kildare County Council under the memorandum of understanding between the Department and local authorities for the acquisition of school sites with a view to securing a suitable site for this school.  The Department has engaged the services of a site acquisition manager, a consultant, to shortlist potential sites, preferably in or around Kildare town and in Newbridge, in order to appraise same.  The first stage of this appraisal has been completed with input from Kildare County Council and the Department is now in a position to carry out stage 2 assessments of a refined shortlist.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This stage 2 process is under way.  </p><p>Arising out this exercise, the Department has opened preliminary discussion with landowners on short-listed sites and is hopeful of progress.  The Senator will appreciate that commercial sensitivities attach to site acquisitions such as this and given that negotiations are at a critical point, I am not in a position to discuss further information and detail.  Should agreement on the proposed acquisition be reached, a process will advance to the conveyancing stage when draft contracts are prepared and legal due diligence is undertaken in respect of the proposed transaction.  It would be expected at that stage that the project to deliver the new school accommodation can simultaneously progress to architectural planning stage.  I can assure the Senator that school authorities will be kept apprised of the situation and will be informed of a permanent location for the school as soon as possible.  </p></speech>

At least I have the sense that this proposed new school has moved to stage 2 in respect of site assessment and that following that, it will be moving to architectural planning stage.  I certainly welcome that.  I again emphasise the significant issues relating to timelines to which we need to try to adhere.  We could very well reach a situation where within two years' time, there could be between 250 to 300 children without a place at second level.  I am talking about mainstream education.  There is a significant shortage in terms of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, places and special education places for young people with intellectual disabilities in the Newbridge area.  This is one of the most important things that this Government can deliver.  Children must have access to school places.  I welcome the update, particularly with regard to the PBS school.  I spoke to the principal recently.  He was very pleased to have that building progressed but we must look at what is happening in the interim and make sure we put in place places to ensure that young students have the opportunity to start second level education.</p></speech>

I hear her genuine concerns about this matter and will certainly convey to the Minister that there is a real sense of a need for urgency to deliver the new school and to ensure that until the school is effectively built and opened, appropriate and necessary measures are put in place to ensure there is sufficient capacity for students in the Newbridge-Curragh area of County Kildare.</p></speech>

I join in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who now represents the people of Sligo-Leitrim but whose family origins are in Roscommon.</p> <p>There is significant pride in Cavan, Monaghan and all that region in Cavan General Hospital.  It has been part of the fabric of that area for the past 30 years.  We must acknowledge the Herculean efforts of the staff during the pandemic and throughout the year.  The hospital is tremendously well staffed.  The case for a new accident and emergency department in the hospital has been highlighted by me and by other public representatives over a number of years.  It is a case acknowledged in the 2040 plan and while that is encouraging, action is needed.  Cavan and Monaghan are fast-growing counties and on occasion, the hospital also provides services to people from counties Meath, Louth and Longford.  Outpatient attendance at the accident and emergency department is increasing and can be in excess of 100 per day.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In circumstances where there are ten beds available and more than 100 patients per day, the Minister of State will appreciate that ten turnarounds will be required.  Attendance is very high and in recent months we have had two very big outbreaks of Covid in Cavan.  Part of the difficulty is down to the overcrowding in the hospital and the lack of facilities there.  There is no point in saying otherwise.</p><p>There has been only piecemeal investment, effectively, since the hospital was built.  It needs a major investment now.  The old accident and emergency department is not fit for purpose.  There is a need for a second resuscitation room and for administrative facilities.  There is a need for a complete upgrade, improved capacity for privacy, better spacing and more facilities.  The accident and emergency department is cramped and this has an impact on privacy and in the context of the pandemic.  There is an absolute need for something to be done about this immediately.</p><p>There are suggestions that the designs for a new accident and emergency department, endoscopy unit and isolation area are being examined.  Is there a real commitment to the absolute need for an improved accident and emergency department?  Where does the project stand at present What is the timeframe for it being put in train?  This needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency and the pandemic has emphasised that.  The number of patients presenting each day - approximately 110 most days - is another example of the need for urgent action.  Just ten beds in an old-style, cramped area are not enough.  Cavan General Hospital is a teaching hospital.  It is a very important regional hospital.  We need to know the commitment and timeframe, how it will all evolve and when the new unit will be built.  It is badly needed.</p></speech>

I come from the constituency comprising Sligo, Leitrim, north Roscommon and south Donegal and I understand that some of my constituents in Donegal are playing a big match against the Senator's county next Sunday in the Ulster final.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to outline the position on plans for the development of a new accident and emergency unit at Cavan General Hospital.  Cavan and Monaghan hospitals are part of the RCSI hospitals group.  Cavan General Hospital operates as a single hospital with Monaghan General Hospital and currently provides services to the population of both counties.  Its catchment area extends to counties Meath, Longford and Leitrim.  Together, they share an integrated managerial and clinical governance system, as well as integrated patient care pathways and support functions.</p> <p>Cavan General Hospital is a teaching hospital, as the Senator rightly said, with links to the Royal College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Physicians and Dundalk Institute of Technology.  All acute inpatient services are in Cavan General Hospital and in addition the hospital provides extensive outpatient, theatre and day services.  Cavan General Hospital is a level 3 hospital and Monaghan General Hospital is a level 2 hospital.  The smaller hospitals framework defines the role of smaller hospitals and outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to operate within hospital groups.  The Cavan and Monaghan hospital emergency department is located in Cavan, with facilities in Monaghan focused on elective care and the appropriate streaming of patients to the minor injuries unit.  These minor injury units help to provide valuable services to local communities and alleviate the pressures on emergency departments.  The HSE intends to progress a project to extend the emergency department, which includes a second resuscitation room, additional clinical administration area and additional waiting area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The HSE has advised it has received some proposed layouts for review.

The pandemic has placed additional stresses on all areas of acute hospitals, including emergency departments, and a design team has now been selected to progress this emergency department project whilst taking account of the learnings presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Cavan and Monaghan Hospital, serving the people of counties Cavan and Monaghan and the wider RCSI Hospitals Group, has a reputation for the delivery of high quality, innovative and safe care to patients.  Given the critical role of Cavan General Hospital within Cavan and Monaghan Hospital, I assure the Senator that this Government will continue to support the hospital to develop its valuable services into the future.</p></speech>

I apologise for inadvertently shrinking his constituency.  He represents all of it with great heart, interest and commitment.</p> <p>I appreciate his remarks.  He said that we will get a new emergency unit with resuscitation rooms and a new administrative area.  I welcome that commitment.  I am also heartened to be informed by him that a design team is in place.  That is all good, acknowledged and welcome.  My request to him is that we get real action, and fast, and that we get over all sorts of bureaucratic hurdles as quickly as we can, get the money and get the job done.  It badly needs to be done.  I acknowledge it is in the capital programme but action is needed immediately and we need the job done.  My final message is that the Minister of State should please treat this as an absolute priority because it is something the place is so badly in need of.  It must be done eventually so why not get it done fast and meet the real need that is growing daily?</p></speech>

I also thank the Cathaoirleach for eventually selecting this matter, which has been submitted every week since we resumed this term.  I am glad to finally seek action on the issue of mobile home caravan parks and, in particular, the need for regulation and legislation that would ensure fit-for-purpose contracts between mobile home park operators and those who rent or lease pitches from them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was contacted by a constituent during the summer who faced issues with their contract.  After 18 years, the mobile home caravan park stated that the caravan was no longer fit for purpose, despite being insured.  That was just one of a number of issues raised by this constituent.  To lift the lid on the issue, I launched a survey to get a better sense of it and I could not believe some of the stuff that came back.  More than 200 people responded to the survey.  Most heard of it through a Facebook advertisement I published.  Some 89% of respondents have a contract, 42% have had a negative experience with the owner of the park regarding their contract, 95% have no residents' association in their park and 88% think regulations and legislation should be introduced.<br/><br/>I refer to some of the issues raised regarding contracts, which are so vague that <i>ad hoc</i>rules relating to noise, pets and curfew are sometimes used as an excuse to threaten eviction.  Owners are forced to upgrade their mobile homes after X number of years, even though the home might be okay, but they must buy from the owner directly.  Some contracts seem to ban formation or participation in residents' associations.<br/><br/>Regarding upkeep, no tenants' association is allowed.  Each individual must approach the operator to discuss a problem regarding the individual contract.  It is easy for the operator to say it fulfils everything written down in a short contract.<br/><br/>On fees, particularly in this Covid-19 year, respondents said full fees were charged for a much-shortened opening season, fees increased every year with no upgrade of site or facilities and some said fees should be tied to set out guaranteed opening times of the season.  Some people called for a built-in buy-back clause and said it was so bad they ended up accepting almost anything in the contract.<br/><br/>On closer inspection of the issue, more broadly in the North, the Executive introduced a Caravans Act in 2011, which is a shared responsibility between the Department for Communities and the Department of Finance.It is a simple Act that ensures the particulars of the agreement.  Under the agreement, for instance, the owner of the caravan site must give the proposed occupier a written contract which states various things.  In addition, it must employ terms on consultation with occupiers' associations.  The owner, therefore, shall consult a qualifying occupants' association, if there is one, on all matters that relate to the operational management of or improvements to the caravan site which may affect the occupants either directly or indirectly.  That is my stad.  I will wait for the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>

If Senators have difficulty in raising a Commencement matter, I am always happy to assist any Member of this House or, indeed, the D&aacute;il so feel free to contact me at any stage.</p> <p>Covid-19 has, understandably, raised a number of issues for mobile homeowners.  Current level 5 restrictions mean people generally cannot travel to their mobile home in the normal way and this has been the case for significant periods of 2020.  The Senator has been active on this issue for a number of months and launched a survey to gather feedback.  I thank him for sharing some of his findings.  I am interested to know how many people contributed to his survey because having made inquiries with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, I can confirm that it has received 70 queries from consumers about caravan parks issues this year.  Unsurprisingly, the majority of these were received during the spring and summer months.  Due to the varied nature of these queries, the CCPC had to deal with the issues on a case-by-case basis and had key messages for consumers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The contract or licence agreement which consumers have with their holiday park operators is very important and they should familiarise themselves with the terms and conditions.  Where consumers require further information about their contractual arrangements, they should speak directly with the operator of the site.  In the case of unilateral changes to a contract made by an operator or contractual arrangements which may contain unfair terms and conditions, the consumer should raise the matter directly with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, under the regulation on unfair terms in consumer contracts.  In cases where a consumer and a holiday park operator cannot mutually resolve a dispute over contractual arrangements, it is up to the parties to seek a civil remedy to the case.  </p><p>The application of charges for mobile homes during the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to be determined by the terms and conditions of the contract and reflected in a licence agreement which would be granted by the operator of a caravan park to the owners of mobile homes.  Notwithstanding the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, consumer rights apply in full and they have not been weakened.  Consumers are entitled to rely on what is provided for in the contract that they have with their operator.  Where a written contract is drafted by a trader in advance and a consumer does not have the opportunity to review the terms of the contract before signing, those contract terms will be subject to the regulations.  It is important to highlight that under these regulations, traders, including operators of mobile home parks, are obliged to adhere to the contractual terms previously agreed.  A trader cannot unilaterally change the terms and conditions without the consumer's agreement.  </p><p>The CCPC recommends that consumers check the terms and conditions of their agreement with their operators.  If consumers think an operator is acting unfairly in relation to the contract, they can make a complaint to the CCPC.  Following this process, if the issue is not resolved, it is open to them to commence legal action.  If the claim is for less than &euro;2,000, consumers can use the small claims procedure to try to resolve their complaint.</p></speech>

The issue here is that in many cases these are just one-year contracts.  Some people have spent more than &euro;30,000 for a pitch in a mobile home site and suddenly find themselves, in some examples I have seen, in one-year contracts.  The system is broken.</p> <p>The Minister of State asked how many people responded to my survey.  It was just over 200 people.  I have also reached out to the CCPC and it is aware of the issue because, as the Minister of State mentioned, many people have contacted it this year.  The system itself needs to be looked at by the Department.  </p> <p>I ask the Minister to go back to Cabinet and suggest that a public consultation from the State is launched so that we are not just going on my survey.  An official public consultation on the part of the Government could explore the need for legislation and further regulation.</p></speech>

I reiterate that where there is a complaint from a consumer that he or she was subject to unfair practices in the way that the terms and conditions of an agreement were reached, it is open to him or her to make a complaint to the CCPC under the regulations on unfair terms in consumer contracts.  Despite the fact that 70 people have contacted the CCPC this year and despite the survey the Senator conducted whereby 200 people came back to him directly expressing dissatisfaction with their contracts, not one person has lodged a formal complaint to the CCPC.  That could indicate that those people were able to arrive at a mutual agreement with the caravan park operator.  A mutual agreement is always much better.  Perhaps there are other reasons people did not decide to pursue their complaints further.</p> <p>I am happy to go back to the CCPC on foot of the Senator's contribution today and see if we can look at reviewing what is there.  I will reiterate the point that despite 70 people contacting the CCPC, not one made an official complaint.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Troy:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It would be worth the Senator's while, although I am not telling him his business, to make the 200 people who contacted him aware that they can contact and make an official complaint to the CCPC.</p></speech>

I am sorry the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here but I am sure the Minister of State will bring some good news.</p> <p>For over 40 years, the good people of Athy and its surrounds have waited in hope, expectation and often desperation for a new relief road.  Over those 40 years, there have been many false dawns and promises but, finally, in October 2017, for the first time ever, the proposed road was granted planning permission.  Since first being elected as a public representative, this has been the number one issue for me and the people I represent.  At a special meeting for councillors in early 2018, following confirmation of the planning permission, we were informed by Kildare County Council that land acquisition would begin later that year with pre-evaluation of tenders in early 2019 and that the main tender would be awarded in quarter 3 of 2019.  The main road was due to commence in quarter 1 of 2020, with the road due to open in quarter 1 of 2022, or so we were told.</p> <p>During this time, I and all the public representatives in Athy continued to raise this matter at each council meeting.  Indeed, it is a standing item each month on the agenda.  Month after month we asked if there was any problem with funding, timelines or obstacles to the opening of this much-needed road and month after month we were told there were none.  We are fully aware that we are in a pandemic which visited our shores in early 2020 and continues to dominate and affect everything we do.  However, alarm bells have been going off every month since the beginning of this pandemic as I was told that there were Covid delays, but nothing major, and that the road was on target, albeit progress would be delayed by a number of months.  The alarm bells grew louder in the past two months when I learned that the project has not advanced to the tender stage.  We are now a full year behind schedule.  I, along with colleagues, was hearing about Covid-enforced delays and, most alarmingly, new demands from the Department of Transport.</p> <p>At yesterday's Athy municipal district meeting, my colleagues, Councillors Breslin and Lee, along with all the councillors present, were told by officials that the Department of Transport had recently informed the council of changes to the procedures with the Athy distributor road.  The invitation to tender documents has now been referred to the Department, with no clear timelines in place for proceeding to the next stage of the project.  That is not good enough and totally unacceptable.</p> <p>The provision of this road has held up the progress of our town for years.  It is currently holding up a &euro;3 million redevelopment of Emily Square in the centre of the town because a one-way system cannot go ahead without the new road.  It is also holding up the provision of a 3.4 km cycle lane and over 7 km of new footpaths, due to be provided as part of the road.  It is potentially holding up community playing fields in the town, so badly needed by the town's sports clubs, and is holding up safer access to the town's train station for some of the over 40% of the population who leave the town each morning to go to work.</p> <p>Most importantly, this is about the future of a great town, one which has faced great obstacles in trying to attract industry and commerce against traffic delays of more than an hour most days, as traffic snarls trying to travel just 2.5 km through the town and over its only bridge.  It is about the quality of life for parents who have no option but to wait in traffic for over an hour each morning trying to get their loved ones to school or those trying to get to work, adding to the stress of all involved.</p> <p>The road, experts tell us, would reduce traffic in the town by 50%, provide over 3.4 km of segregated cycle track and 7 km of footpath and give rise, the council estimates, to &euro;6.1 million in safety benefits resulting from a reduced number of collisions.  Stage 1 of the tender process has been completed with, I am told, six contractors qualified to tender for the main works contracts.  A series of advanced works contracts has been completed and I am told a significant proportion of land compensation packages have been agreed.</p> <p>When will Kildare County Council be given the go-ahead to proceed to stage 2 of the tender process and issue the main works contract?  Most importantly, when will the people of Athy be able to travel along their new road, use the proposed cycle lanes and footpaths and when will the traffic that has held back this town for too long almost disappear?  When can those interested in investing in this town expect to see completed the almost &euro;50 million worth of works which are dependent on this road and which have been promised, modernising this great old town and allowing it to breath again?  The people of Athy cannot wait any longer.</p></speech>

I am happy to have the opportunity to respond to his question on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who, unfortunately, cannot join us.  I am delighted to respond to the Senator.  I served with his father between 2011 and 2016 and always found him an honourable public representative and a gentleman to deal with.  I ask him to pass on my good wishes to him.</p> <p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is a statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provision of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  State grants, where applicable, are intended to supplement the funding allocated to the maintenance and improvement of roads by local authorities from their own resources.  </p> <p>The national development plan, NDP, provides for the gradual build-up in funding for the road network, but funding is not yet at the level needed for the adequate maintenance and renewal of regional and local roads.  For this reason, the primary focus for capital investment continues to be the maintenance and renewal of the network, with some limited investment in road improvement schemes.  In this context, 12 regional and local road improvement projects were identified for development subject to the necessary approvals in the national development plan.  The construction of a distributor route to the south of Athy connecting to the N78 is one of those schemes.  That is positive.</p> <p>The proposed Athy distributor road comprises an arterial link street incorporating footway and cycleway provisions of approximately 3.4 km in length and a new crossing of the River Barrow, the refurbishment of an existing railway bridge over the River Barrow and the provision of a new crossing on the Dublin-Waterford railway line. </p> <p>The scheme objectives include a substantial reduction in traffic volume on the existing N78 through Athy, the provision of an alternative safer route in the vicinity of the town and improved accessibility.  The proposed road development includes the provision of a dedicated pedestrian and cycle facility over its full length with connections to the Barrow Way and the train station.  It is hoped that these facilities will encourage walking and cycling as a local means of transport and provide greater accessibility to public transport for people living in the surrounding housing estates. </p> <p>As regards the current position, I am advised that the Department of Transport has provided significant financial support to Kildare County Council for the scheme to date and that this has facilitated the completion of the site and archaeological investigations and advanced contracts, including preliminary accommodation, culvert construction and utility relocation works.  The land acquisition process is also underway.</p> <p>I am also informed that the council submitted the contract documentation for the main scheme construction contract to the Department last week and is requesting approval to proceed to tender.  The request will be considered once the contract documentation has been reviewed and I will bring back the points he raised today to the Minister on foot of this debate.</p></speech>

We hope we are on the right road.  The problem I have, which the Minister of State might convey to the Minister, is that, in respect of the stage he announced, namely, documentation going to the Department, I have been informed by officials in Kildare County Council that this is a new stage.  The council had not contemplated this stage in the building of the road.</p> <p>I encourage the Minister of State to, as he said, bring this matter back to the Minister as quickly as possible so that he can give the go-ahead to Kildare County Council.  We have waited 40 years for this road.  I am sure if the Minister of State ever travelled to Athy he would have unfortunately been caught in the traffic that snarls the town each day. </p> <p>I ask him to ask the Minister to allow the council to issue the tender documents to the six preferred tenders.  At least we can then fast-track this road in the quickest time for the people of the Athy.  I thank the Minister of State for his contribution today.  I ask that he speak to the Minister on behalf of Athy and the people that live there.</p></speech>

The proof of the pudding is always in the eating.  Despite the fact that available funding for strategic grants under the NDP was reduced in the 2021 budget, provision was still made to move the project in Athy forward.  I am conscious that the overall scheme will cost &euro;42 million.  This Government and previous Governments have made an investment of &euro;5.4 million in this project.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some &euro;3.5 million was allocated to the council for this project in 2020.  I do not believe all of that is going to be drawn down.  There is a commitment there.  I accept what the Senator is saying.  Perhaps there is an additional layer that was not originally envisaged.  The key now is from the Senator promoting it here, and I am conscious my own colleague Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin has raised this issue previously as well, is that we make sure that this new layer in the process is dealt with as quickly as possible because money has been allocated.  It is important that councils are enabled to draw down money that is allocated, that they spend that money, move it forward, build the road and open up the land for development because that is what we all want to see in our respective communities.  I will certainly bring back the points the Senator raised to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and hopefully we can push this forward at an earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

Addressing Traveller accommodation is a priority for me and my Department.  There is no doubt that delivery on capital programmes in recent years has been disappointing.  The need for investment in Traveller accommodation is not reflected in the level of money drawn down from the capital budget.  I assure Senators that I am determine to address the reasons for this and implement all of the solutions.</p> <p>The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 provides that local authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes in their areas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p><p>It is a matter for each local authority to set targets for the provision of Traveller accommodation, which they outline in their Traveller accommodation programmes.  The allocation and recoupment profiles for Traveller accommodation projects can vary across local authorities, given the local priorities, circumstances and project timelines as set out in their programmes.  These programmes provide a roadmap for local authority investment priorities over the period and form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for Traveller accommodation.</p><p>It is important to note accommodation for Traveller households is provided across a range of housing options.  The majority of Travellers live in standard housing, including local authority housing and housing assistant payment, HAP, supported tenancies in the private rented sector.  Funding for these housing supports are provided through the respective budget lines.  The Traveller accommodation budget is provided solely for Traveller-specific accommodation such as halting sites and group housing schemes.  Accordingly, funding available to provide housing solutions for Travellers is much broader than the Traveller accommodation budget.</p><p>I am pleased to say a budget of &euro;21.3 million has been allocated to the Traveller accommodation programme for 2021; this represents an increase to both the capital and current budgets for Traveller accommodation.  My Department&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that full use is made of this funding.</p><p>Capital spending on Traveller accommodation has increased year on year from a low in 2014 of &euro;3.2 million to &euro;8.7 million last year.  To date this year, &euro;9.1 million has been spent from the capital budget and I expect further drawdown before the end of the year.  Although this is an improvement, I fully recognise it falls short of what is needed and the Department continues to work with local authorities to improve delivery.</p><p>In addition to the capital funding provided, my Department provides revenue funding to local authorities for specific Traveller accommodation-related supports, such as social worker salaries and the management and maintenance of halting sites and group housing schemes.  A total &euro;5.4 million was provided to local authorities to meet these costs in 2019.</p><p>A development to improve the delivery of Traveller accommodation is the implementation of the recommendations of the expert group report, which was published in 2019.  In 2018, the Traveller accommodation expert group was established to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other legislation that impacts on the provision and delivery of Traveller accommodation.  The terms of reference for the Traveller accommodation expert group were drawn up in consultation with the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee.  The expert group comprised the following three members: Dr. Conor Norton, head of school of planning, DIT; Professor Michelle Norris, head of social policy, social work and social justice, UCD; and David Joyce, barrister, Mercy Resource Law Centre.  </p><p>The report was published in July 2019.  The recommendations contained in it will enable the delivery of Traveller accommodation.  The topics considered and reported on by the expert group were broken down into four subheadings, namely, delivery reflecting need; planning; governance; and capacity and resources.  The 32 recommendations across the four topics considered are comprehensive and wide-ranging, from changes to procedure and policy to changes to legislation.  Delivery and implementation will involve several areas within the Department, as well as input from other Departments, local authorities and other external stakeholders.  It is clear that the completion of this review and the delivery of this report is a significant step in identifying the best ways to address the issues in the delivery of Traveller accommodation.</p><p>I am working with my Department on establishing a programme of projects that will implement the recommendations of the Traveller accommodation expert group review to improve the delivery and standard of accommodation.  I will also establish a dedicated programme board to drive forward this implementation.  I will ensure the board will include Traveller representatives and representatives from the local authorities, which will be instrumental in driving implementation of the completed report.   </p><p>In advance of the establishment of the programme, my Department has been working, where possible, to progress recommendations contained in the expert group report.  My Department has engaged extensively with stakeholders, Traveller representative organisations and local authorities, as well as with other relevant Departments and Government agencies.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Working groups have been set up in the Department with members of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee.  Legal advice has been sought on the implications of implementing recommendations relating to the social housing needs assessment and some of the recommendations relating to planning issues.  The Department has already been able to progress some of these recommendations.  For example, a review has been concluded of the arrangements for disbursing funding for the provision of refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation and the new process is to be put in place at the start of 2020.</p><p>The Department is working with CENA, which is an approved housing body dedicated to providing Traveller-specific housing solutions.  For the first time, the capital assistance scheme, CAS, funding stream is being used by CENA for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation.  The CAS funding is available to approved housing bodies.  They can avail of local authority loans to provide housing for vulnerable groups.  I welcome this new development and my Department is committed to supporting CENA in line with the recommendations from the expert group.  The Department has also consulted the Central Statistics Office, offering assistance to ensure that Travellers will be properly represented in the next census, which was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Department has been providing regular feedback to the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee on progress to date and this will continue.  Working together with all stakeholders, we will address each successive issue.</p><p>The Department has been working with stakeholders to develop a new caravan loan scheme, which is groundbreaking and offers Travellers an opportunity to own their own home at affordable terms.  The proposed pilot scheme is well advanced and I expect to be able to move it along to the Department of Finance for approval in the coming days.</p><p>We are all facing the Covid pandemic but it affects our vulnerable communities to a greater extent.  The Department has made funding available to local authorities to implement measures in Traveller-specific accommodation to alleviate, where possible, the risk and spread of Covid-19.  Funding has been approved for the purchase of additional mobile homes, touring caravans and demountable accommodation units.  Funding has also been provided to set up additional temporary sites or to reopen vacant bays to facilitate isolation and alleviate overcrowding.  Extra sanitation, water and electricity supplies have been provided.  Additional funding has also been provided for cleaning and disinfecting sites and for the removal of rubbish.  Where it is not possible to accommodate families in their current locations, the Department is working with local authorities and families to find alternative appropriate solutions.</p><p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage continues to liaise with the HSE on accommodation-related issues and attends meetings of the national control outbreak team.  Where outbreaks are identified, the Department holds meetings with the local HSE, local authority and Traveller representatives to find a solution that is most appropriate to meet the needs of those involved.  The Department has worked with the HSE to develop a national Covid-19 preparedness checklist of Traveller-specific accommodation, including official and unofficial halting sites and group housing schemes.  The preparedness checklist will be used collaboratively between the HSE, local authorities and local Traveller representative organisations to identify gaps in facilities required to prevent the spread of Covid-19.  Following a successful pilot run in the north west, the survey will be rolled out nationally at the end of October.  To date, the Department has approved funding of &euro;3.9 million for Covid response measures, of which &euro;2.5 million has been claimed and paid to local authorities.  I acknowledge the Trojan work done by local authority staff since the start of the crisis in delivering front-line services, often putting themselves at risk, as well as the invaluable work of Traveller organisations in representing the most vulnerable members of their communities in a crisis.  Their assistance in getting the public health message across to the community has been invaluable.</p><p>Since the beginning of the Covid crisis, the Department's advice to local authorities has been to provide facilities where Travellers are currently located, including on unauthorised sites, where it is safe to do so.  We have also asked that local authorities avoid moving Travellers where they are in unauthorised situations on local authority land wherever possible.  In October, my Department issued a circular to local authorities to reiterate this position in light of the ongoing emergency.  It is important to recognise that although this is the preferred option, it is not always possible.  For example, where health, safety and overcrowding issues arise, the Department will closely monitor the situation and continue to provide guidance where needed.  I look forward to hearing the views of Members.</p></speech>

I am honoured to contribute on behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.</p><p>We have all been consumed by the issue of Covid since March.  It has taken over our lives, but it is important not to forget that the housing crisis that has gripped our country has not gone away.  In many respects, it has been further highlighted, and the housing difficulties experienced by people have been intensified, by Covid.  No one suffers more than those who are homeless and those in the Traveller community.  When we discuss the Traveller community, it is important that we give the issues of homelessness and Traveller accommodation time in the House.  I thank the Minister of State for giving his time to discuss them with us.</p><p>The Minister of State articulated well the Department's commitment to tackling the issue on behalf of the Government, but we are holding this debate in the context of just two thirds of the funding that was allocated for Traveller accommodation last year being drawn down by local authorities.  We all accept that Covid-19 has had a negative impact on construction and local authorities, but that is no excuse for such a paltry drawdown of funding that has been made available by the Government.  I welcome the Minister of State's recognition that this has been a persistent issue, and one that needs to be called out.  It is reassuring to know that the expert committee, which was established in 2019, has also recognised this issue and is dedicated to tackling it.  Importantly, the programme for Government commits to ensuring that the housing needs of the Traveller community are met by local authorities and that funding is drawn down and utilised.  The Minister of State mentioned that &euro;21 million would be allocated next year to support the community's housing needs.  As the year progresses, we must ensure that local authorities draw down those funds.</p><p>I do not want to embarrass anyone, but if we are to have an honest debate, we must call councils out.  As of October, nine local authorities had yet to draw down funding for Traveller accommodation.  They include Cork, South Dublin, Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow county councils.  A further seven local authorities have drawn down less than &euro;100,000.  In 2019, eight local authorities - Carlow, Clare, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal, Kilkenny, Limerick, Louth and Meath - spent more than their allocated amounts.  Three local authorities did not apply for funding, those being, Mayo County Council, Galway City Council and Laois County Council.  We need to break this issue down to the local level.  We are working with the Government to ensure that funds are allocated at national level, but if local authorities are not going to access and use them to meet a set of needs that are well documented but inadequately provided for at local level, we are at nothing.</p><p>It is critical that we ensure that the aspirations and ambitions of the Traveller community, in particular its younger generations, are realised so that its members can be full participants in society.  It is great to see Senator Flynn in the Chamber.  She is a full participant in the Seanad alongside all of us.  We will ensure that younger members of the Traveller community will have access to a secure home and will know that they can reach their full potential, participate in education and make a full contribution, just as Senator Flynn is doing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That will never happen unless we address Traveller accommodation needs.  The key commitments in the programme for Government include implementation of the national Traveller health action plan and a review of the Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy.  There is also a commitment to undertake an independent assessment of the pilot projects which are aimed at retaining Traveller and Roma children in education and ensuring the housing needs of the Traveller community are met by local authorities.  That is critical.  I come from a local authority background and in the Dublin Central constituency we have a strong Roma community that is growing in number.  It is important that all of these young people are given full access to education to achieve their full potential.  </p><p>On the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee mentioned by the Minister of State, the National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017&ndash;2021 represents a whole-of-government approach to bringing about meaningful change and progress for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.  I like the fact that it is a living document, which will be reviewed and amended.  That iterative process is very important.  Traveller and Roma organisations were involved in its development and are members of its steering committee to monitor its implementation.  The strategy contains some 149 actions.  That is a great deal of work.  It is important that it is an iterative process and that the strategy is reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p><p>The expert group appointed in 2019 reviewed the effectiveness, implementation and operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and produced 32 recommendations specifically relating to Traveller accommodation.  The proposals are aimed at addressing the research deficiencies, including how information is gathered and used, removing any delays in and obstacles to the delivery of accommodation in the planning system, increasing resources and delivery capacity, and strengthening governance arrangements.  </p><p>I wish the Minister of State well in his work.  He has our full support.  It is very important that at the end of its four-year term, when it looks back over the programme for Government, the Government concludes that it has delivered for the Traveller community, most critically in the area of accommodation.  I firmly believe that without having a secure place to call home, it is difficult to engage in school, education, training and work and to participate in society.  That is essential for all of us.  The Government has made a strong commitment.  It will have our support in delivering on it and I wish it well.</p></speech>

We are honoured to have the Senator here.  The reason this debate is taking place is that she raised the issue on the Order of Business some weeks ago.

I thank the Minister for State for taking the time to listen to Senators speak on accommodation issues that are impacting on the Traveller community.  Many local authorities have failed to deliver appropriate cultural accommodation for the Traveller community.  In Ireland we have our own humanitarian crisis, that is, the living conditions of the Traveller community in 21st century Ireland.  Now is the time for action.</p> <p>The lack of appropriate accommodation and supports for the Traveller community is well-documented.  Money has been allocated to local authorities for Traveller accommodation and in many cases it is not being spent.  I cannot understand how this continues to happen year after year.  Since the Traveller accommodation programme began in 2000, there has been an underspend of nearly &euro;69 million.  That is the figure that has not been drawn down.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That does not include the &euro;8 million underspend for this year alone.  I would appreciate a detailed explanation from the Government as to why this continues to happen and why people from my community continue to live in appalling accommodation and living conditions.</p><p>Over the life of the Traveller accommodation programme, living conditions for the Traveller community have not improved.  If anything, they have got worse in terms of people being evicted from halting sites at the side of the road and told to move along.  Why are local authorities continuing to fail in their delivery of the targets they set every five years when they look at their programmes for the Traveller community?  There is such a low target yet they continue to fail in delivering on them.  I wish to highlight the need to establish a dedicated Traveller accommodation authority with an appropriate budget as a priority, which was recommended in the report of the expert review group on Traveller accommodation in July 2019.</p><p>I also want the Minister to take into account the significant impact of Covid-19.  I respect that he mentioned that already but let us get real.  Before Covid-19, Traveller accommodation was appalling for members of the Traveller community.  Travellers are an extremely vulnerable group given the higher rate in the community of chronic and at-risk conditions.  I raise a specific concern for Traveller children living on the side of the road during the pandemic who do not have basic facilities.  At the peak of the pandemic, I learned of a family in the south west, including a pregnant mother who was using a paddling pool to hygienically clean the caravan.  In 2020, she was using a paddling pool for that purpose.</p><p>I have been getting calls from people across the country, from Derry to Kerry, about their living conditions.  People in my community are desperate for appropriate accommodation.  For many Travellers, a trailer or a caravan is a home.  We have been forced to settle.  Members of the Traveller community are 20 times more likely to suffer discrimination when looking for private rented accommodation.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the work of the previous Minister of State, Deputy English, who allocated supports to local authorities for basic sanitation services such as access to water and toilets for Travellers most in need during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Sadly, it is a shameful reflection on local authorities' lack of duty of care to the Traveller community that their basic needs still have not been met.</p><p>I learned in May of a mother and a medically vulnerable child who live with 12 other family members in a seriously overcrowded home.  The woman has been on the housing list for several years.  There are many such cases throughout the country yet in the year to date, only 45% of the budget for that area was drawn down nationally.  What is the reason for that when the need is so great?  As I said, to many Travellers a trailer or a caravan is a home.  We have been forced into substandard accommodation, which is not fair.  It is not Traveller culturally appropriate accommodation.</p><p>I have said that Travellers are 22 times more likely to suffer discrimination and racism when looking for private rented accommodation.  This is Ireland in 2020 and Travellers are still seen as less.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are seen as less anyway but when it comes to accommodation, we are seen as even less again.  I understand that the Government is drawing down money and that it is trying its best.  Why are local authorities not drawing down this money for the Traveller community?  I understand that it is very tough to build a halting site because the general population does not want a halting site or the land is too vulnerable for Traveller communities but we are people.  I was born and reared on a halting site in Ballyfermot.  Look at me.  I am still part of the Labre Park community, which is the oldest official halting site in Ireland.  I know that to local authorities, we are just seen as "them" - the Traveller community.  In this State, we should be treated with dignity and respect and have basic human rights when it comes to accommodation and facilities that help and support us, be it a trailer or however people choose to live.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presence and extraordinary contribution of Senator Flynn and its authenticity by virtue of her ethnicity.  It is great that she is here.  I also acknowledge the contributions of my colleagues here.</p> <p>During my many years in local government, one of the greatest and most rewarding experiences I had was sitting on the Traveller accommodation committee over a number of terms.  I found that very rewarding and enjoyable.  I reference this because I ask the Minister of State to look at every county and see that it has a very vibrant, well-resourced and well-serviced Traveller accommodation committee in terms of executive support.  We had a great one in my local authority for many years.  I hope it is the same all the time.  I have no reason to believe otherwise.  A Traveller accommodation committee achieves a number of things.  The local representatives get buy-in in their community and Travellers are part of the discussion.  One of the 31 recommendations of the expert review group was around Traveller input into their destiny, the type of housing they get and where it is.  I ask the Minister of State to look at Traveller accommodation committees, strengthen them where they are not strong enough and make sure they exist.  Based on my own experience, I believe this is very important.  </p> <p>It is great that Traveller ethnicity was recognised in 2017.  An ESRI report from that year sets out some stark background information about Traveller housing.  A total of 8% of Travellers complete the leaving certificate compared with 73% of the rest of the population.  As Senator Fitzpatrick said, there is a very real link between educational fulfilment and opportunity and accommodation because people need good accommodation to go to school.  In 2017, 1% of Travellers had a college degree.  This figure might have gone up a tiny bit since.  The report showed that unemployment in the Traveller community is 82% while 12% of Travellers lived in a caravan or mobile home.  There have been improvements over the years but those are stark background figures and it is in that context that we must look at this question.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Among the issues cited in the expert review is a lack of integration of Traveller housing with the overall housing strategy.  As the Government unfolds its national housing strategy, it should include a very clear section on Traveller accommodation.  That section should be placed unashamedly as an equal part in the midst of the strategy.  This is what the expert review group recommends.</p><p>The expert review group makes the point that in the development plans and local area plans of local authorities, there is not sufficient citing of Traveller accommodation.  I ask the Minister of State to raise this with county managers.  In development plans and area plans there should be Traveller accommodation targets, dates and facilities and, where possible, sites might be looked at.  The question of adequacy of funding arises but if the funding is not used, it is sinister.  We must ensure existing funding is used.  The Minister of State said &euro;23.1 million, or more than &euro;20 million, is available this year, and this needs to be used in a proper way.</p><p>Governance was raised by the expert review group and this goes back, in a way, to Traveller accommodation committees.  This is the idea that Travellers would be centre stage in their own planning and choices.  The expert review group made a recommendation that I commend very strongly to the Minister of State.  Pavee Point makes the point that there is an underestimation of Travellers' needs.  The CSO should work with local authorities on a better study of the Traveller community, including their housing needs and existing housing, and where it should be going.  There seems to be a variance between what Pavee Point says, and I read one of its reports, and the official statistics.  I would like the Minister of State to square this triangle, if he can.</p><p>The cultural needs of Travellers have to be borne in mind, including the fact they like the extended family concept, the fact they have a specific economy, and this arose in a presidential election recently with regard to horses, and the fact they have a younger population, with 40% under the age of 15.  Sadly they have a shorter life expectancy and, very tragically, 26% of the population have direct family experience of suicide, which is terribly sad.  These cultural realities need to be factored into housing policy.</p><p>In 2017, a total of 59% of accommodation offered by councils was standard local authority housing.  That is fair enough where it is happily accepted.  Group housing schemes took 798 families but we have to look outside this because that is where the problem lies.  Voluntary housing bodies can also provide accommodation to Travellers through the local authorities.  This is good when it happens but one of the problems, as pointed out in one of the 32 recommendations, is that there is an inconsistency in the delivery of accommodation throughout the country.  Knowing the Minister of State, he will get to grips with this because that is his form.  It is morally and administratively wrong that there is an inconsistency.  It is wrong on every level.</p><p>There has been a decrease in the number of halting sites.  We need a further decrease but we also need the provision of halting sites.  What we do not need are Travellers on the roadsides in perilous, dangerous and primitive conditions.  This needs addressing.  As the Minister of State noted, we have the adoption of a multi-annual Traveller accommodation programme each year.  This should be part of the national and local plans.  We need this planning and transparency.  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government on 8 March 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were some interesting recommendations, some of which are distinct and others of which are identical to those of the expert group.</p><p>I am delighted we are having the debate.  I congratulate Senator Flynn and the Cathaoirleach for running with this.  It is important we do this but it is also important that the Minister of State of State is present, and I thank him for his attendance.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-11-17a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1672" speakername="Rebecca Moynihan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020111700002#EEE00300"><p>I thank Senator Flynn for raising this issue on the Order of Business and putting on it on the agenda of the House today.</p><p>There is rightfully a lot of talk about the housing crisis but little attention is given to the long-term lack of supply of Traveller accommodation.  Each local authority is required to have a Traveller accommodation action plan.  The new plans came in two years ago but by the end of October 2019, less than one third of the funds allocated for Traveller accommodation last year has been spent with 14 local authorities have failed to spend any of their Traveller housing budget.  This is consistent year after year and there is a lack of action at local level on spending the budget.  There has been some intervention.  In May 2013, the then Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Ms Jan O'Sullivan, requested local authorities to provide detailed explanations as to why they had not drawn down their allocations for Traveller housing but no explanations were forthcoming, however.  In 2017, the then Minister of State, Deputy English, took on this issue and commissioned a report from the Housing Agency, which found consistent failings in the local authority delivery model.  There was substantial under-delivery over 16 years with only 68% of units delivered, and there was an underspend of the allocated budget.  The review also found local authority and political opposition to Traveller accommodation was a factor in non-delivery.  In one of the local authorities mentioned by Senator Fitzpatrick, which had no Traveller accommodation spend, there was major opposition to housing people following the Carrickmines fire.  The opposition came from local people as there was a lack of consultation.  Another audit in 2019 found that despite the provisions, local authorities: </p> <blockquote> 	... have failed to meet the full scale of accommodation need among this community. This is evidenced by the extremely high rate of Traveller homelessness, the increase in numbers of Traveller households sharing accommodation and living in overcrowded conditions, and the uneven record of delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation among local authorities and also approved housing bodies.  </blockquote> <p>What are the consequences for this and how can we tackle it?  Senator Flynn has referred to the consequences and they are obvious.  Traveller families are over-represented among homeless people, accounting for 10% of people in emergency accommodation.  Traveller families accounted for 23% of homeless families in 2019 in Kerry County Council.  In Dublin, during the first lockdown, homeless Traveller families were advised by some homeless services that they could no longer use the self-locate accommodation option via hotels and had to return to their parents' homes, leading to some of these families sleeping in cars.  According to a published study entitled Discrimination and Inequality in Housing in Ireland, Travellers are 22 times more likely than other white Irish respondents to report they have experienced discrimination in access to housing.  Thus, while Irish Travellers represent less than 1% of the Irish population, they comprise more than 10% of the homeless population.  Our reliance on HAP and rent supplement has meant that Travellers often face significant problems accessing private rental accommodation as landlords discriminate.  As we have seen before the Equality Tribunal, Travellers are discriminated against in so many areas of life, including jobs and accessing services.  That applies also to the private rented sector, which we are over-relying on.</p><p>A secure home is a fundamental right.  For children, a secure home is essential to educational attainment.  For adults, educational attainment is essential to finding a job.  Without a job, the cycle of poverty and deprivation continues.  Culturally-appropriate, hygienic accommodation with facilities and Traveller-specific accommodation is essential.  Traveller accommodation plans and the lack of delivery somewhat mirror the broader trends in the non-delivery of social housing but an additional layer of prejudicial attitudes still permeates the State and underpin how it and individuals deal with members of the Traveller community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In its assessment of the local authority Traveller accommodation programme, the Irish Traveller Movement stated that 30% of Traveller families are currently in need of accommodation.  Yet, eight local authorities have set targets below the need identified by them over the course of their five-year programmes.  We have, therefore, an inadequate and understated needs planning and a failure to address families in temporary roadside and overcrowded accommodation for homelessness.</p><p>Some 1,045 families live in official local authority housing sites.  Of this number, however, 257 share overcrowded basic site facilities with extended families.  According to the aforementioned ESRI report, 56% of Travellers lived in crowded accommodation compared with only 8% of non-Travellers.  Local authorities, local representatives and residents have a responsibility not to oppose this housing but to provide housing for all segments of our society.  If local authorities cannot deliver them, we need to introduce measures to ensure local authorities draw down on their allocation for Traveller accommodation, or if they are unwilling, reallocate those funds towards specific approved housing bodies to deliver specific Traveller accommodation housing.</p><p>The effect on health outcomes for Travellers who live in substandard accommodation is huge and that has a massive knock-on effect.  I am proposing the establishment of an independent statutory body for Traveller accommodation.  At the moment, the existing body is only advisory and it needs to have more executive ability to make local authorities provide Traveller-specific accommodation or punish local authorities that are unwilling to do so.  This agency should draw up a national programme for Traveller-specific accommodation in consultation with Travellers.  If local authorities will not spend the money, then approved housing bodies should be allowed to build Traveller-specific accommodation.  We can remove it from local authorities and invest in approved housing bodies.</p><p>Most Travellers and Traveller organisations want to see their local authority deliver the housing they need.  Year after year, however, we see an under-delivery of Traveller specific accommodation.  It is no longer good enough, particularly when the money and need is there and we have such a health crisis at the moment.</p></speech>

Well done to Senator Flynn, in particular, for getting to the Seanad.  I had a much cushier upbringing than she did and it is always easier to succeed when one has all the rights open to one from day one.  It is also important to acknowledge that it is not just Senator Flynn's job to sort out this situation; the responsibility lies with every Member of this House and the Lower House.  Let us not leave all this to Senator Flynn to sort out.  It is up to every human working in the Government to sort this issue out and we do not want to dump it all on one individual.</p> <p>There was not much in the programme for Government on this but it states clearly that we must "Ensure that the housing needs of the Traveller Community are met by local authorities and ensure that existing funding is fully drawn down and utilised."  It does not say "utilised appropriately" but the Government has made a crystal clear commitment.  I will stick to my notes as I have been known to say the wrong thing or be misinterpreted.  We have a shared responsibility in this House and the Lower House to ensure this happens.</p> <p>In fairness to the national Government, it has provided the money required for Traveller accommodation.  For decades, however, we have failed to ensure the money is spent appropriately by the local authorities.  This Government recognised the Traveller community as an ethnic minority in March 2017.  However, it now needs to recognise that local authorities have failed year on year to spend the allocation for housing this ethnic minority needs and deserves.  We need to find out why is this happening.  Do we have to call it out?  Is it racism?  What is the real underlying issue at play here?  We also need to insist that whoever is appointed by the local authority to implement the Traveller accommodation programme is not racist, has complete and full engagement with the Traveller community and will not be dictated to.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I was also engaging with the Irish Traveller Movement on this matter.  The lack of adequate supply and quality of accommodation for Travellers is well documented.  We all know about it and can talk about it forever.  It is a well-known fact.  I remember it was an issue when I was working with a Traveller training centre more than 17 years ago.  Nothing has changed; in fact, it has got worse, if anything.  Over decades, there has been a lack of motivation to deliver accommodation due to structural and institutional opposition and apathy across Traveller-specific accommodation, standard housing, private rented housing and homeless provision.  That has resulted in massive underutilisation of these allocations.  Local authorities are always crying out for more funding for everything and yet, in this instance, they are not spending the funding.</p><p>This is the year 2020 and it is no longer acceptable because all humans are equal, we know that now, and we have to show that to the young people.  It is sad that I have been to more funerals of Travellers who have committed suicide than I have to funerals of settled people who have done so, even though there are many more settled people than Traveller people.  There is something wrong with that.  We all know of Abraham Maslow's theory that if people's human rights and basic needs of food, accommodation and shelter are not met, it leads to other issues.  In this day and age, we have to look at that.  The rate of suicide in the Traveller community is shocking.  It is bad enough in the settled community but why is it worse in the Traveller community?  We all know this has been an issue for a long time.</p><p>It is also important to accept that Travellers have different needs.  Senator Flynn alluded to that point.  Some Travellers still want to be nomadic and to have a caravan forever while others want to be in a house.  We listen to the needs of individual settled people when it comes to housing, so why do we not do so for Traveller people?  I remember instances in the past where Travellers were given a house when they had never asked for one.  They were given a house they did not want and never asked for.  People have to be given what they need and not what someone else thinks they need.  The only way that will happen is to recognise that the Travellers themselves have to have a voice and be involved and engaged with on every step relating to accommodation and their needs.</p><p>This is an embarrassing situation for the Government in 2020 and we must rectify it.  I know that we can set up another committee, legislative or otherwise, but the bottom line is that we need action now.  We need to find out exactly what is going on and why local authorities are not spending the money.  I hope I will not be here this time next year making the same speech again.</p></speech>

We should not have to return again and again to discuss the non-spending of funds allocated to local authorities to provide houses for members of the Traveller community.  This is ring-fenced money we are talking about and we need to ensure that it is spent.</p> <p>It is even more frustrating when the guidelines and direction for where the money should be spent and what type of accommodation should be prioritised is contained in the report of the expert group on Traveller accommodation, which was published in the summer of 2019.  The money and the instructions are there.  The missing link is political direction and the political will to make it happen.</p> <p>There is a need for quarterly reporting.  The latest spending figures that I have seen are in a reply to a parliamentary question asked last month by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  The job of monitoring on a more regular basis should not fall to Members of the D&aacute;il and "monitoring" is the watchword here.  There is no point in allocating vast sums of money to local authorities in the knowledge that without effective monitoring, the money will be coming back to the Department unspent.  I suggest a quarterly report on spending and builds for Traveller accommodation be introduced just as they have been for social housing.  </p> <p>The latest figures show that only 45.5% of the Traveller accommodation funding of &euro;14.5 million that is available for 2020 has been drawn down to date.  Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned local authorities such as Cork County Council, South Dublin County Council and councils in Longford, Louth, Mayo, Meath, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow that have not drawn down any funding at all.  It is understandable that construction work may be behind schedule due to Covid-19 restrictions but during the harsh lockdown, there was never any restriction on planning, tendering and awarding of contracts to build badly-needed accommodation.  That is where today's debate needs to be focused.  We are here to get an explanation as to why nine local authorities did not draw down a single euro from moneys allocated to them to relieve the housing problem in their local areas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Warfield:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Last week, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, announced a package to ensure Traveller participation in third level education during Covid-19.  The press release referred to ensuring that members of the Travelling community had access to proper and well-ventilated study space.  Why not begin by ensuring that money already ring-fenced for Traveller accommodation is drawn down and spent?  Does the Minister of State want more powers?  Does he think he has sufficient powers to be able to instruct local authorities that are clearly not engaging with central government to deliver Traveller accommodation?  </p><p>Will we have to have a further debate in several months on the same issue?  I hope not.  Is the Minister of State prepared to directly intervene and to instruct local authorities to speed up their planned builds?  We also need accountability.  Money unspent is money that is not being spent by somebody.  It is not an accident.  There is a lack of urgency in local authorities and, in many cases, it is very deliberate.  Clear direction needs be given that moneys must be spent.  Where there is a delay, we need to intervene.  Where rhetoric and bigotry are holding up the process, we need to stand against it, even if that means fighting political opposition.  As I said before, we need to monitor the spend.  We should provide quarterly reports.  One of the best reports the Department produces is on social housing, namely, the housing construction pipeline report.  It is a very detailed piece of work that lets us all know, per project and per local authority area, where construction is in the pipeline.  It would be great to get the same report for the Traveller accommodation programmes.</p></speech>

It is a very important topic.</p> <p>People in the Travelling community face so many challenges, especially in this time of Covid.  These include, as have been mentioned, the high levels of unemployment, challenging health outcomes and, particularly, trying to access accommodation in the private sector.  There is discrimination in our society, particularly for minority groups.  Many families are living in precarious conditions, especially from a Traveller background.  There is short-term housing and a lack of public housing. These are issues we are very familiar with.  I am happy to see that the Government has allocated &euro;21.3 million, as the Minister of State noted, for 2021 and this is an increase.  However, the Minister of State also noted that it falls short. </p> <p>I looked at the figures from the recent census.  I went back to 2016 and I saw that, overall, there are nearly 500,000 households that rent in Ireland and over 143,000 renting in local authorities.  I looked particularly at rental in rural and urban areas.  In rural areas, only 13% rent or have properties available for rental.  This is really challenging when one looks at people who literally are living off renting.  There are communities and families who are trying to rent and there are no properties for them to rent.  In rural regional areas, houses are owned so there is little housing available to rent.  It just hit me.  From the Travelling community, I believe there are 4,000 or so that are renting.  I think there are about 8,000 households, though that might not be fully representative, as has been mentioned, in terms of the census.  There are about 4,000 families from Traveller backgrounds renting from local authorities.  Local authorities are having to provide and that was an increase of about 11% on the previous census.</p> <p>I will speak to my own area.  There is a good Travelling community in Roscommon and east Galway and I spoke to those involved in youth services in Ballinasloe about their concerns.  I am hoping that in better times we might be able to invite Senator Flynn to Ballinasloe to speak to some really amazing young people there that are very active in the community.  It is really important that Senator Flynn is a role model.  An importance will be allocated to her in terms of her role.  We are all role models, I hope.  The Vice President-elect in the US, Kamala Harris, had a good video recently in which she spoke well about young girls dreaming with ambition and that is what it is about.  It is about speaking to the young people in our communities, particularly from Travelling or other minority groups, to encourage them to dream with ambition.  Those youth services were delivering activity packs during the lockdown to families, particularly in disadvantaged areas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Most of it involved crafts and things for children to do because they were not able to go to school during the first lockdown.  They very quickly realised that there was a huge need for food.  People were asking for food to be included in the packs that were being distributed.  We know that people are in really challenging circumstances.</p><p>People are dropping out of education.  Even at second level, they are not going as far as the leaving certificate.  It is a challenge in terms of getting jobs.  That is all being added into the mix with being able to access housing, which is a significant challenge.</p><p>In terms of accommodation, I was a county councillor in Galway County Council and I am aware of the significant pressures that exist in terms of trying to access the HAP scheme and the large waiting lists.  A number of families from Traveller backgrounds were in contact with me about housing.  It is very difficult.</p><p>I am very to happy to hear about the consultation board the Minister of State mentioned.  It is important that all voices are heard.  Many reports have noted that there are challenges with Travellers accessing accommodation.  We have to take account of their unique needs.  They are different.  We need to make sure their voices are heard, otherwise we will not be successful.  That is the aim.  The budget is there.  We want to make sure that families are being accommodated in the ways in which they need to be.  They may not live in our traditional housing estate.  It may be the case that they need to be accommodated in more open green areas.</p><p>It is very important that we invest more in social workers.  We are dealing with very disadvantaged areas.  What sort of funds are available for social workers?  In terms of ongoing work, from what I understand local authorities can only draw down funding when work has been completed - a great deal of work is ongoing.  Given the impact of Covid, will access to those budgets be extended beyond December for local authorities?</p><p>Sanitation facilities have been provided to groups living in precarious housing as a result of the impact of Covid.  What other measures can be implemented?  Does the Minister of Stare foresee any other measures being important for us to put in place over the coming months?</p><p>I thank Senator Flynn for bringing this issue to our attention.  I hope to work with her on the consultation group.  I was very happy to hear that it will include all stakeholders, that we will hear their voices and that we will try to make a concerted effort to try to tackle other areas of disadvantage as well as housing.</p></speech>

Like everybody else, I welcome the fact that Senator Flynn has ensured that we are discussing this issue.  The Minister of State will be very serious about it and I have great faith in him to tackle it.</p> <p>It is concerning that nine local authorities have not yet drawn down funding.  Last year, only two-thirds of the funding allocated for Traveller accommodation was spent.  It is an ongoing problem.  It is fine to talk about &euro;21 million in funding, which Senator Dolan mentioned, but we must remember that if we cannot find out what the real problem is it is of no use.  We have to find out why so many local authorities are not spending their allocation.</p> <p>There may be issues at times and I accept that not all of the money can be spent. That has to be looked into.  Galway, for example, was allocated &euro;1.41 million and spent 40%, or &euro;670,000.  I have been involved in several cases in Ballinasloe where people in the Traveller community are living in very poor conditions and want to live in houses.  I would consider their housing as being unfit for humans.</p> <p>I speak mainly to the mothers of teenagers and young children.  One mother recently said to me that she wished she had a proper house for Christmas.  Galway County Council got a considerable amount of money from the State to address this issue.  Where is the problem there and with other local authorities?  Why is this happening?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not represent Longford but there has been very poor uptake in Longford as well.  </p><p>Down through the years quite a lot of progress has been made but not enough.  Why?  Considering all of the things that have happened with legislation and all of the changes that have been made, there is still a real problem in Ireland with giving Travellers proper housing and accommodation.  Let me give the following examples: the groundbreaking Equal Status Act was initiated by Fianna F&aacute;il and came into effect in October 2000; the Traveller health unit was created in 2004; the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act was enacted in 1998; the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a Part V that obtained a social dividend for the private development of social housing, including Travellers; the national Traveller consultative committee was reconstituted in March 2007 along with the local Traveller accommodation consultative committee; Delivering Homes Sustaining Communities was delivered in August 2007; and a high-level group on Traveller issues was established at the request of the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, to examine ways of producing a more co-ordinated response by State bodies to address Traveller issues with a view to securing improved outcomes.  The group's report was published on 21 March 2006, following its approval by the Government.  The report included a wide range of conclusions and recommendations that covered the full spectrum of public service activity related specifically to Traveller accommodation.  There are many more areas that I could reference.    </p><p>A key development in advancing education for the Traveller community was the report and recommendations for a Traveller education strategy, which was launched by the then Minister for Education, Mary Hanafin, in November 2006.  In 2010, the Department of Education and Skills spent in excess of &euro;17 million per annum directly on Traveller education that incorporated pre-school, primary, post-primary, and further and higher education.  Those direct supports included: 29 segregated Traveller pre-schools; 503 resource teachers for Traveller pupils at primary level; additional teaching hours at post-primary level; enhanced capitation for Traveller pupils at primary and post-primary levels; the visiting teacher service for Travellers; schools transport arranged for Traveller pupils; and 33 senior Traveller training centres.  I have only mentioned some of the initiatives.  Despite a lot of things happening and being done we are still in a very poor predicament in terms of really tackling this problem.</p><p>The Minister of State may be unable to answer this but I would like to know why nine local authorities have not spent anything on Traveller accommodation.  In most local authorities, where there might not be huge issues, there are people who need to be housed.  I shall conclude by again referring to the mother of five children who told me that all she wants for Christmas is a proper home.  So let us all remember that that mother and her children play a very important role in society.</p></speech>

It is appropriate that Seanad &Eacute;ireann is discussing Traveller accommodation.  I commend Senator Flynn for putting this issue forward or ensuring it was put on the agenda.  </p> <p>There is no point in putting a tooth in it.   The Traveller community is the most discriminated against group in Irish society and whether people like to hear that or not, that is the truth.  It is a wrong that has been perpetrated over many generations but, more recently, over recent generations.  We must ensure that discrimination does not continue into future generations.  We, as a society, all have an absolute responsibility and duty to right that wrong.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> One of the most basic and fundamental principles that define us as a nation is the ability to provide people with a proper decent home.  That has not happened in this instance.  It is not that there is an unwillingness in government to do it.  There has been a willingness in many governments spanning the past two decades to do it, going back to the mid-1990s when Mervyn Taylor, as Minister with responsibility for equality, introduced Traveller legislation and empowered county managers to deal with the issue.  Sadly, the problem is to be found at local authority level.  As many colleagues pointed out, local authorities were provided with funding in multi-annual budgets but have failed to spend the money.  The carrot has been offered to them to resolve the problem but they have not bitten or done what they should have done.  It is now time to wield the stick.  A suggestion worthy of consideration is that local authorities that continue to fail to spend the money allocated to them for Traveller accommodation should have their resources depleted in other areas.  That might focus minds on doing what they should do.</p><p>There is a problem with planning and people objecting to proposals but where there is a will, there is a way.  We have a reasonably transparent planning process which gives people the right to make submissions on planning applications.  These then go through the process but the problem is that councils are not submitting Part 8 applications to the degree needed.  </p><p>While we are primarily discussing housing, education is another area that needs significant intervention.  One of the fundamental principles of equality is access to education.  Not enough Traveller children sit the leaving certificate and go on to third level.  Why is that the case?  We need to address the reasons for that and make particular interventions to make sure we deal with it.  </p><p>Four years remain in the lifetime of this Government.  Housing provision is a commitment in the programme for Government and I sincerely hope it is delivered upon.  It is one of the societal challenges which our generation has a duty and responsibility to live up to.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, for being here.  He is very committed to equality and has demonstrated that in his short time in ministerial office.  I have no doubt he will drive this project forward along with the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, and his other colleagues in the Department.</p></speech>

The Green Party is thrilled to have Senator Eileen Flynn as a Member of the Seanad.  Today, she asked for dignity and respect for the travelling community.  That is a cry for dignity and respect and it is not too much to ask.</p> <p>As a child, I was privileged in that my late parents invited members of the travelling community attending our local school to our first communion celebrations and birthday parties.  Nothing struck me as unusual at the time.  My only observation was that the child - my best friend for the afternoon - would be a different face the following year.  There are photos at home with these young birthday party-goers but the harsh reality of statistics would prove, if I tried to chase down the people in those photographs, that many of them are no longer with us due to the dreadful mortality and life expectancy rates among the travelling community.  If I were to do a "Where are they now?" search, provided I could find the photographs in the attic, I would discover that many of them are no longer with us.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They did not have the opportunity I got for education.  They did not have the opportunity that most people in this House had, including education, social, personal and family matters.<br/><br/>I was privileged to have as a lecturer in third level education the Rev. Dr. Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il, the famous Jesuit sociologist, who is still with us and alive and well, in his 90th year, in Westport.  I know today's debate is about accommodation but this point should permeate through all discussions on the Traveller community, in my humble opinion.  The policy of mere assimilation will not work, as in, saying that someone must be like us.  It is like the overenthusiastic member of the Red Cross who helps an elderly, infirm person across the road, and when he or she speaks to the elderly person across the road, the elderly person says that he or she did not want to cross the road.  As Senator Garvey said earlier, listening is important.  Dr. Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il's book, <i>Pluralism and Diversity in Ireland</i>is about early 21st century Ireland.  Chapter 13 is entitled, &quot;The Travelling People - Ireland&rsquo;s Apartheid&quot;.  It is hard not to agree with Dr. Mac Gr&eacute;il and the statistics prove the story.  In the 2006 census, though it is a while ago, there were 22,300 Travellers, which amounted to 0.5% of our population, yet our fellow Senator is appealing for dignity and respect.<br/><br/>We have failed with the policy of assimilation.  We need integrated pluralism.  We need integration to have equality of opportunity, equal rights, equal treatment and pluralism.  We need to celebrate and embrace people's differences for those who want to stay different.  They enrich our community.  It is almost like being ecumenical.  If there is a religious group that wants to have its sabbath on a Thursday, then facilitate the sabbath on a Thursday.  We have to facilitate and allow for difference.  True difference is strength, vibrancy and a celebration of diversity.  It also showcases talents and, on a more practical level, stability and equal rights.  I would welcome further discussion on this issue which, as others have said, is getting worse.  It is not getting better.  We need a fundamental rethink and overhaul.</p></speech>

I grew up close to a halting site in west Dublin, living for over ten years with a halting site 200 m away from my house.  We were all good neighbours.  I would like if all communities could be the same way.  From an early age, where I grew up in County Tyrone, I was taught to respect difference and to know that deep down, we all want the same thing, which is to belong, to feel accepted and that one person's identity is just as important as that of another person.  It is not always as straightforward as that, unfortunately, and I do not want to oversimplify the challenges.  I served on Fingal County Council's Traveller consultative committee before I was appointed a Senator.  I want to mention the good work of the Blanchardstown Traveller development groups in Dublin 15.  Fingal is one of the councils that outspent its allocation for Traveller accommodation of &euro;13 million provided by the then Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The council has been allocated &euro;13.5 million for Traveller accommodation for the next three years under the capital plan.  I hope that will be delivered.</p><p>The relationships between Travellers, local authorities and communities can be complex, but this is an issue of welfare, human rights and building inclusive communities.  Whatever the accommodation is, it should be provided in a culturally appropriate way so that Travellers have quality housing, better facilities and good environmental conditions.</p><p>The Traveller accommodation expert review concluded that "the arrangements established by the 1998 Act have significant strengths and have enabled the delivery of significant amounts of accommodation for Travellers, but they have failed to meet the full scale of accommodation need among this community."  The review covered the effects of homelessness, overcrowding, inconsistency of standards, varying rates of delivery, the degree of satisfaction with Traveller-specific accommodation and the over-reliance on the private rental system to address shortages.  There is a great deal of information in the expert review, including 32 recommendations.  I will not go through them all, but I will summarise.  The expert group focused primarily on what was working and not working, but not on why.  That is what the Seanad is focusing on in this debate.  I cannot understate the importance of building relationships proactively and positively and of on-the-ground leadership at every level of the system.</p><p>In March, the Minister of State, Deputy English, provided supports in respect of toilets, running water and so on because of Covid.  Will they be retained?  There is some concern that they will not be.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I thank Senator Currie for sharing time with me and I welcome the Minister of State.  I also thank Senator Flynn for tabling the motion.  This is an issue that we should keep on the agenda because it warrants further discussion.</p> <p>I served on Mayo County Council's Traveller accommodation committee many moons ago.  At the time, I proposed that two out of every eight local authority houses built should be for Travellers.  That proposal was subsequently adopted by the council.</p> <p>Much has been said about halting sites and Traveller accommodation.  While I welcome the &euro;21 million that will be provided, trading in scrap, batteries and so on by Travellers should be accommodated.  Such trading should not be done on a halting site alongside Traveller accommodation.  The two should be kept separate.  I ask that the Minister of State liaise with the local authorities to provide space somewhere for Travellers who need to trade in those wares.</p></speech>

It has been raised with the Minister previously.  My colleague, Senator Warfield, was keen to have this matter discussed, but he has missed out on it.</p> <p>I was following the debate in my office.  I wish to take this opportunity to discuss something that has not been mentioned so far.  In June 2019, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission initiated an equality review of local authorities' provision of Traveller accommodation.  That report is now a year overdue.  Will the Minister of State take this opportunity to update the House on his understanding of the reasons for the delay and when he expects the report to be published?</p></speech>

I assure the House that I am fully committed to resolving it, including the underspend by various local authorities.  It is a significant underspend, which I was keen to point out in my opening statement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have to acknowledge when things are not working.  When I was advised that I would be taking over this role one of my key tasks was to try to rectify this.</p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick was keen to point out the recommendations from the expert group report.  When I was first appointed to this role I immediately met the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee because it was very important that I hear the views of the Travelling community.  The expert group report is wide-ranging and recommends legislative and planning changes for local authorities and changes in the way they do their business in liaising with the Department on spending this money.  It is important that we resolve to implement the report which is why I am very keen to appoint a programme board to quickly implement and drive its recommendations.</p><p>I acknowledge Senator Flynn's excellent contribution.  Genuine contributions like hers are what we want to hear in this House.  I am very grateful for the suggestions the Senator made.  I am keen to meet her at the earliest opportunity and my office will contact her.  It is important that we sit down together to try to address some of the concrete proposals that the expert group brought to the table and we will do this quickly.  </p><p>On some of the other issues raised, I hope the caravan loan scheme will be approved by the Department of Finance in the coming days.  That scheme is key to showing respect for the ethnicity of Travellers and their way of life by not forcing them into other accommodation or roles.  It is important that we get this funding approved as this was part of the process in the consultative committee.</p><p>The expert group touched on a significant number of areas such as planning, CSO data and how they are compiled, and aligning development plans with Traveller accommodation plans.  All of that detail, which was raised by Senators, is noted in the report.  It is very important that we drive these issues through the programme board that I have spoken about.  This Government takes a serious approach to this area, which is borne out in its actions of putting the report together, having it published and establishing a programme board to drive forward its delivery.  That will make a difference.  There are a number of issues with legislation, which does not go far enough, the powers of the local authority system and the oversight that central government has in this regard.  There have been shortcomings and I hope this will resolve the issue.</p><p>On Covid-19, it is important that our spending is kept high.  We have approved &euro;4.9 million of which &euro;2.5 million has been spent.  This funding is to be used to respond to any issues in respect of Covid-19 in the Traveller community.  The HSE is the lead agency driving forward that response and the Government is keen to respond to any problems that arise in that regard.  We will not be found wanting.  </p><p>We must remember that the fifth anniversary of the Carrickmines fire was last week.  Five adults, five children and an unborn baby perished in that event on 10 October 2015.  Days like that make one think of the job we have to do and the resolve we must show in trying to rectify this problem and respond with all of the resources at our disposal to ensure the situation does not stand still.  We need to move forward with this.  I have no doubt I will get support from the House to do that.  </p><p>I responded to Senator Currie on the funding amounts and some of the issues arising from the expert group.  I will check to ensure I have not left anything out.  </p><p>The private sector is accommodating some Travellers through departmental spending, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and other mechanisms.  We are also trying to acknowledge through the caravan loan scheme that this approach is not always the answer.</p><p>My door is always open.  We are driving forward with the recommendations of the expert group and I will welcome any feedback and proposals that may improve how we do our business.  I thank Senators for arranging this debate and Senator Flynn, in particular, for initiating it.  I look forward to working with the Seanad in the future.</p></speech>

It represents an important step forward in the pursuit of equality and justice for all our citizens.  As a constitutional republican party, Fianna F&aacute;il has always been committed to fighting discrimination in all its forms.  The Bill seeks to tackle hate crimes in an effective and robust manner.</p><p>Only yesterday, <i>The Irish Times</i>reported the fact that the UN rapporteur on the elimination of discrimination in Ireland stated that &quot;Hate crime legislation ... [needs to] be introduced as soon as possible to address the escalation in racially motivated crimes and [to] help build a safer society...&quot;.  This week is Stand Up Awareness week, which calls for all of us to take a stand against homophobic and transphobic bullying.  </p><p>It is a sad reality that hate crime is a real and lasting problem in Ireland today and that our legislation is sadly lacking.  Ireland stands alone among European nations in not having introduced statutory protections from hate crime.  If the harm of hate is to be acknowledged and countered, it falls on us as legislators to act to provide a legislative framework for the explicit naming of bias crime.  Ireland must join other nations in ensuring the violence of hate experienced by vulnerable individuals and communities is challenged head-on.  Individual victims are all too aware of the reasons that they have been targeted.  It is for the worst of reasons - the colour of a people's skin or their ethnicity, religion, immigration status, gender, age, disability, gender identity or sexuality.  These reasons are diverse in nature but they all share one commonality.  The victim of a hate crime has been targeted for their identity.  Victims of hate crime cannot simply assert that their experience was an unlucky occurrence - the wrong place, the wrong time.  Instead, they are forced to accept that their social identity was targeted and they remain at risk of repeated victimisation.</p><p>Ireland has become a more diverse and inclusive society in recent decades.  Irish people of differing race and religion, Irish Travellers, LGBTQ persons and persons with disabilities have all become more visible and engaged with our political processes.  This diversity is a strength.  Sadly, not everyone has welcomed these changes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some see this strength as a threat to them and are willing to engage in violence to continue that exclusion.  We are all too aware of what that looks like.  We think of Shelly Xiong, who was pushed into the Royal Canal due to her race.  Se&aacute;n Munnelly, a 15-year-old boy, was attacked in Eamonn Ceannt Park because of the colour of his skin.  A young gay couple, Anthony and Gear&oacute;id, were attacked and stabbed in Newbridge because of their sexuality, only 100 yd from my home.  We have also seen the arson attacks on direct provision centres and the vandalisation of a mosque in Galway.  This list is only a few examples of some of the events that have taken place in the recent past.  Each of us will also be aware of other cases in which victims felt they could not speak out or which did not receive the same level of prominence for various reasons.</p><p>In a society which expounds principles of inclusivity and diversity, which was founded on the idea that all people should be cherished equally, these experiences are simply unacceptable.  It is the responsibility of the Legislature to send a clear message to society that this behaviour will not be tolerated.  It is then the responsibility of the criminal justice system to ensure that this message is operative and functional.  By adopting this Bill's legislative proposals, we can provide tools that society needs to combat criminal expressions of hatred, hostility, prejudice, bias and contempt.</p><p>The human rights of those living in Ireland are violated daily in a manner which is deeply damaging to both individuals and society.  In the absence of an adequate criminal justice response to hate crime offenders, victims continue to pay for these crimes.  Studies have provided convincing evidence that victims of hate crimes suffer more severely than victims of equivalent crimes, which are not associated with targeted hostility.  Those who have experienced hate offences report a wider range of negative psychological impacts, which also last for longer than those exhibited by victims of non-hate-related parallel offences.</p><p>The 2016 census established the fact that diversity is now a concrete fact of life for Ireland.  Shifting patterns of immigration have changed the racial, ethnic and religious composition of Irish society.  This change to society has not been welcomed by all.  For some, diversity represents a threat to Irishness, a threat that frequently meets with violent opposition.  Those involved with representing minority communities have highlighted concerns in recent years over the rise in the number of hate crimes occurring in Ireland.  These are underrecorded and underreported.  I also refer to the Burning Issues 2 report, which was based on a national survey of more than 2,600 LGBT people and ten focus groups.  The key issue and priority for them is the need to introduce hate crime legislation.</p><p>The Bill I introduced in the D&aacute;il with former Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony in 2016 received cross-party support in the D&aacute;il.  It went to pre-legislative scrutiny at a committee and it stayed there because of inactivity.  The fact that we have not had a two hour debate about hate crime in four years in Leinster House speaks volumes.  There is an onus on the Government to get its act together and to stop dragging its feet on this issue.  We cannot in good conscience wait another four years for solutions and another debate.  The delay in legislating for hate crimes is inexcusable and only serves to discourage people from reporting such crimes.</p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to make provision in law for hate crimes against persons based on an individual's asylum or refugee status, race, colour, religion, nationality, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, transgender identity, sex characteristics, age, or perceived age.  It provides that a crime may be aggravated by hate if, at the time of committing the offence or immediately before or after doing so, a person displays prejudice and is motivated wholly or partly by racist, homophobic, xenophobic, anti-religious or anti-disability prejudice towards a relevant individual.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Where it can be demonstrated that an offence has been motivated by hate, this Bill would ensure that it is labelled clearly as such.  Those guilty of that offence would be liable to a penalty that can be imposed for committing said offence.  It will also provide for those who commit hate crimes to receive counselling to address their prejudice.  The Bill refers to the offences to which it will apply, which are criminal damage, public order, theft and fraud, rape and sexual offences, and assault.  I acknowledge that there is widespread support across the House, from Senators I have spoken to, for the principle of criminalising hate crime.  I acknowledge also that Members of this House may well have proposals to strengthen and improve the legislation.  I am willing to work with Senators on the Bill to ensure it is as strong as it can be.  Those who may be the victim of such a crime deserve the support of all those who are willing to work with me to improve the legislation.<br/><br/>I believe I have shown, through my efforts in the previous D&aacute;il, that I am committed to addressing this issue and I am certainly willing to engage with others who have proposals.  I mention specifically Senator Eileen Flynn, who has assured me of her support, and I look forward to working with her.  I acknowledge that the Government has made commitments to address this problem.  The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce legislation to tackle hate crime and hate speech.  I regret that it was not listed as priority legislation for the Government, which is why I tabled this Bill.<br/><br/>Victims are looking for change.  We must show them that change through our actions, not our words.  Every person has an equal right to be protected by the criminal justice system.  Stopping hate crime and bringing perpetrators to justice must, therefore, be a priority.  As elected representatives and legislators, we have a duty and responsibility to put in place mechanisms that will counter the prejudice, hostility and violence that people can experience as a consequence of their identity.  In introducing this Bill, I am also conscious that a number of NGOs have indicated that it needs to be amended.  I am fine with that and happy to discuss and agree amendments to it.  I advise the House of the following three amendments that I propose to make to my Bill on Committee Stage to address drafting issues.  The first is under the interpretation of hate crime, where I propose to include any relevant offence that is actually or perceived to be motivated by prejudice.  The interpretation would read:</p><blockquote>	&ldquo;hate crime&rdquo; includes any relevant offence that is perceived by a victim or any other person, to be wholly or partially motivated by prejudice against a relevant individual based on said individual&rsquo;s asylum or refugee status, nationality, religion, colour, race, disability, ethnicity (including members of the Traveller and Roma communities), gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, transgender identity, sex characteristics or actual or perceived age; </blockquote><p>The second amendment I will propose is to include the word &quot;relevant&quot; in section 2(1).  The third amendment will be to the Schedule and will propose to delete the following references: &quot;2. An offence under section 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011&quot;; &quot;3. An offence under sections 6, 7, 17, 18 and 19 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994&quot;; and &quot;6. Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993&quot;.  In Part 8 of the Schedule, it will propose to delete references to sections 2 and 11 of the  Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.<br/><br/>My primary concern and that of my party is that we get hate crime legislation on the Statute Book.  It is vital that this sends a clear message that crimes motivated and exacerbated by prejudice and hatred will not be tolerated.  Furthermore, we must not limit our responses to hate crime to the justice system alone.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must work at all levels of society to challenge widespread discrimination and prejudice and ensure that all people are treated as full and equal citizens.

In doing so, I pay tribute to Senator O'Loughlin for her work on this.  She has been a passionate campaigner for the rights.  I particularly commend her on moving forward with the Bill.  Even though there is a commitment to address this matter in the programme for Government, I share her frustration that it has not been given the priority it deserves, particularly in light of the fact that 3,800 written submissions were received in the consultation process relating to the legislation in this area.  This is an important issue.  Senator O'Loughlin indicated that there is a willingness to work with people on all sides in the House to get the best possible legislation.  This is Second Stage, so it is about debating the principles.  This is really about us, as a republic, speaking about the things that are important to us and ensuring that people are not discriminated against because of their identity.</p> <p>When I was growing up as a young gay man, Senator David Norris was somebody who has been inspirational over the years.  People will remember the story of Declan Flynn, a young man who was attacked in Fairview Park in Dublin in 1982.  Any murder is appalling but the only reason he was killed was because he was gay or perceived to be gay.  Senator O'Loughlin has outlined other instances of people who have been attacked in this country simply because of their identity.  There is a responsibility on us, as legislators, to take action against criminal behaviour but where the motivation behind that criminal behaviour is driven by a hatred we, as a State and society, have to say it is not acceptable.  We have come a long way since Senator Norris had to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.  Ireland has come a hell of a long way but in this area we still need to go further.  It is also important, at a time when we see the disgraceful behaviour of the Polish Government towards ethnic minorities and particularly the LGBT minorities, that we need to continue to be a beacon of light in Europe in tackling homophobia.</p> <p>I also want to pay tribute to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of its work in this area.  As an organisation, it has adapted and transformed how it operates.  With regard to people from various ethnic backgrounds and those who are gay, lesbian or bisexual, the Garda has gone the extra mile to understand those who come from minority backgrounds.  When hate crimes are committed, garda&iacute; provide as much support as possible to the victims.  In circumstances such as these, we need to ensure that there is the power at sentencing level where the only motivation behind the action of the accused is hatred of somebody else.  We need to make provision for this extra sentencing power.</p> <p>I hope that we will work together in the House to achieve the best possible legislation we can but, to me, this is about what we say to those groups in our society that are discriminated against.  We are going to say that if the only reason for which they are discriminated against is on the basis of their identity or perceived identity, then we will take a tougher stand.</p></speech>

I know how much she cares about the Bill, how passionate she is about this issue and how much she wants to see real and meaningful change.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a fact that Ireland, thankfully, has become a far more progressive, inclusive and diverse society over recent years and we have witnessed significant positive changes.  However, not everybody has welcomed this change with open arms.  With any change we always meet some resistance.  Out of this have come some really hurtful and damaging behaviours by some in our society who sought to commit a crime against another citizen of the country who is another human being, simply on the basis of hate, because they perceive that person to be different to what they believe in or what they want.  This needs to be dealt with.</p><p>The basis for this legislation is to allow the courts in a situation where a crime has been committed where it is known, or where there is evidence to show, that it is on the basis of hate or discrimination, be it sexual orientation, race, ethnicity and all the categories in the Bill, to take into account when sentencing that hate has been the basis for the commission of that crime.  This is important for our society and that is most important for the victims of the crime so they know the harm and hurt done against them has been recognised by the courts, the laws of the land and society, and has been condemned in the strongest sway as being simply wrong and unlawful once we get these laws on the Statute Book.</p><p>It is important to note that when somebody is attacked because of their identity or the person they are it leaves a long and lasting psychological impact.  Words can hurt the most.  "Sticks and stones may break my bones" was something we often rhymed in the playground but the words definitely lasted longer and often can take the longest to heal.  It is these types of prejudices and discrimination that we as a country and society need to discuss openly and work through and, quite frankly, stamp out.  It is very welcome to have an opportunity in the House to debate the legislation and the topic.</p><p>It is very good of Senator O'Loughlin to acknowledge that there is still work to be done on the legislation and that it is not perfect.  Some of the emails we have seen show how sensitive the topic is and how many communities and people are affected.  Everybody needs to be brought on board and we need to listen to all of these voices.  This is just a starting point and there is a long way to go in getting this legislation on the Statute Book.  This is why it is important that there be cross-party and government support and that we work with all the stakeholders involved to make sure all voices are heard.  The last thing we want to do is exclude anybody or enact legislation that offends our hurts in any way.</p><p>I congratulate Senator O'Loughlin on getting the Bill debated.  I was not aware it had been so long since had been discussed in either House.  This is certainly a failing of the national Parliament.  This is a good starting point and I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution on the matter.</p></speech>

I am unusual, at least I hope I am unusual, in the House, in that I have personally known nine men to have been murdered.  Among them I include Declan Flynn, with whom I was quite friendly.  Declan was a shy young man.  He worked in Aer Lingus.  He went to Bartley Dunne's, which was a gay pub at the time.  Some of his colleagues from work were there on a jaunt and saw him and started teasing him about it.  He was ashamed and he never went back.  Instead, he went looking for company in Fairview Park and he was murdered for that.  He was brutally murdered.  Even worse, the judge hearing the case let the young men who committed the act off with nothing, not even a reprimand.  This was a licence to kill.  It was a really shocking thing.  I have been involved myself.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some years ago I was talking to a friend in Parnell Street and this trio went past me.

I immediately got the garda&iacute;, and they caught them.  They were sentenced to pay me &euro;1,000.  I asked the garda if I could have the address and he said, "For what?"

It was violent, aggressive and appalling.  I tried to get that looked at by the Director of Public Prosecutions and I was told that there was no basis for doing that because there was no hate crime.  That is a good illustration of how it is very necessary.  </p> <p>This has been noted internationally, as referred to by Senator O'Loughlin.  The UN special rapporteur on the elimination of racial discrimination criticised the Government for failing to reform its legal framework on hate crime and called for a clear, timebound commitment to make the necessary changes in law.  That is significant.  This is still going on.  In February of this year, a young man in Newbridge - I am not sure if it was the same case Senator O'Loughlin was referring to - was attacked and stabbed on the basis of his assumed sexuality.</p> <p>I received a lengthy document from a group of women who have problems with the hate crime legislation because they said it allows for the idea of gender to replace the idea of biological sex.  They say it lets someone who identifies as the male gender to be recognised by the State as a biological male and for someone who identifies as female to be recognised as a biological female.  I am putting that on the record without comment because it was referred to me.</p> <p>I notice Senator O'Loughlin is introducing an amendment but she is leaving in this idea of perception; the victim perceived that a crime has been committed.  That is not satisfactory.  It should be removed because it is so subjective.  If somebody shouted, "Ya dirty aul snot" to me I would think it is because I am a fairy.  It is not.  It is because he thinks I am a snot.  I believe this is legally challengeable also.</p> <p>I commend Senator O'Loughlin on the Bill.  It is very timely and I hope it passes.</p></speech>

I agree with almost everything Senator O'Loughlin said in her contribution introducing the Bill to the House.  I commend her and her colleagues on bringing it forward.  It is timely and, regrettably, it is also necessary.  A number of Senators recounted the stories many of us will be aware of, including famous cases like that of Declan Flynn, where the most appalling injustice for nonsensical and incomprehensible reasons have been committed against people in this State.  There is no doubt that we have to deal with that.</p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin also referred to the commitment in the programme for Government, which I believe was very welcome.  It came not just from the programme for Government but because a number of Members of these Houses have called for this exact type of legislation over the years and for action to be taken in this area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Specifically, the programme for Government states that hate speech and hate crimes have a particularly lifelong impact on individuals and communities and have no place in our society.  Senator O'Loughlin dealt with that, and Senator Chambers also made reference to it.  In terms of the impact on victims in circumstances where the victims are not just of a crime but of a crime because of some aspect of their person, be it their ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender, which I will come to shortly, or the other issues I mentioned in this Bill, it is entirely understandable why that would have an incredibly pervasive effect on them and the people around them.  The damage it does is largely incalculable for those of us who are outside that particular offence.  There is no doubt whatsoever that the Legislature must recognise the seriousness of that added element to an offence.<br/><br/>The programme for Government states that hate crime legislation will be introduced within 12 months and will specifically create offences to ensure that those who target victims because of their association with a particular identity characteristic are identified as perpetrators of hate crime.  That is a tremendously important statement.  We will hear from the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in due course but I understand from her that that legislation is in train.  A public consultation on the issue was commenced by the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Charlie Flanagan, some time late last year.  I understand that is now complete and the results of that public consultation are likely to be published before Christmas.  I hope we will see new legislation officially from the Government in the new year but I do not know any of the details of that legislation.  It is important that we, as a House, acknowledge the importance of legislation and of making a statement in law that this State will not accept that kind of behaviour.<br/><br/>I do not agree with what Senator Norris said about there not being any hate crimes legislation.  There is the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.  I do not know if the cases he mentioned predated the operation of that legislation but, for example, the reference he made to the periodical in Galway which made homophobic comments or contained articles is not acceptable and it is not lawful.  Specifically, section 2 of the 1989 Act states:</p><blockquote>	It shall be an offence for a person---  	(a) to publish or distribute written material,<br /><br />(b) to use words, behave or display written material ...<br /><br />or<br /><br />(c) to distribute ... the written material [if it has] words, behaviour, visual images or sounds, as the case may be, that are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred. </blockquote><p>There is some legislation but it is clearly inadequate because it has not addressed many of the cases we have heard about already in the course of this debate.  Everybody in this House would want to ensure that we do have the legislation and that both the Garda and the prosecutorial authorities have the instruments they need to effect prosecutions in this regard.<br/><br/>The other legislation is the Equal Status Acts, which is important to have reference to because that identifies nine specific grounds on which it is unlawful to discriminate against people.  All of them are legitimate and important aspects of the law that protects minorities, and a majority, in our society in terms of the gender aspect of it.<br/><br/>It is important to recognise that while equal status legislation is tremendously important, it is civil legislation.  It does not create a criminal offence and that creates a difficulty from the point of view of laying down a standard for a prosecution in terms of these matters.<br/><br/>I take on board what is stated in this legislation, which I welcome.  I have some difficulties.  Senator Norris identified one of them, that is, the subjectivity of the offence that is mentioned in section 1 on interpretation.  It is vitally important when we are drafting criminal justice legislation that we have regard to the possibility of something being twisted.  There is, for example, hate crime legislation in the United Kingdom which is quite strong.  It provides for a mandatory increase in a sentencing regime for a judge if, in the process of that prosecution, there is a connection with some hate crime element of the kind in this Bill.  Unfortunately, that was twisted in one case I am aware of where the person being arrested for an entirely unrelated offence that had nothing to do with hate crime then accused the arresting officer of being Welsh.  I do not know whether the arresting officer was Welsh.  I do not know whether describing somebody as Welsh constitutes a hate crime.  I am aware of this story because it was told to me by my brother-in-law, who is Welsh.  The difficulty is that with loose drafting we create possibilities like that.  The notion that something like that would add on a mandatory component to sentencing makes a nonsense of the importance of this legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The difficulty I have in terms of the definitions section is the perception that a hate crime "includes any offence that is perceived by a victim or any other person, to be wholly or partially motivated by prejudice against a relevant individual".  I also acknowledge that in raising this issue, Senator O'Loughlin stated that there are imperfections in the Bill, as there are in all legislation.  That, however, is something we will have to address at on Committee Stage if this legislation is to move forward.  Equally, the definition of homophobia is difficult.  The Bill states that it "includes negative and uninformed feelings towards homosexuality" as if to suggest that had they been informed, it would not be homophobia.  Again, these are matters we can tease out on Committee Stage - if and when the Bill gets to that point.</p><p>It is also tremendously important, however, to bear in mind that sections 2 and 3 deal with sentencing, and aggravating factors which can be taken into account in that regard, being related to hate crime.  Hate speech, hate offences or anything that is connected to hate are already aggravating factors and every judge in the country will take those factors on board.  It is tremendously important, therefore, not to send out the message that is in any way acceptable.  Judges already increase sentencing tariffs.</p><p>Finally, the Schedule, which creates a provision whereby a maximum sentence would have to be handed down, is problematic.  I am generally opposed to the fettering of judicial discretion on sentencing, which is tremendously important.  I welcome the legislation.  It is problematic but that can be fixed.</p></speech>

I commend Senator O'Loughlin and her colleagues on proposing a Bill on hate crime and, indeed, on raising the issue and keeping it on the political agenda.  As previous speakers indicated, it is long overdue for legislation of this to be put in place.  Hate crime laws are well established in other jurisdictions.  They are seen as important because they vindicate the rights of victims and those who have experienced hate crimes.  We heard such eloquent testimony from our dear colleague, Senator Norris, about his lived experience of suffering hate crime.  That is important from the victim's perspective.</p> <p>Hate crime laws are also important because they recognise motivation of hatred as an aggravating factor in an offence and, in some cases, in sentencing as well as in the aggravated offence.  These laws are important because they also recognise a societal disapproval of particular biases, prejudices and hate motivation.  Indeed, having hate crime laws on the Statute Book also enables the maintenance of proper recording and reporting of hate crime, a real area where Ireland has been lacking.  Others have referred to the UN rapporteur as being highly critical of Ireland's lack of hate crime legislation.</p> <p>For all these reasons, I have long been a proponent of the need for hate crime laws.  In its 2020 election manifesto, the Labour Party put forward a policy to make hate crime illegal and to provide specific laws.  It is long overdue and that is well recognised.  I am aware there is also a commitment in the programme for Government to bring forward hate crime law and also reform hate speech law.  They are different but often wrongly conflated.  Those are all welcome.</p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin has acknowledged that the Bill and the wording used in it are deeply flawed.  As a criminal lawyer, I have many issues with the text,  I refer to the lack of precision in the drafting, to the definitions section, to the sections on sentencing - for example, section 4 - and the lack of clarity as to whether a mandatory minimum sentence is being created, etc.  Senator O'Loughlin acknowledged those flaws and I know she will be aware that, with a criminal statute, there is a requirement that the language be precise.  There has been a body of case law striking down offences that are seen as too vague in their wording.  Clearly, the wording needs extensive tightening, review and revision.  Indeed, we have all received a great deal of comment on that via email and it has been good to see just how much people are engaged in respect of the issue.  That is welcome.  The Bill is problematic in terms of the wording used and it will require a good deal of amendment.</p> <p>I am conscious we have debated the issue for many years and it is long overdue that we see some form of legislation coming forward.  I ask that the Minister of State give us a timeframe, particularly as the commitment in the programme for Government states that hate crime legislation will be introduced within 12 months of the formation of the Government, that this legislation will be based on an aggravated offences model and that it will be supported by training across the criminal justice system, as well as victim supports.  This is all welcome but when will we see it?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am conscious the Department of Justice is currently conducting a review of hate speech law, specifically the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 which deals with cases of hate speech aimed at inciting hatred but which has been long criticised as being an ineffective piece of legislation under which it is almost impossible to bring a secure conviction.  When is the review of the 1989 Act due?  I understand that review is imminent and a White Paper is already in train in the Department of Justice.  We need, however, a specific timeline to ensure we have the sort of robust and precisely drafted legislation on hate crime and hate speech that we really need.<br/><br/>I wish to pay tribute to the many academics and NGOs that have worked on this issue over the years and whose work has fed into a deep understanding of the sort of legislation that is really needed.  University of Limerick, UL, academics, in particular, have led on this.  I have long admired the work of Dr. Jennifer Schweppe but also that of her colleagues, Dr. Amanda Haynes and Dr. James Carr, whose report, A Life Free From Fear - Legislating for Hate Crime in Ireland: An NGO Perspective, was launched in 2014.  I should declare an interest because I spoke at the launch.  The Minister of State will be aware they drew up draft legislation at the time and their recommendations should, and I hope will, feed into the review.  They worked, of course, with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, which has led in this area, and with other organisations.  I mention NGOs such as the Irish Network Against Racism, INAR, formerly known as the European Network Against Racism, led by Mr. Shane O'Curry.  Again, that organisation led the way in raising awareness about the extent to which hate crime is an issue in Ireland.  Indeed, INAR and the ICCL and others are involved in a coalition against hate crime that is working to ensure we get the robust legislation we need.<br/><br/>I am aware there were a large number of submissions, approximately 4,000, to the Department of Justice consultation on the 1989 Act.  Clearly there are strong views on this and they will need to be fed into the drafting of the legislation.<br/><br/>Without the drafting of the legislation we are failing the victims of hate crime and society more broadly.  We are failing as a society because without hate crime legislation, we are not in a position to formally acknowledge the real damage, hurt, pain and suffering caused by hate crime.  While we await the legislation we are, I suppose, in a situation where we simply do not know the extent to which hate crime is perpetrated.<br/><br/>In June of this year, the Garda reported that 250 crimes recorded in 2019 were judged to have a hate-based motive.  It is worrying, but at the same time, I believe all of us would assume that is an underestimate of the true level of hate crime.  I commend the Garda which introduced a working definition in 2019 so it could move towards the recording of hate crimes.  Clearly, a statutory framework is essential to ensure we have robust reporting.<br/><br/>There have been some worrying reports about the policing of hate crime legislation.On 20 August of this year in <i>The Irish Times</i>,  Mr. Conor Gallagher reported an internal Garda survey which found that a worrying number of garda&iacute; had poor opinions of different minority communities.  That is a concern and makes the programme for Government commitment to introducing supports in the form of training for those working in the criminal justice system crucial.  We need to ensure the legislation is accompanied by non-legislative and non-penal frameworks which enable the legislation to be effective.<br/><br/>Of course, we are all well aware it will take more than hate crime laws to tackle the real extent of hate crime and hate speech in Ireland.  To develop a society in which people truly feel equal and free from the sort of fears many still experience daily walking around public streets or public spaces, we must move towards changing public opinion.  We must move towards a system of education and supports, not just for those in the criminal justice system but supports for teachers and students in our education system.  We know the motivation behind hate crime is a deep-seated problem in Irish society and we need to make sure we tackle it.<br/><br/>I look forward to specific timeframes from the Minister of State on when the Government will introduce the legislation, when we will see the report published on the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 and when we will see true reform taking place.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte roimh an Bille agus pl&eacute; ar an Bille seo anocht.  M&oacute;lam ait siud a lag &eacute;.  I welcome the Minister of State and acknowledge those who have tabled this legislation.  What tonight shows is how effective it is when Members adhere to proper, timely parliamentary processes and give themselves the space to debate, help and inform legislation of this and other kinds that come through this House.  What I always find about the Seanad is that when the collective talent, ability and purpose of Members is harnessed, as in this instance, we can do great work but we must have the ability to acknowledge where there may be legislative weaknesses and have the space that allows us collectively, as Members, to try to help to better amend legislation as it moves forward.</p> <p>Unfortunately, as has been well articulated, and some of it very acutely by colleagues here tonight, Ireland is no stranger to hate crimes.  Hate crime is often motivated by power that can be institutional and personal.  It taps into prejudice, inherited and learned.  It can be obvious and crude, ignorant and uneducated.  It can be invisible and subtle or sophisticated and educated.  Senator Ward raised an important point about the issue of being uninformed and how that could, potentially, cause problems in the future with this legislation.  As colleagues have already acknowledged, hate crime legislation is long overdue in this State.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State will concede that in terms of his own remarks.  </p> <p>As some Members have already articulated, there are concerns.  Indeed, the proposer, Senator O'Loughlin, acknowledged in her remarks that there are some concerns around the wording and precision of the contents of this Bill.  Some of those concerns relate to the conflation between homophobia and transphobia.  I acknowledge there are also concerns by some people in the trans community about what they see as outdated language that perhaps could be tweaked.  As Senator Norris eloquently articulated, as always, there are concerns regarding the inclusion of the word "perceived" in the Bill.  Senators Ward and Bacik also raised those concerns.  I share those concerns and I hope that Senator O'Loughlin will reflect and take our concerns on board, as we move ahead.</p> <p>Legislation such as this can and must be stronger.  It must be informed and shaped by those most impacted.  Many people have contacted us recently, which shows how important and crucial it is that when bringing in legislation, not least legislation as important and sensitive as this, we engage as broadly and extensively as possible.  </p> <p>In acknowledging the passage of this Bill tonight, it must be said with all due respect that this Bill and such legislation would have been much better, stronger and potentially much more effective had it have been a Government Bill from the Department and the Minister, that had been informed by the consultation that has been undertaken, as referenced by Senator Bacik in her remarks.  There has to have been a purpose to the consultation.  I hope that strong, robust, precise and effective legislation ultimately will be the purpose and will be informed by the important consultation on the existing Act because a lot of the relevant stakeholders and groups who have been in contact with us contributed to the consultation in the hope and understanding that this would be the trajectory the Government would follow, as laid out in the programme for Government, in bringing the kind of legislation before the Oireachtas that they want to see that will help tackle hate crime.  I say that in no way to diminish or take away from Senator O'Loughlin's intention here tonight.</p> <p>We have had a good and important debate.  It is good that we have had the space here tonight to have such a debate.  Given the rise in hate crimes in society, it is a debate that we need to have.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While delivering legislation is the ultimate outcome for everyone, it is always positive, as Members of the Oireachtas and people involved in political life, to reassert our commitment to tackling hatred, prejudice and injustice when we have an opportunity to do so.  Whether it is the Bill before us or the Bill the Government has committed to introducing, I hope the legislation we introduce will be as effective and robust as it can be in tackling hate crime in society.  We cannot sit here in splendid isolation and say "Sin &eacute;, we have done enough" because the questions will then be, as rightly acknowledged in earlier contributions, how will the Garda implement and give effect to this legislation and how will those who are committed to hatred and intolerance be effectively dealt with in a way that stops hatred and intolerance and assists those who are most marginalised, the minorities in society, to live free from prejudice, intolerance and hatred.</p><p>I thank the proposer, Senator O'Loughlin, the Minister of State and the Cathaoirleach. </p></speech>

I came into the Seanad with the hope that I would help break down barriers for the Traveller community and for all those on the edges of society.  I believe inclusive and effective hate crime legislation must be part of this.</p> <p>I acknowledge Senator O'Loughlin's efforts in this area.  However, I am aware that some of the issues with the previous draft legislation in 2016 have still not been addressed in the current version.  During transgender awareness month, it is particularly important to point out the need to make sure that transphobia is addressed separately from homophobia in the Bill.  This is not clear in the text.</p> <p>As the only person from an ethnic minority group in the Seanad, I know that if this legislation is not worded appropriately, it could have a very bad impact on people from ethnic minority groups.  It would be like the 1989 Act and will not work.  Any legislation in this area must be informed by consultation and engagement with civil society.  As politicians, we all need to learn and listen because if we do not get legislation right, it could have a negative impact on the people concerned.</p> <p>One of my favourite quotes is "nothing about us without us" because work is often done without consulting the people who are impacted.  While it is great to do the work, we must engage with the people who are impacted by hate crime and hate speech.  This is why my colleague in the Civil Engagement Group, Senator Lynn Ruane, and I have over the last two years held consultations on hate crime with a broad network of stakeholders, including the Irish Traveller Movement, Traveller LGBTQI+ Action Group, the Irish Network Against Racism, INAR, and Muslim Sisters of &Eacute;ire, to name but a few.</p> <p>Since 2014, I have been involved in the #LoveNotHate campaign around hate crime legislation with Shane O'Curry of INAR and the wider INAR network.  Senator Ruane and I are working passionately to deliver hate crime legislation that will work for people in Irish society.  We will also follow the Department's review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have been working with academics from all universities regarding legislation on hate crime that will work for people from ethnic minority groups.</p></speech>

This is another example of that pathetic strategy.  Devoid of any true guiding principles, languishing on an historic low of 11% in the opinion polls and registering a paltry 8% support from under 35s, it looks as if Fianna F&aacute;il is going broke.  It is being devoured by Sinn F&eacute;in on its left and by its new partners, Fine Gael, on its right-hand side.</p><p>I will turn back to this fundamentally flawed Bill, the purpose of which is to create a new criminal offence of hate crime and superimpose it onto specified existing criminal offences.  Section 2(1) states:</p> <blockquote> 	An offence is aggravated by hate crime against a relevant individual if&mdash;  	(a) at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, a person displays racism, homophobia, xenophobia, anti-religious prejudice or disability hate crime towards a relevant individual, or<br /><br />(b) the offence is motivated (wholly or partly) by racist, homophobic, xenophobic, anti-religious prejudice or disability hate crime towards a relevant individual.   </blockquote> <p>That section tacks the label of &quot;hate crime&quot; onto existing crimes as an aggravating factor for the prosecution.  The vagueness, breadth and open-ended nature of this provision is quite staggering.  For example, racism includes things such as antagonism.  Antagonism, which is extremely subjective, would be made criminal if anyone claimed it. </p><p>The definition of &quot;xenophobia&quot; encompasses an accused person having a &quot;fear of people from different cultures&quot;, meaning that fear is also a potential hate crime under the Bill.</p><p>Homophobia is defined as including &quot;negative and uninformed feelings towards homosexuality or individuals who are identified as, or perceived as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender&quot;.  No matter what one thinks about this Bill, how are negative and uninformed feelings to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt?</p><p>What type of evidence is going to be used shift the evidential burden onto the accused?  That question is answered in the definition of &quot;hate crime&quot;, which includes &quot;any offence that is perceived by a victim or any other person, to be wholly or partially motivated by prejudice against a relevant individual&quot;.  That is a problematic provision.  It means the accused must go into evidence, having their privilege against self-incrimination and the right to remain silent brushed aside based on the subjective perception of the victim or any other person.</p><p>The definition of a &quot;relevant person&quot; in section 1 includes:</p> <blockquote> 	... individuals who are identified on the basis of their asylum or refugee status, nationality, religion, (including no religion), colour, race, disability, ethnicity (including members of the Traveller and Roma communities), gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, transgender identity, sex characteristics or age or perceived age ... </blockquote> <p>This is also disturbing and ill-defined.  &quot;Age or perceived age&quot; could potentially refer to everyone on planet earth.  Whose perception is this based on?  Does not everyone on planet </p><p>earth have sex characteristics?  Nationality, religion, or no religion, colour or race can all apply to everyone on the planet, making virtually every relevant offence a potential hate crime.</p><p>The definition of &quot;gender identity and expression&quot; appears to omit people who decide that they are non-binary.  Do they not also deserve the hate crime victims' status?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Regarding sentencing of the accused convicted of a hate crime, section 3(1) states:</p><blockquote>	Where is it proven or demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court, that a motivating factor for the commission of a relevant offence (as set out in the Schedule to this Act) was aggravated by hate crime against a relevant individual, the court shall, on conviction ... </blockquote><p>What on earth does the phrase &quot;demonstrated to the satisfaction of the court&quot; mean?  Have those introducing this Bill invented a new, alternative standard of proof in criminal cases involving hate crimes?  Whatever happened to proof beyond a reasonable doubt?<br/><br/>The penalty to be imposed by the trial judge under section 4 is an unwarranted intrusion by the Oireachtas in judicial discretion when sentencing.  It tries to compel a trial judge to impose a maximum sentence on someone convicted of a hate crime.  If this is supposed to act as a deterrent, it will not.  All the evidence from the field of criminology points to the likelihood of being apprehended as a deterrent and not the potential sentence.<br/><br/>Section 5, like the rest of the Bill, is pointless at best.  Trial judges already have considerable latitude when sentencing to make probation orders with a wide range of conditions as they deem appropriate to the offender, the offence and the facts of the case.  It is my understanding, for example, that as the law stands, a trial judge could, if he or she deemed it appropriate to the facts of the particular case, stipulate that an offender must do a course while on probation to educate them about racism.  Similarly, this entire Bill is unnecessary.  To explain, as the law stands, if there is evidence of racism that is relevant to, and admissible in, a particular case of assault, for example, it can be presented in court by the prosecution for the judge and jury to consider, as appropriate.<br/><br/>Not only is this Bill poorly drafted, ill-conceived nonsense on stilts, it is, equally, a manifestation of poisonous identity politics.  It is a shameful attempt to corrupt existing criminal law with this toxic, incoherent ideology for the sake of personal political gain.  For this reason, I will oppose the Bill in its current form and vote against it on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

Hate crime is based on a criminal act and biased motive.  Coincidentally, I recently read an article by Niall Stokes, who has done a lot of work on racism, in <i>Hot Press</i>.  I read Being Black in the EU, a study conducted in 2019, which asked approximately 6,000 people of African descent in 12 countries in Europe their opinions on many different issues.  I was shocked because it was an area in which I did not expect Ireland to rank highly and it is one survey that one does not want to see one's country's name listed.  However, Ireland was ranked second in violent attacks against people of African descent.  I could not believe that.  Across all areas, there has been a lot of racially-motivated verbal abuse.  We have to do something and act.</p><p>I support the work the Senator is doing and believe that we have to bring it to the fore because it is a discussion that needs to be had.  We are here today to ensure that we can do something to support people who are going through this and it would be excellent to have people in here who can speak about having had this experience.  We are speaking about surveys of people who are affected by this but the make-up of the Seanad and D&aacute;il is not reflective of the community we have in Ireland at the moment.  It is up to us to speak on their behalf and on behalf of us all.  I support and thank the Senator.</p></speech>

I say "Well done" to Senator O'Loughlin for introducing it.  We need to protect all minority groups in Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is essential that the silence is broken on these crimes and people actively report racism and other hate attacks in order to address and stop their occurrence.  Freedom of expression should never extend to hate crimes and Irish people need to accept that.</p><p>It is great to see Senator O'Loughlin show an interest in the area of hate crime and share her views on the topic.  Like others, I fear there are a number of gaps in the Bill in terms of affording protections to all minority groups.  It does not extensively cover the proposed areas of protection included in the 2016 Bill.  It is paramount we craft this Bill with everyone in mind so that nobody's existence is undermined or forgotten.  Legislation, particularly where penalties are involved, must also be legally clear.  For example, there is an important difference between a hate crime offence and hate as a factor in defining the crime.  Different approaches to this have been taken in different legislation, including the Bill we are debating.  </p><p>I am aware that my colleagues, Senators Flynn and Ruane, have been actively working in the area of hate crime legislation for a number of years and have consulted and engaged with non-governmental organisations and activists dedicated to hate crime legislation.  It is great to see support on this issue among many politicians across the House, including Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin.  The Bill features very important points which will be considered by Senators Ruane and Flynn as they continue in their commitment to creating hate crime legislation that will afford adequate protections to every member of society.</p></speech>

There are major problems with this legislation.  Much has been said already about the flaws in the drafting of the Bill.  I must be honest and say it is flawed in its delivery, so to speak, or in its execution.  That is rooted, I am sorry to say, partly in the fact that it is also flawed in its conception.  It is in places confused, erratic and, ultimately, it would be counterproductive in terms of shaping good law for our country.  It gets bogged down in definitional problems that frustrate its aims but would also endanger existing rights such as equality before the law, a trial in due course of law and freedom of expression.  For example, the drafters of the Bill appear to be unclear on whether hate crime is an offence motivated by certain prejudice or simply a perceived attitude of prejudice contributing to an offence.  If they mean a perceived attitude of prejudice aggravating an offence, which is what I think they mean, they should not be using the term &ldquo;crime&rdquo; because this will cause no end of confusion.  It seems the drafters want to treat certain thoughts as criminal if these thoughts are part of the background to an offence, for example, assault.  The problem is that this takes us into the area of thought crime and the Bill seems to state such thought crime has been committed if any person, not necessarily the victim, alleges it and if the prosecution states it, but there is no reference to any burden of evidence or standard of proof required to establish the thought crime in question.</p> <p>The Bill also fails to be precise about which categories of person might be victims of hate crime.  In one place, hate crime is defined as including age-related prejudice but when it comes to the ability of the court to take hate crime into account, offences against victims of age-related prejudice are excluded.</p> <p>There is no easy way to say this but I am extremely surprised the Bill has come before us in this form.  While we all commend each other&rsquo;s best efforts and sincerity of approach, we must bear in mind that people are looking in from outside.  If we bring forward legislation that, for example, seems to define hate crime as an offence in the interpretation and then says an offence is aggravated by hate crime, which is to suggest that an offence is aggravated by an offence but that second offence is nowhere defined in the legislation, it will lead to criticisms of the Seanad.  It is better to deal with these topics by way of a motion to allow us to tease issues out.  Even if a Bill then comes forward at the end of that, which some people will accept and some will reject, at least we have to spend less time teasing through the issues.  That is my honest opinion on this.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Bill gets bogged down in definitional problems but it also jumps the gun.  The public consultation by the Department of Justice on hate speech and the review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 is ongoing.  It is my understanding that a separate consultation process is envisaged regarding hate crimes, so there is the prematurity of the issue.  There is also the fact there is legislation in Britain, as mentioned by Senator Ward, among others, in sections 145 and 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 in England and Wales.  That English legislation does not even mention the phrase "hate crime", yet that phrase is used 25 times in this short Bill, and that worries me.  What has happened here is a phrase has been taken from political discourse, namely, "hate crime", and there is an attempt to translate that into a legal concept instead of doing what Westminster did and trying to tackle the issue directly in a focused way.  Legislation is one thing but public education in terms of the work of our schools, churches, non-governmental organisations or whoever it is that forms ideas and values is a very different thing from what we eventually craft into legislation.  That point cannot be made strongly enough.</p><p>I wish to address the concept because there is idealism behind the idea of trying to attack nasty attitudes in our society.  I understand what the proponents of the Bill are trying to do, that is, to send a message that prejudice on the basis of a person's race, religion, sexual orientation, etc., should have no place in human behaviour or in Irish society.  That is excellent, but the legislation does not do this.  It does not create any new category of crime.  We have the reality that judges are able to take circumstances into account when sentencing.  This seems like something the sentencing guidelines committee of the judicial council should be examining and reporting on before we start issuing new legislative edicts to the Judiciary.</p><p>However, most of all, I am worried about the concept underlining this Bill, which is that is there is a hierarchy of victims among people who are equally vulnerable.  That would send entirely the wrong message about crime.  To take an example, imagine two identical cases of assault causing harm, one is committed against an elderly woman and another is committed against a young member of a community that is an ethnic minority.  Most people would think these crimes should receive roughly similar sentences or perhaps that the crime against the elderly person might deserve a harsher sentence in certain circumstances.  However, this Bill would suggest the crime against the elderly person could theoretically get a fine and a suspended sentence while the assault against the younger victim would be eligible for the maximum sentence of five years in prison.  Is that justice?  To take another example, and I say this with great care, the case of a sexual assault against a vulnerable person, where a person carries out an assault against a vulnerable person.  They do it because they are racist and the person is a member of an ethnic minority but perhaps they do it because they have a grudge against the victim's family or they have a love of violence.  We need to be very careful about creating a hierarchy of victims or a hierarchy of seriousness or odiousness in circumstances like that.  That is to where talk of hate crime takes us.  Judges must take all sorts of circumstances into account.  There may be racism.  There may be prejudice based on a person's bodily characteristics or their sexual orientation, perceived or otherwise, but it may also be there are other issues involved such as love of violence or hatred of some other kind that is not defined in this Bill.  We need to be very careful about setting up a hierarchy of victims.  That is not good in terms of promoting the right kind of attitudes of respect for every person in our society.</p><p>The Bill waters down the notion of hate crime because potentially under its provisions every crime committed could be a hate crime.  Other Members have addressed this.  The Bill defines hate crime as any offence and a crime should be an offence, but elsewhere it refers to hate crime as the attitude underlining the offence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My point is that where the Bill defines hate crime as an offence, the phrase &quot;any offence that is perceived by a victim or any other person&quot; is used.  If, therefore, some officious bystander - to borrow a legal phrase from another context - takes a view, can he or she be heard in evidence if he or she believes that the offence in question was wholly or partially motivated by prejudice against a relevant individual?  On the face of it, this could mean that all offences listed in the Schedule could be hate crimes or that all offences listed in all circumstances could be seen as hate crimes because, in a country of 5 million people, there will always be at least one person who holds a particular opinion, no matter how reasonable.<br/><br/>Others have addressed the problem relating to the standard of proof here and, in a way, that is one of the most alarming flaws in the Bill.  It seems that three things are required for an offence to be deemed to be a hate crime, namely, that there is an underlying offence, that somebody perceives it to have been a hate crime and that the prosecution has to state it in evidence.  I have never seen such a low threshold that must be met before the imposition of a maximum sentence.<br/><br/>I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his indulgence and will now conclude.  In DPP <i>v</i>. Cagney and DPP <i>v</i>. McGrath in 2007, the late Mr. Justice Adrian Hardiman spoke of &quot;the fundamental value that crimes must be defined with precision and without ambiguity so that the criminal law is certain and specific&quot;.  I am afraid that this Bill fails that test.</p></speech>

I welcome the debate on this important matter.</p> <p>One never knows from one day to the next who might be impacted upon by hate crime or hate speech.  Any attempt to impose heavier penalties is to be welcomed.  The Bill has been put together quite well.  It encompasses a number of different areas, including issues relating to an individual's asylum or refugee status, race, colour, religion, nationality, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, transgender identity, sex characteristics, age or perceived age, and provides for related matters.  All of these, evidence has shown, are matters in respect of which people have either suffered abuse or been subjected to hate speech and hate crime.  Obviously, there is a history here in the context of LGBT communities, people with disabilities, who are constantly discriminated against in any event, and those who are coping with very difficult situations regarding transgender identity.</p> <p>The previous Government did a great deal work on transgender issues in particular.  We have been approached by a number of individuals who have made submissions regarding concerns that they have that the Bill could cause problems for some within the LGBT community.  This stems from concerns regarding the Gender Recognition Act 2015, with which I would have been involved via the Government that was in office at that time, as would other Members of both Houses, past and present.  We celebrated the introduction of that groundbreaking legislation.  The main problems are arising because of the idea of gender replacing the idea of biological sex.  The 2015 Act allows someone who identifies as being of the male gender to be recognised by the State as a biological male and for someone who identifies as female to be recognised by the State as a biological female.  There are concerns within the LGBT community about certain aspects of the Bill.  I know that it would not have been the intention of those who drafted it to be the cause of such concerns.  I am sure that if the Bill is allowed to proceed to Committee Stage, some of these issues could be ironed out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The purpose of the Bill is to make provision in law for hate crimes against persons on the basis of asylum or refugee status.  Many of us have experience in dealing with very vulnerable people who are discriminated against because of who they are, their race, or their status in society.  I had direct experience of that in the past year in my previous role.  It is an area that is fraught with difficulties so I can very much understand the rationale behind a Bill that will give additional and added protections to individuals who face that level of discrimination and who are the victims of such hate crimes.</p><p>I mentioned sexual orientation and transgender identity.  When in government, we have done a great deal to be proud of, with cross-party support over the past number of years in this area of recognising the identities of people.  We passed a groundbreaking referendum on sexual orientation as well, which has thankfully resulted in a positive impact on the status of, and access to, civil marriage as well.  I welcome the debate and the work that has been done by the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators on the Bill and look forward to the Minister of State's response to the views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-11-17a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020111700002#JJJJ00200"><p>I thank Senator O'Loughlin for her remarks and I acknowledge the intent and work behind this Private Members' Bill.  The area of hate crime is of particular interest to the Senator and I am aware of her track record and considerable work in trying to advance the legislative position in recent years.  The proposals in this Bill reflect the vital public interest in protecting persons from the harm caused by crimes motivated by hate and prejudice.  I thank Senators for their contributions.  I will address some of the issues throughout my response and will relay their contributions to the Minister.</p> <p>It is fair to say that the historical approach to hate crime was perhaps defined by a sense that Ireland was a place where very few minorities lived and so we believed that hate crime did not really exist to any significant extent.  Our society has changed and is so very colourful and diverse in comparison with the country of 50 years ago.  We must acknowledge the reality that Ireland has always had minorities and categories of people who were treated shamefully.  These were often people who did not have a voice and who were not listened to or taken seriously.  I am proud that we are now taking serious steps to improve our criminal law in this important area and congratulate Senator O&rsquo;Loughlin for her work in developing a genuine, concrete attempt to do just that.  A deeper understanding of the problems and dangers of hate and division has now developed in Ireland, reflecting developments internationally.  Academics and experts have for some time called for effective legislation to deal with these problems swiftly and effectively, wherever they occur.  The work done by the Senator is one part of that and is to be welcomed for that reason.</p> <p>Hate crimes cause very serious harm.  They are especially serious because they are often used as a way of sending a signal to certain groups of people that they are not safe, not wanted or not entitled to the same freedoms as everybody else.  This signal is not intended just for the victim but for their whole community and everyone who is like them.  These crimes spread fear, anger and division.  They make our societies less safe for everyone and, because of this, they are everyone&rsquo;s problem and need to be taken very seriously.  Development of new legislation in this area has wide community and cross-party support, which I welcome.  The Government has reiterated its commitment to introducing such legislation in the programme for Government, Our Shared Future.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the issues the Bill seeks to address are difficult and complex.  This is why such significant and comprehensive work has been undertaken already by the Department of Justice to ensure that the different groups that will be impacted by hate crime legislation or that have expertise and experience working in the area, have an opportunity to feed into the development of that legislation.  As well as a form of public consultation, engagement with civil society organisations and other experts is an ongoing feature of the development of the legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=17"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I acknowledge the significant contribution made to the work by all of those who have been so generous with their expertise and with sharing their stories, even though for some of the contributors, this will have been a painful process.  I acknowledge that and thank those people.</p><p>A report on the results of the consultation and research in this regard will be published by the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, shortly.  This work has provided very valuable insights which will inform the legislative proposals the Minister has committed to publishing in the early part of 2021.  As Senators may be aware, the Minister's work in this area reflects the programme for Government commitment to introduce legislation within 12 months.  Once published, the Government's legislative proposals will go forward to the Joint Committee on Justice and begin a process of comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny.  There will be ample opportunity for the Members of this House and other Oireachtas colleagues to participate and contribute further to the discussions during that process.  The Minister is looking forward to seeing the results of the scrutiny process further inform and improve the legislative proposals.</p><p>The emotive and sensitive nature of the subject matter makes it particularly important that the debate around new hate crime legislation is as coherent and factually based as possible, and that any new legislative proposals in this regard are clear, proportionate and evidence-based.  While the Bill is a genuine attempt to address the issues, parts of it would benefit from further detailed scrutiny and consultation.  On the most fundamental level, I am advised that the proposed definition of hate crime in the Bill would not be suitable for use in criminal legislation.  It is based on a definition used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigative purposes and is very useful and suitable in that context.  However, the use of such a broad definition in criminal legislation, where an offence could be a hate crime in the event that a victim or any other person perceives it to be so, is not being considered by the Minister.</p><p>It will be important in bringing forward Government legislation in this area that any new definition of hate crime is workable and clear, and respects the correct balance of rights needed to ground a criminal prosecution.  It is critically important that any legislation to deal with hate crime balances the important need to protect people from the very real and harmful impact of these crimes, while also protecting the human rights of those accused of wrongdoing.  There are certain legal and drafting issues with the Bill which the Senator may wish to consider further.  For example, some of the key definitions will need to be examined again to ensure they do not cause unintended cross-cutting effects.  In addition, the sentencing provisions will need careful calibration to ensure they are proportionate and do not encroach on the independence of the Judiciary.  We also need to be particularly mindful of the role of the jury in finding a person guilty of a crime.  The section dealing with the hate element of the crime in question and how a person is able to defend himself or herself in relation to this part of the offence would also benefit from careful examination.</p><p>On a final point, the exclusion from the scope of the Bill of offences which are prosecuted summarily needs further consultation and, perhaps, consultation with those who are familiar with such prosecutions to ensure the most common forms of the offences are not outside of the scope of the Bill.  </p><p>On the issue of the matter not currently being priority legislation, the first priority for the Minister was to get the required level of public consultation, and we had almost 4,000 contributions in that respect.  As Senator Flynn correctly pointed out, it was a case of "nothing about me without me".  The important part of the consultation was to enable individuals, civic society and organisations to make those contributions.  I acknowledge, as Senator Bacik did, the work of the Irish Network Against Racism, Dr. Jennifer Schweppe and all those who made significant contributions in that respect.  It is not possible to make this priority legislation until a scheme of the Bill has been prepared and sent to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, OPC.  The legislation will be a priority for the Government as soon as the scheme has been completed and submitted to the OPC.  The Minister expects to have the scheme ready in the early part of 2021.  I assure Senators that this a priority for the Government, and it will be priority legislation in the new year.</p><p>I acknowledge again the work of Senator O'Loughlin and congratulate her on bringing this Bill forward.  As legislators, we all have a grave responsibility to make sure society can deal effectively with hate crime.  A great number of people are relying on us in this regard, and it has taken too long to get to this point.  A collegiate and collaborative approach will be of utmost importance as the Government's legislative proposals on both hate crime and incitement to racial hatred are developed and go through the scrutiny process in the coming months in accordance with the programme for Government commitments.  I ask for the support of all Senators for the important work that this will involve.  I thank Senator O'Loughlin again for bringing this Bill to the House.  I assure all Senators that their contributions will be a valuable addition to this process and will be taken into consideration.  I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Senators for their attention.</p></speech>

I look forward to talking about it again another day.  I did make the case, and clearly there was a very constructive debate which I watched from the television screens, but to set aside 90 minutes to deal with hate crime and hate speech is very disappointing.  It is disappointing that Members of this House could not make this a priority.  We had people come in and make statements, whereas we want to walk our talk and want to see action on it.  I am more interested in hearing whether we can extend the debate.  I know that the Deputy Leader of the House is here today, but next week I would like a second discussion and debate on this issue, because it is too serious and too important an issue.  I will leave the House with one message.  I met a Pakistani man last summer when I was coming from a park in Dundrum.  He had been beaten to lard by three teenagers because of hate and hate crimes.  He did not have his own immigration status regularised and he was told that if he went to the Garda, he would be put out of this country.  He was a big, grown man who could have beaten the lard out of the three of them, but he was in fear, and he did not want to get involved.  I will wrap up at this point.  It is too serious-----</p></speech>
