I am very concerned about the way the energy regulator is doing its business.  It is not providing transparency in its decisions or reaching those decisions in a timely manner.  A project which clearly illustrates the problems with the energy regulator is the proposed Mayo renewable energy project, a 45 MW high efficiency combined heat and power biomass fuelled plant to be built on the former Asahi site outside Ballina.  The project lodged applications to the regulator for various consents and licences in June 2018.  Previously, the project, under a different promoter, had been licensed in 2012 by the energy regulator.  Unfortunately in 2016, even though the project was partially built, progress stalled due to financial difficulties.  Progress stopped but new promoters have now come on board.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This project is worth &euro;255 million, of which &euro;95 million has been invested to date by the new promoters who have taken an equity stake of &euro;95 million in the project.  The promoters have taken on the task of revitalising and reviving the project.  The planning permission has been extended by Mayo County Council and the promoters have received renewed consent from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in respect of emissions.  The promoters have received confirmation from ESB Networks that the grid offer remains in place and will be offered to the new company.  However, the promoters have tried to deal with the energy regulator, now known as the Commission for Regulation of Utilities but have run into a stone wall.  Initially the energy regulator appointed consultants and the consultant did not want to give the project a high efficiency certificate, as had previously been given and subsequent to that the energy regulator has retained new consultants.   </p><p>International consultants retained by the new promoters have certified that no material change has been made to this project since it was initially certified in 2012.  Equally to my knowledge, there has been no change in legislation.  I am very concerned that there will be a repeat of what happened when Apple proposed to build a data centre in Athenry.</p><p>This project is a golden opportunity for north Mayo and is key to developing our national policy objectives, such as renewable heat and energy, to which I know the Minister is very committed.  It is also tied in with the development of a data centre on the same site, which requires a renewable energy project to be co-located with it.  This critical project has been stalled.  </p><p>I believe that under the process that is being pursued by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, the promoters should be entitled to know what the problem is and the reason for such delays when there has been no material change in the projects and why a second set of consultants had to be retained.</p><p>Second, in respect of the legislation covering the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, I believe there should be a time limit placed in legislation upon the regulator wherein it must give a decision.  As the Minister knows, time is of the essence for the development of projects, promoters and investors do not wait around and will go somewhere else.  This project is commercially sensitive to time delays. </p><p>With all the resources available to the energy regulator, why is it outsourcing the evaluation of the project to another set of consultants?  All this is taking time, when we have a project that is time sensitive.  As I have said already, we have seen what happened in Athenry.  The whole community was devastated by the outcome of the delay in giving a decision of consent to Apple and ultimately because it took so long to do so, Apple pulled out.</p><p>There are commercial realities.  There are climate change objectives and objectives for the development of the site.  This site is in a peripheral area, where it is hard to attract investment and growth.  This project offers a golden opportunity and I do not believe the energy regulator has dealt with these investors in a fair way.  I do not believe it is fair from all the view points I have set out to the Minister and I believe it should be prescribed in legislation that the regulator should make a decision within a certain period.  When Deputy Bruton was Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, one of the directives that came from his Department and the Taoiseach of the day was that all Government agencies dealing with commercial projects should deal with them in a time-sensitive way and this clearly has not happened in this case.  The other three agencies have given consent, but the regulator has not.  Is this rocket science?  Why is there no transparency?  Why should I and any ordinary person not know what is happening in respect of a project which is of such critical importance in the area?</p><p>I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-05a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019020500002#C00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.</p> <p>I should outline very clearly that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities is an independent regulator.  The Commission for Regulation of Utilities is independent of me as Minister and it sets its own processes for application forms, application fees, processes it will go through, guidance it provides for applicants and so on.  It also is fair to state that it is a body that engages in very substantial public consultation whenever it produces documentation that is for the guidance of applicants.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Richard Bruton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=119"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It published the documentation to which the Senator referred in March 2012.  The latter remains the documentation to which applicants should refer.</p><p>Regarding the basis for the rulings of the regulator, it essentially interprets European legislation as well as our national legislation.  In this instance, it is establishing the heat efficiency of the particular plant.  The European documentation sets out the issues that must be considered.  I am sure the Senator and the applicant  have already had regard to those issues.  This is a complicated matter by any standard.  The regulator must examine several issues in the context of an application, including electrical, thermal and overall efficiency, power-to-heat ratios, electricity from the high-efficiency combined heat and power and primary energy savings.  It does so in accordance with formula set out in the original directive and its annexes.  The regulator has been transparent about what are the requirements.  I cannot second-guess its assessment of an application such as this, no more than the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government can second-guess An Bord Plean&aacute;la when it independently assesses an application made to it.</p><p>The legislation clearly sets out that the regulator is not accountable to the Minister but it provides for accountability to the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  The independent regulator is accountable to the Oireachtas, as ought to be the case.  I cannot shed light on why nothing has changed in the view of the promoters but they have not been granted the approval which was previously given.  That is entirely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities to assess.  Unfortunately,  I am not in a position to provide an insight as to what difficulties this application may be encountering other than to point the Senator and the applicants to the very detailed guidance on what needs to be submitted, the calculations conducted by the regulator and how it weighs applications.  The very detailed source document specifies the terms within which it operates.</p><p>I understand the Senator's enthusiasm to have the plant approved.  However, in order to access state aid or aid through the various refit programmes it must, in addition to acquiring planning permission and EPA approval, fulfil certain criteria which are set independently, policed by the EU and administered by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  Obviously, it is an important element in any project but there be an independent process to vet approval in any case where benefit is being conferred.  It is not a political decision and nor should it be.  That is the position as I understand it.  The company must complete whatever requests have been made of it by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities in order to facilitate a decision being made in a timely way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-05a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019020500002#D00200"><p>The fact is that if it were not for a financial difficulty encountered in 2016, the plant would be up and running.  It had received all the necessary consents.  The regulations which the Minister has to hand have not changed since 2012 and formed the basis upon which the regulator originally issued consents.  There has been no material change in the application.  Perhaps somebody made an error somewhere wrong along the way.  There are serious questions to be answered by the regulator in respect of this matter.  I will be bringing it to the attention of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Change and Environment in order to get some answers.  There is a lot at stake.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are talking about renewable heat and renewable electricity.  This is a whole package and an awful lot of work has gone into it for the regulator to say it got it wrong in the first place.  I do not accept that and common sense should prevail.  There are clearly issues within the current process when the regulator had to get a second lot of consultants.  Notwithstanding the complexities, things should be clear and transparent.  They have to make sense to somebody, somewhere, and some empirical standard and test has to be applied.  The consultants who previously dealt with this are now saying regulations have not changed and the general public will want to know why such a project, especially in north Mayo, cannot be got over the line.  They will also want to know why a Government agency is delaying it in a way that is quite inexplicable.</p><p>If a clear explanation could be given by the Minister or the regulator, whose job it is to do so, I would at least have something to take back to people but I have no answer at this point.  The regulator appeared before the special climate action committee and he had nothing to offer on that occasion but I will raise this again as it is very important for the north Mayo area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-05a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019020500002#E00200"><p>The Senator knows as well as any of us that An Bord Plean&aacute;la makes decisions and does not engage in a process of toing and froing with public representatives or others.  It has planning guidelines and seeks to implement them in the fairest way possible.  I cannot shed any light on what difficulties are arising.  The EU code states that each generational unit shall be compared with the best available and economically justifiable technology for the separate production of heat and electricity on the market in the year of construction of the cogeneration unit.  That suggests that a unit in construction in 2012, as against a unit in construction in 2018, will be compared to different economically justifiable and best available technology.  A regulator continues to evolve against the rules which are set for it.  It does not follow that if something was approved in 2012, it will be identical in 2013.  In annexe 3, it states that they are looking at a different test, and at today's technology rather than that of 2012.</p> <p>I do not know anything about the process but it is not as clear cut as asking why the regulator is not repeating what it did before.  It has to evaluate it because it would be giving out valuable public subsidies, supported by electricity users, and it is right that it be independently vetted.  I have to defend the integrity of the CRU.  It is a highly professional body and an OECD review in 2018 reported it as operating to the very highest standards.  There is no question of doubt in the public mind about how the CRU does its work.  It is accountable to the Oireachtas as set out in legislation.</p></speech>

They combined with the organisation Extern to apply for funding under the Ability programme last year.  As the Minister of State will be aware, that programme has funding of &euro;16 million and is co-financed by the Irish Government and the EU, delivering to 27 projects across the State.  Major controversy arose last year when iCare, Bluestack Special Needs Foundation and Extern were refused funding.  When we look at a map of the State, only one organisation north of the famous Galway to Dublin line, which was located in Roscommon, had received funding.  Major controversy surrounded that because both iCare and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation have existed for many years without any substantial State funding.  iCare based in the Inishowen Peninsula, my home area, has been in existence for 18 years.  It has raised a great deal of money.  This organisation involves families who are taking care of their loved ones with intellectual special needs and trying to fundraise massive amounts of money every year.  There was an intervention for both organisations last year, which I welcome.  At last they got some funding.  Both of them were on the verge of collapse, which would have been a disaster.</p><p>As we are now into 2019, we need confirmation, and I hope the Minister of State will provide it today, that there will be a service level agreement between both organisations and the HSE and fixed annual funding will be provided in order that they will know where they stand and that the families will know that they have a service and will not have to cope, from year to year, faced with massive demands of fundraising.  Both organisations have achieved a great deal.  They have great support in the community but, frankly, they have been taken for granted for far too long.  If funding is not confirmed by the Minister of State today, urgent intervention is needed to secure that funding as soon as possible.</p><p>As we are now into 2019, we need confirmation - I hope the Minister of State will provide it today - that there will be a service level agreement between both organisations and the HSE and that there will be fixed annual funding in order that they will know where they stand and that the families will know they have a service and will not have to cope, from year to year, with facing massive demands in terms of fundraising.

I am well aware of his work and support for families of children and adults with disabilities in the Donegal area.</p> <p>I thank him for raising the issue of funding for the iCare autism support group and the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation.  As Senators may be aware, iCare provides a range of activities for children and young adults with autism spectrum disorder in the Inishowen area.  The organisation also provides supports and services for siblings and parents of children and young adults with autism spectrum disorder.  </p> <p>I would also like to acknowledge the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation's extraordinary achievements since it was established in 2006.  The foundation operates a range of educational, practical and emotional support programmes using a family support model and provides evening and weekend activities, as well as summer camps and a diverse range of activities.  Through its funding activities, the foundation has made very significant donations to charities in the area over a number of years.  </p> <p>I understand the Bluestack foundation has in the past received modest funding through the national lottery.  Following a request for urgent funding last year, of which I am aware, the HSE met representatives of the Bluestack foundation and some funding was awarded to assist the organisation.  That intervention was made last year.</p> <p>I understand that both organisations have submitted funding applications to the HSE for 2019 and I can appreciate they are anxious to learn the outcome.  The HSE's national service planning process for 2019 has now been agreed and budgets are currently being assigned to each community healthcare organisation, CHO.  Once CHO area 1 receives its allocation, it will be in a position to consider the funding arrangements for individual services and organisations, and this will include those raised by the Senator. </p> <p>As Senators may be aware, a number of important developments are under way regarding disability services in general and this includes autism services.  In December 2018, the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced the publication of two reports relating to autism services.  These included a research report on prevalence and a review of HSE autism services.  The HSE review includes a range of recommendations aimed at improving services for children and adults with autism.  The Minister has asked the HSE to proceed with implementing these recommendations and an autism plan will be published later this year.  These actions will build on the substantial work already under way on improving autism services and the assessment process, in particular.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Finian McGrath:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1822"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1822&amp;amp;pid=FinianMcGrath&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Government remains committed to providing service supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives.  These supports will provide greater independence for people in accessing the services they choose and will enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  As part of this commitment, a radical programme of reform of disability services is under way.  The implementation of the reforms will continue to have a practical and tangible impact on the lives of young people and their families.  The work is ongoing, as is the investment and the reform.  We need to focus on the organisations involved, such as those to which Senator Mac Lochlainn refers.</p></speech>

He has personal knowledge of being a carer so he will understand more than most just how frustrating the situation has been.  I will again tell the story of iCare, which I know so well because it is based in my home town of Buncrana.  It has been in operation for 18 years and has become bigger and bigger in terms of the services it delivers.  Its work is groundbreaking in terms of autism support services.  It works with the local school, Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in, in Buncrana.  iCare is a template for organisations across the State but, incredibly, it has achieved that with its own resources and those involved are weary.  The HSE will announce its decision soon.  I urge the Minister of State to ensure that clarity is provided as soon as possible on the funding for 2019, along with the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation.  There is full, cross-party support in Donegal for the services provided by the two organisations.  We desperately want them to have State funding that will allow them to continue their important work.  I urge the Minister of State to continue to monitor the position and to ensure that funding is provided for this year.  I thank the Minister of State for attending.</p></speech>

I appreciate the work of iCare, the members of which I have met.  I was involved with representatives of the Bluestack foundation last year when an issue arose at the time of the intervention.  I recognise the dedication, commitment and autism support services in Senator Mac Lochlainn's community.</p> <p>The HSE will continue to provide significant support services for children, young adults and their families in the north west.  Alternative respite, in-home respite and community-based activity programmes are in place in the community healthcare organisation area benefitting 157 children and adults with some complex needs.  I recognise the commitment of the groups raised by Senator Mac Lochlainn and I firmly believe that community and voluntary services such as those must be supported as much as possible.  I accept the Senator's point that the services are essential.  In this year's budget, funding of &euro;1.9 billion was allocated by the HSE for disability services in 2019.  What that means essentially is that we will 8,600 people in residential care, 27,000 people in day services, respite residential support for 182,500, personal assistance services of 1.63 million hours and home support services of 3.08 million hours.  The good news for people living in institutions is that we will move 160 more people out of institutions into smaller community settings.  We must invest and reform and listen to the needs of groups such as iCare and the Bluestack foundation.  I am listening carefully to what the Senator says and I will push very hard on those issues.</p></speech>

I am delighted he is here to take this matter in which I know he has a strong interest.  My Commencement matter is to ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to provide information on the progress made to date in conducting the three-year review of the operation of section 7A of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993.  In particular, I seek an outline of the progress made in providing the additional resources promised to support those seeking to exit prostitution and for research into the operation of section 7A.</p> <p>The Minister of State is well aware of the context for this question.  It is the passing into law in 2017 of Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, which created in section 7A of the 1993 Act a new offence of purchasing sexual services, thereby criminalising the buyers of sex, while also decriminalising individuals who sell sex.  The primary objective, as the Minister of State is well aware, was to tackle the demand that leads to sexual exploitation, predominantly of women and girls.  The context was the 2013 recommendation of the justice committee, which was chaired at the time by the Minister of State and on which I served, that a law be introduced here in line with the approach taken in Sweden and an increasing number of other countries worldwide which seek to tackle demand by criminalising the purchase of sex.  In Ireland, we had seen a long campaign by the civil society alliance, Turn Off the Red Light, TORL, to which more than 70 groups were affiliated.  The work of TORL fed into the committee's review but, as the Minister of State is aware, we also conducted extensive hearings.</p> <p>The legislation was commenced on 28 March 2017 and I understand the three-year review is thus due in March 2020.  There is some concern among civil society groups that worked with the Turn Off the Red Light campaign and are very supportive of the legislation about how the review required by section 25 of the 2017 Act will be rolled out.  My objective today is to get some clarification as to how it is proposed the review will be conducted and to ask the Minister of State to outline whether the promised additional resources will be provided to support those seeking to exit prostitution.  A review of the debates on this matter would show that even those who opposed the legislation supported the provision of resources to assist those who wish to exit prostitution.  There was an expectation that projects such as the Women's Health Project and groups working closely with those seeking to exit prostitution such as Ruhama would be given resources to assist them in their important work.  The Minister of State travelled with other members of the committee to Sweden on a fact-finding trip in 2012 when we saw the resources that are put in place in that country to support the implementation of its law.</p> <p>I am also keen to find out what progress has been made in resourcing research into the operation of section 7A.  We need to ensure the review will be evidence based and research will be done to provide facts on which the review will be based.</p> <p>I would also like resourcing to be provided for a public awareness programme on the legislation and its purpose.  The first conviction under Part 4 was reported on 21 January last.  One assumes the reporting of that conviction will have knock-on and deterrent effects.  We know from other research that knowledge that people are likely to be prosecuted acts as a deterrent and has a very welcome effect of suppressing demand.  We know also that implementing new criminal legislation creates challenges.  While the reporting of cases such as the conviction secured in recent weeks will have an important chilling effect, we are all conscious that resourcing must be put in place for specialist Garda units assigned to the work of targeting sex buyers and the organisers of prostitution who feed on demand.</p> <p>I have raised a number of different issues.  I know the Minister of State is personally concerned about this matter and I welcome his attendance in the House to respond.</p></speech>

It was 2012. </p><p>I remind the House of the provisions of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 that related to prostitution-related offences.  Part 4 of the Act provides for two new offences: paying for sexual activity with a prostitute and paying for sexual activity with a trafficked person, with the latter offence carrying a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both.  The Act removes those who offer their services as a prostitute from the existing offence of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution.  A key objective of Part 4 of the Act is to reduce demand for sexual services, as the Senator said.  As regards actions on the ground, I believe the message is getting out to those who purchase sex.</p><p>In recent months, a number of files have been sent to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, resulting in the much-published first conviction for the purchase of sex earlier this month.  Furthermore, the Department of Justice and Equality has advanced plans to conduct an awareness-raising initiative later this year relating to the offence of purchasing sex.</p><p>As regards supporting persons who wish to exit prostitution, comprehensive measures are already in place.  The Department of Justice and Equality provides annual funding to Ruhama to ensure that women who wish to exit prostitution receive the necessary support to develop the confidence and capacity to rebuild their lives.  This funding was increased in 2017 and again in 2018.  With regard to State support, the HSE's women's health service provides sexual health and outreach support for women affected by prostitution and trafficking for sexual exploitation.  The service comprises a free comprehensive sexual health service, including full sexual health testing, treatment and contraception.</p><p>The Act was enacted on 22 February 2017, and much of the Act, including the provisions I have described, were commenced on 27 March 2017.  Part 4 of the Act specifies that, not later than three years after its commencement, a report will be prepared on the number of arrests and convictions in respect of the new offences, as well as an assessment of the impact of the section on those who provide sexual services for payment.  Inputs to the report will come from a number of sources.  The first will be from the monitoring of investigations, arrests and convictions by the Garda National Protective Services Bureau.  Additional information will be provided by the HSE's women's health service and by civil society organisations working in this field.  Furthermore, this year the Department is funding a number of research projects that will measure the impact of the new legislation on the welfare of women engaged in prostitution, the outcomes of which will inform the report.  I hope that answers the Senator's points.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the plans of the Department of Justice and Equality to conduct an awareness-raising initiative.  It will have a large role to play in supporting the suppression of demand, as sought through the legislation.</p> <p>I welcome the announcement that the funding for Ruhama was increased in 2017 and in 2018.  I note the Minister of State does not refer to any additional resources being provided to the HSE women's health service.  I wonder whether resources to that important service will be increased also because the service does a great deal of work in supporting women and others involved in prostitution.</p> <p>I note the Minister of State's point about the report.  Section 27 of the Act states it shall include information on arrests, convictions and the impact of operation.  Is it possible, however, that other material might be in the report?  Could the Minister of State comment on that?  Could he give more detail on the research projects the Department of Justice and Equality will be funding to measure the impact of the new legislation on the welfare of women engaged in prostitution?  I would be interested to know the basis on which those resources are being allocated.</p></speech>

The Department of Justice and Equality is actively engaged in co-ordinating measures to reduce demand for the purchase of sexual services and in developing support strategies for persons seeking to exit prostitution.  I recognise the important role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the HSE, State agencies and the NGO sector play in supporting our national objectives in this regard.  These organisations also play a strong role in the national strategy against human trafficking, which has a strong sexual exploitation dimension.</p> <p>The Minister believes Part 4 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 has played an important role in this process, and he is committed to the delivery of a comprehensive review of its operation.  On behalf of the Minister, I assure the House that his Department will continue to support this important area through research, awareness-raising, NGO funding and co-ordination measures.  I do not have any information to hand on the HSE women's health service.  It is possibly best got from the Department of Health rather than the Department of Justice and Equality.</p> <p>As the plans and research come to hand, I will arrange for them to be communicated to the Senator.  There are other inputs.  I am aware the Senator has a personal interest in this matter and I will ensure she is kept informed in the best possible way as this develops.</p></speech>

I am sure he will agree with me that the crisis unfolding in Venezuela over recent weeks has shocked many people with news reports of people rooting through bins to feed their children, a crisis in the availability, as well as a lack of, basic medical care and supplies, along with inflation of 1 million %.  This is all in a country which has generated $320 billion in oil revenue in the past ten years.</p> <p>Last year&rsquo;s Venezuelan presidential election exposed and saw electoral fraud on a massive scale.  This has been roundly condemned by the European Union and all international observers.  We have seen serious human rights abuse reports with 8,000 extrajudicial killings in the past three years by the state security services, while thousands more have been detained without charge, trial or any due process.  Many Venezuelans have been stranded abroad during the crisis, including many in Ireland, because their worsening situation has meant that they are able unable to renew their travel documents.</p> <p>I would be grateful if the Minister could outline what steps the Government is taking about this serious situation, particularly in conjunction with the European Union, to bring about an end to this crisis and an improvement in the lives of ordinary people in Venezuela.  Is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade aware of Venezuelan citizens who may be stranded in Ireland and unable to return home?</p> <p>Will the Minister of State agree with me that some political parties and Members of the Oireachtas have not covered themselves in glory on this issue?  Many Members of this House spent much time raising human rights abuses in the context of the debate on the occupied territories Bill but have been curiously silent on this issue.  The Minister of State will be aware that two senior members of Sinn F&eacute;in, including its general secretary, attended Mr. Maduro&rsquo;s inauguration recently.  It was Sinn F&eacute;in's connected organisation, the IRA, which committed 1,800 extrajudicial killings on this island that are still not condemned outright.  In one way, we cannot be surprised that it has no objection to 8,000 extrajudicial killings committed by the Venezuelan regime.</p> <p>It is not just Sinn F&eacute;in of course.  Over the weekend, I heard Deputy Paul Murphy of the so-called Socialist Party say that the economic crisis in Venezuela was due to the fact that Mr. Maduro was not left wing enough.  Even our President has joined this bandwagon in the past, I am sorry to say.  He praised the former Venezuelan President, Hugo Ch&aacute;vez, for achieving "a great deal in his term in office, particularly in the area of social development and poverty reduction&rdquo;.  These policies are now the policies universally agreed to be the root cause of the current misery of the Venezuelan people.  I do not say this to be nit-picking but because it is a serious subject.  It highlights the bankrupt political ideology of many of the hard left.  It does not seem to matter how many people suffer or die, so long as their left-wing experiment is protected at all costs.</p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will agree with me that sentiments praising the Maduro regime do not represent the views of the Irish people.  The Government has moved on this issue by recognising of the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaid&oacute;.  Will the Minister of State endorse what two Venezuelan nationals living in Ireland, Kley Salinas and Liliana Fernandez, who said in an interview at the weekend that &ldquo;Your body is here in Ireland but your mind is in Venezuela&rdquo;, living in fear for those back home?  We have to have in mind these days and show concern for the hundreds of Venezuelan nationals who have come to Ireland to live happy and productive lives but who are in great pain about the plight of their home country.</p></speech>

This crisis continues to have a grave impact on the Venezuelan people.  It has resulted in mass migration, affecting countries in the region and overall regional stability.</p> <p>Particularly distressing is the human impact of the crisis.  The UN estimates over 3 million people, approximately one tenth of the entire Venezuelan population, have already left the country.  The acute humanitarian needs in the country are well known, particularly regarding shortages in access to medicine, significant increases in malaria, infant and maternal mortality, as well as acute malnutrition.</p> <p>On 10 January, President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro started a new mandate on the basis of non-democratic elections held in May 2018.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2253"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2253&amp;amp;pid=CiaranCannon&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland was not represented at the inauguration and fully supported the related declaration by the EU High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Ms Federica Mogherini, which urged President Maduro to release all political prisoners, to uphold the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms and to urgently address the needs of the population.</p><p>Ireland, alongside its EU partners, has repeatedly called on the Venezuelan Government to engage in dialogue with the opposition, respect the electoral calendar and fully restore the country's democratic institutions.  It is regrettable that the Venezuelan Government has not heeded these calls for fresh presidential elections in accordance with internationally recognised democratic standards and, indeed, the Venezuelan constitutional order.</p><p>Ireland fully supports the most recent EU 28 statement made by the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Ms Mogherini, on 26 January which reiterates that a peaceful and inclusive democratic solution is the only sustainable way out of the current crisis and reaffirms the full support of the EU to the democratically elected National Assembly.  It stated that if no announcement regarding fresh elections were to be made over the intervening days, the EU would take further actions, including regarding the issue of recognition of the country's leadership.  Ireland reaffirms its full support for the democratically elected National Assembly, the last remaining fully democratic institution in Venezuela, emphasising that its powers need to be restored and respected.  Ireland supports the call made by the President of the National Assembly, Mr. Juan Guaid&oacute;, for free, fair and democratic elections.</p><p>Ireland is committed to finding ways to foster shared democratic solutions that can bring political stability and address the pressing needs of the Venezuelan people, including by increasing EU humanitarian support.</p><p>A credible, meaningful dialogue leading to an inclusive democratic solution is the most effective way of achieving a peaceful and sustainable resolution of the current crisis in Venezuela.  Ireland also supports the remarks made by the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Ms Mogherini, following the informal meeting of EU foreign Ministers in Bucharest on 31 January, including regarding further EU actions to increase humanitarian support and to consider additional targeted sanctions.  Ms Mogherini also took the opportunity to announce the establishment by the EU of an international contact group for Venezuela.  Ireland, while not seeking membership, welcomes its establishment and believes that the international contact group will be a useful vehicle for facilitating dialogue and working towards a democratic solution.  I look forward to the report of the first meeting of that international contact group which is to be held in Montevideo this Thursday.</p><p>I welcome the high priority given to the issue by the EU and the regular consultations at the highest levels on developments on the ground.  Ireland remains in close contact with our EU partners to consider our next steps for a co-ordinated EU action.</p></speech>

I want to reiterate something I said in this House last week.  While I welcome the general thrust of the Government's approach to this issue, it would be good if we did not just wait for the EU line on these issues.  It is important we give strong moral leadership as a small country that has been known to do that in the past and is recognised and respected for its neutrality.  Other, larger countries have moved more quickly to make their positions on the matter clear and I would like to see Ireland taking a lead and not just waiting for the EU line.</p></speech>

Ireland is committed to finding ways to foster shared democratic solutions that can bring political stability and address the pressing needs of the Venezuelan people, including by increasing EU humanitarian support.</p> <p>We have always made the case, and we continue to do so, that a credible, meaningful dialogue leading to an inclusive democratic solution is the most effective way of achieving a peaceful and sustainable resolution of the current crisis in Venezuela.  Ireland supports urgent measures to address the humanitarian crisis and reiterates calls for humanitarian actors to be allowed to operate without interference to ensure that the utmost is done to mitigate against the grave effects of the crisis and alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people to the greatest extent possible.</p> <p>Ongoing engagement with our EU partners is critical in trying to effect the kind of change necessary within Venezuela in the most sustainable manner.  Our voice is amplified significantly by working in close concert with our EU partners and at the highest level on the issue.

I have been in north County Dublin for the last number of days knocking on doors and talking to people and this was the only matter they wished to talk about.  It is on everybody's lips.  It is outrageous that we are still not getting the full story and the Government's credibility has been shattered by this.  It is clear that its timelines are not adding up and we need to immediately know what happened.  It is not good enough for the current Minister for Finance or the Minister for Health to tell us what is going on, this concerns successive Ministers.  There are clearly some serious issues involved where costs were not tied down, the contract was not properly costed at the start, and there are clear governance issues at play here.  The stories are not adding up and people are getting very angry out there.  We need to know what is going on and we need to stop taking people for fools.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They want to know what is going on.  Nobody questions the need for this hospital.  We all know it needs to happen as soon as possible but we need to take control of the costs.  It is clear Fine Gael has mismanaged the largest capital project in the country but it has a history of mismanaging large capital projects, such as the fiasco with Irish Water and broadband roll out.  There is now more mismanagement of the public purse and people are sick of it.  They want to see their hard-earned taxes going to projects and not being wasted.  We are now spending half a million on a review of something that should not have happened in the first place.  We will apparently have this PwC report in March but we need to see the terms of reference of this report immediately and to get cross-House and cross-party agreement on them.  Fianna F&aacute;il wants the terms of reference to include identification of areas where savings can be made.  The project is ongoing and nobody is calling for it to be stopped but we need to identify areas within the project as it stands on which costs can be saved.</p><p>The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance need to publish where they will cut the capital expenditure in health over the coming years to finance the spiralling costs of the children's hospital.  Projects throughout the country will have to be cut back or cancelled.  Fine Gael is able to announce health projects but we want to see immediate announcements of what projects it will cancel because it could not manage the public purse.  Fine Gael likes to say that it has great prudence and can be trusted with the public purse.  Significant mismanagement has happened under Fine Gael in recent years and the public is outraged by it.  I want a proper and sincere debate in this House about the outrageous situation with the national children's hospital.</p></speech>

It is scandalous that these nurses have to be out there rather than doing what they are trained to do.  I look forward to joining them in the next couple of days.  I also wish to speak about the national children's hospital and the overrun there.  It is not just about the national children's hospital.  People are so angry because we have had it all before.  This is like Fianna F&aacute;il's personnel, payroll and related systems, PPARS, but much worse.  Other projects such as the national broadband plan, the Carillion debacle and the JobPath debacle have seen millions wasted by vested interests and because the proper procurement procedures are not in place.  It is time for the Minister to say exactly what he will do differently, because the buck stops with him, and how the procurement model will be changed.  We can no longer afford to continue with the same procurement model that has been used.</p> <p>I have raised the serious issues relating to JobPath since I entered the House, the money that is paid to companies involved and the impact on existing local schemes.  This is all connected to what is happening with the children's hospital.  Tonight, my party colleague, Deputy Brady, will table a motion in the D&aacute;il to immediately stop the referrals to this scheme.  Private companies have been made extremely wealthy by the multiple referrals they are given.  We have never seen the contracts that have been given to those private companies to see what deal was made.  Did people do their jobs properly?  Did the Minister properly oversee those contracts?  This scheme will cost almost &euro;100 million, if not more.  At the same time, the publicly funded local employment services could not buy a box of paperclips.  More than 11,000 unemployed, vulnerable people were forced back on to it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rose Conway-Walsh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2462"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2462&amp;amp;pid=RoseConwayWalsh&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They do the first round of JobPath and the private companies get paid for it.  They are then told to come back after a few months and are put through the rigours again.  There are further payments for that.</p><p>This has to stop.  There are 1,900 vacancies in the community employment sector.  Such vacancies which could offer jobseekers opportunities to take up locally-based and suitable employment that contributes to the community.  Figures from November show that out of 190,000 people referred at that stage, just 9% of those who went to these private companies had secured employment which was sustained for one year.  The cost to the taxpayer - the citizens of this country - is &euro;3,718 per person.  Providers also receive double payments where the same individuals are referred twice.</p><p>I want a full debate on JobPath.  I want the cover-up to stop.  A cover-up has been going on for years in respect of JobPath and there has been an absolute waste of money.  The money in question could be given to our nurses, who are out in the rain today picketing.</p></speech>

It is the product of a major body of work with academics, sexual health experts, teachers organisations, bodies representing students and school boards of management.  We have made a number of wide-ranging recommendations on curriculum reform that will now be delivered to the Minister for Education and Skills and fed into the review being carried out by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  Our recommendations have at all times been guided by best practice and domestic and international evidence, and motivated by wanting to see our young people happy, empowered and informed as they explore relationships and sexuality for the first time.  It has been over 20 years since the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum was last reviewed and we want to make sure our proposed reforms reflect the huge social and political changes in Ireland during that time, particularly the recent referendums on same-sex marriage and repeal of the eighth amendment.</p> <p>The report and its recommendations are detailed and comprehensive.  I would like to draw attention of the House to some key changes we have proposed.  We want relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and SPHE classes to start at a younger age in primary school and in a developmentally appropriate manner.  The use of outside providers is the most common way RSE is delivered to students at the moment and we want such providers regulated by the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.  We want teachers to be able to be specialised in RSE and we want RSE reform to be taught as part of a whole-school approach, with extra resources given to school principals and boards to support this.  In terms of the curriculum, we have recommended that LGBTQI education, consent, reproductive healthcare and pornography form part of any new curriculum.  We have also called for the amendment of the Education Act 1998 to remove ethos as a barrier to delivering objective and factual sex education.  This is a progressive report, proposing some big changes that will benefit students and young people.  I would like the Leader to organise a debate in the Seanad on the report in the near future.</p> <p>On a related note, I ask the Government for an update on the plans to fully commence the Data Protection Act 2018, including the provisions on the micro-targeting of children, which Senator Higgins and I worked to include in the legislation.</p></speech>

I join with others in calling on the Government to engage urgently with the INMO to address, in particular, the very valid concerns it has raised around recruitment and retention of nurses and around patient safety in hospitals because of under-staffing as a result of the difficulties with recruitment and retention.  As Deputies Howlin, Kelly and others have stated in the D&aacute;il, this engagement can be carried out within the framework of the public service stability agreement, PSSA, particularly in the context of the issues relating to recruitment and retention.  It is worth noting the Opposition has been calling for a general review of changes in work practices and of additional duties now being taken on by nurses, and that such a review should consider, therefore, the issues the INMO has been raising around the increased professionalisation of nursing.  I should add I have been contacted - as I am sure Senators Norris and Ruane have - by Trinity nursing graduates who point out to us the huge transformation that has occurred in recent years within the nursing profession, with the increased professionalisation of nursing and the awarding of degrees.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Furthermore, the huge expansion in postgraduate nursing studies has resulted in some incredible research coming out of third level institutions which has really changed the nature of the nursing profession.  The Government has been strangely detached on this matter and needs to engage with the INMO, otherwise we will just see more and more hardship for patients whose procedures will be delayed.</p><p>I also wish to raise concern about the children's hospital and the levels of awareness, in particular within the Government, of the cost overruns.  We need urgent clarification from the Government on this issue.  It raises the question down the road about the cost and the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a real elephant in the room.  We see the issue of the children's hospital and the difficulty bringing it forward in a responsible manner and in accordance with projected costs and then we look at the enormous cost potential of Sl&aacute;intecare, yet there is a very significant political buy-in to Sl&aacute;intecare and its proposals.  We ask the Leader for clarification from Government and the Minister for Health on this issue.</p><p>I also ask colleagues for support on the parental leave legislation, which we will bring forward in the Labour Party's Private Members' time tomorrow.  I thank all those colleagues who have assisted us in this regard.  My Labour Party colleagues and I, and Senator Norris in our Seanad Technical Group, are putting forward this Bill on Committee Stage.  We will table amendments and we hope colleagues will support the amendments, which are mostly technical, simply to ensure that the Bill will be straightforward and effective in implementation.  We hope the Government will not oppose the Bill on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader for an explanation of this, or perhaps the relevant Minister might come in and tell us about PwC.  I would like to have outlined to me what its expertise is, since the first thing it did was to telephone England and find some other organisation that might be able to research what has happened here for &euro;450,000.  I just question its expertise.  Why must it bring in someone from outside this island?  There is nothing wrong with doing so, but we could have done that ourselves.  That is the first thing.  I want an explanation.</p> <p>The second matter I wish to raise concerns the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan.  A very interesting thing happened on a certain road in Ireland recently.  Two semi-detached houses were up for sale at reasonable prices.  Families with two, three and four children came to view the houses and queued, but the houses were bought by Chinese people who were able not only to match the price but nearly to double it and pay in cash.  In this country Chinese businessmen are given residency and the possibility of national passports - there is nothing wrong with that - for investments, be they in research, property or other fields.  I would like some explanations about this.  There is nothing wrong with people buying houses if they have a legal right to do so, but I think this activity is pushing up prices here for all the wrong reasons.  I know of two or three instances of students living in the houses, which could be best bought by the Irish and be home to a family of five or six.  I just want an explanation on this, what is happening about it and how many properties have been bought this way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am talking about residential properties.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-02-05a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019020500002#R01500"><p>I ask the Leader to invite my fellow Ulster man, whom I am very happy to congratulate on his appointment, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, to the House to discuss the CAO applications process.  As everyone knows, the CAO is the mechanism by which we assess and allocate college places, based on a points system related to performances across academic subjects.  I want to make a specific proposal and I would like the Minister to come to the House to address it.  I am proposing that 80 points - that figure is open to negotiation - of the now 630 points are taken away, with 50 of them committed to involvement in social work and social action and the remaining 30 committed to sport and cultural activities, to be monitored and assessed by a subgroup of teachers in the pastoral care sector of the school and to be part of the assessment of the child.  This would create a social awareness in our young people.  It would create an interest in social action and social concern, which is a crucial in young people.  The cultural-sporting dimension would reward children for participation in school musicals, the county minor teams and so on so that their sporting and cultural lives would develop.  The question might be in some people's minds that this would compromise academia and reduce academic performance but the contrary is the case as it would bring social concern, social awareness and social commitment, plus sporting and cultural development, into academia.  Students would do a much better job and better understand their academic studies.  Whether studying the humanities, the social sciences or science in general, they would do so with a consciousness that is very important.  We need to have young people who understand their society and how it works.  I am effectively asking the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to begin the debate in this House - it should be in this House - on how the points system functions, what it assesses in young people, what type of young people it prioritises into courses and what we could do complement what is there.  I appeal to the Leader, who is an educationalist, to give this urgent priority.</p></speech>

I worked with a firm of architects in Roscommon on the design-supervision of the building of schools and churches.  We always knew the cost.  Additional costs arise, but nothing like in this case.  There are quantity surveyors, architects and engineers involved in this project.  It is amazing how inept Ministers are in this Government.

For example, at University Hospital Limerick we await 60 modular beds.  Two members of the Labour Party were quoted in the <i>Limerick Leader</i>yesterday saying that the project has not been signed off and is not going to happen, which is untrue because the capital plan has not been finally approved.  The Minister for Health yesterday and again today has given an assurance about the 60 modular beds because there has been a lot of scaremongering.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance also refused to meet the union and the Estimates were drawn up without including these awards, which were made under the PSSA.

All the secondary schools in County Cavan have completed the programme, with 27 teachers across the county now qualified to teach CPR.  The schools in County Monaghan are not far behind, with 83 secondary schools currently engaged on the programme.  The Irish Heart Foundation, which I congratulate on its initiative, hopes to roll out the CPR 4 Schools programme to all secondary schools in the country.  It is a very ambitious plan to save lives.  Schools in counties Monaghan and Cavan are leading the way and I compliment them for that.</p> <p>It should be noted that there are 5,000 cardiac arrests each year in this country.  A person qualified in CPR being close by when a person suffers a heart attack could be the difference between life and death.  In any given year, there are approximately 365,000 students in our secondary schools and there is the potential for all of those students to become competent in CPR, which could save lives.</p> <p>While I commend the teachers and students for their passion and initiative, the programme shines a light on the Department of Education and Skills which is not doing its job in regard to CPR and first aid in general.  That was one of the main reasons that I introduced the First Aid and Mental Health in Schools (Existing Teachers) Bill 2018 and the First Aid and Mental Health in Schools (Initial Teacher Training) Bill 2018 a couple of weeks ago which, thankfully, received the unanimous support of all Senators.  I thank them for that support.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, needs to take the lead  and ensure that our students and teachers are fully qualified in first aid.  They can be taught nothing more important than how to save a life.</p></speech>

It is made even more deceptive by a letter suggesting doctors could face legal action for &quot;assaulting&quot; women unless that GP had recorded evidence that the woman consented to a termination of pregnancy.  This cohort of activists uses such names as The Women's Centre, Good Counsel Network Ireland and Ultrasound Services WCN for the purposes of sounding legitimate.  The bogus clinic previously came to our attention when an undercover video was posted of a woman receiving untruthful, unscientific advice, which was used to prevent her getting an abortion, such as suggesting an abortion could cause cancer or that women who have abortions are vulnerable to committing child abuse.<br/><br/>Let us be under no illusions.  Those who wish to deceive doctors and shame vulnerable women are not justified in what they are doing.  We have had national conversations about this and have had referenda on the subject.  The public has given its answer as to whether abortion services should be available to women.  We have had enough stories of shame and stigma and those who wish to return to that by protesting, offering GP services or posting confidential doctor and patient information online should reconsider their actions.  Given that legislation has now been passed, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, to come to this House to discuss how we can best protect women in vulnerable situations.</p></speech>

I appreciate the work he and his office have done on this issue but unfortunately, at this stage the Minister still has not indicated when he will attend the House.  I have been patient on the issue but I feel I have no alternative to moving an amendment to the Order of Business tomorrow to call for the Minister for Health to attend to discuss the HSE plan for 2019 and the issue of not providing additional supports and services to families with members suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's.  I do this reluctantly and I hope the Leader will be able to contact me in the morning to indicate when the Minister will attend.  If he does so, I will give a commitment not to try to amend the Order of Business.</p></speech>

As Senators will know, they are out in protest.  This is the first of two days that nurses will be on strike this week and next week they will be joined by the Psychiatric Nurses Association for three days on strike.  Almost 50,000 nurses are protesting on the picket lines.  It did not dawn on us initially this morning but as we looked around, we saw hundreds of nurses protesting on one side, while on the other side, we saw a massive crater in the ground where our national children&rsquo;s hospital is to be built.  The irony of this juxtaposition of these two sights was not lost on us.</p> <p>Nurses are demanding &euro;250 million to achieve pay parity.  Every year, &euro;120 million is spent on agency nurses alone.  Someone has not done the maths on those figures and they have certainly not done the maths on the national children&rsquo;s hospital, the cost of which could run to &euro;2 billion.  The public cannot get to grips with that.  Where were the checks in the procurement process?  Who was looking after the public purse when it was being robbed and dipped into?  The irony of that is not lost on nurses or members of the public.  I support my colleague, even though the confidence and supply agreement needs an injection.  What other capital projects will we lose because of this massive cost overrun?  I advise Senator Colm Burke that no amount of spin about how beautiful this hospital will be will create a soft landing for people given that the cost will run to &euro;2 billion?</p></speech>

Today is Safer Internet Day, among many other days.  Almost one year ago, Senator Ruane and I successfully introduced an amendment to the Data Protection Bill, now the Data Protection Act, to prohibit the profiling of children under the age of 18 and the use of such profiles for commercial purposes.  I ask the Leader for an update on when the Minister plans to commence that aspect of the legislation.  It is no longer a proposed amendment.  I understand Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan put forward a variation of the proposal in the D&aacute;il.  Will the Minister commence that aspect of the legislation which protects children under the age of 18 from commercial targeting, fast-track the alternative version put forward by Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan or take action of his own volition?  It is not satisfactory that almost a year after the legislation was passed, we have not taken steps to protect younger people, which is vital, and ensure they are not targeted in a shocking way based on their vulnerabilities or insecurities.  We hear much rhetoric-----</p></speech>

We were told at that stage that the cost of the hospital would be &euro;450 million and that the sale of the national lottery licence would go more than half way towards providing funding for this much-needed facility.</p></speech>

Following what was stated at a committee meeting last week, it appears that the final figure could be more than &euro;2 billion.  Senator Colm Burke pointed out the various stages of planning the hospital went through.  The reality is that the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding the Mater Hospital site could have been appealed but it was not and that was as a result of political reasons.</p></speech>

Irrespective of one's views on PwC, it has been asked to do a piece of work on which it will report back to Government, and the Senator might be cynical, throw her eyes to Heaven and do all that; that is fine.  The comments by some people inside and outside this House lend themselves to scaremongering and hysteria.  We had that in the House earlier in terms of projects in other parts of the country.  Third, Senator Colm Burke gave a very good overview of where we are now and how we got to the point of development of the project.  I chaired the Joint Committee on Health and we were on the site on a number of occasions.  When I hear members of the opposition, in particular Fianna F&aacute;il, talking about the national children's hospital I have to cast my mind back to when Bertie Ahern was Taoiseach.  He wanted to have it located in his constituency but An Bord Plean&aacute;la overruled that.  I say to Senator Wilson that the only place one can go after that is to the Supreme Court.</p></speech>

I will make the same point I made last week and the whole time.  All of us value, respect and admire the work being done in our hospitals and healthcare system by our nurses.  Not one person I know of wants to see any person, be it a nurse, teacher, porter or bus driver, on strike.  Today there is a pathway to reopen the talks between all sides.  I hope those concerned can re-engage and have meaningful dialogue.

The Government, as the Taoiseach and Minister for Health have outlined, is open to meeting.  I invite and encourage all concerned to sit around the table and engage.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of JobPath.  It is worth noting that there are 41,000 people employed full time and 5,000 part time.  The level of complaint concerning JobPath is around 0.41%.  If the acknowledged costs are what the Senator says they are, work needs to be done on it.  If what she is saying is correct, it beggars belief.  I am not sure it is correct.</p> <p>I join Senators Ruane and Higgins in referring to Internet Safety Day and the report last week on sex education.  I commend all involved in the Oireachtas education committee.  It is important that our curriculum be reformed regarding the development of sex education for young people.  I hope we can continue the ongoing work.  To be fair, it was initiated by Mr. Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and continued by the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the current Minister, Deputy McHugh.  I hope the development can happen.</p> <p>With regard to the Data Protection Act, I do not have a commencement date for Senators Higgins and Ruane but I am sure we can liaise with the Department on that issue.</p> <p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill.

We had the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government in the House last week for a housing debate.  He will be in today to conclude his remarks.  My advice to the Senator on the point she raised on housing is to put a Commencement matter before the House.</p> <p>On the Assisted Human Reproduction Bill, my information is that the heads were approved on 3 October.   The Senator raised the issue last week and I share her views.  There was pre-legislative scrutiny on 19 December and 17 January and it is continuing.  Work is being done on this Bill that is not as easy as it first appeared.  That is the information I have but I will endeavour to obtain more for the Senator.</p> <p>With regard to Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationships Act, the work is still ongoing.  It will be commenced as soon as possible.  All of us share the views expressed by the Senator regarding both matters.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator O'Reilly made one of the best contributions to the Order of Business today when he spoke about reform of the Central Applications Office, CAO, process.  There is complete merit in what he suggested in this regard.  Having spent 20 years myself in the classroom, I saw the benefit of a non-traditional leaving certificate pathway for young people to college.  I know of some young people who have done the leaving certificate applied and gone to college through it.  Senator O'Reilly's idea about the allocation of points for social work and social action, as well as sporting and cultural participation, is done in other jurisdictions and has its merits.  It deserves to be heard and debated.  I commend Senator O'Reilly on that.</p><p>We will endeavour to find time for a debate on the Shane O'Farrell case.

It is an important issue, which needs to be addressed urgently.  We have seen defibrillators put in place in rural and urban settings.  We need to set up a process whereby we can train more people, especially young people, in CPR.  I commend all involved.</p><p>Senator Warfield raised the issue in <i>The Times</i>, Ireland edition, about anti-abortion protests.  It is important we have a respectful implementation of the new law of the land.  That requires respect for different viewpoints.  It is disappointing that the types of activity referred to are being carried out.  I know there is a debate during the week in the Oireachtas on these types of protest.  I do not believe anybody should be allowed to protest at a maternity hospital or a doctor&rsquo;s surgery.  The dignity and privacy of citizens going about their business, for whatever reason, should be respected.  Women who might be in a difficult or vulnerable position should not have to endure such barrages of protest.  I will try to have the Minister to come to the House on that matter.</p><p>As I said last week, I thank Senator Humphreys for his patience concerning his requests for the Minister for Health to attend the House on the question of Alzheimer's disease and dementia.  I also apologise to him.  He has been exceptionally fair about this matter.  We have endeavoured to have a debate on the matter in question.  I hope the Minister met with the Senator.  I will endeavour to have a date for such a debate tomorrow.

I had time in my initial response to respond to some of the questions asked and made a note of ones that were not answered, so I will work backwards through the Senators in the order in which they asked questions to make sure I get to everyone in the time available.</p> <p>Senator Mullen asked about statistics and the difference between Government statistics and other statistics.  It is very important to say that for many of the things we count or many of the different pieces of information we put out, we are gathering statistics from local authorities or other areas and compiling them for publication.  That is done at official level.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Figures for emergency accommodation every month come from the different regions which themselves collect the information from local authorities.  The Dublin Regional Homeless Executive is involved in compiling them.  We have said that that data collection needs to be improved because it is not capturing enough information.  When the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive did a deeper dive last year and produced a report over two quarters, it was able to tell us a lot more information.  It is the type of information that we should always be gathering so that work to capture more data for those monthly reports is now happening.</p><p>Senator Mullen asked about a particular Dublin City Council site and housing body.  He said there had been a delay.  I am not sure of the specific site.  The Senator can provide me with information.  We have a delivery office in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government so that where there are delays and snags or problems that require people to sensibly put their heads together, it does that.  As we all know, things can sometimes crop up which can lead to long delays if they are not resolved quickly.  The housing delivery office is there to work with the local authorities.  I have asked colleagues in this House and elected representatives in local authorities to bring areas where they think there are unnecessary delays directly to my attention so that I can chase them up in the Custom House.</p><p>Senator Mullen also asked about voids.  He mentioned 4,000 voids.  We have remediated 8,000 to 9,000 vacant social housing homes that were empty and needed significant repair over the last four to five years.  We are coming towards the end of that programme.  These are social housing homes that were vacant and required as much as &euro;30,000 in investment to get them back into use and letting.  I hope we will have the numbers for 2018 next week.  We will see that approximately 500 to 600 voids have been remediated over the course of 2018.  We would have done much more than that but we agreed that we would not count above what was in the targeted amount.  A lot is happening in that area.</p><p>I am supportive of pre-fabrication, modular and rapid technologies.  It is also important that as we bring in new housing, we have to bring in all of the facilities required.  While there are efficiencies and gains to be made with these new technologies, one still needs to go through planning and procurement, and to put in footpaths, electricity and water.  We want to and are doing it, as is the private sector but it has other time and investment requirements that traditional housebuilding also has.</p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell made a point about recognising that a Government that is led by Fine Gael, Independents and the Independent Alliance is building social housing homes, as have previous Governments.  People hark back to different times in Irish history where it is assumed that we were building more social housing homes.  While that might be correct for individual years, I read an interesting piece by Karl Dieter over the weekend in which he wrote about the 1950s being the most successful decade for the building of social housing in the State's history.  The average output per year in the 1950s was 6,000 social housing homes.  We will build more than that this year.  We have brought that responsibility back to the heart of Government and local authorities.  Delivery is ramping up and I will have confirmation of the 2018 figures next week, I hope.  They will show that, at the moment, one in four to one in five of new homes built in the country is a social housing home.  That has not happened for a long time and it is welcome.</p><p>Senator Kieran O'Donnell was also right to talk about how we need to make sure that we build mixed tenure estates.  We want our housing policy to help to build, unite and support communities rather than dividing them.  That means having mixed tenure, whether in apartment or housing developments.  He also asked about whether empirical work had been done on the viability of house-building.  It has been done with regard to the building of semi-detached or terraced homes and apartments.  When doing these viability reports, one builds in margins in certain areas as contingencies against risk.  There has to be a profit margin because it has to be affordable for the builder to develop it.  Depending on the project itself, there will be a greater or lesser gain depending on how risk was programmed into different elements of the build.  It is also true that land costs could be a significant contributory factor.  Land costs in the State plummeted after the financial collapse but began to rapidly increase again from 2015 onwards.  It will depend on when many builders bought the land.</p><p>The Rebuilding Ireland home loan has been a success.  We have seen that in the level of drawdowns.  It has been operating for almost a year and as of December, approximately half of the allocation for three years has been drawn down.  That has been successful.  Senator O'Donnell made a point about some local authorities building in the wrong locations and that there was inadequate due diligence.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eoghan Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2288"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2288&amp;amp;pid=EoghanMurphy&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=05"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If that is the case and if he has examples of that, it is difficult to square it with people stating that we need to cut red tape in the Custom House and strip out some of the oversight that exists.  The Senator makes an important point.  However, we in government and as Members of the Oireachtas have to make sure that, as we rebuild our housing sector and get local authorities back into building, we build the right homes in the right places and that we do not relax things so much that we end up making mistakes like we did in the past, leading to ghost housing estates or developments like Priory Hall in the future.  While we have cut red tape and streamlined things in the Department, and we are looking to make a few more changes in that area, we have to be careful that we do not go too far.</p><p>Senator Norris described the role of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government as a poisoned chalice.  I do not agree.  Of course, it is a challenge.  It is perhaps the most important domestic challenge we face but it is one we can resolve and are resolving.  Within the plans we have, some things will work well initially and others will not and will need to be reformed and monitored to see that they are working.  Overall, at a high level, when we look at what we are trying to achieve, which is basically to increase the supply of homes as quickly and sustainably as possible.  That is happening..  Even in the supplements of the newspapers, we can see that it is happening.  Of course, we need to do more but the fundamental supply problem is being corrected and we need to drive that further.</p><p>Senator Norris is correct to state that this cannot be solved overnight.  When we are talking about building any house or housing scheme, it will take a time to move from the initial idea to planning, design, procurement, building and occupancy.  We are not just talking about a few schemes but about thousands upon thousands of new homes.  We are also talking about rebuilding those elements of the housing system that had been broken, whether in regard to the skilled labourers who are needed, the architects whose profession got hammered or those who had emigrated.  In addition, we did not initially have the finances and they had to be restored.  New procurement and planning procedures have been put in place, including the fast-track process.  We are doing all of those things and increasing our resources in each part of the housing sector while at the same time starting to build.  It is happening now but it takes time.</p><p>I also agree with Senator Norris that we cannot return to the sprawling housing estates of three-bedroom semi-detached homes.  Let us take the example of Crumlin, a great area and a very desirable location but the density is far too low in terms of what should have been built there.  Good planning should take advantage of the infrastructure that is there in the city and also have regard to issues such as climate change and the environment that are very important for us and for future generations.  We have to make sure we do not make those kinds of density mistakes into the future.  When we talk about building now, we must look for infill development or increasing densities where we can, particularly around transport corridors, and that means more apartment building.</p><p>Senator Norris also referred to the numbers in emergency accommodation and to the massaging of the figures.  I have to disagree with that absolutely.  We are talking about people in emergency accommodation.  What was discovered by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive when it was doing its work in conjunction with my Department was that some people had been categorised as being in emergency accommodation when they were not.  These are people who had been in their own homes and who had been at risk of going into emergency accommodation but, because of the financial support they received from local authorities, they never had to leave their own home, never presented for emergency accommodation and never became homeless, yet were counted as being in emergency accommodation.  That miscategorisation issue was accepted by the Oireachtas when we discussed it at the Oireachtas committee, although some have since gone back on that for political reasons.</p><p>It is very important that we understand who is in emergency accommodation, not just because of the numbers involved but because we need to know why they are in emergency accommodation and how we get them out of emergency accommodation in a sustainable way.  That is where the Department and the local authorities are focused, namely, on understanding who is there and how we help them out of emergency accommodation into sustainable homes.  It is very important that we can do this work and that we have an accurate understanding of the enormous scale of the challenge.  We will continue to work with local authorities to address all of the issues we can but, of course, concomitant with that is the delivery of new homes, which is happening, and, in addition, the delivery of a family hub programme where we can have safe, secure supports for families until we get them into their new homes.  The figures show that, on average, families are spending less than six months in family hubs, which is very important for those families.</p><p>Senator Buttimer was right to refer to focusing on affordability.  It is incredibly important that the State is directly involved in building social housing homes but it must be noted that the majority of people do not qualify for social housing.</p></speech>
