    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#C00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte.  I look forward to working with her in her new portfolio.  It is great to see a woman from the west because she will be well aware of the Commencement matter I will raise today.  It relates to Portiuncula University Hospital, in Ballinasloe, and investment under the HSE capital plan for 2021 and also the HSE winter plan for 2020.  As the Minister of State would know very well, Portiuncula is a level 3, 24-7 hospital.  It operates 365 days a year.  It never stops.  It handles casualty, maternity and surgical services and is part of the Saolta network.  It is one of the seven hospitals that are part of the network in the west and we so need our hospitals in the west to be hospitals fit for the 21st century.</p> <p>What surprised me when I was involved in fighting for the 50-bed unit last year was that the hospital handles a catchment area of more than 500,000 people.  It is amazing.  It covers five counties including east Galway, Roscommon, parts of Westmeath, Offaly, north Tipperary and, as the Minister of State would know, Portumna.  It even covers Athlone, with a population of more than 21,000 people.  If one lives in Athlone one was more than likely born in Portiuncula hospital.</p> <p>For people in Ballinasloe, the hospital is an integral part of our identity and a vital service.  Close to 800 people work in the hospital.  We have excellent healthcare teams.  We recently won funding awards with Sl&aacute;intecare.  However, the hospital infrastructure dates back to the 1940s.  There is a dire lack of shower and toilet facilities and for an area of 400,000 people, Portiuncula hospital has only 13 single rooms.  I am not talking about ICU beds; I am talking about single rooms to keep people safe from infection.  It is made up of six- and eight-bed wards.  In the face of this crisis, a special ward was designated for Covid-19 patients within the hospital.  The general manager and the teams in the hospital have taken the initiative.  They have moved the outpatient department to a modular unit in the car park.  They have funding for that modular unit but funds are now required for the next step to develop the outpatients unit into 13 en suite single rooms.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Can the Minister confirm that sufficient funds are listed in the HSE 2021 capital plan for the redesign and repurposing of the outpatients&rsquo; area in Portiuncula hospital as a matter of urgency?  We need those 13 rooms now and even if the work is started in January it will be February before it will be set up.  When I was a county councillor in 2019, the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and I were at a meeting here with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and commitments were given on the 50-bed unit.  A 50-single-bed unit was committed to and the enabling works have started.  The investment for that is crucial for the hospital to ensure adequate facilities.  These are just single rooms to avoid basic overcrowding, infection and to ensure that there is dignity for end-of-life for patients.  As I mentioned we need a hospital that is fit for the 21st century.</p><p>Can the Minister confirm if follow-on funding is available for stage two construction of this 50-bed single unit and if the tender process is to commence in January, with HSE estates?  We looked for and were given a date last year with a construction start date of July 2021.  </p><p>Finally, the CT scanner is not currently fully operational in the hospital. The Minister of State may be aware of this.  It is due for equipment replacement in 2022.  Can the Minister of State consider within the Department of Health if a replacement CT scanner could be an urgent request for the 2021 equipment budget to allow for early diagnosis and to assist teams handling of waiting lists?  </p><p>I thank the Minister of State for her time.  I know that of all Ministers, and being a woman from the west, she is aware of the crucial importance of that hospital and of the lack of investment over the past number of decades.  I look forward to hearing more from the Minister of State now about the great budget we have achieved with an extra &euro;4 billion, and the commitment to bed capacity.</p></speech>

It is my first opportunity in a public session to congratulate her on her appointment as a Minister of State and, equally, to thank her for her work in the recent budget in securing &euro;100 million for disability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#D00300"><p>I thank Senator Dolan for placing this matter today.  Before I go to the script it gives me great pleasure to discuss Portiuncula Hospital given that my youngest child was born there.  It is 24 miles down the road from me so I know it intimately.  Many of my constituents work in Portiuncula Hospital and it is embedded in the fabric not just of Ballinasloe but in the wider spread of the area.  It provides a great service.  I will read the script and then I will focus on the two main questions the Senator has asked.</p> <p>Portiuncula hospital, Ballinasloe is one our acute general and maternity hospitals that delivers a patient-centred, quality-driven focused service and provides a wide range of diagnostic and support services. The hospital catchment area, as the Senator has referred, includes east Galway, Roscommon, the midlands and the mid-western areas.   </p> <p>The construction of the 50-bed ward block is an important project for this hospital.  A contractor was appointed for the enabling works commenced on the 11 August 2020 and due for completion by 25 May 2021.  It intended to advertise for contractors for construction of the 50-bed ward block in the second quarter of 2020.  That should be about to progress as we speak now.  This is with a view to commencing works on-site in mid-2021, subject to the availability of funding.  This project is on the capital plan and the Senator was given commitments by the previous Minister.  I have been speaking to the current Minister on this project and it is a focus to keep this project live and to ensure there is funding following for it.</p> <p>As the Senator knows this winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the Government's determination to meet the challenge is demonstrated by its decision to invest the additional &euro;600 million in the health services this winter: &euro;200 million in 2020 ands &euro;400 million in 2021, to support the roll-out of the winter-specific measures.</p> <p>For Portiuncula Hospital, it is proposed to provide the additional space addressed by the Senator with a prefab-modular building for segregation which will provide an immediate solution for emergency department streaming for winter 2020 at the hospital.  The modular building proposed will facilitate 14 temporary Covid-19 emergency department and minor injuries treatment and assessment rooms with associated support facilities.  The unit will also have a residual value for the displacement of outpatient accommodation after the Covid-19 emergency.  It states here that it is expected that the building will be ready for occupation by March 2021 but I have a slight concern that it will be ready for occupation by that date because that is at the end of our winter period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The staff and management of Portiuncula University Hospital would like to have a commitment that they could actually start.  We all know that the accident and emergency department in the hospital is head-to-toe when it gets really busy.  Due to Covid and social distancing it does not have the facility, hence the request that it needs to be prioritised.  Other hospitals around the country are in the same position.  That is the nature of the question.</p><p>I have spoken to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, about the matter and I am trying to get it prioritised.  Deputy Denis Naughten has also raised this issue.  It is an issue of priority for constituents in the area.  The staff and patients are at risk.  The demographics of the area usually show that there is an older population.  There is a fear on the part of GPs in terms of referring people to the hospital because it does not have adequate space for their patients.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  It is great to hear that commitment.  The commitment to Portiuncula University Hospital and the Saolta group mean that our healthcare teams in the west will be able to cope when faced with the worst public health crisis ever.  It means that patients in our hospital will receive the care that they deserve.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to accelerate the project if at all possible.  We need it now.  As far as I know, the modular unit is up and running.  Funding was received for that and the hospital authorities moved things out of the outpatient unit.  If we could get a move on that quickly the beds would be available.  There could be single rooms to handle isolation.  The hospital is dealing with infectious patients, be they potential Covid cases or the normal flu, and there is no place to isolate them. </p> <p>I appreciate the commitment of the Minister of State on this.  As she will be aware, all public representatives very much support the hospital and hope that, at a national level, the HSE will give that commitment as soon as possible to the Saolta healthcare group.  I appreciate the time of the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#E00300"><p>I thank Senator Dolan.  I did not answer the question on the CT scanner.  The HSE advised that the replacement of the CT scanner in Portiuncula is scheduled for 2021 or 2022, through the HSE equipment replacement programme.  Priority for replacement is based on risk categorisation covering age dependability and service history, with capacity for replacement depending on availability of funding.</p> <p>If there is an issue in anything I have said that could support the management of the hospital in terms of risk categorisation, perhaps it can be reviewed.  The Senator should be assured from the Department and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that we want to work with all local public and elected representatives to ensure that the 14-bed modular unit and isolation rooms are made available, not just for isolation but the protection of everybody coming into the hospital.  I look forward to working with the Senator on that.</p></speech>

I am raising the issue of St. John of God Community Services in response to a letter I received from Councillor Paddy McQuillan in Louth County Council.  He is involved with the service and is a local representative.  He circulated to me a letter he received from the chief executive, as did all of the staff and their colleagues, a copy of which I have passed to the Minister of State, dated 30 September 2020.</p> <p>The substance of this correspondence is that the St. John of God Community Services is to end its involvement in disability and mental health services and transfer all of that responsibility to the HSE.  St. John of God services stated that the reason this is happening is because there is an issue with funding.  There is a funding crisis that cannot be sustained, in its view.  Services have been subsidised by it from other resources, both its personal resources and those of the order which were never collected or intended to be used to subsidise the community services they operate. </p> <p>As we know, St. John of God provides services for more than 8,000 children, adolescents and adults with intellectual disabilities across Dublin, Kildare, Kerry, Wicklow, Meath and Louth.  It employs 3,000 staff and has volunteers in excess of that number.  It has 300 locations.  More than 2,500 people in receipt of day, residential and respite services will be affected.  This is really critical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The order has told me that there is a &euro;27 million annual funding gap and an accumulated deficit of &euro;27.7 million.  These are staggering figures.  I have spoken to the chief executive of St. John of God Community Services yesterday, Claire Dempsey.  I updated myself.  I was convinced by my short conversation that there was a genuine willingness on the part of the organisation and the brothers to engage with the Minister of State and the HSE to get a resolution.  The Hospitaller Order of St. John of God has a strong track record while having diminishing religious vocations.  The order has a rich legacy that has served the State exceptionally well in a wide variety of supports and services.</p><p>My concern is firstly for the clients and service users.  I am also concerned for the employees who work in these services throughout the country as well as their families and the families of the service users.  This is critical.</p><p>Funding is an issue and it has to be resolved.  It is not a question of a blame game with the HSE versus the Department of Health versus the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God.  It is simply that there has to be a sustainable agreement to ensure these services are provided.</p><p>There is also an impact because we know the Government policy with regard to congregated settings and breaking up large institutions.  We have had enough talk about institutions in recent days to keep us going for years.  There are new models and policies of care but they do not come cheap.</p><p>There are difficulties and they need to be bridged.  I appeal to the Minister of State for her response.  People really need to know what is going on, whether we can get these talks back on track and whether we can get an arrangement whereby St. John of God Community Services will consider options with the Minister of State in a constructive way on how to fund these essential services.  This is not for the order, the Minister of State or the HSE but for the people who avail of these important care services.</p></speech>

It gives me the opportunity to bring the Senator through my engagement since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for disability matters.</p> <p>Before I continue, I wish to say this is not a blame game.  I could not agree more with Senator Boyhan on that.  This is about the service users, their families, the employees and delivering services to the most vulnerable in our society who require these services.</p> <p>While St. John of God Community Services is in this particular situation regarding funding, we know the disability sector was underfunded for many years.  We also know that we have a sustainability issue within the disability sector, where service providers provide a great deal of care.  They are not unique in this regard.  When we talk to the service providers or anyone within the HSE or the Department, that is exactly what we hear.  It is the clear message coming out.</p> <p>St. John of God Community Services currently provide services to over 2,400 children and adults with intellectual disabilities in community healthcare organisation areas 4,6, 7 and 8.  They also provide mental health services and supports to over 5,600 children, adolescents and adults in CHO areas 6 and 7.  The HSE has worked closely with the St. John of God organisation over several years to support it in its role and assist it in addressing the financial and governance challenges.</p> <p>Against this background I held a meeting on 24 September 2020 with representatives of St. John of God which included Department of Health and HSE officials.  I outlined my position and plans for the disability sector and encouraged St. John of God to engage with the HSE and address the issues facing the organisation.  Nevertheless, following a board meeting of the organisation on the same day, St. John of God formally served the HSE with 12 months' notice of its intention to terminate the provision of services under its section 38 arrangement with the HSE, with a view to transferring responsibility for delivering disability and mental health services to the State by October 2021.</p> <p>I am keenly aware that the decision of St. John of God may cause anxiety for many of the service users concerned and their families as well as the staff working in the organisation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, I assure them that there are processes in place to ensure continuity of service provision, which are underpinned by service arrangements between the HSE and St. John of God.  St. John of God will continue to be responsible for providing disability and mental health services over the next 12 months.  During this period, the HSE will work with St. John of God to put in place suitable arrangements to transfer provision of these services to another appropriate organisation. </p><p>St. John of God is required to continue providing services from the effective date of termination or expiry of the 12-month notice period until such time as any new service arrangements become effective.  If the 12-month notice period ends and the transfer of services has not yet been finalised, St. John of God is obliged to continue providing the services for up to another six months to allow the transfer to be completed.  In effect, the whole process could take up to 18 months.  I understand that the HSE also purchases some mental health services from St. John of God on a private basis, which are not governed by the section 38 service arrangement.  The HSE is already making provision for community mental health services in Loughlinstown and D&uacute;n Laoghaire primary care centres.</p><p>The primary concern of this Government is to ensure the continuity of the vital services provided by St. John of God in the interests of service users, families and staff.</p></speech>

These are difficult times for all of us in terms of our physical and mental well-being.  They are particularly difficult for people with disabilities and the type of people being supported by the St. John of God Community Services.  I am encouraged by what the Minister of State said.  I will write to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, today to ask him if we can see a speeding up of the engagement.  We have a timeframe which the Minister of State outlined but it ticks away quite quickly.  These are complex issues and big issues in terms of finance.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State's comprehensive and frank layout of what is at stake and I encourage all sides to engage early to ultimately create a better service for users, employees and the communities in which they operate.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and recognise his concerns.  It is the first time I have been given the opportunity to put on the record my engagement with St. John of God and my plea to it on that day to not serve notice on us, to work with me, as a Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, and to give me the opportunity to understand their concerns and to work with the HSE and the Department.  It was its prerogative on that day to take the decision it took.  I regret it and I do not wish any anxiety or stress to be placed on service users, their families or staff.  Over the coming months I will ensure that nobody is left languishing and waiting for answers or responses.  Everyone will be left clear and communication will be crystal clear.  I will work with the HSE and the Department to ensure there is communication and service users understand exactly what is going on.</p></speech>

It is the first time I have had the chance to publicly congratulate her on her appointment as Minister of State.  I have no doubt that with her work ethic and compassion, she will make a big difference to the lives of people with a disability.  I also want to say well done to the Minister of State on securing a significant disability budget, the highest in the history of the State, in budget 2021.  Now we have to make sure that makes a difference on the ground to the people who matter because it is about implementation and improving lives.</p> <p>I will talk about the issue of children with disabilities, particularly in Kildare.  I was contacted at the beginning of this month by a mother, Samantha Kenny, about her daughter, Ava, who I had dealt with before.  She was distraught to receive a letter saying that three therapists and one part-time therapist would be taken away from the network disability team, NDT, in Kildare in order to deal with early assessments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all know how important early assessments are but it should not be a competition between assessments and early intervention.  Since I spoke about this issue I have been contacted by a number of parents in Kildare.  It is not a lie to say they are absolutely distraught.  It has been months since March, when their therapists were taken away from them to do contact tracing.  In that time, these children did not have the opportunity to be in school so they further regressed.  Now, when things had been getting back to some level of normality, the fact these vital services will be removed again is simply shocking.</p><p>I understand that therapists, by which I mean physiotherapists, speech therapists and occupational therapists, are being taken away to work on contact tracing.  We all know how important contact tracing is during this crisis but to create a backlog of dire situations and consequences for children is absolutely not the way to do it.  All of the research on children with disabilities shows the importance of community-based early intervention and the importance of interdisciplinary team work.  The fact that Ava and her peers are not getting this at present in Kildare is absolutely wrong.  We cannot allow this situation to go on.</p><p>We are not speaking about luxuries.  We are speaking about a passport to life for these children.  We are talking about a situation where children are being denied access to speech therapy to help their communication.  The right to be able to communicate is a basic human right.  It is something that all of us in the Chamber take for granted.  Not having a system in place whereby we ensure children have the right to communicate is absolutely wrong.</p><p>We all know that early intervention as well as assessment is key to ensuring children with disabilities can live the best lives they can and can take their places within the community and society.  It is absolutely wrong that after assessments are carried out, there is no programme of supports and services to enable these children and support their families.  What is happening is completely and utterly unacceptable and I hope the Minister of State can put this right.</p></speech>

I want to go back to the question she submitted, which was on redeployment to address assessments of need.  We are speaking about speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physical therapists.  This is the question the Senator laid before me to address today.  My answer does not comprehensively address this but I would like to address it and bring the Senator up to speed on it.</p> <p>The reason &euro;7.8 million was provided from Sl&aacute;intecare funding was to address the backlog in assessments of needs for in excess of 6,500 children.  This is why, in conjunction with the Department and the HSE, I put in place a plan to address it and get everybody on the one page where the assessments of needs are done and, at the same time, put in place a plan for the delivery of services through our clinicians at the other end.</p> <p>The deployment piece is what the Senator has raised this morning.  It is something that is becoming a more alarming concern to me because it is not just in the Senator's community healthcare organisation area but throughout the country.  I spoke to Paul Reid and Anne O'Connor on 5 October and I raised it as a huge concern for me.  Only this week, I spoke to Fergal Goodman in the Department and other principal officers to portray my fears and anxieties about the families and the children such as Ava throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I can say that while I have an investment, parents are not feeling that they are getting the calls, we cannot support them and are not in a position to deliver.  Not only is the HSE sending the kinds of letters to which the Senator referred but I am also aware that other providers under sections 38 and 39 that have been commissioned to do the work are also now part of the redeployment.  It is important for us to understand the need for contact tracing, the value of which was demonstrated by the report that one person who did not restrict his movement led to the infection of 56 others.</p><p>The are two things here, the first of which is the early intervention piece which applies to children from nought to six years of age.  If we do not get it then, we lose that piece because the child goes onto another list when he or she turns six and there is another backlog there.  This is a priority within my Department, hence the &euro;7.8 million allocated in August.  I can only say that the HSE and the Department of Health are working closely with me.  Contact tracers have been recruited through the HSE.  That is going on and they are being trained in as we speak.  The whole purpose is to let the staff, the trained clinicians, come back.  It is not happening quickly enough if parents are receiving those letters.  It is causing extra anxiety.</p><p>I received good news this week to the effect that, as part of essential services, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy will continue during level 5 restrictions.  They will not cease.  Those services did not continue during the previous lockdown but they will this time.  We should not find ourselves with mounting lists.  We should find ourselves addressing those issues through level 5.  I welcome that and thank the HSE and the Department for getting us to that position.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will meet later today and I look forward to the outcomes of that as they apply to clinicians, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  I hope that network disability teams will be repopulated to support young people with assessments of need.  The Senator can tell Ava's mum that is what has happened through my Department this week.  I say that to any other mothers in similar situations who are listening.  I am on top of it and across it and will stay that way until I know that everybody who was redeployed returns to fulfil the functions of their jobs.</p></speech>

It is certainly good news that therapy can continue through level 5.  I had asked the Minister of State to Kildare to meet representatives of KARE and the Muir&iacute;osa Foundation.  She had committed to doing that during October but the restrictions mean that cannot happen.</p> <p>When we talk about redeployment, there are two different kinds.  We are talking about therapists who are going to, or have gone to, contact tracing and those who went from intervention therapy to assessment therapy.  We need to battle this.  I want to know when children like Ava will receive the therapies that they absolutely need.</p> <p>I am still awaiting figures from the HSE to show where we are on assessments and early intervention.  I asked a similar question last year and 78% of children in Ireland were waiting more than three months for an initial assessment.  That was an absolute disgrace and bad indictment of the system.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for her support but I wish to know when these children, who absolutely need these therapies, will be given the opportunity to recommence them.</p></speech>

As I said, the &euro;7.8 million was to address the backlog.  I am on top of the redeployment piece.  There was a successful budget last week, out of which money was circled for the recruitment of additional staff, including another 100 therapist posts.  Some 100 therapists were secured under the most recent programme for Government.  It is sad to think that the last of those staff members to come on board, in early March, went straight into contact tracing.  They did not get to hit the ground running.  I want them brought back into the profession for which they were hired.  I also want the new posts that we were going to advertise to be filled in order that when the proper assessments of needs are completed for the backlog of cases, we will have therapists in place to carry out the interventions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Three items of work are being done, that is, recruitment, early intervention and assessment of need.

These matters have continued unabated.  It is estimated that in 2019, some 624 Palestinian-owned structures were demolished.  That is the number of structures but, of course, the number of people displaced by that is very significant.  It is probably between 700 and 1,000 people, families and children who were displaced.  It has continued this year during which, it is estimated, there have been 554 demolitions.  On 31 August, 107 homes and 46 retail units were demolished in east Jerusalem, while at the end of last month, four homes in the West Bank were demolished, so this is continuing.</p> <p>As to why this happens, there are a variety of reasons.  Sometimes it is just a feature of occupation and, undoubtedly, this kind of intervention has been a feature of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.  Sometimes it is punitive and involves military installations or military activity, but more often than not, it involves the failure of a Palestinian business, family or community to get a permit for the building.  That is kind of a nonsense because, as I understand it, in the period 2016 to 2018, there were 1,485 applications for such permits, 21 of which were granted, and that refers only to Area C in the West Bank, which is controlled by the Palestinian authorities alone.  As has been acknowledged, it should be for the Palestinian authorities only to grant those permits.</p> <p>There is no doubt this activity by the Israeli authorities is illegal under international law and the Geneva Convention.  It is recognised as such not just by Palestinian organisations and non-governmental human rights organisations but by transnational organisations such as the European Union and by the Government, yet it continues unabated.  In the same time that those 21 permits were granted, between 2016 and 2018, 6,000 Israeli settlement houses were built in the same area, Area C.  That is what we are dealing with.</p> <p>The reason I have raised this matter with the Minister of State is that many of these structures are built with the aid of the Irish taxpayer and the European taxpayer.  The European Union funds it, as does Irish Aid.  It is estimated that since May 2016, according to a statement by Federica Mogherini, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, &euro;329,000 worth of European taxpayers' money has been demolished by Israeli authorities, while another &euro;2.4 million of property is subject to demolition.  This is a major problem.  Irish Aid gave &euro;15 million to Palestine in 2008 and we contributed &euro;9 million to the UN Relief and Works Agency.  As a group of taxpayers, therefore, we are contributing to this.  We are doing the right thing, yet a national organisation is doing the wrong thing.  It is doing something illegal and what everyone recognises is against international law and its obligations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like the Minister of State to tell the House what the Government is doing about it.  What steps have we taken, diplomatically or otherwise, to ensure that Israel understands our chagrin at this kind of behaviour and our dissatisfaction with its behaviour?  What are we doing to stop it?  What are we doing to send a message to Israel that we will not tolerate this waste of our taxpayers' money and of European taxpayers' money and, most of all, this gross violation of basic humanitarian behaviour?</p></speech>

Senator Ward raises extremely serious concerns that are being raised by many other colleagues, and I am delighted he has taken the opportunity this morning to raise them again.</p> <p>The demolition of Palestinian homes and the demolition or seizure of structures, including schools, is cruel and unjust.  These practices cause suffering to ordinary Palestinians and impinge on the right of children to an education.  Demolitions and seizures of Palestinian property and humanitarian aid, including Palestinian homes, have continued despite previous commitments from Israeli authorities not to target Palestinian residential structures during this pandemic.  The only conclusion we can draw from the systematic nature of these policies, especially in areas where illegal Israeli settlements have already been constructed, is that they are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land.  In addition to its human impact, this activity undermines the feasibility of a two-state solution.</p> <p>Ireland has conveyed our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities.  In a statement last Friday the Minister for Foreign Affairs called on Israel to halt demolitions and to allow for legal construction for Palestinian residents.  Our ambassador in Tel Aviv has raised the issue of demolitions with the Israeli authorities in recent weeks along with a group of EU and non-EU colleagues.  Our representative in Ramallah remains engaged on this issue and regularly undertakes visits to sites affected by demolitions.  I understand that today the representative is due to take part in a visit by EU and other like-minded countries to a West Bank area threatened by demolitions.  Ireland is committed to reducing the vulnerability of Palestinian communities living in Area C of the West Bank.  Ireland is a member of the West Bank Protection Consortium, which plays a leading role in supporting threatened communities and co-ordinating the provision of essential services to them, including material assistance and legal aid.</p> <p>It is of additional concern - and the Senator rightly highlights this - when the structures confiscated or demolished are donor-funded.  The practice of demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education and schools infrastructure, is contrary to Israel's obligations under international law, including the provisions of international humanitarian law, in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Our principal concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families.  It is important also, however, that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers, as Senator Ward rightly said, should be pursued.  Ireland, together with a group of EU member states, pursues this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium.  It is the practice of the consortium to raise this directly with the Israeli authorities.  To date, the consortium has sought compensation of more than &euro;625,000 in respect of confiscated or demolished assets.  Ireland will continue to engage on these matters and will continue our support for a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a negotiated two-state solution.</p></speech>

I know he and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have a strong record of calling out this kind of behaviour.  I am also particularly glad to hear him use the word "recompense" because, as I said, while there is a massive humanitarian issue here, there is also a simple breach of international law.  There is also the fact that we are giving money to Palestine and it is being essentially destroyed or wasted by Israel.  I hope the Minister of State can also give us a commitment that Israel's behaviour will not interfere with the Irish policy, including aid policy, to continue to support Palestinian communities and the Palestinians in the West Bank who are suffering as a result of this Israeli behaviour.</p></speech>

Ireland has a really strong record on this, including among Members of the Oireachtas, who constantly raise the issues faced by the Palestinian people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We express our deep concern at recent demolition and confiscation of properties, including in Hebron.  Our clear position on the settlements and our concern at the recent announcement by Israeli authorities for nearly 5,000 additional housing units bears restating.  Settlements are illegal and in contravention of international law.  Our position is underpinned by a long series of UN Security Council Resolutions.  Ireland has been forthright on these matters, publicly and privately, and indeed over many years.  That sentiment is shared right across the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ireland's long-standing support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, annunciated 40 years ago this year by former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Brian Lenihan Snr., remains an integral aspect of our foreign policy.  We remain steadfast in our support for a comprehensive two-state solution, which protects the future of the Palestinian and Israeli people.</p><p>Ireland is a strong and consistent voice on these issues in EU discussions.  We will continue to prioritise the Middle East peace process, particularly when we take up our seat on the UN Security Council, and we will do whatever we can in that role to advance efforts towards and just and lasting peace.

While much of this might be explained by the fact that we use English, that, in itself, does not excuse the fact we have not been able to embed a knowledge of European languages.  Employers regularly cite the lack of language skills as a major problem in the Irish workforce.</p> <p>In a post-Brexit scenario, having a greater knowledge of languages will be an opportunity for Ireland.  In addition to that, it is not just about languages, but understanding other cultures.  As the Minister of State is aware, the problem is that there has been a shortage of language teachers at second level for quite a while.  Second level school principals regularly cite one of their biggest fears as being a language teacher being ill or on maternity leave as it is practically impossible to get a substitute language teacher.  I welcome the commitment in the budget to significantly increase the number of Spanish teachers.  That is positive, but much more needs to be done.</p> <p>Some concern has been expressed that some of the exam questions are based much more around philosophical ideas rather than students' linguistic abilities.  This is something that needs to be examined by the State Examination Commission.  We also have to look at an active campaign, whereby we can encourage second level students to take up languages right to leaving certificate level and beyond.  Tied into that has to be a reinvigoration of the primary school languages initiative, which was announced more than a decade ago, but slowly but surely began not to have the same level of emphasis as it had in the past.  </p> <p>The Languages Connect Strategy, which was the foreign languages strategy launched by the Government in December 2017, was very ambitious.  It set out that it believed that Ireland should be among the top ten countries in Europe for the teaching and learning of modern European languages.  It set out 100 actions, but three years on, very little progress has been made on those actions.  That is certainly the case with the targets of increasing the number of post-primary schools offering two or more languages by 25%, and increasing the number of students taking two languages by 25%.  That has not happened.  We are talking about improving attitudes to foreign language learning, and I have not seen any campaign which is able to do that.</p> <p>Languages are important, and I am certain the Minister of State is aware of that, given his responsibility for European affairs.  It is not good enough for us or for employers to say every so often that we need to improve our language skills.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need real programmes and real actions to be able to do that.</p><p>In terms of addressing the shortage of language teachers, a number of years ago when there was a shortage of teachers for honours maths, there was a very successful higher diploma programme that operated in UL that allowed teachers of other subjects to upskill in that area.

Is &aacute;bhar an-th&aacute;bhactach &eacute; agus ceann a bhfuil i bhfad n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhtachta&iacute; anois i gcomhth&eacute;acs an Bhreatimeacht.</p> <p>This debate gives me an opportunity to outline some of the measures that the Government has taken and is taking to support the supply of foreign language teachers, which is a really critical issue, as the Senator rightly identified, and to provide an update on the implementation of the language strategy.</p> <p>In recent years everyone in the education sector has reported difficulties being experienced by some schools in recruiting post-primary teachers in certain subject areas, including teachers of foreign languages.  The Senator might be aware that I wrote a policy document on this very issue on behalf of our party a number of years ago.  I am glad that he shares my own concerns about this issue.</p> <p>As far as I know, the second language that was spoken on the first day of the D&aacute;il was not English but French, when George Gavan Duffy read out the Declaration of Independence.  English was spoken after that.</p> <p>In response to these issues, there was, as the Senator has mentioned, a teacher supply action plan published by the Department that contained a range of actions to address teacher supply and which focused on four policy areas, including higher education.  A number of those measures were aimed at supporting the supply of teachers of foreign languages.</p> <p>As the Senator will undoubtedly know, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, engaged with the higher education institutions to encourage the development of undergraduate initial teacher training programmes in targeted subjects, including foreign languages.  This has resulted in new programmes, but obviously it takes time to feed into the system.  Nonetheless, it is important to get the foundations right.  Since 2019, students can select an undergraduate programme to become a foreign language teacher.  This reduces costs they would incur by going on to do a masters in education.  These programmes are offered in DCU, UCC, with combinations including Irish, and Limerick, where two foreign languages can be taken on the programme.  There were 100 places available on these programmes in 2020, which represents significant additional capacity for foreign language teacher education in the system over the past two years.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the number of students due to graduate in foreign languages in 2020 from what I referred to as the traditional professional masters in education has also significantly increased.  Based on information from our higher education institutions, the graduates on these programmes have increased the potential teacher registrations of foreign languages by more than 130 this year compared with 70 last year.  That is starting to make a bit of progress.  Obviously we have to make sure that all of these people join and stay in our education system when they get the qualifications.</p> <p>In addition, the Higher Education Authority issued a call for proposals to upskill existing teachers to meet the Teaching Council's subject criteria in targeted subjects, including Spanish, as mentioned by the Senator.  The programmes are two years in duration, open to already registered post-primary teachers, and they will not have to pay fees.  It is intended that the details of these programmes will be announced in the coming weeks, and I am delighted that this is happening.</p> <p>With regard to Languages Connect, which is Ireland's strategy for foreign languages in education and which was published in November 2018, I am pleased to say that significant work has taken place at increasing and diversifying the range of foreign languages taught.  A key element of this work has been the development of four new leaving certificate curricular language specifications, which have been rolled out in 15 schools in September of this year, including Mandarin, Chinese, Lithuanian, Polish and Portuguese.</p> <p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has also published the national primary curriculum framework for public consultation, which recommends the reintroduction of foreign languages in senior classes at primary level.  That issue is a particular personal priority for the Taoiseach.  I look forward to seeing that rolled out and giving our kids the skills that, as the Senator rightly points out, they need.  It is not just a question of wanting it at this stage.</p></speech>

Quite frankly, we will have to get over it.  I do not know what the reason is.  I do not know whether it is because of the historical connotations of the Irish language of poverty.  We have our own national language here that, let us be honest, very few speak and that then leads to difficulties.</p><p>The challenges are considerable.  When I go to European meetings, I am surprised at the amount of English that is not spoken.  People are using English but many countries are using their own languages.  In fact, I spoke Irish at the General Affairs Council last week.  I was pleased to do so.  The French certainly do not use English at European meetings and they would probably prefer if we were speaking French to them as well.</p><p>We must upskill.  The Government is absolutely committed to this.  I am bringing forward a policy on recruitment into the European institutions where our biggest problem is the lack of languages.  It is not only so that we can all say &quot;<i>Bonjour</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>Danke</i>&quot;, or whatever.  We need a deep level of understanding and a high level of language capability among our graduates if we want to have people working in the European institutions.</p><p>We must change the national attitude around this.  At our disposal on every phone and television, we have Netflix where all of these television programmes are available in all sorts of languages.  Our young people, particularly, have a considerable opportunity now if they decide that languages are the thing for them.  When I was doing the leaving certificate, I went around in my father's car with a tape listening to conversations to practise for the oral examination.  Now one can watch every programme.  We need to grasp these opportunities to become fluent in other languages and go out there to other countries, particularly to the European Union, and be confident about it.  We need to put our case there, as our forefathers and foremothers in the D&aacute;il and Seanad did, for instance, in 1919, when, as I stated, George Gavan Duffy read the Declaration of Independence in French to speak that language of diplomacy.</p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  It is a priority for the Government.  I will certainly bring the points that the Senator raises to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, who is dealing with Covid-related matters in schools this morning.  The Minister is supporting Covid teams that will be giving help to schools in the next few weeks.  That is why Deputy Foley is not here and she asked me to convey her apologies to the House.</p></speech>

I am not speaking to any particular cases that are currently ongoing, any particular civil case or any other prosecution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A Tusla report, however, has indicated that the allegations are well founded, and an independent appeals panel upheld the findings of the report.  The acknowledgement of the allegations of historical child abuse and rape within St. John Ambulance makes me very concerned that, over the decades, more people may have been sexually abused than those who have come forward or who are proceeding with a civil case against a perpetrator.</p><p>I have a request to make of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Before bringing the Minister in here today, we did our work to see who would be responsible for a scoping exercise.  We looked at the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the past, there was a reference to the Charities Regulator.  We are quite confident that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is responsible for holding a scoping inquiry given that it was child sexual abuse in St. John Ambulance over the last 30 to 40 years, which is the length of the career of an individual who has worked in the organisation.  It is safe to assume there are more cases than the number currently known about.  Usually with these matters, we are only ever scratching the surface in terms of knowing how many have been abused.  We owe it to all the young people who signed up in good faith and wanted to volunteer with St. John Ambulance to uncover what was done to them.  I refer not only to our being able to support victims of sexual abuse within St. John Ambulance but also to ensuring that we reach a point where we can hold people to account for the abuse the young teenagers endured.</p><p>Since allegations of the kind in question have come to light, St. John Ambulance has implemented child protection measures.  I have been told there was some resistance in the beginning to measures such as Garda vetting.  All these issues have been sorted but, regardless of child protection measures within an organisation, the law still applies to any organisation in which there is child sexual abuse.  The law should protect individuals, including young people, who have been victims of child sexual abuse.</p><p>I hope the Minister can determine the capacity of his Department to carry out a scoping inquiry so we can create the necessary space, facilitate a conversation and encourage others who are affected by abuse carried out within St. John Ambulance while they volunteered there as teenagers.  I hope we can work together to establish an inquiry.</p></speech>

I am aware of the specific issue she alluded to, and I have been in correspondence with an individual in that regard.  As the Senator knows, our country has in the past failed to protect its children, and that failure weighs heavily on all of us.  Abuse is not consigned to the past, though, and it is my role, in collaboration with Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to protect children where there is a clear existing threat.  Tusla's role in considering historical abuse allegations is to try to establish if the person against whom an allegation has been made could currently pose a risk to children.  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to investigate a crime and, where appropriate, instigate a prosecution.</p><p>Let me refer to Tusla's role in protection first.  The Children First Act 2015 commenced in December 2017 and it defines relevant organisations and mandated persons and what is required of them.  Relevant organisations must have a child safeguarding statement.  The following is the definition of some of the categories of relevant organisations covered under the 2015 Act:</p> <blockquote> 	1. Any work or activity which is carried out by a person, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the person having access to, or contact with, children in&mdash;<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />4. Any work or activity which consists of treatment (including assessment which may lead to treatment), therapy or counselling provided to a child.<br /><br />5. Any work or activity which consists of the provision of&mdash;  	(a) educational, research, training, cultural, recreational, leisure, social or physical activities to children,  </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Both of these definitions apply to St. John Ambulance.  I commend the bravery and fortitude of the individuals who have come forward and shared their experiences that led to correspondence with my Department.  I can only imagine how recounting their stories and reliving that difficult time in their lives must be incredibly traumatic for them.  It was that bravery that led to Tusla's child safeguarding statement compliance unit engaging with St. John Ambulance Ireland.  The unit has reviewed the child safeguarding statement of St. John Ambulance and is satisfied that it meets current criteria.  Safeguarding statements are an important tool to clarify the potential risks to children in any organisation, and to inform the volunteers, staff and service users of the actions taken to mitigate those risks.</p><p>In order to inform my response to the Senator's specific request, I am liaising with the Departments of Justice and Equality and of Health to see if they have knowledge of any further pertinent information.  Following concerns that had previously been made known to my Department, Tusla conducted a review in the region in question of available records and indicated it did not find any concerns.  Today, my Department has requested Tusla to perform a similar review of St. John Ambulance in all regions of the country.  This review will cover cases that may relate to the matter and any retrospective cases that have come to the attention of Tusla.  On foot of findings from this review and the engagement with the Departments of Health and of Justice and Equality, all due consideration will be given to the Senator's request.</p><p>Where abuse happened in the past, Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can only rely on and make assessments on the information available.  I strongly urge anyone who at any time has information related to the endangerment or abuse of children, now or in the past, to immediately bring it to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  It can be extremely difficult to take such action but I say to anyone who has been the victim of abuse that they are not alone.  I fully appreciate that while instances may be historic and may be in the past, the impact is felt every day by these individuals.</p><p>I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to my attention.  I have outlined steps the Department is taking.  We will continue to work on this.</p></speech>

It is comforting to know that conversations are happening in the background on how we can move forward and pursue this, even in terms of answering my request about an inquiry.  I would like to put on the record why I mentioned a scoping inquiry.  I looked at the Scally report, which I know related to CervicalCheck and which is a different issue, and it was a really good way to take a transparent and victim-led approach to reporting.  As the Minister said, the incident is historical but the effects are lifelong.  Over the past few months, in looking at how we can move forward in terms of an inquiry, I have had many conversations.  This was much wider than the people who have been most impacted, such as those who contacted the Minister.  It would seem abuse within St. John Ambulance was tolerated at the highest level of that organisation.  Therefore, even though a particular individual is not there any more, we need to look at the structures which supported and facilitated that individual for such a long period of time.  According to one account, which was given to me, it was an open secret.  It was like everybody knew, but nobody knew.  That was a very strong statement to hear from somebody.  That is why, even with the current risk being mitigated with the particular individual being gone, we need to look at why it was allowed persist for so many generations and at how many others have, I am sure, been impacted.</p></speech>

As to the degree of significance the Senator outlined, I had not heard that expression regarding prevalence before.  We are taking steps.  We are not just examining the region where the initial issue was flagged and the victim, whom we both have been in contact with, was from.  Rather, we are examining the organisation nationally.  That will help us to establish whether there are more causes for concern and further action.</p><p>I am happy to continue engaging with the Senator.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has done a great deal of work on this matter.</p></speech>

Something I believe would be interesting and topical for us to discuss is the whole area of employment and the different changes that have occurred due to this pandemic.  The first factor is the level of youth unemployment.  This is a significant problem for the country.  The level of youth unemployment among the under-25s currently stands at almost 37%.  Many of those have been employed in the lower income sectors, in hospitality and in retail and would have been in part-time and more precarious employment.  Many of those jobs will not return in the short term.  We have a serious issue around youth unemployment and the long-term impact on young people in this country.  It would be a good debate to have in this House and to hear from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss the impact of that on this sector.  </p> <p>I welcome also the news this morning from IBEC which has published a report to identify the dual threat of Covid-19 and Brexit and the fact that it poses significant challenges to businesses for the year 2021.  There were, however, some positive aspects to this report, in that 28% of their businesses intend to hire more staff next year and 49% of their businesses intend to increase wages.  There is some positivity and light at the end of the tunnel here.  The impact of this on business is also an issue that the Minister with responsibility for trade might wish to come before the House to discuss.</p> <p>I also wish to highlight and discuss the point that today is day one of the new restrictions under level 5.  This House will discuss and debate today and tomorrow additional legislation in respect of penalties, rent and protections for those living in rental accommodation.  It is a difficult time for the country and I am concerned about the impact on the mental health of citizens for these six weeks.  One thing I will say is that we have learned from the last lockdown and we have made some changes.  The social bubble proposed is a very positive measure for this period, in that we recognise that some people who live alone will need to meet up with other households.  We are asking people to limit that to one other household and to have that social bubble.  The fact that the schools are remaining open is also a very positive impact.  Six weeks of these restrictions is difficult but I hope that at the end of the period, we can reopen.  The question being asked is whether we can be sure that six weeks will be enough.  When I listened to Dr. Tony Holohan, he stated his belief that if we do the right thing and follow the guidelines of these six weeks, the time they have set aside is sufficient to flatten the curve and reopen the country in time for Christmas.  That is what we must be looking forward to.  </p> <p>The legislation this House will debate today and tomorrow is emergency legislation to protect our citizens and to ensure that we can get through the next six weeks.  I look forward to debating those items with colleagues over the next couple of days and I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

Although it is somewhat late because there has been a slight change in it, I again appeal to the Leader to make arrangements to provide sufficient time for Members, some of whom are travelling long distances to be present.  We need time.  The Senator is the Leader of the House and she assured me last week that she would do her best.  I believe it is not unreasonable to have available to Members the proposed Order of Business she wishes to bring to the House a minimum of one hour before proceedings begin.  It is our job under the Order of Business to consider what business the Leader is proposing.  It is the Members who decide it by a vote and we accept the democratic decision.  That is what the Order of Business is.  I appeal again to the Leader to take that on board and ask her to address that point in her replies here today.  I do not support No. 1, which is the motion that we received last night.  I thank the secretariat which must be under enormous stress and pressure.  I was working at my desk and it came in just before 9 p.m.  That shows the level of commitment and work of our staff-----</p></speech>

I thank them for that.  Unfortunately it gives us very little time to consider it or to discuss it with our colleagues.  We are a small group of five Senators and other groups have bigger numbers.  I ask the Leader to take on board the difficulties and practicalities around that and to use her position as Leader of the House to do something about it going forward.  She might also address that point in her response to the House today on the Order of Business.  I therefore do not support this item.  I do not believe there is any good enough reason to not have an Order of Business tomorrow.

Today we have woken up to lockdown No. 2.  Up to 150,000 people now have no jobs to go to.  Others are returning to working from home in less than ideal conditions.  While of course the lockdown is necessary and the ratio of spread of the virus is deeply concerning, our contact tracing system collapsed over the weekend under the volume of cases.  This is simply not good enough.</p> <p>The WHO has repeatedly said that lockdowns are a mechanism to stop the spread of the virus while countries get their houses in order.  A lockdown buys time to put in place a robust testing and tracing mechanism.  This Government squandered the first lockdown.  There was an enormous sense of goodwill from the public.  They put their faith in the Government to put in place the necessary hospital capacity and ramp up testing and tracing.  Now they find that did not happen.</p> <p>The Be On Call for Ireland campaign saw tens of thousands of people sign up to help in the Covid battle.  From those who came forward, a pool of 1,480 people were eligible, 755 of whom went through the entire process and yet were not hired.  Some 300 job-ready applicants have already dropped out.  In addition to the Be On Call for Ireland drive, many more part-time and semi-retired GPs came forward to offer their services for contact tracing.  Instead of seizing their expertise, they were subjected to reams of form filling, including, in at least one case, a GP being asked for his leaving certificate results.  In the ultimate insult, those who were hired were offered zero-hour contracts with no sick pay during a pandemic.</p> <p>It is simply not good enough.  The vast majority of people in this country, young and old, will play their part in bringing the Covid numbers down.  They will stay home, wear their masks and socially distance, but they will not tolerate their efforts being wasted a second time because the Government failed to get its house in order.  Medical workers who are exhausted will not tolerate it.  Teachers, childcare workers, bus drivers, cleaners and retail staff who are continuously being put at risk on the front line will not tolerate it.  Existing contact tracers who are worked to the bone will not tolerate it.</p> <p>The Government has an enormous opportunity to restore public faith in the system.  It should hire contract tracers directly, not through a recruitment company that is charging a 20% premium, and pay them a decent wage.  Trying to do contact tracing on the cheap will cost us in the long run.  It will not just cost us economically.  It will cost us in terms of our mental health, well-being and the public buy-in which will collapse if the Government does not get this right.  I know the public will do their bit, but we need the Government to play its part.</p></speech>

I hope Members will agree that we need to do something about it.<br/><br/>Today, I wish to again highlight the urgent need to recognise the heroes of Jadotville.  I know this has been mentioned by several speakers in the Chamber but I believe we have come to a point where we need to do more.<br/><br/>Since I had the honour of being elected to the House I have listened to colleagues support the call for these gallant soldiers to finally get the recognition they deserve.  Many continue to fight for this on their behalf.  Recently, along with Labour Party colleagues, I received a reply from the Minister for Defence stating that in recent years his Department has had several representations outlining the courage and bravery of A Company.  The Minister finished his reply by stating that he would consider any additional documentation, information or evidence to support any request for additional medals but that no new information had come to light.<br/><br/>I have spent the past couple of weeks speaking to families who have loved ones who were involved in this engagement.  They continue to search for justice for their loved ones and continue to uncover new documentation on this important matter.  I know they are in constant contact with the Department.  They will never give up and neither should we.<br/><br/>I am informed that 11 or more county councils have supported this request in recent weeks.  I was also informed recently that there may be nine surviving members from this engagement.  I encourage everyone here to come together as a House to support this call once and for all.  I call on the Cathaoirleach to show us how to do that, whether by letter or whatever else to the Minister for Defence.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish to take the remainder of my time to talk about the retail sector and the many jobs and services provided by the sector in our towns and counties.  During this pandemic, many of us have been forced to change the way we shop.  This has had an impact and will continue to have a serious impact in the coming six weeks on the many retailers throughout the State.  Local enterprise offices have helped many retailers get online for the first time with grants to retailers as well the search and start initiative, a new online route for their customers.  A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>promoting 100 Irish-based online retailers stated that up to 70% of Irish consumer online spending leaves this country as people shop with multinationals.  This must stop.  We have to start shopping locally.  We must start buying Irish as much as we can.  Specifically, in the coming six weeks, we must do so to save as many jobs as we can.  I encourage Members to get involved in that campaign.</p></speech>

However, it is important that we put in place supports for students immediately.  Some students have on-campus commitments and rental commitments.  We need a proper process for all third level institutions to ensure that refunds are given immediately.  Also, we need a process around the private rental market for students.  Additionally, now that students can no longer avail of the payments under the PUP scheme, we need to examine what has happened to those students who fall outside of the SUSI grant system and, therefore, cannot get the work they were doing at the weekends to be able to supplement their living.  I ask, as a matter of urgency given the lockdown, that the Minister would look at how such people can be supported.  We cannot see this generation sink into poverty any more than they already have.  We need to ensure that people do not drop out.  We need to ensure they get the education they want and require, because it is of benefit to society.</p></speech>

We spend &euro;5 billion doing online shopping.  More than two thirds of this goes outside the country.  If we are buying more online, we need to look at the Irish companies.  As the Senator said earlier, there is a good article by Conor Pope in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I strongly recommend that people look at it.  We also have <i>buyirishfood.ie</i>and there is importance of buying local.  Luckily, the farmers' markets have not been shut down this time.  We have to look at quality over quantity.  Every year in this country, 1 million tonnes of food are wasted by being thrown away.  Customers get a better personal service if they support local businesses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are the character, the make-up and the heart of all our towns and villages and we need to prioritise spending on money locally.  Even if people go to the big chains or supermarkets to do their shopping, they also have sections of Irish products.  People should take the time and look at the label.   If it states, "Packaged in Ireland", it was not made in Ireland but if it states, "Produced in Ireland", it was produced in this country.   Let us put our money where our mouth is and go all out to buy Irish.  If we could all spend &euro;5 or &euro;10 more per week on Irish goods we could save thousands of jobs.   Now is the time.   Let us prioritise buying Irish.</p></speech>

Yesterday at the Joint Committee on Health, we heard from representatives from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation and it was shocking to hear what they had to say.  We heard about the disgraceful treatment of student nurses during this pandemic.  Student nurses are exhausted.  They are expected to work over and above their undergraduate status, they are exposed to the dangers of Covid and they get either no payment at all or an allowance of &euro;50.79 per week.  Failure to pay them amounts to exploitation.</p> <p>A common thread running through all the submissions is understaffing and the negative impact this is having on patient care.  Everyone is in agreement that the nurses are prepared to jeopardise their own health to save lives.  The increase in spending on health of &euro;4 billion is to be welcomed but it could be wasted if staffing levels are not addressed.  Understaffing of hospitals can lead to poor outcomes for patients and increase the number of deaths.  We have relied on recruiting nurses from abroad but with the travel restrictions this may prove impossible.  It is important to retain Irish nurses in Ireland and increase the number of college places so we can satisfy the demand for nurses.  The allowance that was paid in March must now be reintroduced.</p> <p>The mental and physical toll of this pandemic on nursing staff is enormous.  Some 50 nurses per week are getting infected by the virus.  Research has shown that front-line hospital staff and other key workers have a higher chance of experiencing mental health difficulties during the pandemic.  The Covid-19 pandemic has created stressful working environments for many people.  Having regular contact with people who experience severe symptoms of Covid-19 or die from it becomes traumatic over time.  It is important that the necessary mental health services are made available to all front-line workers experiencing trauma from dealing with the impact of this pandemic.</p> <p>I thank all the healthcare workers and front-line workers who are risking their health to save lives.  We are deeply indebted to them all.  However, although saying thank you is important, they are not enough.  If this gratitude is to be given meaning, it should lead to an overdue reassessment of who we value most in society and how we treat them.  It should not have taken a pandemic to expose how poorly paid, insecure and badly treated so many health workers, without whom society cannot function, truly are.  I would like to ask the Minister to come in and give us an update.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Wall on the Jadotville men.  We need to do something about it at this point as it is just not on.</p></speech>

Cathal died on 10 October.  He suffered from metachromatic leukodystrophy.  He was extremely fortunate in his loving and caring family: his father Les, mother Linda, brother Ciaran and sister Holly.  Some weeks ago, I introduced the National Screening Advisory Committee Bill 2020 in the House, which would allow for the screening of up to 40 disorders and save the lives of 50 children each year in Ireland.  We should, in Cathal's memory, commit ourselves today to ensuring this situation is urgently addressed.</p> <p>I refer to the wonderfully welcome message from Pope Francis, who said gay people were part of the human family.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Of course they are and it is perfectly obvious.

An area I feel needs to be looked at, and I raised it in the previous D&aacute;il with the then Minister with responsibility for local government, unfortunately to little avail, is the area of online voting - not electronic voting - and the necessity for a proper debate in the Houses to recognise that if we were bounced into an election in the next year, we would really have an issue with voting by way of pencil and paper at polling stations.

If we can collect the taxes of the people of this country online through a secure portal, then voting online safely should also be possible.</p> <p>Last year, I met the Gov2U group, which promotes democracy throughout Europe.  Up to 14 countries have some form of online voting.  Estonia, a small Baltic nation, was the first to introduce permanent national Internet voting.  It has gone from 1.9% of votes cast through online voting to almost 30% in the parliamentary elections there last year.  Interestingly, it also keeps the pencil and paper as a voting system for the electorate.  If we are looking at electoral reform, it is incumbent on us before any Bill is drafted to have a robust and proper debate that would also consider online voting and its potential, not only in terms of ease of access but also in helping younger people to participate in democracy and voting.</p></speech>

Specifically, I am given to understand that citizens under the age of 18 have no right whatsoever to change their names.  I can see why this would not be a problem normally, but the circumstances of this rigidity specifically affect a number of women who are estranged from their husbands and the fathers of their children, and who now have children who have a different name from them.  If the children have not taken any part of their mother's name and have their father's name, a mother who is estranged from that person and from whom the children might also be estranged must now in regular circumstances in engagement with the State, such as passport control or dealing with the Garda and social and family protection services, not only explain the nature of her relationship to her own children but also prove they are her children.</p> <p>I suggest that the rigidity means these women cannot change this but we should put in place a system that allows somebody in these particular circumstances to register a double-barrelled surname that includes the name of the mother in the official name of the child and does away with this bureaucratic difficulty that many women have.  Many women have raised it with me personally with regard to when they are dealing with the State or officialdom in the country.  I would like to see us do something to facilitate it and to be much more flexible in how we approach the various types of families we now have in the country.</p></speech>

It has never been done by any Senator here before.  I would like to call them in to account for their chaotic mismanagement of this crisis and to give reasons, backed up with solid evidence, why we are ignoring smarter strategies as we face into level 5 restrictions.</p> <p>This nation is in shock this morning.  We are in level 5 again.  We are yo-yoing in and out of lockdowns.  We, as politicians, have failed with our messaging.  Even Opposition parties have failed.  Perhaps our constant questioning of every single move that the Government has taken did not work.  It has not worked for the likes of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald and all of those who have questioned every single move that the Government has made in trying to protect our people.  It should be about how we can protect our people.  I believe that level 5 is a step too far.</p> <p>The Irish strategy is short-sighted.  It is led by politicians who are pandering to lobbyist groups so that football and alcohol trump the health and wealth of this nation.  We failed in our messaging in respect of level 3 restrictions.  Perhaps it needed to be tweaked.  We did not get buy-in from the public because we had protestors, anti-maskers on our streets, and because of golfgate.  There are many reasons why we did not bring the public with us.  We have to look at ourselves when we ask why we are at level 5 this morning.  It is down to us.  We should not be in this position.</p></speech>

It remains no more than a promise.  The Government last year signed a contract with National Broadband Ireland to the value of approximately &euro;3 billion.  Since then, we have heard precious little from National Broadband Ireland on when it intends to begin the installation of broadband.  At the time, the estimate was five to seven years but we have no indication as to when it will begin and end.</p> <p>We are now in level 5 and have asked the Irish people to take extreme measures and stay at home.  We still expect them to provide appropriate services while working from home.  We expect our college students to participate in lectures and advance towards examinations.  We expect people to do their banking without going to the bank.  We effectively expect people to live their lives from home, to the greatest extent possible.  Yet, 540,000-odd people have no access to high-speed broadband.  I appeal to the Cathaoirleach and to the Leader to try to organise a debate here as quickly as possible with the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to see if anything can be done to roll out a wireless service to some of those areas as a kind of stopgap measure.</p> <p>Like many others in this and the other House, I take calls from people about this matter on a daily basis.  Those people could manage until now but, with the level of restrictions that we are now placing on them, they can do so no longer.  Unless we are prepared to address that in some way, we will make it much more difficult for people to remain in their homes.</p></speech>

I am echoing the sentiments of Senator Pauline O'Reilly in speaking up for our third level students.  They are in the most invidious of positions because two of their academic years have now been affected.  There are great supports for them and there is no doubt that the Minister has brought in great things.  The injection of &euro;50 million in the budget was great and equated, in the instances of some students to whom I have spoken, to them receiving &euro;250 back.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The problem, however, is that many of them have paid up front for accommodation and are not getting that accommodation refunded, yet they are not allowed on campus.  That mechanism, therefore, is not working.  They cannot work in part-time jobs and their whole lives have been disrupted at a time when they are not on campus to receive their lectures, so they are not getting the benefit even of the discussions among themselves that might happen when they are coming out of lecture theatres or sitting around the coffee dock.  They are not getting the additional growth and development that normally comes from campus life.</p><p>At the beginning of this academic year, they were promised they would attend one lecture session on campus per week, but unfortunately that has not transpired, although that is for good reason, given that we are in level 5.  This is a group whom the media and people in general are quick to criticise if there is a social gathering, even though the vast majority are trying to get their qualifications.  If they are final year students, they may be worried about what the next year will hold for them, what they will do after college, whether there will be jobs, what the prospects will be and what their future will look like.  At a time when the world should be their oyster, it is not.  We need to address that and have the Minister hear statements from us on that.</p></speech>

Last year, I visited Colombia as part of a Justice for Colombia peace monitor delegation.  I travelled extensively through the country and witnessed at first hand horrific stories of human rights abuses.  I visited a small town called Cajibio in the Cauca region and met a young man, Jayder Quintana, who was just 17 years old when I met him.  At the beginning of this month, he was gunned down and murdered.  A few minutes before he was murdered, a policeman came to check his identity card to see who he was, and then the right-wing paramilitaries arrived and gunned him down.</p> <p>Jayder was a member of the FENSUAGRO trade union, which has a relationship with the Unite union here and in Britain.  The most dangerous country in the world in which to be a member of a trade union is Colombia.  Trade union members have been gunned down in their hundreds.  Some 1,000 people have been murdered since the peace process was initiated four years ago.  The key problem is that the Colombian Government is not implementing what was agreed to at that time, in respect of rural reform, justice and the country's national commission for security guarantees.</p> <p>The Colombian Embassy is very active in Dublin.  I call for a foreign affairs debate in order that we can discuss the matter in greater detail.  I have written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to request a meeting.  I want to understand what measures the Government will take to put pressure on its Colombian counterpart.  To be fair, while the people at the embassy are very decent and fair people, we are talking about a far-right government that seems to be watching on as people are slaughtered month after month.  We have to do what we can to ensure, for people such as Jayder, murdered like so many in Colombia just for trying to build a better life for his family and community, that something fundamental will be done by the Government.  We need to hear justice for the people of Colombia.</p></speech>

It is really important.  We have to examine human rights throughout the world and see what we can do.</p> <p>The issue I raise relates to my friend, Pat Tinsley, whom I have spoken about in the House previously.  Pat and 29 others have been diagnosed with amyloidosis.  No treatment is available in this country, although it is available in Northern Ireland, the UK, Europe and the US.  The treatment's name is patisiran.  I have engaged with the company that produces it.  It would give a new lease of life to the 30 sufferers in this country.</p> <p>I raise this issue again in the context that &euro;50 million was allocated in the budget for the provision of high-quality healthcare through the availability of innovative medicines.  That is really welcome and it marks a major shift in public policy towards the funding of new medicines.  When I spoke previously about the issue, I requested a debate on it with the Minister for Health.  That the money has been allocated in the budget is a really significant development.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to have this process expedited in order that we support these 30 people?

The dispute centres on a funding shortfall of &euro;1.2 million for veterinary inspections of smaller slaughterhouses carried out by the local authority vets, who also work with the local enterprise offices to develop new businesses as well as overseeing the regulatory standards.  The current contract runs out on 30 November, with the CCMA indicating that it will not continue to provide these services because of a shortfall in funding.  This issue is quite close to me in my local village, which is home to the Rawles abattoir, which services nearly all the butchers throughout the entire county.  We have Uncle Bok, which provides Biltong for the entire southern African market in Ireland, and Herterich's artisan butchers, which are renowned for their quality throughout the country.  These are small local enterprises in our community.  They are not the Goodmans or the large supermarket chains.  This issue needs to be resolved immediately to give certainty to these businesses prior to Christmas and to keep the veterinary service within our local authorities in order that they can work with the local enterprise offices to continue to provide more jobs.</p> <p>Finally, I support Senator Wall in his comments.  Collectively, we need to come together to recognise the men of Jadotville.</p></speech>

I have only been here six months but it seems like a record, even for this House, so I reiterate that we will oppose the Order of Business on that basis.</p> <p>I am thinking of all the many Nigerians living here in Ireland today.  They are in all our communities.  #EndSARS is a movement against police brutality in Nigeria and for an end to the special anti-robbery squad, SARS.  SARS is a controversial unit of the Nigerian police force.  The dissolution of SARS was announced over the weekend, to be replacement by SWAT - same thing, different acronym.  There is an outcry over this entirely unwelcome replacement of the very body the people of Nigeria are protesting against.  The international community is watching with dismay the fury and outcry on the part of the people of Nigeria and the extremely heavy-handed approach the Government of Nigeria is taking against these protestors.  My heart goes out to the victims of the shootings in Lekki, where people were peacefully protesting around the toll gate and were fired upon.</p> <p>What is happening in Nigeria is reprehensible, and the international community must not be silent.  There is enormous energy going into disrupting the protestors rather than engaging with them and meeting the demands of these people.  The demands include the immediate release of all arrested protestors, justice for the deceased victims of police brutality, appropriate compensation, and an independent body to oversee the investigation and prosecution of all reports of police violence.</p> <p>This is about more than just SARS.  It is about ending police brutality and about better implementation of laws, better leadership and more accountability.  I request that the Minister for Foreign Affairs condemn how the people of Nigeria are being treated.  Peaceful protestors are being gunned down, and this is reprehensible.  I hope this House will join me in condemning this senseless violence and that it will support the promotion of peace in Nigeria.</p></speech>

The reason I say this today is that Packie was once a director of football in the FAI.  He and one of his colleagues and many more staff were turfed out of that organisation at a time when a member of his departmental team was raising financial irregularities within the FAI and taking those concerns to the board of Sport Ireland.  Nothing was ever done about them.  The only result was that Packie, all his team around him and his department were turfed out on the back of a money-saving exercise shortly after 2011, after the irregularities were raised.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall Blaney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I find it extraordinary that last week the CEO and chair of Sport Ireland were reappointed for another term.  Is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform aware of, and did he approve, the reappointment of the CEO for another term?  Is he also aware that the reappointment of the chair goes against the regulations of Sport Ireland which state that nobody can be appointed for more than two terms?  I find it disgusting that these two individuals have been reappointed, considering how they handled the financial affairs of the organisation, the saga which surrounded John Delaney's term in office and the financial irregularities that are now coming to light.  I ask both Ministers concerned to open an investigation into these irregularities, dating back to 2010.</p></speech>

They are the heroes of the hour and continue to keep us all safe.  They have been joined in recent weeks by new heroes, and it is not an exhaustive list.  We should remember teachers and childcare workers on this poignant day when level 5 restrictions are introduced.  They have kept the lights on in this country.  They have stepped up, putting themselves in harm's way, so that this country continues to function.  We spoke today, and have done so the past, about honouring the A Company heroes of Jadotville, and we should do so.  However, we should also honour and recognise the work of teachers.  As someone who is proud to have spent a few years as a teacher, I am conscious of the diverse logistical and other challenges faced by principals, teachers, caretakers and special needs assistants in every school community to make their schools work.  They are all working for Ireland like never before.  I know the Leader of the House will agree to honour them and recognise their role.  In the longer term, the honour they deserve involves receiving equal pay for equal work, reducing the teacher-pupil ratio to the standard European norm, giving childcare workers a salary that is commensurate with their incredible and crucial work, and showing them the dignity and respect they deserve and have earned.  I urge this House to remember them today of all days.  We must do something constructive and real, and not just pay lip service.  When we get out of the Covid pandemic, and we will, let us express in tangible and real ways the great work they have done.  They are the soldiers of today - the living soldiers.</p></speech>

I have no interest in changing my daughters' names, but I have come up against the obstacles and complications that the Senator has highlighted.  I have had many conversations on this issue.  One stands out more than the others because it took place at passport control.  I have one daughter who is a Wallace, one who is a Jones, and I am a Ruane.  That has led to some very awkward conversations.  Obviously, none of us look alike, which makes it even worse.</p> <p>The issue I want to raise today spans across a few Departments, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and involves everyone who is in control of funding expenditure for youth, addiction, community, and mental health services.  Over recent months, I have had many conversations about the concerns of many of those services about underspends this year as a result of service provision being somewhat restricted due to the Covid pandemic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Service providers are afraid that when they seek next year's funding at the end of the year, the underspends will make them look as though they do not need so much funding.  As the underspends were caused by a very exceptional year, I hope the Departments in charge of many of the community services will issue an instruction or guideline to them that allows a six-month grace period that lasts into 2021, thus allowing enough time for them to spend their money and they do not have to rush to spend it before the year is out.</p><p>It would be very helpful if the Departments were able to widen the scope for the expenditure because some it will not be spent on service provision and many projects may need to invest in particular capital that is necessary to continue to provide services due to Covid-19.  Widening the scope would not cost the State any money because the money has already been assigned to the projects but would allow projects more room to manoeuvre and prepare for 2021 in terms of how different the work looks for many of these sectors. </p></speech>

I note that when Paul Reid was interviewed on radio today, he expressed his regret and apologised for what happened, which is commendable.  I suggest that we invite the Minister for Health here to specifically debate Covid halfway through the six weeks of restrictions at level 5.  It would be an opportunity for him to engage with us on Covid, review how we are doing and talk about a roadmap that lasts right into 2021 because there is no doubt we will have to live alongside Covid-19 for some time to come.  Even if a vaccine is rolled out, it will take a significant amount of time for it to percolate down.

Members in both Houses have previously raised this matter.  We should not allow it to be repeatedly discussed and raised here, as there is cross-party consensus.  As Senator Wall mentioned local authorities, I note that two former members of the Army, Councillor Joe Malone in Kilkenny and Councillor Gary Laffan in Wexford, tabled motions on the issue with their local authorities as has happened across the country.  The Defence Forces have a lot of bigger issues but the recognition of the Jadotville men is a small issue.  Only eight brave men who served in Jadotville remain and I ask the Leader to seek an assurance from the Minister for Defence that he will come here to debate this issue.</p> <p>I welcome the statement that the Taoiseach made this morning concerning the development of a shared island unit and its priorities.

Somebody who currently awaits their driving test has had to wait over 30 weeks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is prohibitive for young people, and some not-so-young people, not only in terms of enabling them to drive unaccompanied but for many who need to be able to drive to work.

"Please, no" is all I could say to that.  Let us spare ourselves the future misery and confusion and let us see what happens in the US election in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 allows income from the sale of artistic works to be exempted from income tax in certain circumstances.  The works involved must be original and they must have "cultural and artistic merit".  Applications are made annually in respect of specific works - books, plays, a collection of artworks, etc. - and individuals can earn up to &euro;50,000 tax free in the year the determination is made.  The question of what works qualify as having that cultural or artistic merit is assessed by the Revenue Commissioners with advice from the Arts Council based on set guidelines.  It seems that the granting of exemptions for non-fiction books has been a bone of contention for more than a decade.  In 2013, the Arts Council complained to the Revenue that its role was being undermined by the tendency to grant exemptions to ghost written sports biographies and political memoirs.  For non-fiction books to be considered, they should have a cultural theme, such as a biography or an autobiography of a writer or painter.  Where appeals are made against applications, more than half have been successful.  The Arts Council provides expert opinion but, here again, the council has said that all manner of appeals are being upheld.  The council differs from the Revenue in some determinations.  It seems political memoirs should not quality but there is certainly no justification to allow serving politicians or retired officeholders with generous pensions to avail of a tax break in this situation.  They should pay tax on royalties as they would on other income earned in retirement.  This is something that can be addressed in the coming finance Bill.  It is something we ought to address.  We are spending a great deal these days.  We are borrowing a great deal.  We should certainly take any opportunity we have for prudent retrenchment.</p></speech>

The Bridge Street-Linenhall Street area has been a neglected part of Dundalk for the past 40-odd years for various different reasons.  It is a part of the town of Dundalk that has the most sincere and genuine sense of community.  Other parts of my town have benefited from urban regeneration funding over the past couple of years but the north end, Bridge Street and Linenhall Street, have been consistently left behind.  We have people like Mr. Martin McElligott, who is the manager of the business improvement district scheme, BIDS, in Dundalk.  We have people on Louth County Council who are pushing hard to improve this area.  However, they cannot do that unless they get substantial funding.  I am talking of funding in the millions of euro which would be required for urban regeneration to totally transform the streetscape to make it more attractive for new businesses to move in and to make it more attractive for people to go and shop in that area.  The area has a wonderful sense of community and it is crying out for substantial funding.  I would appreciate it if we could invite the Minister to this House at some stage in the near future to talk about urban regeneration funding and the benefits that it can have for towns right across Ireland, in particular, for the area of Dundalk I raise here today.  It would be important to do that and push for urban regeneration funding in the provincial towns and large towns, such as the town of Dundalk.</p></speech>

It is with great sadness I rise to tell the House of a story that is breaking online in the Roscommon Herald in recent hours.  A nursing home in the Roscommon-Galway border - I will not mention it or the people involved but the names are here - has been left in a state of absolute emergency after the majority of staff and 26 of the 28 residents tested positive for the coronavirus.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The director has been in tears.  She tested positive herself.  She has no symptoms but obviously cannot go to the nursing home.  The result is that the nursing home has been left with one nurse, one care assistant, one chef and one food server.  The HSE's intervention was sought.  It promised to help and did send one nurse but, because so many staff have been affected, that nurse and one care assistant were left in charge of the patients.  One resident has died and two are being hospitalised today.  It has been described by a local GP, Dr. Daly, as a state of emergency.  It is really sad and we have seen this before.  I will not prolong my contribution as I will be working behind the scenes later but I ask the Minister, whom I know will be very compassionate, to bring this to the attention of the Government and get the HSE to do everything possible in the coming hours to sort this out.  If it is not sorted, most of the residents will end up in hospital.</p></speech>

It is a private nursing home.  The circumstances indicate exactly why we have moved to level 5, which is to protect and save lives.  All of these measures that we have to endure, such as wearing a mask and taking a step back, are about saving lives.  The nursing home is in dire straits.  We are talking about the tracing and testing capability of the HSE but we also need to ensure we are supporting private nursing homes so they will have adequate staff, especially when staff are testing positive.  As Senator Murphy pointed out, it is an emergency ask.  I that this be raised with the Minister for Health so a request can be made of the HSE that it allocate resources urgently.  I assume it is through primary health care so we are talking about Community Healthcare West.  The resources need to be assigned today.  We need the nursing home and the people in such dire straits to be supported.  God forbid that we would have a loved one going through something like that.</p> <p>The other point I want to make is on staying safe at this time because the evenings are getting darker. There was a fatal accident involving a pedestrian this morning outside Strokestown.  All of us are going to be driving, speeding or rushing to where we need to go, but people will be walking with no footpaths in rural areas on dark evenings.  Please be careful; please be safe.  I will work with Senator Murphy on getting support as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We noted quite recently that many members of the public are of the view that off-licences should be closed.  I do not agree but I cannot understand why the Government has not at this stage implemented minimum unit pricing, which is included in the legislation.  There was a big debate on this at the time regarding the prices in the North and South.  At this time, people cannot travel from either jurisdiction given the travel restrictions.  I therefore call on the Leader to liaise with the Minister for Health in order to introduce minimum unit pricing.  The Government should liaise with the authorities in Northern Ireland and reach a joint agreement in this regard.  This is the opportune time to do that.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  Today is the first day of the lockdown. Everybody working in front-line services obviously has our support but I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to address, with Dublin Bus, the provision of public bus services in the city.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ordinarily a Dublin Bus double-decker will carry more than 100 passengers but because of the restrictions only 17 passengers will be allowed on them.  We encourage parents and children use the public bus service to go to school.  During the lockdown earlier this year, we had good weather and children were home from school, but we are now entering the period of worse weather, darker mornings, afternoons and evenings with less capacity on the buses.  I am not asking Dublin Bus to do anything that would be in any way dangerous for either the drivers or the passengers but we need to ensure the full capacity of the bus service is made available to commuters in the city.  The Leader will know that people commute from County Meath and far beyond the city.  However, by the time the buses get to the Navan Road, Cabra or Drumcondra the city commuters cannot actually board.  It was not too bad this morning because although it was cold, it was dry but it will be lashing rain soon enough.  We need to ensure everything is being done to maximise capacity on the Dublin Bus service.</p></speech>

Should it read "to be taken at 1.30 p.m. or 15 minutes after the conclusion of No. 1 or whichever is later"?</p></speech>

The next number of weeks are probably going to be difficult not just for the operations of this House and the D&aacute;il but for every Irish citizen.  We woke up this morning with level 5 imposed on us.  Senators Murphy and Dolan brought the impact and reality of this virus home to us with clarity, when they described the information released this morning on the nursing home in County Roscommon, on the County Galway border.  It shows us how dangerous and precarious things are.  Precarious does not even come close to describing how the families of the residents and staff must be feeling this morning.  When we finish voting here, the first call I will make will be to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and Mr. Paul Reid to ensure the services are put in.</p> <p>There were many requests for debates this morning.  Depending on how we sit over the next couple of weeks I will try to accommodate them, particularly those related to Covid, given the Covid committee is no longer sitting.  However, we need to be cognisant of the health and the welfare of all the people who keep these Houses running.  To that end, I want to put on record my genuine appreciation for the officials, ushers, catering staff and absolutely everybody who tirelessly come in here every day to keep these Houses running and to help us and support us in doing our jobs.  I will, however, arrange for debates to be facilitated as quickly as I can.</p> <p>Last week Senator Craughwell, who is not in the Chamber, asked for a debate on education and I committed to providing that.  I tried to arrange for the Minister for Education and Skills to come to us today but unfortunately she had a very busy schedule.  She will, hopefully, be back to us the week after next for a debate on substitute teachers.  A number of colleagues said this morning that it is very easy for us to be appreciative of our healthcare workers, which we are, but I am always fascinated by the divide and very contentious debate when we talk about our teachers.  I really find it fascinating.  I do not think I was particularly lucky with the teachers my four children have had, and continue to have.  The commitment teachers show not only to education and the quality of education but to the overall well-being of all our students is second to none.  When I see the debate becoming vicious towards teachers, suggesting they are being precious about their own healthcare and well-being and that of their children, I get somewhat angry.  Perhaps that is not justified but I do not want a society where we all start pitting ourselves against each other.  Whether we are all at different levels of being "in it together", we all must experience the same precautions and engage in the same activity and behaviour to protect ourselves, our families and each other.  I do not think turning on particular sections of society is in any way helpful.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we sit for a substantial time during the six weeks of lockdown, a debate with numerous Ministers about Covid and its related issues would be helpful &ndash; I do not mean this disrespectfully &ndash; in holding people to account in the absence of us going about our normal daily schedule, given that we will be told to work from home as much as possible.  I will facilitate that debate.</p><p>We will not be in a position to vote for the proposed amendment.  Senator Boyhan raised this request last week as well.  We are working in an extraordinary time.  There are not just Covid restrictions, but also other obstacles to running our business normally.  We are not in our own Chamber because of objections from certain quarters.  We have no guarantee that we will be in this Chamber on any day except, perhaps, a Friday.  Even that is not guaranteed, given that the D&aacute;il might choose to sit in this Chamber every single day.  Schedules change at very short notice.  This week's schedule was issued yesterday at lunchtime.  It was again issued today at 10.23 a.m.  Based on interactions with the Seanad Office, there was a slight change at 11.20 a.m.  The Cathaoirleach highlighted the exact wording a second ago.</p><p>I ask Senators for a little latitude and understanding.  These are not normal times.  Our officials and staff are working flat out to ensure that we can try to hold Ministers to account by having this House and the Lower House functioning as much as possible.  However, there are constraints, and they are not just the obvious ones owing to Covid.  I will continue trying to provide as much space for debates as I can, but I am cognisant of the fact that we need to mind not only our own health, but the health of those who support and work with us to keep these Chambers open on a daily basis.</p></speech>

I oppose this section because it proposes to extend section 6(4) of the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994 in a way that allows for the participation of limited partners in an advisory committee or gives limited partners the right to appoint someone to this position.  This creates the new possibility of giving a limited partner the power to take part in the business of an investment partnership in a way that could challenge the distinction between a limited partner and a general partner.  The rationale for the extension of this safe harbour should be clarified.  It creates the risk that the general partner will be de facto controlled by the limited partner without later engaging their responsibility.  I want this on the record so that I can propose some amendments to section 7 on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Minister has described the legislation as a key part of the Ireland for Finance strategy.  He stated, &quot;Ireland's success in attracting top-tier global financial services is set against an increasingly dynamic and competitive backdrop.&quot;<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are essentially talking about passing a law to better facilitate the growth of private investment in this country and to allow these investment funds to come together to further seek and achieve greater profitability.  This is a key and explicit policy goal for the Government.  My amendments propose to set the kinds of conditions we will expect in return.  I echo some of the concerns expressed in recent weeks about the Government's legislative priorities.  I question why legislation like this is being scheduled and is moving through the Houses when we still await many important legislative commitments made in the programme for Government.  It speaks volumes that a law designed to advantage a small number of private investors, operating at an already high level of profitability, is being debated today over other important legislation related to climate change or even the surely more pressing creation of the corporate enforcement authority, all of which are listed on the Government's autumn legislative programme.  It also speaks to something more fundamental about the perspectives underlying the Government that, at a time when global solidarity is so needed and the demands on our Parliament so high due to the pandemic, Members are here debating a law to attract more private investment funds to the country, while at the same time nothing is being offered in many other areas in need of reform.  This needs to be said and I am disappointed that this is the legislation to which priority is being given.</p><p>My amendments relate to the same issue.  If, as a State and as a Parliament, we are going to go so far as to change the law simply so private investment funds can consolidate and further pursue profits, we all want to know what these funds will do in return for the favourable legislative environment we are gifting them.  At a time when Ireland is drawing much attention internationally for being a centre of international tax avoidance by multinational companies and private equity actors, it seems more than fair to ask what these firms offer in return to the real people living here in our communities, beyond direct employment in the firms themselves.  If investment partnerships benefit from the kind of measures contained in the Ireland for Finance strategy and this Bill, they need to be required to pay a social or environmental dividend back to the State in which they operate.</p><p>Amendment No. 2 would empower the Central Bank, when considering applications to allow the formation of a new investment limited partnership, to set conditions that would ensure that the new investment fund partnership actually made a positive contribution to civil, social, economic or cultural life within the State.  If we as the State are going the distance to facilitate the creation of these new legal vehicles, it seems entirely fair that we would ask such funds to also describe how they will use their investment policies to support the lives of citizens and communities living here.  It could be as straightforward as demonstrating they will support local community initiatives and sports clubs.  These funds need to show that they are here not just for the favourable investment climate or low tax rates but that they are willing to work to improve the lives of people in Ireland in exchange for the kind of beneficial legal personalities we give them here.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 is straightforward.  It would give the Central Bank a role in determining the degree to which the investment policies of a new proposed investment partnership would support initiatives that contribute to our efforts to fight climate change.  It is ironic that he is no longer a Member of the House, as it was former Senator Michael D'Arcy who actually inspired the tabling of this amendment.  He did so on Second Stage, when he commented that: "investors are [significantly] ahead of everyone else ... because, If we destroy the world through climate change, there will be no world economy".  Through this amendment, I am proposing that if it is the case that the thinking of investors is so well developed and conscious of their investment policies related to the combating of climate change, let us then make it an explicit legal requirement that they must demonstrate this before giving them this favourable legal investment vehicle.  It should be easy for the investors that former Senator D'Arcy was talking about to demonstrate this to an appropriate level to the Central Bank.  Consequently, I am proposing that we make it a condition for granting this new form of partnership.</p><p>These are two sensible and straightforward amendments relating to the kinds of conditions we will set before we grant these new investment partnerships to groups of private investment funds.  It seem fair that if the Government plans to give them a favourable legal environment in which to invest, then they should have to demonstrate how they will use these favourable conditions to the common good of the people and communities who live in Ireland and to assist in our collective challenge to combat the climate and biodiversity crisis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope the Minister of State can accept the amendments.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is welcome.  I support these sensible amendments.  Our party is disgusted at the fact that Committee Stage is being curtailed, and effectively guillotined, today.  Was former Senator D'Arcy not right in what he said about investors being way ahead?</p> <p>When I asked the Minister of State about something last time, he promised he would have an answer today.  Was a lobbying document from the industry submitted to the Minister of State's Department and was there a refusal to release same?  I would appreciate an answer.</p></speech>

Interestingly, this is our third debate on Committee Stage.  One Senator complained that we were not giving it enough time and said that we should not conclude it today whereas the previous speaker complained about us giving it too much time and asked whether it was a reflection of Government policy that we were spending so much time on this type of legislation rather than other legislation that people might consider more necessary at this time.  I have been given two conflicting views about the time afforded this, our third session on Committee Stage.</p> <p>I will give a general answer to the question on freedom of information, FOI, requests.  Where an FOI request is made in respect of any matter, including this, a decision is made to refuse, grant or part grant that information.  If someone is not satisfied with the response, he or she has the option of appealing the decision.  Regarding the situation Senator Gavan raised, my understanding is that a decision was made and that the requester has not made an appeal on same.  The requester had the option of pursuing the matter but did not take it.  That is the end of the request if the requester does not want to pursue the matter by way of appeal.  If my understanding is wrong, then I will correct it on Report Stage, but there currently is no live application under the Freedom of Information Act for consideration in respect of this Bill in the Department.  One application was made and dealt with and has not been pursued.  That is the end of the story.  I cannot add anything further beyond outlining the facts of the situation.</p> <p>While I understand where Senator Ruane is coming from with her amendments, I am not able to accept them because the Bill incorporates much of their spirit and content.  I will elaborate.  My reasoning has two parts - first, the role of the Central Bank and the EU and, second, the forthcoming EU legislation on sustainable investment.</p> <p>The Cental Bank is responsible for the authorisation and supervision of investment funds established in Ireland.  As such, it is not a matter for the Oireachtas to set out the rules and conditions of any investment fund.  That is why we have a Central Bank, which is the regulator.  It will approve or not approve the particular proposals put to it.  It is not a matter for the Oireachtas to adjudicate on the investment priorities of individual funds except to say that they must operate within the legislative guidelines, the Central Bank's regulatory rules, the EU's rules and any forthcoming EU legislation on sustainable investments.  The Central Bank's mandate is to protect the best interests of consumers and supervise regulated funds.  It cannot require an investment fund to invest in a certain manner or with a particular objective.</p> <p>However, I hope that the second part of my reasoning will provide some comfort that there is EU legislation covering investment funds.  It focuses on sustainable investment and investment funds with an environmental, social or governance objective.  The European social entrepreneurship funds regulation, EuSEF, already provides a regulatory framework for funds with a social investment objective.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That already exists at EU level and we are bound by it.  An investment limited partnership may be established under the regulations that would be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Another EU regulation on sustainability disclosures in the financial services sector was recently agreed and it will apply from March of the coming year in regard to any funds established under this legislation.</p><p>Overall, the EU legislation provides for a comprehensive package of measures aimed at directing private sector finance towards mitigation of climate change and other environmental threats, which is very important.  It will have an impact on investment funds, regardless of whether they label their financial products as green.  Under EU regulations, there is already provision in regard to ensuring funds can come under the sustainable development heading and the green environment heading.  I do not have to repeat that it is also an opportunity to increase employment here in Ireland by providing this service.  All in all, I think the spirit of what the Deputy is talking about is already enshrined in the original legislation and, on that basis, I am not in a position to accept the two amendments.</p></speech>

It again goes to one of the fundamental problems and concerns I have with the Bill, which is that it can effectively represent a reduction in liability for limited partners.  At the same time, section 7, on which we divided the House, gives very meaningful powers, including powers in regard to boards, to limited partners while they are protected.  Again, they are getting the power but not the responsibility.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Specifically, this amendment proposes that a majority of partners be calculated as a simple majority whereas the Bill proposes that a majority of limited partners will be "calculated by reference to the value of contributions of the limited partners at the time the determination of that majority falls to be made".  Effectively there could be one individual who is a limited partner, is protected from liabilities, who, and because he or she has a majority of such section of the shares that sit with limited partners, is calling the shots while avoiding responsibility and culpability.  That is a real concern that I have, which is why I would prefer a simple majority of limited partners be calculated rather than a situation whereby the value of contributions determines that.  I do not want to have a situation of a silent partner or power behind the power.</p><p>While I have not tabled amendments on section 14, which is around the withdrawal and substitution of general partners, I will reserve the right to come back on that question in that section.  What we do not want is, for example, a limited partner who remains constant while general partners change.  That is my concern on that amendment.</p></speech>

The structure of the investment limited partnership is not based on one partner, one vote.  That is the essence of this Bill.  People can invest different amounts into an investment limited partnership, so the essence of this legislation is that the majority should not be calculated based on one partner, one vote, but should be based on their contributions.</p> <p>If I could draw the analogy, it is a bit like a person who has shares in a company.  Every single shareholder does not have an equal vote.  It is based on the number of shares that shareholders own in the company.  It is not a mutual society like a building society where everybody has one vote.  In trying to explain it, I would say that the situation is more akin, although not exactly, to shareholders at a meeting.  Some people have more shares than others, and therefore get more votes at an AGM.</p> <p>The structure of the investment limited partnership is not based on one partner, one vote.  It is based on the contribution of partners, as outlined in the partnership agreement, which is clearly stated.  When a person agrees to invest in a partnership, he or she knows the agreement being entered into, which is based on the size of his or her contribution.  That determines the person's relative position rather than it being a mutual partnership in which every person has one vote.  It is based on the person's contribution and is therefore akin to the situation of a company shareholder and the number of shares that person holds in a particular company.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

At present, the Bill simply requires that a statutory declaration be made that the general partner had not been notified of any order or resolution to wind up or liquidate, and similarly, that the general partner had not been notified of the appointment of a liquidator or similar person.  I am proposing to extend that provision because it is crucial that such a statutory declaration should also be able to confirm that no limited partner has been notified of an intention to liquidate or appoint a liquidator.  This proposal reflects my concern that there is real power without responsibility and culpability here.  I do not want us to end up with a statutory declaration where, in theory, the general partner can claim it did not know of the appointment of a liquidator even though an active limited partner, possibly a board member, may have been aware of such a situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#JJJ00400"><p>This amendment relates to a statutory declaration that a general partner must make on a migration-out stating that it has not been notified of a resolution or other order to wind up the investment limited partnership.  It seeks to add a provision that the general partner is not aware of a notification made to a limited partner of a resolution to wind up the investment limited partnership.</p><p>The problem with this proposed amendment is that the role of the limited partner must be distinguished from that of the general partner in this legislation.  It is essentially one of the key cornerstones of this legislation that the general partner is the person responsible for the running of the partnership and the limited partner's role is limited and it has no role in the management or decision-making roles of the investment limited partnership.</p><p>Section 6 of the 1994 Act prohibits a limited partner from taking part in the conduct of the business, as I have said.  In contrast, the general partner's role is to conduct the affairs of the investment limited partnership.  The role of the limited partner is, therefore, restricted to that of a passive investor.  Consequently, a limited partner cannot have a role with regard to winding up the investment limited partnership.  Limited partners are passive investors.  To take on such a role would mean that a limited partner is taking on a management role acting as a general partner and this would entail the loss of limited liability.  That is the essence of it.  Limited partners are passive investors, not participants in the management of the investment limited partnership.</p><p>Finally, notification to wind up should be served or made to a general partner.  If this is not done, the service would not be considered properly made and would arguably be ineffective <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the investment limited partnership.  A notice of liquidation served on a limited partner would not be valid in any event.</p></speech>

That is my concern.  I note that this entire section - section 40, in relation to the migration-out - relates to the question of funds moving location as convenient.  It relates to that concern we might have of chasing services or products on offer elsewhere.  I reserve the right to bring forward similar amendments, and indeed wider amendments looking at the question of the changing of jurisdiction or the migration-out of partnerships, on Report Stage.</p></speech>

There may be an argument to be made in certain circumstances &mdash; we need to interrogate these &mdash; about not having cross-liability between different sub-funds.  An example would be where there is a large number of pension schemes.  Regardless of the lack of cross-liability, I am concerned that there is no upward liability.  The umbrella fund should be liable for the failure of a sub-fund to deliver.  My amendment would leave the lack of cross-liability between sub-funds but remove the excuse for the overall fund not being subject to upward liability.  I will be proposing much more specific measures because we see these products at work in Luxembourg and elsewhere.  We must learn from the problems and concerns regarding these products.</p></speech>

If accepted, it would adversely affect the segregation of liability between the sub-funds that this legislation seeks to establish.  It would result in inconsistency between other investment funds' legal structures which are currently available in Ireland and it would expose investors to the risk of cross-contamination of liability between unconnected sub-funds.  Each sub-fund will hold a separate pool of assets whereby the liabilities of one sub-fund will be segregated from those of another.  What the Senator suggests means that certain sub-funds could be liable for others although they have no direct involvement in them.  Segregated liability ring-fences the assets and liabilities of each sub-fund, and the structure is available to all other regulated fund vehicles in the country.  This process is in line with the normal process to date.</p> <p>On the section, I may table a technical amendment on Report Stage to correct typographical error in the printed Bill, which refers to "limited partners".</p></speech>

The spread of Covid-19 has created an unprecedented situation both in Ireland and globally.  I do not believe it is possible to overstate how serious a threat Covid-19 continues to pose to our economy, society, health and wellbeing.  To date, Ireland has recorded over 53,422 cases and, sadly, 1,868 deaths.  I know this House will wish to extend its sympathies to the bereaved families and friends of all who have lost loved ones.  </p> <p>When the Government brought this legislation before the Oireachtas six months ago we were really at the start of what has turned out to be a continuously evolving and uncertain journey.  While we managed to suppress the virus to very low levels of transmission over the summer, recent trends and the current disease profile are very concerning.  All indicators of disease incidence and severity have continued to worsen in recent weeks.  In the last week alone we have had almost 9,000 cases and the national 14-day incidence rate now stands at 291 per 100,000.  We have also seen outbreaks of Covid-19 continue to occur in the community, hospitals and, most worryingly, in long-term residential care settings.  In response to the rapidly deteriorating epidemiological situation across the country, this week the Government has had to make some very difficult decisions to protect public health by moving the entire country for the next six weeks to level 5 of the plan for living with Covid-19.</p> <p>While progress has been made in terms of the development of possible vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, it is internationally accepted that Covid-19 will continue to represent a grave public health threat in the medium term.  Unfortunately, this means that there is still a need for non-pharmaceutical public health measures of the kind that came into effect overnight and are facilitated by this legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Ireland is not alone in this crisis.  Indeed, all across Europe and much of the rest of the world, Covid-19 infections are on the rise and increasingly countries are having to introduce more restrictive measures in response.  I fully accept that these measures place extraordinary limitations on lives and livelihoods, limiting who we can meet, how far we can travel and requiring some businesses and services to close their doors.  Government does not take these decisions lightly and always seeks to balance all considerations, including public health, economic and societal, to ensure that any measures taken are proportionate to the level of threat, but regrettably we need to retain these measures as part of our national response.  They proved essential in allowing us to suppress the virus in the first half of this year and they will do so again.  Critically, they will support us in protecting our key priorities of maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and, above all, protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.</p><p>These laws are necessary for now, and their main aim is to protect people and save lives.  However, in the spirit of proportionality, I recognise that the extension of these extraordinary measures must be temporary, and I will repeal them as soon as it is safe to do so.  I assure Senators that they will be continually reviewed and assessed in light of emerging evidence.  Therefore, I am proposing an extension of seven months up to 9 June 2021, as this is in line with the timeline of the Government's medium-term strategy, Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with Covid-19.  I am asking Senators to support this motion.</p><p>I turn now to the extension to the measures in the emergency measures Act amending the Mental Health Act.  The measures in Part 5 of this Act amend the Mental Health Acts 2001-2018, specifically relating to the role of independent consultant psychiatrists and the holding of mental health tribunals.  Mental health tribunals are made up of a solicitor or barrister, who acts as chairperson, a consultant psychiatrist and a layperson.  Tribunals review the detention of every person involuntarily admitted and detained under the Mental Health Act within 21 days of admission and thereafter every three or six months.  The tribunal either affirms the order detaining the patient or refuses it, following which the patient is released.</p><p>The Mental Health Commission, the independent regulator of mental health services in the State, approached the Department of Health in March of this year to raise its concerns over the need to ensure that these tribunals continue and that each patient's right to a review of his or her case is protected.  In addition, there was a need to protect the health of both patients and healthcare staff and to ensure that the potential for Covid contamination was minimised.</p><p>Following detailed discussion with the commission and the HSE, the Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, introduced the measures to ensure that these tribunals could continue.  These measures provide for a cascading approach to the role of the independent consultant psychiatrist and mental health tribunals.  This approach means that, where possible, the current system of review is conducted as normal.  In the event where, due to Covid, this is not possible, alternative measures are in place to protect the rights of the patient.  The measures allow a consultant psychiatrist conducting an independent examination of an involuntarily detained patient to do so remotely in scenarios where a personal examination cannot take place.  They also provide for mental health tribunals, the bodies which review the detention of every involuntary patient, to consist of only the chairperson if members cannot attend due to the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>I emphasise that all patients are examined in person by their responsible treating consultant psychiatrist at the point of admission and throughout their care, as appropriate.  The independent examination by a second consultant psychiatrist still takes place, be it in person or remotely.  The Mental Health Commission has been monitoring the implementation of the new measures on an ongoing basis.  It has informed the Department that the new measures have worked well overall given the circumstances and that, while the current situation is not ideal, it has ensured that the rights of patients are upheld and that every patient has received his or her hearing.</p><p>As of this week, no one-person tribunals have been required, and the full complement of a legal professional, a consultant psychiatrist and a layperson has reviewed all involuntary detentions, either remotely or in person.  This, however, does not lessen the requirement to have these contingency measures in place since they may yet be required to protect the health of both patients and front-line healthcare staff.  Furthermore, other supports have been provided to patients during this period, including the additional involvement of interpreters and the use of videoconferencing for interactions with legal representatives and the independent consultant psychiatrist.</p><p>I reiterate that both resolutions propose a new date for the sunset clause of 9 June 2021, and these measures will not be continued indefinitely.  The measures are also subject to ongoing review.  I note that the temporary measures may be ended earlier by ministerial order should the public health situation improve to such a point that the measures are no longer needed.</p><p>The measures temporarily amending the Mental Health Act must continue beyond 9 November as part of our efforts to protect our most vulnerable and our healthcare workers.  The proposal to extend the measures is supported by both the HSE and the Mental Health Commission.  I ask all Deputies to support the continuation of these measures in a timely manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1630" speakername="Catherine Ardagh" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#QQQ00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House today.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il support the extension of the sunset clauses for both Part 5 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 and Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020.</p> <p>Regrettably, the ongoing presence of Covid-19 still presents a significant public health emergency and poses a considerable threat to human life.  The latest Covid figures, as the Minister of State outlined, showed yesterday that three additional deaths were recorded.  That brings the total of deaths in Ireland to 1,868 people, that is, 1,868 families who have been affected directly by Covid-19.  As of midnight, Tuesday, 20 October, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, has been notified of 1,167 confirmed Covid cases and there is now a total of 53,422 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.  As of 2 p.m. on Wednesday, 314 Covid patients were hospitalised, 34 of whom are in intensive care units, ICU.  There were 27 additional hospitalisations in the previous 24 hours.  All of this is extremely worrying.</p> <p>On 20 March last, the previous Seanad of which I was a Member was convened on an emergency basis to discuss the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, as outlined.  Not many amendments were made.  However, the Seanad brought forward and included the sunset clause, the extension of which we support today, which puts a temporary timeframe limitation on these emergency powers that the Government is introducing.</p> <p>Many people are directly affected by these regulations.  It is not ideal to have to enact them.  They include restrictions on moving from geographical areas, restrictions on working, the prohibition of events, and introducing safeguards in central workplaces, such as our own, schools and cr&egrave;ches so that they can continue.</p> <p>Ultimately, there is a significant societal impact.  There are significant mental health pressures on many people in society, not only the elderly living alone.  Those who have businesses are massively impacted.  Some businesses managed to scrape through the previous lockdown but, unfortunately, they may not survive the next period because it is uncertain when, in fact, it will end.</p> <p>The Government has included considerable financial supports, from extending the wage subsidy schemes and the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  These may not be enough to help the small businesses throughout the country.  It is regrettable and upsetting that the virus has had such a stronghold on us, not only in Ireland but across Europe.  These measures are obvious important in the face of this public health risk but the outcomes, every which way we look at it, are disastrous.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Catherine Ardagh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2473"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2473&amp;amp;pid=CatherineArdagh&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Many of us have our own ideas and would say that if we were in government, we would have done X, Y and Z, and would have imposed curfews or fines earlier.  Ultimately, however, when faced with the decisions on protecting public health and the economy, these decisions are hard made and they are not made quickly.  A lot of consideration and thought are put into these types of decisions to ensure there is a balance between protecting public health and the economy, with public health supreme, as it should be. </p><p>I support the emergency measures in regard to allowing mental health tribunals to continue in a Covid environment.  We know psychiatric reports can be done on a remote basis, which is welcomed by the HSE, by psychiatrists and by members of the tribunal, who have asked that this temporary measure be extended.  We are happy to support that and the details have been outlined by the Minister.  Over the Covid period, we have seen there has not been a drop in the work of the mental health tribunals and the increase in their work shows the worth of these temporary measures.</p><p>We in Fianna F&aacute;il support the extension.  I am glad to hear the Minister of State say that if the public health situation changes before June, she will recommend these measures are revoked, which is welcome.  Hopefully, we are not here before 9 June to extend them again. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#RRR00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, back to the House.  Of course, we would prefer if she was here in better circumstances.  We think back to last March, when we passed the emergency legislation in the Seanad.  The sunset clause was an amendment that was put into the legislation and we were looking at a timeline of November.  That was how optimistic people were that we would get this virus under control, and that this public health emergency would be under control and well on the way to recovery, but, sadly, that is not the case.  Sadly, the situation in October is that in excess of 50,000 people have contracted Covid-19 and we have lost more than 2,000 people on the island of Ireland.  It is appropriate that we would send our sympathies to the families of the people who, sadly and tragically, have lost their lives to this awful disease.  To the 50,000 people who picked it up, we wish them well.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we are back here to deal with the sunset clause and it is appropriate that we would extend it until next June.  I am glad the Minister of State has given an undertaking that if the public health emergency is dealt with, if we are fortunate enough that a vaccine is found, if this six-week period results in a flattening of the curve and if, post-Christmas, we are on the road to recovery from this virus, she will look to delete the sunset clause and will come back to the House to do that.  However, it is appropriate at this time that we would extend it to next June.</p> <p>Of course, this is emergency legislation.  It is legislation that would not be brought through these Houses except for the public health emergency.  It is a once-in-a-generation situation and we have not had such an emergency in close to 100 years, since the Spanish flu.  We are here in a time of crisis that we wish we were not in.</p> <p>The good that is coming out of this is that people do pull together.  The goodness, strength of character and determination of people will shine through and is already shining through.  We have a very difficult six weeks ahead of us.  I appeal to all the people of Ireland that this is a chance for every single one of us to be leaders.  We all have a part to play in this battle.  All of us in this House are leaders within our communities and leaders in our country.  I have no doubt that, across the House, we will show the type of leadership that we should.  I have no doubt every citizen, when he or she realises the challenges and the difficulties our country faces, as well as the absolute heartbreak that some of our citizens have already faced, will want to protect the vulnerable and the elderly in our communities. </p> <p>We need to get the basics right.  Social distancing means staying 2 m away from people, even if a person is wearing a mask, and coughing and sneezing etiquette and the washing of hands are all things that make a difference.  We have a role to play as leaders.  We all need to use our social media channels to keep pushing the message and pushing the narrative.  We can have all the legislation we want but unless we come together as a nation, we will not succeed. </p> <p>I wish the Minister of State well in the very important portfolio of mental health and its other aspects.  In my capacity as party spokesperson on health in the Seanad, I look forward to working very closely with the Minister of State because I share her goals and aspirations for the Department and for the people of Ireland, particularly those who need the supports and services of the Department.  I look forward to working with her in the next three to four years to rebuild our society and our health service after this crisis.  We will get through this crisis, of that I have no doubt.  The people of Ireland will come together and we will defeat this virus.  Hopefully, in the not too distant future, the scientists and medical experts who are working night and day to find a vaccine will succeed and we will all be able to move on to rebuilding Ireland into the great country it is, has been and will be again.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I strongly object to the extension of the Act conferring power on the Minister to impose lockdown restrictions on the nation from this day until 9 June 2021, as set out in Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020.  These repressive measures have been railroaded through both Houses without adequate time for debate and scrutiny as to whether they are actually necessary and proportionate.</p> <p>As the Government lurches mindlessly into another disastrous lockdown, there are already mutterings from the Taoiseach about future lockdown cycles in the new year and beyond.  Lockdowns prolong and increase the suffering of everyone.  When is the Government going to learn this lesson?  Is it when the people and the State are both broke?  Our current hospital waiting lists stand at 1 million people, that is, 1 million people are waiting for a procedure or to see a consultant.  Let that sink in.  The Government is doing its best to ensure the State and small Irish businesses go bust.  It is unforgivable that the Government bases the health and wealth of this nation on football and alcohol.  This minor distraction was only for the public to take their eyes off the game that the Government is failing to play to save the lives and livelihoods of its people. </p> <p>Is the level 5 lockdown all the Government and NPHET can come up with again?  We have 34 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in ICU.  Is the hospital system overwhelmed by Covid-19 or was it ever overwhelmed by Covid-19?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Is a lockdown justified or is it just the only answer because the Government failed to find and provide effective solutions?  Even the WHO does not advocate lockdowns.  It has urged governments to learn how to coexist with the virus in a way that does not require the constant closing down of economies and yet is not associated with high levels of suffering and death.  Our Government is failing to do this.<br/><br/>The Great Barrington declaration has been signed by more than 3,500 eminent scientists and doctors.  It sets out a balanced, science-based strategy of focused protection to deal with the pandemic.  Essentially, protective measures must be focused on high-risk groups - the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions.  The Government failed to protect the vulnerable early in the pandemic, with more than half of deaths in care homes.  At the same time, it did immense harm to the health, social life and economic and cultural fabric of the nation with a lockdown.  This morning in Galway, 26 out of 28 nursing home residents have been diagnosed with Covid and only one nurse and one carer have been available for the past 72 hours because all other staff have tested positive.  It is unconscionable that a GP would have to resort to Twitter to get help for this nursing home from the Minister for Health.<br/><br/>The latest fiasco in tracing is just another calamity for the Government.  Why are the Department of Health and the HSE not on the same page?  Does the left hand not know what the right hand is doing?  Why did the HSE hide the tracing mess from the Minister?  Why is the school tracing and reporting system so slow?  In the north east, only one phone line is available in HSE offices to answer queries from schools in Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.<br/><br/>Like the previous Government, this Government is mortgaging the nation's future to the tune of some &euro;50 billion in pursuit of a flawed lockdown policy.  My children and grandchildren will be paying for this woeful negligence.  Compliance with a lockdown cannot last forever, particularly in a free and democratic society.  The measures proposed by the Government last night and now before the House to fine people for breach of lockdown rules are a step too far.  How many in rural Ireland live more than 5 km from major supermarkets?  There is real fear among the people of the nation this morning.  The distance must be extended to 10 km.  No home can be entered by garda&iacute; without a warrant - let us be clear about that.<br/><br/>This motion continues the amendment to the Mental Health Act up until 9 June 2021.  Could a workable solution not have been found to deal with the people suffering mental health issues who are currently detained under the Act?  The Government had even admitted until this week that everything was working fine and these measures might not need to come into effect.  Why include them in the Act if they will not be needed?  Surely psychiatrists and tribunals could perform examinations with the PPE available to all medical professions.<br/><br/>Once again, this legislation is being rushed through the House with little or no thought for the people it will affect or their human rights.  The Government came up with a plan to live with Covid.  Compliance with that plan has proven unsuccessful in bringing the public with us, so now the Government is reverting to plan A, which is a lockdown.  Punish the people.<br/><br/>The Living with Covid plan could have been tweaked to ensure public buy in and that the spirit of the nation was with us.  All politicians failed in our messaging.  Some of us have displayed reckless behaviour and it is no wonder that we failed to bring the public with us.  Heavy-handed policing and the imposition of <i>ad hoc</i>fines is not the way to encourage people to limit their social contacts.  We have to learn to live with the virus, not merely exist in a state of indefinite lockdowns.  This is not living.  We must do better for the people of Ireland.</p></speech>

I have spoken to a number of people in recent weeks, and there is no doubt that they are stretched beyond the call of duty.  Our thanks and appreciation continue to go to everyone across all levels of the health service.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, and much like many other countries throughout the world, our society has been in a state of emergency for many reasons.  This has had an adverse effect on the mental health and emotional well-being of the people of this nation and further afield.  Much was uncertain at the beginning of the emergency and there is still a great deal of fear.  Indeed, the virus has caused unprecedented levels of fear and anxiety among our communities.  Generally speaking, people of all ages and gender have responded well to the pandemic.  They have correctly played their part in being responsible and responding positively to the measures taken by the Government in Dublin and the Government in Belfast.  It has not been easy for them to do so.  No one should underestimate the stress and strain on families and individuals living in the highly restricted set of circumstances required to live with the virus until there is a vaccine.  Therefore, it is important that any emergency measure be clearly time limited and subject to review by the Government on a credible ongoing basis.</p> <p>We supported the emergency legislation seven months ago because it was understandable.  There were many unknowns and a great deal of panic and we did not have enough information on the virus.  The legislation gave the Minister for Health sweeping discretionary powers.  This extraordinary situation was an immediate and necessary response at the time.  However, it is for this House and the Lower House, not individual Ministers, to legislate day-to-day for the people.  For that reason, Sinn F&eacute;in is proposing an amendment to reduce the length of time until the review of the emergency legislation from June 2021 to February.  We believe firmly that it is prudent to do so.</p> <p>This morning, my party colleague, Deputy Cullinane, spoke about the need for the Government to work better with us, the Opposition.  I reiterate that point.  Due to the nature of the decision-making process that was given to the Minister and his Department by the emergency legislation, we have found ourselves being asked to support Government decisions without having relevant information in advance or the time to scrutinise same.  We cannot allow this practice to continue.  As legislators, we need to be able to scrutinise properly the Minister and the Department on their many significant decisions that are having a major impact on workers, families and businesses.</p> <p>It has been very difficult to get any information from the Minister, the Department or the HSE on all-Ireland co-operation.  It is prudent that the Government in Dublin and the Government in Belfast regularly review together all aspects of managing the impact of the virus, although not just in the area of health, crucial though that is to the preservation of life and health.  In that regard, I will raise the importance of this country being effectively treated as one unit when it comes to the measures needed to control and combat the virus.  The full resources of both Governments must be aligned and co-ordinated to ensure that there is no area across the island where the virus is free to wreak havoc on people.</p> <p>I wish to discuss the system of contact tracing in Border constituencies.  I have been concerned for some time that the testing and tracing systems here and in the North are falling short of what is required to control the virus in those constituencies.  Several times in recent months, I have asked questions in the Seanad and written to the Minister for Health in Dublin and the Minister of Health in Belfast asking for information about their respective systems of testing and tracing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Elisha McCallion:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ElishaMcCallion&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To this day, I have not received relevant information from either jurisdiction, which gives me any comfort to suggest that there is anywhere near enough sharing of information that allows appropriate contact tracing for those of us who live in Border constituencies and cross the Border daily.</p><p>This is absolutely unacceptable.  We want to help the Minister in trying to deal with the virus, but he needs to give us the tools and information we need in order to do our job.  We cannot continue to work in the manner in which we have been doing with his Government for the past number of months, lacking in information and being unable to scrutinise legislation properly.  It is with that in mind that I will press the two amendments moved by our party.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Labour Party,  I wish to express my enormous sympathy to all of those affected by Covid-19. This includes the families and loved ones of the more than 1,800 people who have sadly died, and to the many who continue to suffer, who have had Covid and are still suffering with the after effects of what is being referred to as long Covid.  I also express my admiration for, and solidarity with, our front-line workers.</p> <p>We all recognise the enormous public health threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Labour Party has offered constructive opposition over the past few months.  We supported the emergency legislation we are debating today back in March, but we also tabled amendments seeking to secure a sunset clause, and we were glad to see that sunset clause was inserted into the legislation.  However, at this point, we cannot support the extension that is proposed for seven months.  We have not been given adequate time to scrutinise these motions or, indeed, the basis for them.  We saw the regulations signed by the Minister at 11.50 p.m. last night, SI 448 of 2020.  These are detailed regulations containing extensive penal provisions, with draconian powers extended.  I know that the regulations are only to last until 1 December 2020, but if that is the case, why are we seeking to extend these measures for seven months?</p> <p>As a result of that, I was happy to second the amendment moved by Sinn F&eacute;in to shorten the extension to February 2021, rather than having a long extension for seven months to June 2021.  There is no difficulty in the Minister coming back to the House in the interim, for example, in February, if indeed a longer extension is needed.  We must be given time to debate the issue then.  However, it is entirely inappropriate to debate this legislation in such a way that we have six minutes each to debate two motions containing extraordinary extensions of powers.  Even in a pandemic, can we not give a little more time for parliamentary scrutiny?</p> <p>The Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, has rightly criticised the railroading through, not only of these motions, but of the other legislation that we will consider under guillotine tomorrow.  Tomorrow four guillotines will be imposed on legislation and one is being imposed today.  The health Bill being debated tomorrow proposes to introduce on-the-spot fines.  The Labour Party is not convinced that that is necessary.  There is capacity in the District Court and there are existing procedures through the District Court to enable the implementation of the penal provisions.  We are not convinced of the evidence that these on-the-spot fines are necessary.</p> <p>We have supported the Government to try to get through this pandemic together, and we have tried to do so in a constructive manner.  We supported the Living with Covid framework when it was introduced, but we have expressed serious concerns about the way in which it has been implemented, about Government communication as to the move between levels and the rapid move from level 3 up to level 5 without, it seemed, sufficient consideration of alternatives.  We are all very conscious of the massive impact that this week's level 5 restrictions have for so many people, including workers, businesses and families.  What has been lacking, particularly in the past few weeks, has been any sense of a coherent and planned exit strategy, that is, a point at which we can say that the curve is sufficiently flattened and we can move incrementally between the levels of restriction, as were supposed to do.  If we are to live with Covid, then that is what we must do.</p> <p>This week the Taoiseach ruled out the zero Covid strategy, which was being proposed by some very eminent scientists and medics.  In order to implement such a strategy we would have needed a coherent all-Island approach, which was not evident, unfortunately.  The summer was a missed opportunity, when we had brought down levels of infection and reduced the R number to a point at which it would have been containable, had we put in place the contact tracing system that we clearly need and which broke down so unfortunately at the weekend, and had we put in place a system of rapid testing.  Deputy Alan Kelly has asked repeatedly in the D&aacute;il about why we do not have a proper rapid testing system and a contact tracing system in place.  We know that track and test is the only way.  If we are not adopting a zero Covid strategy and we are to live with the virus, we must ensure that we have an exit strategy to come out of this level of unsustainable, severe restrictions.  We must have a point at which we can say that the virus is containable and we have enough contact tracers in position that we can identify, move and tackle any outbreaks where they occur.  That is what we failed to do in the last flattening of the curve.  We cannot fail people this time.</p> <p>We have six weeks now, and we will work with all in government, our front-line workers and society to ensure that this works, however we need to be given a coherent strategy to ensure that it does.  We have supported the Minister of State and the Government in keeping schools and childcare open, which is hugely significant and important.  We have supported reasonable measures where the evidence is clear, but we cannot support open-ended extensions for seven months without adequate time to debate and scrutinise them and without a clear plan and timeframe for coming out of this level of restrictions.</p> <p>We will have an opportunity to speak on the health Bill tomorrow, albeit very briefly, because we have two and a half hours to pass All Stages of the Bill because there is a guillotine, which is most unfortunate.  Through the regulations and the extension motions railroaded through today and the Bill tomorrow, we are going to see the blunt instrument of criminal law being used to try to encourage social solidarity.  In my view, as a criminal lawyer, that is not the most effective means to tackle Covid-19.  What we have seen over the past seven or eight months is enormous social solidarity, goodwill, efforts and energy put in by so many people to suppress Covid.  A much better way to build social solidarity is to ensure that we bring people with us and that we have continued goodwill, rather than to use the blunt instrument of the criminal law.</p></speech>

I have to remind myself we are in the D&aacute;il Chamber in which the Seanad is sitting for the purposes of this exercise.  I read the Minister of State's speech.  It is clear and is unambiguous, and I thank her for that.  I also acknowledge the enormous work of the ICCL, not only on this legislation, but on other legislation that is coming before the House.</p> <p>These are critical times for all of us.  There is a crisis and a pandemic, and an emergency response was made.  I remember the day when the then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, came to the Seanad to explain to us what we were facing, and nobody believed it.  We were shocked and we thought it might be something that would last for a few weeks or maybe a month or two.  Here we are many months later and the pandemic seems to be worse.  Nobody had a faint of idea where we would end up.</p> <p>My concern relates to the Mental Health Commission, so that is the only area on which I will dwell today.  The Minister of State said in her speech that the Mental Health Commission, the independent regulator for mental health services in the State, approached the Department back in March 2020 to raise its concerns about the need to ensure that mental health tribunals continued, and that each patient's rights to a review in his or her case were protected.  That is a powerful statement.  We know the emergency provisions introduced earlier this year are due to expire on 9 November 2020 as per the sunset clause for which many of us argued at the time.  There was some doubt at that stage as to whether we would even have a sunset clause.</p> <p>The HSE and the Mental Health Commission wanted to extend it, or they considered it, and they have now expressed concern.  The ICCL and other organisations and advocates for mental health practices and supports have also expressed concerns.  The commission told the Department of Health that it was worried about the mental health tribunals and the issues it would face.  The Mental Health Commission wanted to ensure that the tribunals would continue, and that patients' rights would be fully protected throughout the process.  We have a duty of care to protect the rights of all citizens in this country.  We particularly have a duty of care in respect of people who are under the care of the Mental Health Commission, which has an independent remit to safeguard these people.  It is important the mental health tribunals proceed as normal, where possible and practical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I accept that there are exceptional circumstances in terms of Covid but where at all practical and possible, we must protect and safeguard the rights of these people.  As pointed out by the Minister of State, a tribunal has three members that are made up of a solicitor, barrister or, indeed, a retired judge as the chair, and a consultant psychiatrist and a layperson.  The membership has been given some thought and is balanced because these are the safeguards and advocates for the system, and all of the people involved.  </p><p>The tribunal reviews admissions or renewal orders for involuntary patients.  The tribunal either affirms the order or, in some cases, refuses it so the process is all open, which is important for protecting people.</p><p>A three-person tribunal is the norm but where that is not possible, as the Minister of State has said, a one-person tribunal comprised of just the chair can be used.  Such a situation may arise due to the unavailability of a consultant or, in this case, issues around Covid but also the cross-contamination of the same people going to another tribunal engaging with another set of circumstances or another group of people, of which I also am mindful.  On the basis of what the Minister of State has said, I am glad to say that it has not been a problem.  There has been an issue with one or two cases but the system seems to have worked well on the whole, which is encouraging.  </p><p>The rationale for the motion is that these are emergency measures.  I think we need to consider a lesser period.  No patient was denied a hearing, if he or she wanted one.  I have not heard of anyone being denied a hearing but it is of concern to me, as I know it is to the Minister of State as the person with responsibility for this whole area.</p><p>The Department states that if the emergency provisions are not extended, consultant psychiatrists and perhaps others will have to attend different approval centres.  Again, I understand those issues.  I have considered this whole issue and talked to the various people involved.  I have also listened to Senators, particularly from the Sinn F&eacute;in Party here today, who have tabled an amendment to shorten the duration of the extension to only extend to 9 February 2021 rather than 9 June 2021, which is a reasonable proposal.  We are here to safeguard.  We are a second Chamber and revise legislation that comes to us from the Lower House of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann because, as politicians, it is our job to be vigilant.  I would like to think that the Minister of State will accept the amendment but I do not know.  She has taken advice from her officials, which I accept and respect.  I find that having reflected on what I have heard in the contributions made here today, I have decided to support the amendment tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in that proposes to shorten the duration of the extension to just 9 February 2021, as opposed to the Government's proposal of 9 June 2021.  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment is reasonable, prudent, cautious and right so I hope that Minister of State is in a position to come somewhere near the proposed date because it makes sense.</p><p>I thank the Minister of State and thank the Senators who made very considered contributions to the debate here today.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  When we initially reviewed the legislation back in March we were in a different situation and, sadly, in some ways we were in a better situation.  While we knew that there was a crisis, and many of us knew it would be a long-term crisis, to some degree we had a clarity of message and purpose, in that we would flatten the curve and during that period we would see a huge investment in ICU capacity.  At the time I pushed for ventilators by asking for enough of them to be purchased, sought greater ICU capacity and called for a huge recruitment drive.  We praised the fact that thousands of people came forward and volunteered to work for the HSE.  It is extraordinary that so many of the people who volunteered for contact tracing and to work in front-line healthcare are still not in our system.</p> <p>We were promised at the time that there would be huge measures to scale up our response and capacity but that did not adequately happen.  As a result, people's trust was damaged.  Moreover, not only did we not use the time as fully as we should have, we did not even follow through on the mission to fully flatten the curve because when we were at the point where the number of cases were very low, and zero Covid was a very real and practical possibility with many experts advising it, we decided to jump a step and to short-circuit.  Again, lobbying by various industries meant that we jumped ahead but were premature.  I was against the loosening of restrictions at that exact moment because zero Covid was in sight.  Trust has been damaged in that context.</p> <p>My group and I understand the severity of this health emergency.  We absolutely send our wishes to all of those who have suffered.  I refer to the 500 people who have gone through ICU, the 1,583 people who have lost their lives and those who live with the long-term effects of Covid.  We also sympathise with the front-line workers.  It is because of all that that we need to hold the Government to account.</p> <p>During the debate in March I raised a number of concerns.  Like many others, I called for the sunset clause.  I also raised specific concerns about the mental health provisions in terms of what supports or advocacy might be involved.  We were given lots of assurances that there would be engagement.  Since the debate, I sent as many as seven queries to the Department of Health and not one of them was answered.  I had to get Deputies to table parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il asking the Minister for Health to respond to my question that it was said would be answered in the D&aacute;il.  He gave a very weak answer in May that the HSE was "finalising protocols and procedures and support arrangements".  I would like the Minister of State present to commit here as to what the channel of communication will be between the Department of Health and Senators.  How can the Government ask us to abdicate our scrutiny?</p> <p>The Government's priorities seem to be somewhat skewed.  I am shocked, frankly, that horse racing and greyhound racing, whose only purpose is to serve the gambling industry, are moving ahead yet women cannot have their partners with them during very difficult maternity situations, including miscarriage.</p> <p>There was a problem in terms of a lack of information in the interim.  We have not been given the information that we need.  There is a real concern that at times the Government seems to lack the information it needs.  Can we be assured there will be proper contact tracing, and not just future contacts but sources?  If not we will be in a cycle forever.</p> <p>Again, it is inappropriate to review these measures without reviewing how the previous powers were used.  It is in that context, recognising the emergency we are in, the severe health circumstances and number of cases, I support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment.  Also, before next February we need to see a review of how the powers given were implemented.  The Government has not earned a seven-month blank cheque in terms of provision in this area.  We can give a three-month extension that allows for proper scrutiny and debate, and a clear robust exchange of information in order that collectively, we can fulfil our responsibility to address the pandemic and these urgent circumstances.</p> <p>I urge the Minister of State to accept the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, as it is a fair and reasonable compromise.  I ask her to commit that she will review how the powers are used and give the information to the Minister.</p> <p>We have been told on a number of occasions that more powers are needed.  Let us be clear.  Ireland has had successes but where it has failed in its response to Covid, it has not been due to an absence of powers but to a failure of policies.  Therefore, those policies must be accountable. </p></speech>

Senator Joe O'Reilly mentioned this morning in his contribution this tragic and upsetting situation.  Since all but three staff tested positive on Tuesday night, only one nurse and two care assistants were available to care for the 27 residents of the nursing home.  We are back in a dreadful place with this morning's news about that nursing home, and I wish to call for the immediate reconvening of the Oireachtas Special Committee on Covid-19 Response and for the Government to treat this issue as the national emergency that it is and to do finally what should have been done more than six months ago, which is to make the residents of nursing homes and other residential settings its top priority in the fight against Covid-19.<br/><br/>As far back as April and May, I and other Members of this House and the D&aacute;il went to great lengths in trying to get the Government to take the issue of Covid in nursing homes seriously.  The word &quot;abandoned&quot; was justifiably used at the time to describe the Government's response regarding its failure to protect the lives of residents of nursing homes during the first wave.  Six months on from that, it is beyond devastating to hear the owner of the nursing home at the centre of today's story reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i>as saying that she feels &quot;totally abandoned&quot; by the State as she comes to terms with trying to save the lives of residents under her care.<br/><br/>It is highly regrettable that some members of the Government parties back in April and May sought to scapegoat individual nursing homes for the deaths of residents rather than accepting that it was, first and foremost, a responsibility of Government to do whatever was needed to safeguard the lives of older people and those most at risk.  That is what the national effort was supposed to be all about.  On one occasion, I heard the then Minister for Health point out gently that these were privately owned nursing homes in many cases, as though that mattered.  The reality is the same if there are old and vulnerable persons being cared for, whether with a State subvention or not.  There is a responsibility in a crisis to ensure that everything is done to protect them.<br/><br/>I regret to say that residents of nursing homes and other residential care homes were overlooked and not given the attention that they deserved in phase 1, and to think from today's news that little may have changed is an absolute indictment of the failure of the previous Minister and the current Minister for Health to come to grips with the situation and to right the wrongs of the failure to get it right the first time round.  I am not seeking to lay the blame on any one person but the buck has to stop with the politicians in charge of the relevant Departments.  There can be no excusing the situation we find ourselves in today.  We do not want to hear any more lofty words of concern from Ministers that are not backed up by appropriate action.  This is a national emergency.  Even if it is six months too late putting in place what is necessary to minimise the loss of life, let the decisions be taken today, but not later than today.<br/><br/>We were put to the test six months ago and we failed the most vulnerable.  Let us not have a repeat of the same.  I am making as impassioned a plea as I can to the Taoiseach and the Government to treat this issue with the urgency it deserves today, not tomorrow or in the days to come.  It is the least we owe our older and most vulnerable and dependent members of the community.<br/><br/>I know what I am talking about.  I wrote about this issue in April in the <i>Irish Independent</i>arising out of contacts I was having from people who were involved in contact tracing.  At that time, they knew what the Government presumably knew but what the media was not yet covering, which was that there was a serious outbreak in nursing homes.  They were asking me to try to get the ball rolling and to push Government and anybody who was listening to make the appropriate arrangements for people who were working in nursing homes, or indeed in private homes giving care, to seek to provide accommodation options, probably with the assistance of shuttered hotels at the time and supported by local authorities, so that there would not be a circular spread of the disease.  What I found remarkable at the time in contacting journalists was that they were waiting to see what the Government would tell them at the next briefing and the knowledge on the ground was coming in way ahead of what was being heard on the television and radio news.<br/><br/>The situation has changed.  Now that we have public permission to disagree with the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, there are people, including me, taking issue with aspects of the new restrictions.  I remain firm in my call for facilitating public worship, not because I think that they have some special entitlement but because I believe that the evidence will show that public worship has been organised in a highly responsible way by highly compliant people and it should be possible for us to facilitate those aspects of our social and national life which are bringing consolation to people and which are supporting people mentally, socially and spiritually, subject, of course, to overriding public health requirements.  However, it seems that they are still lacking.  There is a desire to get it right but there is something missing in approaches that come down too hard in some areas and seem to stand back then from other areas.  Sporting activity is one that many people have been questioning, but all of those issues pale into insignificance compared with the challenge facing our most vulnerable citizens in nursing homes.  That, to me, is the most important point that should be galvanising us today.<br/><br/>The Minister of State will not disagree with anything that I have said.  I ask her to take the message back to Government that we have failed people previously.  It is appalling to think that we could be in the same situation again.  That is an indictment of what has not been going on.  For God's sack, can we have action now?</p></speech>

When the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, then T&aacute;naiste, came to the Seanad to announce the provision of the health Act earlier this year, I supported him and said that I was strongly behind him because I saw what I believed to be the alternative - the military trucks in Bergamo ferrying bodies away from hospitals in huge numbers, mass graves being dug in New York, and scenes from the around the world - if there was no adequate response from the State's health service and law-making services to the problems which were confronting us in Covid.  I believed in my heart that the truth of the situation lay in what was recently stated by Dr. David Nabarro of the World Health Organization, that to contain a really serious emergency situation it was legitimate to have extensive clampdowns on people's economic, social, employment and other activities to avert a similar disaster.  However, Dr. Nabarro also said and the World Health Organization not merely said but appealed to all governments in the world not to use clampdowns or lockdowns as the primary response to the Covid virus in our midst.  I believe that the three Ws are hugely important - wash your hands, wear a mask and watch your distance - and a growing number of people are quite happy to adopt those measures and values in their own lives.  However, we also agree in our hearts with what Dr. Nabarro said, which is that the use of a lockdown is simply to buy time so that the necessary resources and organisational measures can be taken in the health system to confront the problem and to minimise it.</p> <p>Dr. Nabarro also said that the damage done by lockdowns is very substantial - people dying from non-Covid conditions, people failing to diagnose non-Covid conditions, people failing to avail of preventative measures in respect of other serious illness, depression, suicides, and damage to people who are confined to their homes with violent and disruptive members of households, be they abusers or people who are suffering from disability or whatever.  There are many hundreds of people for whom a lockdown is a very serious personal challenge to their psychological, not to mention their economic, well-being.  Economic well-being and psychological well-being are two not utterly different things.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Someone may be near the breadline and dependent on a job in the entertainment business, for example.  He or she may live in shared accommodation, as many people do.  When such a person is told there is no reason to go to work and there is little or no money because he or she might not qualify this way or that for State support, and when he or she is told to stay at home and that home involves sharing a bunk bed in an overcrowded, multiple-occupancy house, there are very serious consequences to measures of this kind.  We do not all live in the kinds of home that I or most people in the House have, that is, our own home where we are the master or mistress of our own activities.  It is quite different for many people.</p><p>There cannot be any sense in continuously repeating the same mistakes.  The HSE was given an opportunity to put in place in Nightingale hospitals and it did not do so.  It was also given an opportunity to put in place a proper test and trace regime and it simply did not do so.  I do not want to berate public servants, but some agencies are good at implementing policy decisions and some are poor.  I recall a prominent civil servant who became frustrated with the slowness of the reaction of his Department.  He used to say that if a job was worth doing, it was worth doing badly, and that if it could be got over the line, they could clear up the blood.  There has to be a can-do attitude from now on.  These six weeks that we now have must be used to do something about NPHET and about the imbalance between it and the tiny group of people who exercise control over it, namely, Ministers and their special advisers.  These six weeks must be used to put in place a voice for enterprise and those whose businesses have been closed, and to introduce an entirely new regime of transparency in order that everything NPHET says behind closed doors to Ministers will be said in public to the people in order that we can evaluate what is appropriate.</p><p>There will be no point in opposing the motion because it will go through.  Nevertheless, we cannot do it again.  It is up to the Government to show that it really is a government and not a caretaker group, to avail of the six weeks of hardship it is imposing on the country, and to do its job and make a difference.</p></speech>

As they all will know, we face a very difficult period.  All indicators of the incidence and severity of the disease have continued to worsen in recent weeks, while in the past four weeks alone, there have been almost 9,000 cases.  The national 14-day incidence rate is now 229 per 100,000.  Ensuring a balanced and proportionate response to Covid-19 is a complex task.  Since the beginning of the crisis, the dilemma facing us concerns how to implement public health measures in response to the pandemic in a way that is fair, reasonable and proportionate.  This is neither easy nor straightforward, but I assure the House we will continue to use these powers responsibly.</p> <p>The nursing home matter that was raised by several Senators is an issue on which I have been receiving updates all day.  There are 585 nursing homes in Ireland, of which 45 are experiencing outbreaks.  It is, therefore, a serious issue.  As for the specific nursing home that was mentioned, I do not want to go into too much detail.  The director of nursing on that Covid response team, of which there are 23 in the country, has been on site this afternoon.  She is assessing the stability, safety and staffing there.  The HSE has advised that it will provide supplementary staff, including a night nurse, for the next three nights.  I do not for a moment deny that it has been a very difficult week for the nursing home.  The HSE was informed on Sunday and testing of all the patients and staff was carried out on Monday.  As was noted, the figures arising from those tests are very frightening for the community in question, given that the nursing home is their home from home.  The real issue, however, is that the nursing home is finding it impossible to get agency staff to cover for the staff who are out sick due to Covid or because they are self-isolating with symptoms.  That is where the matter is really difficult.</p> <p>I have been very concerned about nursing homes throughout the pandemic, and I have spoken about this issue weekly in the Houses.  A total of 54% of deaths in the first surge happened in the nursing home sector, where 985 people lost their lives.  Much work has been done since.  I spoke to Tadhg Daly, the chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, less than two hours ago.  NHI has responsibility for 480 nursing homes.  All nursing homes currently have sufficient personal protective equipment.  Fortnightly testing has been ongoing for three months and has been very helpful because it allows a nursing home to know if an asymptomatic staff member is positive, and he or she can then be asked to self-isolate for 14 days.  Accommodation is still being provided by the HSE for staff members who feel they cannot go home if they are worried about passing on the virus to children or elderly parents.  The temporary assistance payment scheme has proven very important for nursing homes, whether private, public or residential, so they can ensure they have the correct infection prevention control, sufficient staff and tip-top cleanliness.</p> <p>There is an issue with staff; I will not pretend otherwise.  Nursing homes are finding that difficult at the moment.  All nursing home employees are entitled to leave their job and move to another.  I was talking to management at a nursing home this week where three members of staff, who had been working there for quite a while, have decided to move.  They have now been employed in testing and tracing.  Many people have been employed in that regard, at an average of 70 people per week at the moment.  Unfortunately, everyone is entitled to apply for another job and to move on, which is proving difficult.  I was speaking to officials from the Department and the HSE all afternoon before I came to the Chamber.  The supports are in place but it is very difficult.</p> <p>There are 45 outbreaks currently in nursing homes in various parts of the country.  We were reduced to having just window visits on level 3.  When the virus is rampant in the community, even with the best of intentions it will enter nursing homes.  Our older people, unfortunately, are the most vulnerable.  As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am very conscious of this and we are doing everything we can.  On Thursday night last, for example, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and I held a meeting with Mr. Paul Reid and Ms Anne O'Connor from the HSE and other representatives of HIQA, the Department and the HSE.  We were all there until 8 p.m.</p> <p>My main worry relates to the staff at nursing homes.  When seven of eight nurses have been infected with Covid, it is very difficult to replace them overnight when agency staff are not available.  I compliment all the people who have worked in the residential sector.  We always speak about front-line workers, who are fantastic, but people working in nursing homes have worked so hard.  Nursing homes are a home from home for the community of 25,000 people who live in them.  We are doing everything we can to protect them and will continue to do so.</p> <p>The issue of testing and tracing was raised.  As Senators will be aware, the HSE has worked intensively over recent months to put in place comprehensive testing and tracing capacity, which is currently at 20,000 tests per day.  While I acknowledge there were issues earlier in the week, more than 400 people are now working at contact tracing centres and the HSE is bringing on board a further 60 to 70 every week.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Mary Butler:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2445"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2445&amp;amp;pid=MaryButler&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->By the end of next month, there should be up to 800 people doing that work.</p><p>I assure the House that work is continuing on developing and enhancing our broader public health response further, for example, our capacity, our testing strategy, including the potential use of alternative diagnostic approaches, and our testing and contact tracing service.  Significant progress has been made and we now have a solid platform, but we need to build on it.  One can never do enough and always has to do more.</p><p>While by no means a panacea for managing the disease into the future, a robust and timely public health response to cases and clusters will continue to form one of the most important elements of our overall response.  Unfortunately, however, it is unlikely to be enough on its own.  I was struck by Senator McDowell's three Ws - wash, wear and watch your distance.  That is a fantastic mantra.  Members should take that message with us today and get it out into the public domain.  The three Ws are the basics to which we must return.</p><p>While we all accept that the imposed measures are, by their nature, blunt instruments, they are nonetheless essential to enable the level of virus suppression that is now required.  The extension of these regulations is time-bound and aligns with the timeframe of the Government's current strategy, which we believe to be reasonable and proportionate.  These temporary measures may be ended early by ministerial order should the public health situation improve to such a point that they are no longer required.  They will be subject to ongoing review and will be repealed if the circumstances allow.</p><p>This motion will allow mental health services to plan appropriately for the medium term.  Senator Keogan asked why we were doing this, but it has already been done for the past seven months and the Mental Health Commission has not flagged anything about it as not working.  A measure was put in place whereby, if necessary, only one person would attend the tribunal, but such a situation has not arisen.  On all occasions, the three people were able to attend the tribunal.</p><p>The amendments to the Mental Health Act have helped to reduce cross-infection within inpatient psychiatric facilities.  If the measures are not extended, we will be putting at risk the health and well-being of patients and healthcare workers.  Anyone who is involuntarily detained is entitled to have a tribunal hearing within 21 days.  The most important element is that tribunals proceed, but in order for that to happen, we had to move them online and insert the caveat that, if two people were not available to attend, one person would be sufficient.  However, that situation has not arisen and there have been three people present at every tribunal.  It is important to note that.</p><p>I thank Senators for their time, but I will make another point before I conclude.  Between 85% and 90% of all mental health services were retained during the lockdown.  Obviously, I have only been in this job for three or four months - I believe it is approximately 15 weeks.  These supports were kept going even when other supports, for example, for children with disabilities, could not be retained.  Admittedly, some mental health supports had to change to a blended approach.  They were not always provided face to face and many supports moved online, but the most important aspect is that they were retained.</p><p>Facing into the winter, there will be six weeks of major challenges, including to people's mental health, finances and businesses, but I honestly believe that we have no other choice.  There seems to be an acceptance among people, especially older people, who are so resilient, that we need to get through the next six weeks.  Senator Bacik was vocal on the issue of social bubbles.  They are a fantastic idea.  We are not asking older people to cocoon.  Rather, we are asking older people who are living alone, single parents caring for a couple of small kids and someone who is caring for a person with dementia to pair with another family or household so that they have support during the six weeks.  We have to learn, and we have certainly learned where cocooning is concerned.  It was very difficult on people and their mental health.  They were fantastic and resilient and they did it, but the bubble approach can work and should make a difference.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.255" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#EEEE00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, for attending and for his engagement with me on this important Bill over recent weeks.  I will begin with some thanks.  First, I thank my colleagues in the Civil Engagement Group for facilitating this debate today and for sponsoring this Bill with me.  This was legislation I introduced in the previous Seanad.  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in, the Labour Party, Senator Boyhan and Senator Norris, as well as former Senators Colette Kelleher, John Dolan and Grace O'Sullivan of the Green Party for giving it their formal support when I brought it forward in May last year.  This is an important show of cross-party solidarity and support on such an important issue.  I also thank the Coalition for Civil Society Freedom, an umbrella group of more than 50 civil society organisations which came together two years ago to call for this reform.  Without their important advocacy, this Bill would not be here.</p> <p>It is somewhat ironic, therefore, that it is to protect their right to continue such advocacy work that we are here.  My motivation for introducing this Bill is something of a personal one.  Having worked in the area of advocacy for more than 20 years in regard to people who have been living on the fringes of society, whether due to poverty or issues of addiction, and working in community development for all of those years, I know advocacy has played a hugely important role in that we have empowered our communities to be able to advocate, not only for their own rights but the rights of their communities.  When I think of such rights, I think of an addiction support group which has been a great advocate in the area of trying to end the use of supervised urinals for methadone users receiving their prescriptions, or those who have created campaign groups advocating against the situation that the GP contract does not allow for a local GP to take these people on.  In the past, groups like this in communities have advocated in regard to living conditions.  I remember working in Rialto, where a group at Dolphin House took a very successful case on human rights in regard to sewage coming up through the sinks there.</p> <p>All of this is very important advocacy work and it must be supported at all costs.  Unfortunately, we have moved into a time where the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, has begun to raise concerns with groups that operate in the advocacy space, given there was an unintended consequence that now sees some of that advocacy work and human rights work as having what is termed "political purposes".  While this was never the intention of the original legislation, it is getting caught up in that.  We need to be able to disentangle all the very important work I have been involved in for years, as well as the work of everyone else in this Chamber in regard to disability groups, mental health groups and all the different groups.  We all agree that work needs to be protected and cannot be caught up in the way it is currently caught in such a narrow view of political purposes.  Obviously, this all falls outside electoral politics or referenda, and it needs to be to decoupled from that as well.</p> <p>To turn to the Bill, groups of ordinary people who organise together with a common purpose to identify and address problems and injustices play a vital role in our political system.  The community groups and civil society organisations they go on to form need to be able to fundraise to engage politicians in the public space.  Without their lobbying, their campaigning and their agitating, we do not hear directly from the communities we are lucky enough to represent.  It is because of this threat to the chance for a civil society organisation or community group to raise the funding it needs to advocate in the public interest that I am tabling this Bill.</p> <p>The electoral Acts regulate us as politicians.  They apply rigorous, onerous and high standards of donation declaration, certain prohibitions and accounting requirements that we are all familiar with, and we were all subject to them at the most recent election.  The problem we are here to address is that, because of a flaw in the wording of these same electoral Acts, our laws do not fairly distinguish between how we regulate the campaigns of politicians and how we treat the normal everyday advocacy of campaign and community groups throughout Ireland.</p> <p>A group of parents who came together to fundraise and advocate for secular education rights for their children are objectively different from a D&aacute;il candidate seeking funding for an election campaign, yet under our laws no real distinction is made.  This was a consequence of the extension of the Electoral Act 1997 with an amendment by the Oireachtas in 2001 to include donations received by third parties for what is called "political purposes".  It has forced our electoral regulator, SIPO, to treat donations in excess of &euro;100 received by community and civil society groups as if they were donations to a political campaign and to pursue any non-compliance accordingly.  SIPO itself, the very body tasked with applying these laws, in its 2003 annual report highlighted this likely unintended issue, stating,"The Standards Commission doubts if it was the intention of the legislature that such bodies, in conducting their ordinary affairs, could find themselves covered by the legislation."  It would, of course, be a different matter if any of them became involved in a campaign at an election or referendum, in which case they should and would be covered.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Despite this the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, must apply the law as it is written, not as it may have been intended.  This is the cause of the problem we are seeking to address.  The issue with the application of the electoral Acts has arisen for many organisations working in very diverse areas.  Some examples include Education Equality, a volunteer-run group of parents campaigning for education reform which had to dedicate extraordinary amounts of its limited resources to attempt to comply with SIPO&rsquo;s requirements, all the time being threatened with legal action and criminal sanction.<br/><br/>Last year an <i>ad hoc</i>group of local residents in south Dublin who organised together to participate in the planning process and to fundraise locally through a Facebook page were referred to the Garda by SIPO and brought to the High Court.  Of greatest concern in the case of the group Equate, actors on the opposing side of the baptism-barrier issue deliberately used our flawed laws to report the organisation to SIPO using the high compliance standards required and therefore diverting resources from the group's vital campaigning work.  In each circumstance the financial requirements intended for aspiring Members of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament are applied to what are essentially volunteer-run groups.  The work needed to comply with such required standards has damaged their capacity to advocate and has interfered with their right to freedom of association as a result. <br/><br/>This flaw in our electoral law is almost 20 years old and is being continuously identified and criticised in the intervening period, particularly by international human rights bodies and observers.  This is particularly worrying due to the near-hypocritical nature of Ireland&rsquo;s high profile support for free and vibrant civil society spaces internationally.  Ireland played a leading role in the development of the European Union&rsquo;s guidelines on human rights defenders and has even sponsored a resolution on civil society space at the United Nations Human Rights Council.  It is difficult to square these international actions with glaring flaws in our domestic law, especially in light of Ireland&rsquo;s recent election to the UN Security Council.  <br/><br/>Our own Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission released a policy statement in 2019 raising concerns about the application of the electoral Acts in this area.  This came in the wake of criticism in a report from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in 2018 which raised its concerns with the selective nature of the law&rsquo;s enforcement on foot of complaints such as in the Equate case.  Furthermore, as recently as last month, the European Commission published its 2020 rule of law report for Ireland criticising our laws and calling for Ireland to apply EU law requirements and Council of Europe guidelines instead.  <br/><br/>In the wake of the concern on the application of the law domestically and widespread international criticism, we are proposing legislation to amend section 22 of the Electoral Act 1997 to only apply to civil society advocacy during an election or referendum period, as was the likely intention of the Oireachtas in 2001.  Concerns have been raised with me this week on the knock-on impact this may have on foreign groups which fundraise to influence public opinion here in Ireland.  The inadequacies of our current law in this area were well aired in the recent campaign to repeal the eighth amendment.  I appreciate that this is a sensitive issue on which we will have to move carefully.  I therefore welcome the approval of the Cabinet this week for legislation creating an electoral commission and on the regulation of political advertising.  This issue must be urgently addressed as part of the process.  We cannot continue to rely on electoral legislation enacted before the Internet, or on private companies like Google and Facebook to ban online advertising to safeguard our democratic integrity.  This must be a role for the State.  We are committed to ensuring that we have full transparency and accountability in political funding, especially for funding coming into Ireland from abroad.  It is our intention to ensure that this issue will be fully explored as this Bill moves through the Houses so that no unintended consequences arise again.  <br/><br/>I am therefore disappointed that we cannot support the moving of the Bill to Committee Stage this evening but I thank the Minister for the memorandum from his Department on how he seeks to progress this issue, in that the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage could examine the Bill as part of pre-legislative scrutiny on the electoral commission Bill and that the commission, when created, could address it as part of a full comprehensive review of the electoral Acts.  <br/><br/>I am concerned, however, about the timeline that has been set out.  It could feasibly take longer than the lifetime of this Government and over five years for the necessary changes to the law to be made if we are to follow this timeframe.  I would appreciate an indication of the urgency that is needed here.  Can the Minister commit to a formal consultation process in his Department to happen in parallel with the organisations and groups affected by this flawed law and on the impact that it has on their work?  Can he also commit to write to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as Minister, requesting that the committee specifically look at this urgent issue, in particular within its pre-legislative hearings?  It would at least provide an opportunity for concerns to be aired to show that his Department is listening to them.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response and I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#FFFF00200"><p>I second this Bill and commend Senator Ruane for proposing it.  It is something that all of us in the Civil Engagement group in the Seanad strongly support - both the current group and the former members of the group including former Senators John Dolan and Colette Kelleher.  It goes to the core of the role that we see civil society playing in shaping and contributing to Ireland and in supporting and changing the policies in people&rsquo;s lives.  </p> <p>This is what the Bill is about.  It is important to be very clear that this is not a Bill about elections or referendums but, very clearly and explicitly, the Bill sets out a very comprehensive set of political purposes which we consider should be regulated under the current measures.  These include political campaigns but also those who might promote the political campaigns of a particular candidate or party, and those that might be taking action around a particular outcome in a referendum.  We very much see all political activity as coming within that political purposes definition.  That was very much the intent of the former Minister of State and Deputy, Bobby Molloy, at the time where he very much felt that this legislation was around the engagement of third parties in electoral activity.  That was the envisaged role of this earlier legislation.  </p> <p>The concern is that the vagueness of the language, the lack of that clear definition and the interpretation of it, particularly in recent years, has meant that "political purposes" is being taken as basically encompassing having an opinion about political policies that affect one&rsquo;s life or to actively engage around the changing of a policy.  The reason that this is really important is because of the people that this earlier legislation affects.  Examples were given of the Hellfire Club and of parents who are trying to advocate together around the rights and supports for their children.  The people who care about their colleagues, their neighbours or their communities tend to care a great deal.  They care about people and also care about policies.  The problem at the moment is that people are often in a position because they feel torn where they have to choose between the two. </p> <p>For example, those who might be providing community services, who are the exact people who know what needs to be done, have to choose between minding the people, providing the services or changing the policies and changing the future for all of those for whom they work.  That is often very difficult.  I have spoken to people who have strong views, who know how policies can be improved and what is needed in services on the ground, but are nervous of speaking up about it.  They are nervous because they may be regarded as advocating, crossing a line and that it might affect their ability to fundraise in order to provide essential services.  It should not be a situation where those who care in that kind of way are inhibited from effectively caring in another wider way.  Ireland is particularly unusual in this regard because we rely extraordinarily heavily on volunteers.  In the CSO survey some 28.4% of adults in Ireland volunteer, and we have over 14,000 volunteers.  Those volunteers in the community groups that we have described, and those who may be employees working with NGOs or civil society groups, should be able to engage and to advocate on the issues that are really important and should not feel in any way compromised or jeopardised to fundraise in that respect.  </p> <p>Again, I do not wish to name groups, but I am thinking now about when I worked with people who cared about bees where advocacy is a tiny part of their work.  Mainly they work with bees.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When policies on pesticide or hedge-cutting are coming through, obviously they have a perspective and may wish to share it but that should not jeopardise them in respect of all the other value they add.  That is the core of this.  NGOs and more informal voluntary and community groups have all been hit by the wide interpretation of "political purposes".</p><p>I accept that the Minister of State will engage with us on this and that there will be an electoral commission, but I am quite concerned because the commission has a very significant task ahead of it, not least in regard to Seanad reform and so forth.  I would like him to affirm that this issue will not be lost in engaging with those issues.  We have supported electoral reform and the electoral reform Bill.  I called for an electoral commission umpteen times before I was elected to the House.  In the regulation of online electoral advertising, it was Deputy Lawless and I who insisted, before, during and after the most recent referendum, that there was a lacuna in the regulation of online advertising, and that during electoral periods in particular, given that there is a prohibition on foreign donations in respect of electoral activities of other kinds, we should be assured that that also applies to the purchasing of online advertising.  We have pushed for the regulation of political advertising, including online.</p><p>Those issues, and the issues of ensuring there are appropriate safeguards for issues such as foreign donations, can be dealt with by the electoral commission or by Bills specifically relating to the regulation of advertising.  Furthermore, if those issues need to be addressed in the Bill, they could be addressed through amendment on Committee Stage.  That is why it is unfortunate that we are not able to move past Second Stage and to come to a debate on definitions and ensuring they are appropriate.  The definition offered by Senator Ruane and the rest of our group fulfils what has been noted at EU level, as well as by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and many others.  It is our attempt to address that definition problem.  We are, of course, willing to engage with people on suggestions they might have about how that definition could be improved or strengthened.  The circumstances cannot be left as they stand.  I have talked about people who want to express their concerns and to advocate but we too, as legislators, need to hear from people.  We know how many issues have come to light too late, indirectly, via whistleblowers or individuals who had to break from what they were doing to raise a flag or highlight an issue.  It will make for a healthier ecosystem because civil society and politics will work together on those collective tasks we set ourselves to make a better and more liveable Ireland.</p><p>I hope this will move forward.  If roadblocks are encountered in respect of the electoral commission, we might have to revisit the Bill as a standalone issue coming back through the Houses.</p></speech>

It concerns an issue that many of us in the House will have come across, given that in most cases we will have come to politics through our community activism.  I have had involvement with many of the groups mentioned and know that many of the problems have existed for 20 years, putting undue pressures on small groups on which the State relies for much of its functioning.  It is unpaid, voluntary work.  I commend, therefore, the Senators and the Civil Engagement group on introducing the Bill.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it is clear there are problems with the Bill as it stands and the two Senators have pointed out what they are.  Through my involvement with the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment, it was very clear to me that there were problems with foreign donations.  The best way forward from our perspective is to return to the programme for Government and to what we committed to therein, that is, the establishment of an electoral commission and, on that basis, an electoral reform Bill.  I understand the repeated concern of those in opposition when they hear that another Government Bill regarding a commission will be brought forward.  A memo on the issue has gone to the Cabinet, however, so it has progressed a great deal.</p> <p>There are many issues I would like to be addressed.  This is certainly right up there among them, but so too are election posters, which impact on smaller parties and Independents much more than on larger parties.  Incumbents within those larger parties have an advantage, which means that men also have an advantage because they are often incumbents.  In this day and age when we are examining why we do not have better representation and why there was such an under-representation of women Senators before the Taoiseach&rsquo;s nominees had been announced, now more than ever we need to examine electoral reform.  Many of us throughout the House have signed pledges in respect of electoral reform in the Seanad and I would like that to be progressed.  I would also like us to look to models outside of Ireland when we examine advertising.  In Europe, for example, there are billboards in several parts of towns that give every political candidate, irrespective of his or her capacity to fundraise, the same right to put himself or herself forward in a democratic way.</p> <p>So many factors, which the Minister of State will probably outline, will form part of the proposed electoral reform Bill.  I have outlined some of them.  I ask the Minister of State that he give them due regard and that something to address them come before us as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I must admit that when I first saw the Title of the Bill, and the document I received that referred to keeping in power the voices of the people and of civil society groups, I kind of struggled with what exactly it was about.  Once I understood it, I agreed wholeheartedly that the issue needs to be addressed.  That is blindingly obvious.</p> <p>Both the Senators spoke about the volunteer effort and how much we rely on it in Ireland, which we do.  I am a voluntary director of a youth service, a Garda youth diversion programme, a family resource centre and a community policing forum.   I got involved in all those groups on a voluntary basis for the same reasons as the people and groups the Senators described.  I have contested local elections, D&aacute;il elections, Seanad elections and European Parliament elections.  There is not much of the ugly side of electoral politics I have not seen.  This is one part of that which is quite distorting, so it needs to be reviewed.  I very much welcome the commitment of the Minister of State and the Government to delivering on the promise in the programme for Government for an electoral commission.</p> <p>I share the Senators' concern about the issue getting bogged down.  I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Housing, to my mind, is probably the single biggest issue facing us, putting climate change, Covid-19 and Brexit aside.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important that we all work to ensure that it does not get bogged down, that there is a timeline assigned to it, and that this issue is called out as one to be addressed.</p><p>In Dublin Central, elections and the other issues that I would like to see addressed are those that have been mentioned around postering, funding from outside of the State for political activities, and the congestion caused by northern-registered cars around polling stations in Dublin Central.

I am an ordinary person who cares.  I happen to wear a badge that says Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is a republican party, which means that it is motivated to actually serve the people.  When I think of the other members of Fianna F&aacute;il in Dublin Central, I do not think they differ much from any other group of ordinary people in Cabra, Phibsborough or Drumcondra who want to address housing poverty, end illegal dumping and address climate action.</p> <p>We need to drill down into this.  We need transparency and accountability so that there is some honesty restored to our political activities and to re-establish confidence among the general public.  I do not think that engaging in the political and democratic process should be something to be embarrassed or ashamed about, but that is what it has become for many people and it should not be like that.  It is really unhealthy for our society.  When I saw the civil society group, I wondered whether I was outside of it, but I am not.  I do not consider myself outside of it, and I am very much part of it and centred to it, and I want to be.  That is why I got involved in politics.</p> <p>I will support the sentiment and the objective of this Bill, and will defer to the Minister and the Government to progress it.  I will do my part to ensure that it is not buried or lost and that it will be progressed.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad.  I note the contributions made and support for the Bill from the ICLL, which represents numerous organisations.  Its view is that section 22 of the Electoral Act 1997, as amended in 2001, is having a detrimental impact on the important and legitimate work of civil society organisations.  It speaks of operational challenges, and also legal uncertainty in the sector.  It is not good for any organisation to be unsure in respect of the work it does, its advocacy and what it has to declare.  We all believe in full transparency in everything relating to politics and campaigning.</p> <p>This is a case of unintended consequences of the original drafting, and this has been admitted in debates that have taken place in the Oireachtas.  We know that the civil society groups play an important role, and they need to be able to engage and interact with the Government.  This advocacy and campaigning can cost money, and there was an issue in relation to campaigning between elections and at election time.  </p> <p>I would not often quote Atheist Ireland, but it is right and proper to read the submission it has made.  It has a contrarian view, and it feels that it is old-fashioned and authoritarian to regard democracy as happening only during elections.  This is a valid point.  It also feels that wealthier civil society groups and far-right activists, with whom they would disagree, will all have access to even more big money to spend on lobbying decision-makers between elections.  It argues that these groups and their wealthy donors will have even more undue influence on our democracy, which is bad, whether one agrees with their aims or not.  This is a valid point that should be taken into account and teased out in the discussions on Committee Stage, whenever that may be.</p> <p>It is interesting that the Standards in Public Office Commission has raised this issue, and it has recommended a review of the electoral Acts and the establishment of an electoral commission.  I welcome the commitment to engage on the issue of the electoral commission and also the Minister's view to take the recommendation on board in respect of the review of the electoral Acts.</p> <p>The definition of political purposes brings non-governmental organisations, NGOs, within the scope of the Bill, even though their activities may not be related to the time of elections and referendums.  There are whole range of bodies that we are all lobbied by.  We might not be lobbied by some of them, but with others like the Irish Farmers Association and TidyTowns, I would not say it is lobbying, but meeting and having views on important issues.  I do not think that was intended in the original Bill.</p> <p>I welcome the commitment to establishing an electoral commission.  The use of PPS numbers, or whether PPS numbers could be looked at in relation to single identity on the electoral register has been discussed often.  Electoral fraud is probably not a big issue in this country, but that is not to say that it does not, or could not, happen, or that there are some constituencies in which it might be more common than in other areas.

Although one may be asked, will that happen?  That has to be looked at.  We have heard stories in the past of polling cards being bought for a pint of Guinness.  Are these just stories or do they happen?  I have concerns that they happen.</p> <p>Another issue is the electoral registers that still contain the names of the dead.  I canvassed a lady in the last election whose son is still on the register even though he moved abroad.  He has been abroad for 30 years and is still on the register.  One can understand if it has happened recently, but there are instances of people who have passed away seven, eight or even ten years ago, still being sent a polling card to their house.  One can see how things happen.  For example, one could be registered under a maiden name and under a married name, maybe even in different constituencies.  The opportunity is there to vote early and often, but that is not to say that it is taken up.</p> <p>On the issue of posters, I have come around to the view that they should be banned.  I do not know, perhaps that is because my hair is getting greyer and I am getting older and whatever.  I think, as others have said, the hassle of putting them up, taking them down, the cost of them, posters going missing and vandalism, are all considerations.  There is also a serious point which arose before the last election in relation to some towns which take it upon themselves to say that there is a ban on posters within the town.  Is that fair on a candidate who is perhaps very reliant on that town, and other candidates who might not be, so it may not bother them as much as it would in other areas?  Therefore, I welcome the review of the use of posters.  In the past some candidates have decided not to use posters to their detriment.  I do not think that a voluntary decision to not use posters has been official in some cases, although one could make a virtue of it, but an absolute decision would be welcome.</p> <p>I would like to mention the Citizens' Assembly.  It has served a purpose and continues to do so on important decisions made in our country.  I have an issue with limiting membership to 100 people.  It has been said that one ends up with counties that are not represented.  The number should be increased and should also be looked at proportionately.  Numerous locations should be used.  For example, there should be a meeting of the Citizens' Assembly at the same time in Connacht, Munster, Leinster, the Border area and Dublin.  Video conferencing can be used in this day and age to ensure that it would be more representative of the country as a whole, and it would provide regional coverage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not think it is right that some large counties ?.

It is the first time that I have seen the Minister of State in the Chamber and I wish him the very best in his brief.  I congratulate him on his stellar performance in getting elected to the D&aacute;il and being appointed a Minister of State.</p><p>I strongly oppose this legislation.  Its timing is unfortunate for its sponsors because it comes just as Deputy Nash has exposed correspondence between Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, and Sinn F&eacute;in, which displays in embarrassing detail how that party is more than happy to use partition to help it pocket a &euro;4 million bequest.  That funding loophole and others should be closed all right.  Instead, this Bill seeks to take an existing narrow loophole and blow it wide open.  This matter arises out of a High Court dispute between SIPO and Amnesty International Ireland centring on an interpretation of the phrase &quot;political purposes&quot; in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001.  The Bill before us would change the definition of donations for political purposes to allow NGOs and campaigning organisations to accept unlimited donations from Ireland or abroad in between elections or referendum campaigns.  Only donations made during an election or referendum campaign would have to comply with any donation restrictions.  This would remove from limit or scrutiny large donations to campaigning organisations delivered up to the time that the election or referendum was called.</p><p>Amnesty received a donation of &euro;137,000 from the Open Society Foundation, which is a Swiss front group for the Hungarian multibillionaire, George Soros.  The explicit aim of that donation was that it be used to campaign to change the Irish law and Constitution in terms of abortion.  Senator Pauline O'Reilly was right to refer to the referendum on the eighth amendment.  I can certainly say, from my association with the pro-life campaign which worked very hard to protect unborn babies and mothers, that any donations that I was ever aware of came from Irish citizens.  That was not the case with regard to Amnesty's largesse coming from George Soros and his Open Society Foundation.  Amnesty claimed, ludicrously, that the donation was not for a political purpose.  Hello?  It was clearly stated by the Open Society Foundation what the donation was all about.  The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word &quot;political&quot; as meaning relating to the government or public affairs of a country, which makes things fairly clear.  Therefore, a donation that is intended to influence or change Irish law, as the Amnesty donation clearly was, surely comes within that definition.</p><p>The sponsors of the Bill seem to think that a political purpose equals, for the most part, a party political or an electoral purpose.  These are all very different things.  The issue was not conclusively resolved by the High Court, so future donations might be similarly challenged by SIPO.  Therefore, Amnesty has a huge vested interest in seeing this Bill pass so that all future foreign donations for political campaigning can be whitewashed, as does the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which also supports this Bill.  That group raised just &euro;6,000 from Irish citizens in 2018 but was given more than &euro;500,000 from foreign sources, including a &euro;65,000 donation from the same Swiss front group which funds Amnesty.</p><p>While I wish Senator Ruane well and commend her on her diligence, perhaps she could please clarify for the record of this House whether Amnesty, the ICCL or any individuals connected to those groups were involved in any way in the drafting of this Bill.  If so, it would be a disturbing development.  It would mean that private organisations funded by foreign money are already seeking to influence directly a change in Irish law for their own financial benefit.</p><p>The explanatory memorandum says that treating the Amnesty donation and others like it as a donation for political purposes was an &quot;unintended consequence&quot; of ambiguous drafting in the 2001 Act.  Surely it was a consequence that was directly intended.  Do the Bill's sponsors seriously believe that the Oireachtas intended, in 2001, that foreign money would be allowed to flow into the country to campaign for changes in our law or Constitution in a completely unaccountable way?  Why should third parties be given such light-touch treatment compared with political parties or Independent politicians with a democratic mandate?</p><p>If Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or the Green Party wanted to mount a public campaign to change the law or Constitution, for argument's sake to introduce a constitutional right to housing, they would have to fund the campaign through donations from Irish citizens to a maximum of &euro;2,500 per individual or just &euro;200 from an Irish company.  If this Bill were passed, a third party or so-called civil society group could be set up and campaign full throttle against such a proposal - against such a proposal, just to make the point easy to understand for some of its proponents - funded by unlimited money from unidentified domestic or foreign sources.  Frankly, that would amount to little more than auction politics and the transfer of the democratic process to the highest bidder.  It would be a scandal for our democracy.</p><p>Senators will have received an interesting submission on the Bill from Atheist Ireland, as Senator Kyne has said, one such civil society group and not one which I regularly quote.  I have to say that I am experiencing a <i>frisson</i>of excitement as I quote it.  In fact, it might do wonders for my social life once Covid is out of the way.  Atheist Ireland make an interesting point when it says that the law as it stands:</p> <blockquote> 	... helps us, not hinders us, by trying to make democracy a battle of ideas not bank accounts.  It does not prevent any civil society group from raising money.  We just have to raise it in small donations from the many, not large donations from the few.This is good for democracy, not bad. </blockquote> <p>Fair play to Atheist Ireland for putting it so clearly.  Does that not bring us to the nub of the issue?</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the organisations supporting this Bill are groups which depend almost entirely on large foreign donations for their existence, drawing only tiny amounts from Irish citizens, so they have a vested interest in seeking this Bill to be passed so they can sustain themselves.  It seems to me that it is wrong to give international financiers or big business, at home or abroad, such an advantage over ordinary Irish citizens and the political parties or individuals that they support with their votes or few quid.  There is a vested interest in seeing this Bill passed.  This Bill could do for Irish politics what the notorious Citizens United <i>v. </i>Federal Election Commission decision by the United States Supreme Court did for politics in the US.  It could open the floodgates to large amounts of completely unaccountable and anonymous money being funnelled into Irish politics.  That would be a seriously retrograde step, and I urge Senators to reject this Bill.</p></speech>

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in support of this Bill on behalf of the Labour Senators.  I was a co-sponsor of the Bill and have worked on the issues it addresses with colleagues in civil society groupings, in particular with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  I commend Senators Ruane and Higgins on bringing it forward, and note also that it has received support from a wide range of civil society organisations and NGOs.  The number is 65, I am told, including ICCL, Amnesty International Ireland and The Wheel, which is an umbrella organisation for civil society groups, community and voluntary organisations, charities, and social enterprises.</p> <p>As others have said, the Bill has a simple, straightforward purpose.  It seeks to offer a definition of "political purposes" that addresses the existing problem that has been identified with the Electoral Act 1997, as amended in 2001, which has effectively imposed funding restrictions which are having a really negative effect on the work of civil society organisations.  Because the definition of "political purposes" in the original legislation is so vague that it can be interpreted and applied in a broad fashion, it has brought a wide range of organisations within the scope of the Act, despite their activities not being directed in any way at influencing the outcome of an election or referendum.</p> <p>As others have said, the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, itself has identified the problem in the legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 2003, it noted in its annual report that the scope of the current law is so broad that it may cover such bodies at Tidy Towns committees, charities, representative organisations and other interest groups.  SIPO has suggested change.  It has doubted that it was the intention of the Legislature that these bodies, in conducting their ordinary affairs, would find themselves covered by the legislation and recommended that a different definition be offered.  SIPO has identified this issue.  We have also seen concrete examples of organisations that have fallen foul of the current definition.  Other have referred to the Amnesty International Ireland case in 2018 and we also saw it with the voluntary group campaigning to end the so-called baptism barrier.  The group Equate was compelled to hand back a starter grant.</p><p>There is also an international dimension to this.  We should be aware that the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, for example, has been critical of Ireland for operating funding rules that have had the effect of shutting down the work of some human rights organisations.  Closer to home, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has highlighted the negative impact of the restrictions on advocacy.  </p><p>It is an important point that is being made in this Bill and an important issue to be addressed.  It is therefore disappointing that the Government is not supporting it sufficiently to even allow it go through Second Stage.  I know that Government speakers have identified flaws and that Atheist Ireland has corresponded with us about flaws that it suggests are in the Bill but Private Members' Bills can be amended on Committee and Report Stages.  Indeed, we have a lot of experience of that.  In the previous Seanad, I brought forward legislation to amend the Competition Act and colleagues who were Members of the House then will recall that the Government identified flaws in that but we won a vote on Second Stage and, as a result, I worked with officials and Ministers and we amended, by agreement, the amending legislation and brought forward an important Bill that safeguards and protects the rights of freelance workers to engage in collective bargaining.  That was a good example of how Private Members' Bills can be amended and improved upon through collaborative working with the Government.</p><p>I welcome the Government's announcement of an electoral commission.  I know that there has been a good deal of correspondence and negotiation between Senator Ruane, Seb McAteer in her office and Government officials.  That is also welcome.  At the same time, I think it would have been preferable simply to let the Bill go through Second Stage and then we could all work together on identifying flaws and seeing whether the aims of the Bill could be addressed in another way.  There are useful suggestions coming through, for example, looking at the charities legislation and amending definitions there, rather than necessarily just using this sort of legislation.  The Charities Act could be amended to enable promotion of human rights under the category that currently protects religious organisations.  Others have pointed out the anomalies there.</p><p>We could look again at whether that approach is better or the SIPO approach is better.  SIPO's recommendation in 2003 was to keep the current definition of "political purposes" and capture third parties if they intend to spend over a certain threshold in advancing such a purpose.  This Bill does not have any threshold and amends the definition of "political purposes" to exclude those groups unless they are spending money during an election or referendum.  There are certainly different models by which we can address the current problem that is restricting and curtailing the activities of groups advocating for human rights.  I do not think any Member on the side of the House that is supporting the legislation is saying it is perfect.  It has been acknowledged that we would be happy to work with the Government to ensure that the Bill could be amended and that any flaws it contains could be addressed, as I said, on Committee and Report Stages.  </p><p>In the meantime, it is important that Ireland is seen to take a lead on the promotion and protection of civil society.  In a debate like this, it is worth reflecting on the contribution to Irish society that civil society organisations have made.  I have worked with many groups on many different campaigns, including the referendums on marriage equality and the repeal of the eighth amendment in 2018.  I have also worked on campaigns in between and outside of referendum and electoral processes, including campaigns on the extension of multi-denominational schooling, for example.  As a parent in the local community, I was one of the people who helped to establish a new Educate Together school.  That is the sort of low level, local campaigning that goes on and in which many civil society groups are engaged on a day-to-day basis.  The problem with the current definition in the Electoral Act is that it unduly hampers the work of such groups.  There are sensible ways in which we can address restrictions that were not foreseen or intended.  As SIPO and others have said, the restrictions were not intended at the time of the passage of the legislation.</p><p>We should be working together with the Minister.  I am sorry that we cannot simply agree and move forward through Second Stage and see the Bill go to Committee Stage and then work together to bring forward amendments to ensure that we are not bringing in any unintended consequences and are simply seeking to enable the flourishing of civil society organisations in our society.  I again commend Senators Ruane and Higgins on bringing forward the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#KKKK00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  It is nice to have him here and he is welcome back any time.  The issue at hand is the application of the restrictions of funding to voluntary and community sectors.  That is what we want to discuss and we are here late at night because we all care about it deeply.  I thank Senators Ruane and Higgins for pointing it out.  It is important that we find things on which we can work together and have commonality.</p> <p>The Electoral Act is a source of legal uncertainty and significant challenge for a sector that is already stretched to its limit during this time.  Organisations that can be impacted by the application of this include many organisations that we have all probably been involved in, such as Tidy Towns and biodiversity groups.  SIPO has agreed there is a flaw in the legislation and we all know that SIPO knows exactly what is going on when it comes to political donations.  The definition of "political purposes" is so wide that it may unintentionally cover, on an ongoing basis, many of the voluntary groups that need our support and need not to be prohibited by funding and donation constraints.  </p> <p>I will give a couple of examples.  Seventeen years ago, I came together with six other mothers, as Senator Bacik has done, and started a Steiner school.  We were three years without a penny from the State and it was all based on volunteering and fundraising.  Seventeen years later, that school has 150 pupils and is funded by the State.  We gave people a new choice in education, that was co-educational and had a different pedagogy.  It was the first free Steiner school in Ireland.  Instead of being a fee-paying school, we fought tooth and nail to get it recognised by the State and it became a free school.  That would not have happened except that we were able to take donations and allow volunteers to run the school.</p> <p>Another example is the ban on fracking in this country.  That started in my kitchen with a few friends.  We decided we wanted fracking banned in County Clare.  We got some funding, some donations.  We did a 3,000 leaflet drop of all the houses in west and north Clare.  That leaflet informed people what fracking was, because they did not know at that time.  It also gave them the numbers of all their local councillors so that when the motion was brought to the council a few weeks later, every councillor had received hundreds of phone calls from concerned citizens and fracking was unanimously banned in Clare, the first council in Ireland to do so, although many followed suit.  The matter then came before the D&aacute;il and we are now a fracking-free nation.  These things happen with small groups.  Margaret Mead said never to doubt that a small group of people can make a difference because, in fact, it is the only thing that ever did.  </p> <p>I find it refreshing that I am in the House for the first time since I became a Senator and we are working together on something.  It is great that we can come together and find commonality because, at the end of the day, the people we represent are not bothered about who is in or who is out, they just want to get things done, to progress and work in and support communities.  The hearts of souls of volunteers and community organisations are keeping this country going at the moment.  </p> <p>I commend the Senators who brought in the legislation and I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, will do his level best to deal with any issues.  I know that Senator Mullen has some issues.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State and those in opposition who are working with him will sort it all out and do a great job.  I support this amendment.</p></speech>

It is always good to have two Malcolms in a Chamber at the one time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I, like others, thank Senators Ruane and Higgins for bringing this discussion to the floor.  The discussion this evening and the contributions from everybody are core to our democracy.  These discussions are important and, as others, including Senator Fitzpatrick, have said, I would be worried if this gets bogged down in the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  That committee will be dealing with a lot of important issues.  This is a vital question about the future of our democracy.  I ask that the Minister of State ensures that whatever mechanism is used, it is given sufficient priority.</p><p>This raises important questions about the role of civic society within our democracy.  The difficulty is the legislation, as Senator Higgins pointed out, is analogue legislation operating in a digital age.  Activism is completely different from what it was when most of us in this Chamber started getting involved in our various forms of activism.  A healthy democracy requires input from a wide variety of groups and opinions from civic society.  Senator Kyne mentioned the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, which is probably one of the most successful lobby groups in the country.  Input is also required from business organisations, trade unions, churches and all sorts of groups as well as collections of individuals, as Senator Garvey said, who come together and are passionate about an issue.  It is important we support those organisations, that mechanisms are found in a digital age for those organisations to advance their cause, that there is not a funding imbalance with one group being more powerful than the other and that we have, as Senator Kyne said, transparency in the process.</p><p>The announcement this week by the Government that we will finally have the long overdue electoral commission is hugely significant.  I hope it addresses the issues contained in this Bill and that all civic society organisations are provided with a meaningful opportunity to take part in the debate around that commission.  There are several functions of the new commission I would like to see addressed.  One such function concerns an overhaul of the electoral register, which I think almost everybody would agree with.  There is also the question of political education, not just in schools but for the wider public, about how our democracy operates and how to influence the legislative process.  There is within the programme for Government reference to investment in a fund which will support research into politics and electoral research.  The programme for Government commits to examining by-elections and whether they should be replaced with alternate lists.  That would be worthwhile.</p><p>In particular, it will be important that it examines the question of online political advertising and microtargeting.  I agree with Senator Ruane that we cannot leave it to the tech giants to self-regulate in this area.  There must be a role for the State in the regulation of online advertising.  This will be one of the biggest challenges the new commission will face.</p><p>Elections and political funding are always a source of controversy.  There is a noble intent behind this legislation but I do not want to see the provisions contained in this excellent Bill used in such a way, and Senator Mullen referred to this in some ways, that funding raised outside the State would be used to unfairly influence our political system.  This is not to stop valid civil society organisations operating here.  There are a number of flaws with our electoral legislation at the moment but we have spending limits and much more transparency than other countries.  It is not perfect but it is better than other countries.  The Twenty-six Counties' regulations are far more stringent than the UK donation regulations which are preferred by the wealthiest political party on this island.</p><p>I would fear a move to a situation similar to that in the US.  There would be difficulty distinguishing between civil society organisations and political action committees, such as are found in the US.  It is not the intention but it is something we will have to address.  During the Brexit referendum we saw this was the case where a group called the Constitutional Research Council donated &pound;435,000 to the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, to support the leave campaign, which included the DUP engaging in online advertising in Britain, not just in the North.  Equally, we have to address questions around money being raised at a $500 per plate dinner in the Trump Hotel in Manhattan or a political party getting a &pound;4 million donation from a reclusive electrician.  We have to ensure mechanisms whereby money from outside the State cannot be used to fund online political campaigns.</p><p>One of the challenges we have with the lack of proper regulation, especially of online advertising, is that Facebook, Twitter and others say they self-regulate but everybody knows they do not.  Senator Ruane is correct that we have to address that in terms of a role for State.  The scale of what is happening with the political action committees and the Super PACs in the US is frightening.  I happened to look at it today.  The super PACs in the US are different from the political action committees in that they cannot give money to specific candidates but can generally fund a campaign.  To date this year in the US, they have raised $2.3 billion and spent more than $1.5 billion.  I do not want us to get into a situation where that happens.  I am aware that is not the intent of the Bill but when we come to address this we have to ensure, while supporting civic society organisations to engage in political debate, that we do not allow undue influence or malign forces in our democratic process.  Given our role, with particular regard to data and data management, there may also be an interest from other powers and other states in influencing our democratic process.</p><p>My colleague, Deputy Lawless, is, as has been said by Senator Higgins, bringing forward legislation in the D&aacute;il.  This is a hugely important legislation and I ask for the Minister of State's assurance that it will be given priority when it goes to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I quite like the definitions in it.  I am someone who has built my whole life on advocacy, working in communities and being an activist.  The obvious choice of career was to try to move into politics and make that effective change from inside this House.  I understand the chilling effect on freedom of speech of advocacy groups that this definition has brought about.  I have been aware of it in organisations and somewhere on file there are probably letters I have written complaining about it.  I am <i>ad idem</i>with Members when it comes to the spirit behind this legislation.</p><p>I welcome what is in the programme for Government, what is being brought forward and the initiatives being taken in the area of the electoral reform commission and the idea of bringing this before the joint Oireachtas committee.  I am on that committee and I pledge to make sure to watch this and make sure it does not slip off the agenda.</p><p>One of my great discoveries in this House has been having fantastic conversations thus far and looking forward to many more with Senator Byrne.  We are in a similar nerdy mode when it comes to data and we exchange nerdy words on data.  One of my key concerns and one of the big things affecting democracy is the use of social media and not just with regard to online political advertising.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My concern is that the definition we are trying to legislate for is far too narrow.  If we have learned anything from the Cambridge Analytica data breach, the documentaries made about it and the books written on it, either by whistleblowers or by people trying to clear their conscience and save their careers, it is that social media affects how we think and is designed to manipulate us.  Social media is designed to control us and to get inside our heads in ways that we do not even realise in order to manipulate us.  Those of us who did the old-fashioned thing and bought <i>The Irish Times </i>this morning will have read the same articles<i>.  </i>We might agree or disagree with what we read but at least we all got the same news from the same source.  The problem with social media is that it is tailored to our likes, depending on how long we pause to look at a particular image, for example.  People can go down a rabbit hole, follow something innocuous and end up being exposed to extreme content.  They can be radicalised towards violence or positions of ultra-fear.  <br/><br/>When we are looking at electoral reform and how we deal with definitions, we need to consider the role of social media and the issue of how our democracy is being undermined.  When it comes to news feeds and information being fed to us through social media, people will see very different things because they like different things or are of different genders, have children of different ages and so on.  Everything about our lives is manipulated to commodify us as human beings and turn us into purchasers and users.  That stream of influence in our lives is in private hands for marketing and profit purposes.  It is not like the old days when people would congregate outside this House and try to influence those who are legislating; we do not really know where power lies anymore because of social media.  The social media giants need to be taken on and legislated for and I say that in due recognition of all of the employment they provide in this State.  They represent a massive threat to democracy.  We have already seen the evidence of that in Britain and the US and we should take it very seriously.  We need to consider the points made earlier within the larger conversation and we need to be legislating far more powerfully.  We actually need to go further than what is being proposed here.</p></speech>

I commend my colleagues, Senators Ruane and Higgins, on this Private Members' Bill which is absolutely fantastic.</p> <p>I would consider myself an activist.  I am the founder of a charitable organisation and understand how difficult it is to raise funds, particularly in the absence of Government funding.  Civil society organisations work to influence public policy for the benefit of people living in this country.  The advocacy work of civil society organisations has been at the forefront of transformative positive change in Ireland and this rich tradition must continue.  Any constraints on their activities are totally undemocratic.  Many civil society organisations are supportive of this Bill and see it as a defence of civil liberties and human rights.  </p> <p>One of the many organisations that will be impacted by the provisions of the Electoral Act is Frontline Defenders, an international human rights organisation based in Dublin.  I am sure the Minister of State is well aware of that organisation which works to advance the protection of at-risk human rights defenders in all regions of the world.  How does it breach the spirit of a law that was passed to prevent foreign influence on the outcome of elections here for this organisation to fundraise to protect human rights defenders?  Other organisations that will also be impacted include the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, which exists to raise public awareness of human rights issues, Amnesty International Ireland which researches and campaigns with the aim of preventing and ending grave human rights abuses and Transparency International Ireland, the Irish chapter of the worldwide movement against corruption.  </p> <p>I am deeply worried about provisions that were inserted in 2001 into section 22 of the Electoral Act of 1997, as amended, which appear to prohibit any person or organisation based in Ireland from accepting sizeable or international donations to assist them in influencing public policy.  I am also concerned by the impact of the onerous tracking and reporting requirements that attach to small domestic donations.  The Electoral Act's civil society donation restrictions should be confined to advocacy aimed at achieving a certain result in elections and referendums only.  Civil society organisations should be allowed to freely advocate on public policy issues outside of campaigning in an election or referendum for which the date has been set.  Denying funding to civil society organisations amounts to silencing the people's voice and weakening democracy.  </p> <p>I have worked closely with many of these organisations, particularly on legislation about which I am passionate including the Occupied Territories Bill and the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  Indeed, I could not have done that work without them and I am still working with them today.  They are absolutely incredible and are so passionate about the work they do.  They are truly an inspiration.  It is highly likely that in conducting their day-to-day business, civil organisations could be involved in activities that would fall within the definition of "political purposes" in that they would be attempting to promote or procure a particular outcome in the context of a policy or policies of the Government or of public authorities including local authorities.  </p> <p>Civil society organisations are essential and I know the Minister of State is aware of this.  They are essential to the democratic process in this country and we must do whatever we can to protect the freedom of these organisations.  I would love the Minister of State to consider allowing this Bill to progress to the next Stage and then work with Senator Ruane on amending it, if necessary.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Ruane for bringing the Bill forward which enables us to debate and consider the relevant issues around the definition of "political purposes" as set out in electoral law.  I would also like to commend the Civil Engagement Group on its work on the matter, as well as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, with which I have engaged in recent weeks.</p> <p>Like many Members of this House, I come from an advocacy and campaigning background with environmental organisations, Traveller development groups and many really important groups that have helped to shape civil society.  Many of us were involved in the fantastic Repeal campaign which was an amazing national campaign.  I literally had to climb over barriers to get here this evening and am acutely aware of the barriers that civil society must overcome to be active participants in our democratic processes.  In that context, I commend the intent behind this Bill.  </p> <p>If the House is in agreement, I will read my statement and then I will try to respond to some of the really excellent points that were made in what was a fantastic debate.  As Members are aware, the Electoral Act 1997, as amended, provides the statutory framework for dealing with political donations and sets out the regulatory regime covering a wide range of interrelated issues such as the funding of political parties, the reimbursement of election expenses, the establishment of election expenditure limits, the disclosure of election expenditure, the setting of limits on permissible donations, the prohibition of certain donations, the disclosure of donations and the registration of third parties who accept donations given for political purposes which exceed &euro;100.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Act also provides for the independent supervision of these provisions by the Standards in Public Office Commission, which has published a number of guidelines to inform candidates standing for election, Members of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament, political parties, corporate donors and third parties of their obligations under the Act.<br/><br/>As the body responsible for the implementation of the Act's provisions, over the years SIPO has raised concerns in its annual reports about the wide-ranging nature of the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; and its potential impact on the ordinary affairs of civil society.  For example, in its annual report for 2018, SIPO recommended that &quot;An electoral commission should be established, and a comprehensive review of the Electoral Acts should take place.&quot;  A similar recommendation was included in its annual report for 2019.<br/><br/>Before I proceed to the Private Members' Bill itself, it might be useful to recall that, under the Act, a third party is required, on receipt of a donation exceeding the value of &euro;100, and before incurring any expenses for political purposes, or any further such expenses, to furnish to SIPO the name and address of the third party and the name and address of the person responsible for its organisation, management or financial affairs; a statement of the nature, purpose and estimated amount of donations to, and proposed expenses of, the third party during the year; and an indication of any connection the third party may have with any political party or candidate at an election or referendum or otherwise.  In addition, and similar to the requirements on candidates standing for election, for Members of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament and political parties, where a monetary donation in excess of &euro;100 is received, an account in a financial institution in the State must be opened and maintained and the donation and any subsequent monetary donations, irrespective of value, must be lodged to that account.  A number of statutory statements and supporting documents must also be submitted to SIPO by the deadlines prescribed in the Act - for example, by a date no later than 31 January in each year for elected Members.<br/><br/>In very broad terms, the political donations regime applies more or less equally to candidates standing for election, Members of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament, political parties and third parties who are in receipt of donations given for political purposes where a donation has been received which exceeds the &euro;100 threshold.  While third parties must provide the information which I have just set out, unlike the other obligated parties under the Act, they are not required to make donation statements which are made public by SIPO.<br/><br/>While the Bill is relatively short, it deals with an issue that is complex and, more importantly, plays a critical role in preserving the integrity of our elections and our wider democratic processes.  In simple terms, the Bill proposes to amend the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; in section 22(2)(<i>aa</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997, as amended by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, by removing the reference to third parties in a number of places within the definition and by restricting the obligations on third parties solely to electoral periods.  The definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; informs and underpins the application of our entire political donations regime.<br/><br/>I would like to state that I welcome and support the active participation of a vibrant and diverse civil society throughout all aspects of our political decision-making processes and wish to acknowledge the significant contribution they have made, and continue to make, in this regard.  The most effective democracies worldwide are founded on robust structures, active citizenship and civil society advocating for and working towards greater transparency and accountability for decision makers and political institutions.<br/><br/>I also note the concerns that civil society has raised in connection with the wide-ranging nature of the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot; provided for in the Electoral Act 1997, in particular, the adverse impact it can have on the ordinary activities of civil society and the means by which they legitimately raise funds to run their normal day-to-day operations, outside of any specific electoral or referendums periods.  Nonetheless, while I accept there is merit in reviewing the definition of &quot;political purposes&quot;, given the complexities of our political donations regime and its impact across all participants in the electoral and democratic processes, including prospective candidates standing for election, Members of the Oireachtas, Members of the European Parliament, political parties, third parties, individual donors and corporate donors, I am strongly of the view that any review should be comprehensive and objective and should be undertaken in tandem with a wider review of the entire 1997 Act.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the political donations regime as provided for in the 1997 Act needs to apply in a manner that is proportionate, fair and balanced to all participants.  Anything less than a thorough review could possibly result in more unintended consequences arising, over and above those that civil society has rightly argued have given rise to the current situation, with potential adverse implications for transparency in our electoral processes.  Against this background, the Government is opposed to this Private Members' Bill.  However, I wish to assure this House that the issues at the heart of the Bill can be considered further in the context of wider electoral reform proposals, which I intend to bring forward shortly.  My Department is currently finalising the general scheme of an electoral reform Bill, which will establish an independent, statutory electoral commission, provide for the modernisation of the electoral registration process, introduce new regulatory provisions to ensure transparency in online paid political advertising, as referenced extensively throughout this debate, and facilitate the holding of electoral events during Covid-19-type restrictions.<br/><br/>The plans to establish an electoral commission are now at an advanced stage within my Department and, in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government - Our Shared Future, it is intended that an electoral commission will be in place by the end of next year.  My Department is working to meet this commitment and is confident that it can be met.  With this in mind, the proposed general scheme of an electoral reform Bill will be brought to Government shortly for its consideration.<br/><br/>As I alluded to earlier, one of the initial functions proposed for the electoral commission, when established, will be to oversee the regulation of online paid-for political advertisements commissioned for use during electoral periods.  The general scheme will include provisions to regulate online political advertisements with a view to ensuring that such advertisements are clearly labelled and display certain specified information.  These obligations will apply to both the buyers and sellers of political advertising in the online sphere.<br/><br/>Members might wish to note that the provisions on online advertising are being prepared having regard to the detailed proposal from the interdepartmental group on the security of Ireland's electoral process and disinformation, which was agreed by the last Government in early November 2019.  This was developed following a public consultation process and the holding of an open policy forum in the latter half of 2018 to elicit the views of a variety of stakeholders, including from the media and political spheres, online companies, the advertising industry and academia, as well as representatives from civil society.  The interdepartmental group's proposal recommended that the scope of what constitutes a political advertisement should align with the scope of &quot;political purposes&quot; as defined under the Electoral Act 1997.  This would ensure consistency across all legislation, albeit the proposal acknowledged that the definition would be examined as part of a wider review of the Act and the establishment of the electoral commission.<br/><br/>It is intended that the general scheme, following the Government's consideration, will be referred to the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to undergo pre-legislative consideration in accordance with the Standing Orders of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I give a commitment that this will be given careful and due consideration at that stage.  It is anticipated that this process would commence later this year.  Pre-legislative consideration of the proposed general scheme will provide an opportunity for, among other matters, a detailed scrutiny of the issues which the Private Members' Bill aims to address.  While it will be a matter for the joint committee to determine the course of any such pre-legislative consideration, given the general scheme will refer to the definition in the Electoral Act 1997, I believe this could provide an opportunity for the meaning of &quot;political purposes&quot; to be examined on a cross-party basis and could also facilitate an examination of the obligations on third parties under the Act versus those on political parties and prospective candidates.<br/><br/>As part of the pre-legislative process, it also would be open to the joint committee to invite the views of civil society, SIPO and other stakeholders to inform its consideration of the general scheme on this issue and on other issues, as the case may be.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This was discussed at great length with Senator Ruane in our discussions in the lead up to this evening.</p><p>Senators may recall that the programme for Government commits the electoral commission, when established, to undertake a number of items of research such as those on the use of posters at elections and referendums, as well as the expansion of postal voting provisions.  In addition, it is proposed that a comprehensive review of the Electoral Act will be carried out with a view to making recommendations to address, among other matters, the concerns raised by civil society.  It is envisaged that the proposed review could be completed within a relatively short timeframe, following the commission's establishment.  In addition, I anticipate that any report that may arise from the pre-legislative process could, in due course, inform the electoral commission in the proposed review of the Act.</p><p>The proposed Bill before us today seeks to address an issue that is both complex and integral to maintaining transparency regarding our political donations regime.  Accordingly, it is important, deserving of careful consideration and merits an objective analysis of its implications and impacts.  In this context, I am of the view that the approach proposed by the Government would, in the final analysis, deliver an objective, clear and more efficient outcome for all affected parties with regard to the entirety of the interrelated provisions in the Electoral Act 1997, including its impact on the ordinary affairs of civil society.  </p><p>Before I conclude, I will try to address some of the items raised by Senators in what has been a really worthwhile debate.  I give my commitment to both the proposer and seconder of the Bill that the Government will give the legislation the scrutiny that it deserves.  We will invite in the civil society organisations to give them an opportunity to have their say in that regard.  It is really important that we have such engagement because, like the Senators, I share their absolute sentiments in this regard.</p><p>Other issues have been raised about the electoral commission and the work it might carry out.  Certainly, this has been a long-held aspiration of previous sittings of the D&aacute;il.  The work done by the commission will be really important, including the issue that has been raised about election postering.  I ran a campaign for the most recent general election without election posters, which is an example of a successful candidate running an election campaign without posters.</p><p>The issue concerning the use of personal public service numbers, PPSNs, for the electoral register will be addressed in the wider context of this electoral reform Bill.  The point has been well raised by Senators about foreign groups wishing to campaign in Ireland.  A lot of important issues have been raised this evening.</p><p>Finally, I thank Senator Ruane for bringing the Bill forward and I thank Senators for a really useful debate.   </p></speech>
