    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#C00400"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte.  I look forward to working with her in her new portfolio.  It is great to see a woman from the west because she will be well aware of the Commencement matter I will raise today.  It relates to Portiuncula University Hospital, in Ballinasloe, and investment under the HSE capital plan for 2021 and also the HSE winter plan for 2020.  As the Minister of State would know very well, Portiuncula is a level 3, 24-7 hospital.  It operates 365 days a year.  It never stops.  It handles casualty, maternity and surgical services and is part of the Saolta network.  It is one of the seven hospitals that are part of the network in the west and we so need our hospitals in the west to be hospitals fit for the 21st century.</p> <p>What surprised me when I was involved in fighting for the 50-bed unit last year was that the hospital handles a catchment area of more than 500,000 people.  It is amazing.  It covers five counties including east Galway, Roscommon, parts of Westmeath, Offaly, north Tipperary and, as the Minister of State would know, Portumna.  It even covers Athlone, with a population of more than 21,000 people.  If one lives in Athlone one was more than likely born in Portiuncula hospital.</p> <p>For people in Ballinasloe, the hospital is an integral part of our identity and a vital service.  Close to 800 people work in the hospital.  We have excellent healthcare teams.  We recently won funding awards with Sl&aacute;intecare.  However, the hospital infrastructure dates back to the 1940s.  There is a dire lack of shower and toilet facilities and for an area of 400,000 people, Portiuncula hospital has only 13 single rooms.  I am not talking about ICU beds; I am talking about single rooms to keep people safe from infection.  It is made up of six- and eight-bed wards.  In the face of this crisis, a special ward was designated for Covid-19 patients within the hospital.  The general manager and the teams in the hospital have taken the initiative.  They have moved the outpatient department to a modular unit in the car park.  They have funding for that modular unit but funds are now required for the next step to develop the outpatients unit into 13 en suite single rooms.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Can the Minister confirm that sufficient funds are listed in the HSE 2021 capital plan for the redesign and repurposing of the outpatients&rsquo; area in Portiuncula hospital as a matter of urgency?  We need those 13 rooms now and even if the work is started in January it will be February before it will be set up.  When I was a county councillor in 2019, the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, and I were at a meeting here with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, and commitments were given on the 50-bed unit.  A 50-single-bed unit was committed to and the enabling works have started.  The investment for that is crucial for the hospital to ensure adequate facilities.  These are just single rooms to avoid basic overcrowding, infection and to ensure that there is dignity for end-of-life for patients.  As I mentioned we need a hospital that is fit for the 21st century.</p><p>Can the Minister confirm if follow-on funding is available for stage two construction of this 50-bed single unit and if the tender process is to commence in January, with HSE estates?  We looked for and were given a date last year with a construction start date of July 2021.  </p><p>Finally, the CT scanner is not currently fully operational in the hospital. The Minister of State may be aware of this.  It is due for equipment replacement in 2022.  Can the Minister of State consider within the Department of Health if a replacement CT scanner could be an urgent request for the 2021 equipment budget to allow for early diagnosis and to assist teams handling of waiting lists?  </p><p>I thank the Minister of State for her time.  I know that of all Ministers, and being a woman from the west, she is aware of the crucial importance of that hospital and of the lack of investment over the past number of decades.  I look forward to hearing more from the Minister of State now about the great budget we have achieved with an extra &euro;4 billion, and the commitment to bed capacity.</p></speech>

It is my first opportunity in a public session to congratulate her on her appointment as a Minister of State and, equally, to thank her for her work in the recent budget in securing &euro;100 million for disability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#D00300"><p>I thank Senator Dolan for placing this matter today.  Before I go to the script it gives me great pleasure to discuss Portiuncula Hospital given that my youngest child was born there.  It is 24 miles down the road from me so I know it intimately.  Many of my constituents work in Portiuncula Hospital and it is embedded in the fabric not just of Ballinasloe but in the wider spread of the area.  It provides a great service.  I will read the script and then I will focus on the two main questions the Senator has asked.</p> <p>Portiuncula hospital, Ballinasloe is one our acute general and maternity hospitals that delivers a patient-centred, quality-driven focused service and provides a wide range of diagnostic and support services. The hospital catchment area, as the Senator has referred, includes east Galway, Roscommon, the midlands and the mid-western areas.   </p> <p>The construction of the 50-bed ward block is an important project for this hospital.  A contractor was appointed for the enabling works commenced on the 11 August 2020 and due for completion by 25 May 2021.  It intended to advertise for contractors for construction of the 50-bed ward block in the second quarter of 2020.  That should be about to progress as we speak now.  This is with a view to commencing works on-site in mid-2021, subject to the availability of funding.  This project is on the capital plan and the Senator was given commitments by the previous Minister.  I have been speaking to the current Minister on this project and it is a focus to keep this project live and to ensure there is funding following for it.</p> <p>As the Senator knows this winter is expected to be particularly challenging due to the presence of Covid-19 and the Government's determination to meet the challenge is demonstrated by its decision to invest the additional &euro;600 million in the health services this winter: &euro;200 million in 2020 ands &euro;400 million in 2021, to support the roll-out of the winter-specific measures.</p> <p>For Portiuncula Hospital, it is proposed to provide the additional space addressed by the Senator with a prefab-modular building for segregation which will provide an immediate solution for emergency department streaming for winter 2020 at the hospital.  The modular building proposed will facilitate 14 temporary Covid-19 emergency department and minor injuries treatment and assessment rooms with associated support facilities.  The unit will also have a residual value for the displacement of outpatient accommodation after the Covid-19 emergency.  It states here that it is expected that the building will be ready for occupation by March 2021 but I have a slight concern that it will be ready for occupation by that date because that is at the end of our winter period.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The staff and management of Portiuncula University Hospital would like to have a commitment that they could actually start.  We all know that the accident and emergency department in the hospital is head-to-toe when it gets really busy.  Due to Covid and social distancing it does not have the facility, hence the request that it needs to be prioritised.  Other hospitals around the country are in the same position.  That is the nature of the question.</p><p>I have spoken to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, about the matter and I am trying to get it prioritised.  Deputy Denis Naughten has also raised this issue.  It is an issue of priority for constituents in the area.  The staff and patients are at risk.  The demographics of the area usually show that there is an older population.  There is a fear on the part of GPs in terms of referring people to the hospital because it does not have adequate space for their patients.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  It is great to hear that commitment.  The commitment to Portiuncula University Hospital and the Saolta group mean that our healthcare teams in the west will be able to cope when faced with the worst public health crisis ever.  It means that patients in our hospital will receive the care that they deserve.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to accelerate the project if at all possible.  We need it now.  As far as I know, the modular unit is up and running.  Funding was received for that and the hospital authorities moved things out of the outpatient unit.  If we could get a move on that quickly the beds would be available.  There could be single rooms to handle isolation.  The hospital is dealing with infectious patients, be they potential Covid cases or the normal flu, and there is no place to isolate them. </p> <p>I appreciate the commitment of the Minister of State on this.  As she will be aware, all public representatives very much support the hospital and hope that, at a national level, the HSE will give that commitment as soon as possible to the Saolta healthcare group.  I appreciate the time of the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#E00300"><p>I thank Senator Dolan.  I did not answer the question on the CT scanner.  The HSE advised that the replacement of the CT scanner in Portiuncula is scheduled for 2021 or 2022, through the HSE equipment replacement programme.  Priority for replacement is based on risk categorisation covering age dependability and service history, with capacity for replacement depending on availability of funding.</p> <p>If there is an issue in anything I have said that could support the management of the hospital in terms of risk categorisation, perhaps it can be reviewed.  The Senator should be assured from the Department and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, that we want to work with all local public and elected representatives to ensure that the 14-bed modular unit and isolation rooms are made available, not just for isolation but the protection of everybody coming into the hospital.  I look forward to working with the Senator on that.</p></speech>

I am raising the issue of St. John of God Community Services in response to a letter I received from Councillor Paddy McQuillan in Louth County Council.  He is involved with the service and is a local representative.  He circulated to me a letter he received from the chief executive, as did all of the staff and their colleagues, a copy of which I have passed to the Minister of State, dated 30 September 2020.</p> <p>The substance of this correspondence is that the St. John of God Community Services is to end its involvement in disability and mental health services and transfer all of that responsibility to the HSE.  St. John of God services stated that the reason this is happening is because there is an issue with funding.  There is a funding crisis that cannot be sustained, in its view.  Services have been subsidised by it from other resources, both its personal resources and those of the order which were never collected or intended to be used to subsidise the community services they operate. </p> <p>As we know, St. John of God provides services for more than 8,000 children, adolescents and adults with intellectual disabilities across Dublin, Kildare, Kerry, Wicklow, Meath and Louth.  It employs 3,000 staff and has volunteers in excess of that number.  It has 300 locations.  More than 2,500 people in receipt of day, residential and respite services will be affected.  This is really critical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The order has told me that there is a &euro;27 million annual funding gap and an accumulated deficit of &euro;27.7 million.  These are staggering figures.  I have spoken to the chief executive of St. John of God Community Services yesterday, Claire Dempsey.  I updated myself.  I was convinced by my short conversation that there was a genuine willingness on the part of the organisation and the brothers to engage with the Minister of State and the HSE to get a resolution.  The Hospitaller Order of St. John of God has a strong track record while having diminishing religious vocations.  The order has a rich legacy that has served the State exceptionally well in a wide variety of supports and services.</p><p>My concern is firstly for the clients and service users.  I am also concerned for the employees who work in these services throughout the country as well as their families and the families of the service users.  This is critical.</p><p>Funding is an issue and it has to be resolved.  It is not a question of a blame game with the HSE versus the Department of Health versus the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God.  It is simply that there has to be a sustainable agreement to ensure these services are provided.</p><p>There is also an impact because we know the Government policy with regard to congregated settings and breaking up large institutions.  We have had enough talk about institutions in recent days to keep us going for years.  There are new models and policies of care but they do not come cheap.</p><p>There are difficulties and they need to be bridged.  I appeal to the Minister of State for her response.  People really need to know what is going on, whether we can get these talks back on track and whether we can get an arrangement whereby St. John of God Community Services will consider options with the Minister of State in a constructive way on how to fund these essential services.  This is not for the order, the Minister of State or the HSE but for the people who avail of these important care services.</p></speech>

It gives me the opportunity to bring the Senator through my engagement since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for disability matters.</p> <p>Before I continue, I wish to say this is not a blame game.  I could not agree more with Senator Boyhan on that.  This is about the service users, their families, the employees and delivering services to the most vulnerable in our society who require these services.</p> <p>While St. John of God Community Services is in this particular situation regarding funding, we know the disability sector was underfunded for many years.  We also know that we have a sustainability issue within the disability sector, where service providers provide a great deal of care.  They are not unique in this regard.  When we talk to the service providers or anyone within the HSE or the Department, that is exactly what we hear.  It is the clear message coming out.</p> <p>St. John of God Community Services currently provide services to over 2,400 children and adults with intellectual disabilities in community healthcare organisation areas 4,6, 7 and 8.  They also provide mental health services and supports to over 5,600 children, adolescents and adults in CHO areas 6 and 7.  The HSE has worked closely with the St. John of God organisation over several years to support it in its role and assist it in addressing the financial and governance challenges.</p> <p>Against this background I held a meeting on 24 September 2020 with representatives of St. John of God which included Department of Health and HSE officials.  I outlined my position and plans for the disability sector and encouraged St. John of God to engage with the HSE and address the issues facing the organisation.  Nevertheless, following a board meeting of the organisation on the same day, St. John of God formally served the HSE with 12 months' notice of its intention to terminate the provision of services under its section 38 arrangement with the HSE, with a view to transferring responsibility for delivering disability and mental health services to the State by October 2021.</p> <p>I am keenly aware that the decision of St. John of God may cause anxiety for many of the service users concerned and their families as well as the staff working in the organisation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, I assure them that there are processes in place to ensure continuity of service provision, which are underpinned by service arrangements between the HSE and St. John of God.  St. John of God will continue to be responsible for providing disability and mental health services over the next 12 months.  During this period, the HSE will work with St. John of God to put in place suitable arrangements to transfer provision of these services to another appropriate organisation. </p><p>St. John of God is required to continue providing services from the effective date of termination or expiry of the 12-month notice period until such time as any new service arrangements become effective.  If the 12-month notice period ends and the transfer of services has not yet been finalised, St. John of God is obliged to continue providing the services for up to another six months to allow the transfer to be completed.  In effect, the whole process could take up to 18 months.  I understand that the HSE also purchases some mental health services from St. John of God on a private basis, which are not governed by the section 38 service arrangement.  The HSE is already making provision for community mental health services in Loughlinstown and D&uacute;n Laoghaire primary care centres.</p><p>The primary concern of this Government is to ensure the continuity of the vital services provided by St. John of God in the interests of service users, families and staff.</p></speech>

These are difficult times for all of us in terms of our physical and mental well-being.  They are particularly difficult for people with disabilities and the type of people being supported by the St. John of God Community Services.  I am encouraged by what the Minister of State said.  I will write to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, today to ask him if we can see a speeding up of the engagement.  We have a timeframe which the Minister of State outlined but it ticks away quite quickly.  These are complex issues and big issues in terms of finance.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State's comprehensive and frank layout of what is at stake and I encourage all sides to engage early to ultimately create a better service for users, employees and the communities in which they operate.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and recognise his concerns.  It is the first time I have been given the opportunity to put on the record my engagement with St. John of God and my plea to it on that day to not serve notice on us, to work with me, as a Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities, and to give me the opportunity to understand their concerns and to work with the HSE and the Department.  It was its prerogative on that day to take the decision it took.  I regret it and I do not wish any anxiety or stress to be placed on service users, their families or staff.  Over the coming months I will ensure that nobody is left languishing and waiting for answers or responses.  Everyone will be left clear and communication will be crystal clear.  I will work with the HSE and the Department to ensure there is communication and service users understand exactly what is going on.</p></speech>

It is the first time I have had the chance to publicly congratulate her on her appointment as Minister of State.  I have no doubt that with her work ethic and compassion, she will make a big difference to the lives of people with a disability.  I also want to say well done to the Minister of State on securing a significant disability budget, the highest in the history of the State, in budget 2021.  Now we have to make sure that makes a difference on the ground to the people who matter because it is about implementation and improving lives.</p> <p>I will talk about the issue of children with disabilities, particularly in Kildare.  I was contacted at the beginning of this month by a mother, Samantha Kenny, about her daughter, Ava, who I had dealt with before.  She was distraught to receive a letter saying that three therapists and one part-time therapist would be taken away from the network disability team, NDT, in Kildare in order to deal with early assessments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We all know how important early assessments are but it should not be a competition between assessments and early intervention.  Since I spoke about this issue I have been contacted by a number of parents in Kildare.  It is not a lie to say they are absolutely distraught.  It has been months since March, when their therapists were taken away from them to do contact tracing.  In that time, these children did not have the opportunity to be in school so they further regressed.  Now, when things had been getting back to some level of normality, the fact these vital services will be removed again is simply shocking.</p><p>I understand that therapists, by which I mean physiotherapists, speech therapists and occupational therapists, are being taken away to work on contact tracing.  We all know how important contact tracing is during this crisis but to create a backlog of dire situations and consequences for children is absolutely not the way to do it.  All of the research on children with disabilities shows the importance of community-based early intervention and the importance of interdisciplinary team work.  The fact that Ava and her peers are not getting this at present in Kildare is absolutely wrong.  We cannot allow this situation to go on.</p><p>We are not speaking about luxuries.  We are speaking about a passport to life for these children.  We are talking about a situation where children are being denied access to speech therapy to help their communication.  The right to be able to communicate is a basic human right.  It is something that all of us in the Chamber take for granted.  Not having a system in place whereby we ensure children have the right to communicate is absolutely wrong.</p><p>We all know that early intervention as well as assessment is key to ensuring children with disabilities can live the best lives they can and can take their places within the community and society.  It is absolutely wrong that after assessments are carried out, there is no programme of supports and services to enable these children and support their families.  What is happening is completely and utterly unacceptable and I hope the Minister of State can put this right.</p></speech>

I want to go back to the question she submitted, which was on redeployment to address assessments of need.  We are speaking about speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physical therapists.  This is the question the Senator laid before me to address today.  My answer does not comprehensively address this but I would like to address it and bring the Senator up to speed on it.</p> <p>The reason &euro;7.8 million was provided from Sl&aacute;intecare funding was to address the backlog in assessments of needs for in excess of 6,500 children.  This is why, in conjunction with the Department and the HSE, I put in place a plan to address it and get everybody on the one page where the assessments of needs are done and, at the same time, put in place a plan for the delivery of services through our clinicians at the other end.</p> <p>The deployment piece is what the Senator has raised this morning.  It is something that is becoming a more alarming concern to me because it is not just in the Senator's community healthcare organisation area but throughout the country.  I spoke to Paul Reid and Anne O'Connor on 5 October and I raised it as a huge concern for me.  Only this week, I spoke to Fergal Goodman in the Department and other principal officers to portray my fears and anxieties about the families and the children such as Ava throughout the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I can say that while I have an investment, parents are not feeling that they are getting the calls, we cannot support them and are not in a position to deliver.  Not only is the HSE sending the kinds of letters to which the Senator referred but I am also aware that other providers under sections 38 and 39 that have been commissioned to do the work are also now part of the redeployment.  It is important for us to understand the need for contact tracing, the value of which was demonstrated by the report that one person who did not restrict his movement led to the infection of 56 others.</p><p>The are two things here, the first of which is the early intervention piece which applies to children from nought to six years of age.  If we do not get it then, we lose that piece because the child goes onto another list when he or she turns six and there is another backlog there.  This is a priority within my Department, hence the &euro;7.8 million allocated in August.  I can only say that the HSE and the Department of Health are working closely with me.  Contact tracers have been recruited through the HSE.  That is going on and they are being trained in as we speak.  The whole purpose is to let the staff, the trained clinicians, come back.  It is not happening quickly enough if parents are receiving those letters.  It is causing extra anxiety.</p><p>I received good news this week to the effect that, as part of essential services, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy will continue during level 5 restrictions.  They will not cease.  Those services did not continue during the previous lockdown but they will this time.  We should not find ourselves with mounting lists.  We should find ourselves addressing those issues through level 5.  I welcome that and thank the HSE and the Department for getting us to that position.</p><p>The National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will meet later today and I look forward to the outcomes of that as they apply to clinicians, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.  I hope that network disability teams will be repopulated to support young people with assessments of need.  The Senator can tell Ava's mum that is what has happened through my Department this week.  I say that to any other mothers in similar situations who are listening.  I am on top of it and across it and will stay that way until I know that everybody who was redeployed returns to fulfil the functions of their jobs.</p></speech>

It is certainly good news that therapy can continue through level 5.  I had asked the Minister of State to Kildare to meet representatives of KARE and the Muir&iacute;osa Foundation.  She had committed to doing that during October but the restrictions mean that cannot happen.</p> <p>When we talk about redeployment, there are two different kinds.  We are talking about therapists who are going to, or have gone to, contact tracing and those who went from intervention therapy to assessment therapy.  We need to battle this.  I want to know when children like Ava will receive the therapies that they absolutely need.</p> <p>I am still awaiting figures from the HSE to show where we are on assessments and early intervention.  I asked a similar question last year and 78% of children in Ireland were waiting more than three months for an initial assessment.  That was an absolute disgrace and bad indictment of the system.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for her support but I wish to know when these children, who absolutely need these therapies, will be given the opportunity to recommence them.</p></speech>

As I said, the &euro;7.8 million was to address the backlog.  I am on top of the redeployment piece.  There was a successful budget last week, out of which money was circled for the recruitment of additional staff, including another 100 therapist posts.  Some 100 therapists were secured under the most recent programme for Government.  It is sad to think that the last of those staff members to come on board, in early March, went straight into contact tracing.  They did not get to hit the ground running.  I want them brought back into the profession for which they were hired.  I also want the new posts that we were going to advertise to be filled in order that when the proper assessments of needs are completed for the backlog of cases, we will have therapists in place to carry out the interventions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Three items of work are being done, that is, recruitment, early intervention and assessment of need.

These matters have continued unabated.  It is estimated that in 2019, some 624 Palestinian-owned structures were demolished.  That is the number of structures but, of course, the number of people displaced by that is very significant.  It is probably between 700 and 1,000 people, families and children who were displaced.  It has continued this year during which, it is estimated, there have been 554 demolitions.  On 31 August, 107 homes and 46 retail units were demolished in east Jerusalem, while at the end of last month, four homes in the West Bank were demolished, so this is continuing.</p> <p>As to why this happens, there are a variety of reasons.  Sometimes it is just a feature of occupation and, undoubtedly, this kind of intervention has been a feature of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.  Sometimes it is punitive and involves military installations or military activity, but more often than not, it involves the failure of a Palestinian business, family or community to get a permit for the building.  That is kind of a nonsense because, as I understand it, in the period 2016 to 2018, there were 1,485 applications for such permits, 21 of which were granted, and that refers only to Area C in the West Bank, which is controlled by the Palestinian authorities alone.  As has been acknowledged, it should be for the Palestinian authorities only to grant those permits.</p> <p>There is no doubt this activity by the Israeli authorities is illegal under international law and the Geneva Convention.  It is recognised as such not just by Palestinian organisations and non-governmental human rights organisations but by transnational organisations such as the European Union and by the Government, yet it continues unabated.  In the same time that those 21 permits were granted, between 2016 and 2018, 6,000 Israeli settlement houses were built in the same area, Area C.  That is what we are dealing with.</p> <p>The reason I have raised this matter with the Minister of State is that many of these structures are built with the aid of the Irish taxpayer and the European taxpayer.  The European Union funds it, as does Irish Aid.  It is estimated that since May 2016, according to a statement by Federica Mogherini, the foreign policy chief of the European Union, &euro;329,000 worth of European taxpayers' money has been demolished by Israeli authorities, while another &euro;2.4 million of property is subject to demolition.  This is a major problem.  Irish Aid gave &euro;15 million to Palestine in 2008 and we contributed &euro;9 million to the UN Relief and Works Agency.  As a group of taxpayers, therefore, we are contributing to this.  We are doing the right thing, yet a national organisation is doing the wrong thing.  It is doing something illegal and what everyone recognises is against international law and its obligations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Barry Ward:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=BarryWard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like the Minister of State to tell the House what the Government is doing about it.  What steps have we taken, diplomatically or otherwise, to ensure that Israel understands our chagrin at this kind of behaviour and our dissatisfaction with its behaviour?  What are we doing to stop it?  What are we doing to send a message to Israel that we will not tolerate this waste of our taxpayers' money and of European taxpayers' money and, most of all, this gross violation of basic humanitarian behaviour?</p></speech>

Senator Ward raises extremely serious concerns that are being raised by many other colleagues, and I am delighted he has taken the opportunity this morning to raise them again.</p> <p>The demolition of Palestinian homes and the demolition or seizure of structures, including schools, is cruel and unjust.  These practices cause suffering to ordinary Palestinians and impinge on the right of children to an education.  Demolitions and seizures of Palestinian property and humanitarian aid, including Palestinian homes, have continued despite previous commitments from Israeli authorities not to target Palestinian residential structures during this pandemic.  The only conclusion we can draw from the systematic nature of these policies, especially in areas where illegal Israeli settlements have already been constructed, is that they are aimed at forcing Palestinians off their land.  In addition to its human impact, this activity undermines the feasibility of a two-state solution.</p> <p>Ireland has conveyed our views on these actions to the Israeli authorities.  In a statement last Friday the Minister for Foreign Affairs called on Israel to halt demolitions and to allow for legal construction for Palestinian residents.  Our ambassador in Tel Aviv has raised the issue of demolitions with the Israeli authorities in recent weeks along with a group of EU and non-EU colleagues.  Our representative in Ramallah remains engaged on this issue and regularly undertakes visits to sites affected by demolitions.  I understand that today the representative is due to take part in a visit by EU and other like-minded countries to a West Bank area threatened by demolitions.  Ireland is committed to reducing the vulnerability of Palestinian communities living in Area C of the West Bank.  Ireland is a member of the West Bank Protection Consortium, which plays a leading role in supporting threatened communities and co-ordinating the provision of essential services to them, including material assistance and legal aid.</p> <p>It is of additional concern - and the Senator rightly highlights this - when the structures confiscated or demolished are donor-funded.  The practice of demolition and confiscation of humanitarian assets, including education and schools infrastructure, is contrary to Israel's obligations under international law, including the provisions of international humanitarian law, in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Our principal concern is the hardship and injustice that demolitions and confiscations cause for Palestinian families.  It is important also, however, that the question of recompense for humanitarian relief funded by our taxpayers, as Senator Ward rightly said, should be pursued.  Ireland, together with a group of EU member states, pursues this issue consistently through the West Bank Protection Consortium.  It is the practice of the consortium to raise this directly with the Israeli authorities.  To date, the consortium has sought compensation of more than &euro;625,000 in respect of confiscated or demolished assets.  Ireland will continue to engage on these matters and will continue our support for a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a negotiated two-state solution.</p></speech>

I know he and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have a strong record of calling out this kind of behaviour.  I am also particularly glad to hear him use the word "recompense" because, as I said, while there is a massive humanitarian issue here, there is also a simple breach of international law.  There is also the fact that we are giving money to Palestine and it is being essentially destroyed or wasted by Israel.  I hope the Minister of State can also give us a commitment that Israel's behaviour will not interfere with the Irish policy, including aid policy, to continue to support Palestinian communities and the Palestinians in the West Bank who are suffering as a result of this Israeli behaviour.</p></speech>

Ireland has a really strong record on this, including among Members of the Oireachtas, who constantly raise the issues faced by the Palestinian people.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We express our deep concern at recent demolition and confiscation of properties, including in Hebron.  Our clear position on the settlements and our concern at the recent announcement by Israeli authorities for nearly 5,000 additional housing units bears restating.  Settlements are illegal and in contravention of international law.  Our position is underpinned by a long series of UN Security Council Resolutions.  Ireland has been forthright on these matters, publicly and privately, and indeed over many years.  That sentiment is shared right across the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Ireland's long-standing support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, annunciated 40 years ago this year by former Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Brian Lenihan Snr., remains an integral aspect of our foreign policy.  We remain steadfast in our support for a comprehensive two-state solution, which protects the future of the Palestinian and Israeli people.</p><p>Ireland is a strong and consistent voice on these issues in EU discussions.  We will continue to prioritise the Middle East peace process, particularly when we take up our seat on the UN Security Council, and we will do whatever we can in that role to advance efforts towards and just and lasting peace.

While much of this might be explained by the fact that we use English, that, in itself, does not excuse the fact we have not been able to embed a knowledge of European languages.  Employers regularly cite the lack of language skills as a major problem in the Irish workforce.</p> <p>In a post-Brexit scenario, having a greater knowledge of languages will be an opportunity for Ireland.  In addition to that, it is not just about languages, but understanding other cultures.  As the Minister of State is aware, the problem is that there has been a shortage of language teachers at second level for quite a while.  Second level school principals regularly cite one of their biggest fears as being a language teacher being ill or on maternity leave as it is practically impossible to get a substitute language teacher.  I welcome the commitment in the budget to significantly increase the number of Spanish teachers.  That is positive, but much more needs to be done.</p> <p>Some concern has been expressed that some of the exam questions are based much more around philosophical ideas rather than students' linguistic abilities.  This is something that needs to be examined by the State Examination Commission.  We also have to look at an active campaign, whereby we can encourage second level students to take up languages right to leaving certificate level and beyond.  Tied into that has to be a reinvigoration of the primary school languages initiative, which was announced more than a decade ago, but slowly but surely began not to have the same level of emphasis as it had in the past.  </p> <p>The Languages Connect Strategy, which was the foreign languages strategy launched by the Government in December 2017, was very ambitious.  It set out that it believed that Ireland should be among the top ten countries in Europe for the teaching and learning of modern European languages.  It set out 100 actions, but three years on, very little progress has been made on those actions.  That is certainly the case with the targets of increasing the number of post-primary schools offering two or more languages by 25%, and increasing the number of students taking two languages by 25%.  That has not happened.  We are talking about improving attitudes to foreign language learning, and I have not seen any campaign which is able to do that.</p> <p>Languages are important, and I am certain the Minister of State is aware of that, given his responsibility for European affairs.  It is not good enough for us or for employers to say every so often that we need to improve our language skills.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need real programmes and real actions to be able to do that.</p><p>In terms of addressing the shortage of language teachers, a number of years ago when there was a shortage of teachers for honours maths, there was a very successful higher diploma programme that operated in UL that allowed teachers of other subjects to upskill in that area.

Is &aacute;bhar an-th&aacute;bhactach &eacute; agus ceann a bhfuil i bhfad n&iacute;os t&aacute;bhtachta&iacute; anois i gcomhth&eacute;acs an Bhreatimeacht.</p> <p>This debate gives me an opportunity to outline some of the measures that the Government has taken and is taking to support the supply of foreign language teachers, which is a really critical issue, as the Senator rightly identified, and to provide an update on the implementation of the language strategy.</p> <p>In recent years everyone in the education sector has reported difficulties being experienced by some schools in recruiting post-primary teachers in certain subject areas, including teachers of foreign languages.  The Senator might be aware that I wrote a policy document on this very issue on behalf of our party a number of years ago.  I am glad that he shares my own concerns about this issue.</p> <p>As far as I know, the second language that was spoken on the first day of the D&aacute;il was not English but French, when George Gavan Duffy read out the Declaration of Independence.  English was spoken after that.</p> <p>In response to these issues, there was, as the Senator has mentioned, a teacher supply action plan published by the Department that contained a range of actions to address teacher supply and which focused on four policy areas, including higher education.  A number of those measures were aimed at supporting the supply of teachers of foreign languages.</p> <p>As the Senator will undoubtedly know, the Higher Education Authority, HEA, engaged with the higher education institutions to encourage the development of undergraduate initial teacher training programmes in targeted subjects, including foreign languages.  This has resulted in new programmes, but obviously it takes time to feed into the system.  Nonetheless, it is important to get the foundations right.  Since 2019, students can select an undergraduate programme to become a foreign language teacher.  This reduces costs they would incur by going on to do a masters in education.  These programmes are offered in DCU, UCC, with combinations including Irish, and Limerick, where two foreign languages can be taken on the programme.  There were 100 places available on these programmes in 2020, which represents significant additional capacity for foreign language teacher education in the system over the past two years.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the number of students due to graduate in foreign languages in 2020 from what I referred to as the traditional professional masters in education has also significantly increased.  Based on information from our higher education institutions, the graduates on these programmes have increased the potential teacher registrations of foreign languages by more than 130 this year compared with 70 last year.  That is starting to make a bit of progress.  Obviously we have to make sure that all of these people join and stay in our education system when they get the qualifications.</p> <p>In addition, the Higher Education Authority issued a call for proposals to upskill existing teachers to meet the Teaching Council's subject criteria in targeted subjects, including Spanish, as mentioned by the Senator.  The programmes are two years in duration, open to already registered post-primary teachers, and they will not have to pay fees.  It is intended that the details of these programmes will be announced in the coming weeks, and I am delighted that this is happening.</p> <p>With regard to Languages Connect, which is Ireland's strategy for foreign languages in education and which was published in November 2018, I am pleased to say that significant work has taken place at increasing and diversifying the range of foreign languages taught.  A key element of this work has been the development of four new leaving certificate curricular language specifications, which have been rolled out in 15 schools in September of this year, including Mandarin, Chinese, Lithuanian, Polish and Portuguese.</p> <p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has also published the national primary curriculum framework for public consultation, which recommends the reintroduction of foreign languages in senior classes at primary level.  That issue is a particular personal priority for the Taoiseach.  I look forward to seeing that rolled out and giving our kids the skills that, as the Senator rightly points out, they need.  It is not just a question of wanting it at this stage.</p></speech>

Quite frankly, we will have to get over it.  I do not know what the reason is.  I do not know whether it is because of the historical connotations of the Irish language of poverty.  We have our own national language here that, let us be honest, very few speak and that then leads to difficulties.</p><p>The challenges are considerable.  When I go to European meetings, I am surprised at the amount of English that is not spoken.  People are using English but many countries are using their own languages.  In fact, I spoke Irish at the General Affairs Council last week.  I was pleased to do so.  The French certainly do not use English at European meetings and they would probably prefer if we were speaking French to them as well.</p><p>We must upskill.  The Government is absolutely committed to this.  I am bringing forward a policy on recruitment into the European institutions where our biggest problem is the lack of languages.  It is not only so that we can all say &quot;<i>Bonjour</i>&quot;, &quot;<i>Danke</i>&quot;, or whatever.  We need a deep level of understanding and a high level of language capability among our graduates if we want to have people working in the European institutions.</p><p>We must change the national attitude around this.  At our disposal on every phone and television, we have Netflix where all of these television programmes are available in all sorts of languages.  Our young people, particularly, have a considerable opportunity now if they decide that languages are the thing for them.  When I was doing the leaving certificate, I went around in my father's car with a tape listening to conversations to practise for the oral examination.  Now one can watch every programme.  We need to grasp these opportunities to become fluent in other languages and go out there to other countries, particularly to the European Union, and be confident about it.  We need to put our case there, as our forefathers and foremothers in the D&aacute;il and Seanad did, for instance, in 1919, when, as I stated, George Gavan Duffy read the Declaration of Independence in French to speak that language of diplomacy.</p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue.  It is a priority for the Government.  I will certainly bring the points that the Senator raises to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, who is dealing with Covid-related matters in schools this morning.  The Minister is supporting Covid teams that will be giving help to schools in the next few weeks.  That is why Deputy Foley is not here and she asked me to convey her apologies to the House.</p></speech>

I am not speaking to any particular cases that are currently ongoing, any particular civil case or any other prosecution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A Tusla report, however, has indicated that the allegations are well founded, and an independent appeals panel upheld the findings of the report.  The acknowledgement of the allegations of historical child abuse and rape within St. John Ambulance makes me very concerned that, over the decades, more people may have been sexually abused than those who have come forward or who are proceeding with a civil case against a perpetrator.</p><p>I have a request to make of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Before bringing the Minister in here today, we did our work to see who would be responsible for a scoping exercise.  We looked at the Department of Justice and Equality.  In the past, there was a reference to the Charities Regulator.  We are quite confident that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is responsible for holding a scoping inquiry given that it was child sexual abuse in St. John Ambulance over the last 30 to 40 years, which is the length of the career of an individual who has worked in the organisation.  It is safe to assume there are more cases than the number currently known about.  Usually with these matters, we are only ever scratching the surface in terms of knowing how many have been abused.  We owe it to all the young people who signed up in good faith and wanted to volunteer with St. John Ambulance to uncover what was done to them.  I refer not only to our being able to support victims of sexual abuse within St. John Ambulance but also to ensuring that we reach a point where we can hold people to account for the abuse the young teenagers endured.</p><p>Since allegations of the kind in question have come to light, St. John Ambulance has implemented child protection measures.  I have been told there was some resistance in the beginning to measures such as Garda vetting.  All these issues have been sorted but, regardless of child protection measures within an organisation, the law still applies to any organisation in which there is child sexual abuse.  The law should protect individuals, including young people, who have been victims of child sexual abuse.</p><p>I hope the Minister can determine the capacity of his Department to carry out a scoping inquiry so we can create the necessary space, facilitate a conversation and encourage others who are affected by abuse carried out within St. John Ambulance while they volunteered there as teenagers.  I hope we can work together to establish an inquiry.</p></speech>

I am aware of the specific issue she alluded to, and I have been in correspondence with an individual in that regard.  As the Senator knows, our country has in the past failed to protect its children, and that failure weighs heavily on all of us.  Abuse is not consigned to the past, though, and it is my role, in collaboration with Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to protect children where there is a clear existing threat.  Tusla's role in considering historical abuse allegations is to try to establish if the person against whom an allegation has been made could currently pose a risk to children.  The role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is to investigate a crime and, where appropriate, instigate a prosecution.</p><p>Let me refer to Tusla's role in protection first.  The Children First Act 2015 commenced in December 2017 and it defines relevant organisations and mandated persons and what is required of them.  Relevant organisations must have a child safeguarding statement.  The following is the definition of some of the categories of relevant organisations covered under the 2015 Act:</p> <blockquote> 	1. Any work or activity which is carried out by a person, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the person having access to, or contact with, children in&mdash;<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />4. Any work or activity which consists of treatment (including assessment which may lead to treatment), therapy or counselling provided to a child.<br /><br />5. Any work or activity which consists of the provision of&mdash;  	(a) educational, research, training, cultural, recreational, leisure, social or physical activities to children,  </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Both of these definitions apply to St. John Ambulance.  I commend the bravery and fortitude of the individuals who have come forward and shared their experiences that led to correspondence with my Department.  I can only imagine how recounting their stories and reliving that difficult time in their lives must be incredibly traumatic for them.  It was that bravery that led to Tusla's child safeguarding statement compliance unit engaging with St. John Ambulance Ireland.  The unit has reviewed the child safeguarding statement of St. John Ambulance and is satisfied that it meets current criteria.  Safeguarding statements are an important tool to clarify the potential risks to children in any organisation, and to inform the volunteers, staff and service users of the actions taken to mitigate those risks.</p><p>In order to inform my response to the Senator's specific request, I am liaising with the Departments of Justice and Equality and of Health to see if they have knowledge of any further pertinent information.  Following concerns that had previously been made known to my Department, Tusla conducted a review in the region in question of available records and indicated it did not find any concerns.  Today, my Department has requested Tusla to perform a similar review of St. John Ambulance in all regions of the country.  This review will cover cases that may relate to the matter and any retrospective cases that have come to the attention of Tusla.  On foot of findings from this review and the engagement with the Departments of Health and of Justice and Equality, all due consideration will be given to the Senator's request.</p><p>Where abuse happened in the past, Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can only rely on and make assessments on the information available.  I strongly urge anyone who at any time has information related to the endangerment or abuse of children, now or in the past, to immediately bring it to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Tusla.  It can be extremely difficult to take such action but I say to anyone who has been the victim of abuse that they are not alone.  I fully appreciate that while instances may be historic and may be in the past, the impact is felt every day by these individuals.</p><p>I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to my attention.  I have outlined steps the Department is taking.  We will continue to work on this.</p></speech>

It is comforting to know that conversations are happening in the background on how we can move forward and pursue this, even in terms of answering my request about an inquiry.  I would like to put on the record why I mentioned a scoping inquiry.  I looked at the Scally report, which I know related to CervicalCheck and which is a different issue, and it was a really good way to take a transparent and victim-led approach to reporting.  As the Minister said, the incident is historical but the effects are lifelong.  Over the past few months, in looking at how we can move forward in terms of an inquiry, I have had many conversations.  This was much wider than the people who have been most impacted, such as those who contacted the Minister.  It would seem abuse within St. John Ambulance was tolerated at the highest level of that organisation.  Therefore, even though a particular individual is not there any more, we need to look at the structures which supported and facilitated that individual for such a long period of time.  According to one account, which was given to me, it was an open secret.  It was like everybody knew, but nobody knew.  That was a very strong statement to hear from somebody.  That is why, even with the current risk being mitigated with the particular individual being gone, we need to look at why it was allowed persist for so many generations and at how many others have, I am sure, been impacted.</p></speech>

As to the degree of significance the Senator outlined, I had not heard that expression regarding prevalence before.  We are taking steps.  We are not just examining the region where the initial issue was flagged and the victim, whom we both have been in contact with, was from.  Rather, we are examining the organisation nationally.  That will help us to establish whether there are more causes for concern and further action.</p><p>I am happy to continue engaging with the Senator.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has done a great deal of work on this matter.</p></speech>

Something I believe would be interesting and topical for us to discuss is the whole area of employment and the different changes that have occurred due to this pandemic.  The first factor is the level of youth unemployment.  This is a significant problem for the country.  The level of youth unemployment among the under-25s currently stands at almost 37%.  Many of those have been employed in the lower income sectors, in hospitality and in retail and would have been in part-time and more precarious employment.  Many of those jobs will not return in the short term.  We have a serious issue around youth unemployment and the long-term impact on young people in this country.  It would be a good debate to have in this House and to hear from the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to discuss the impact of that on this sector.  </p> <p>I welcome also the news this morning from IBEC which has published a report to identify the dual threat of Covid-19 and Brexit and the fact that it poses significant challenges to businesses for the year 2021.  There were, however, some positive aspects to this report, in that 28% of their businesses intend to hire more staff next year and 49% of their businesses intend to increase wages.  There is some positivity and light at the end of the tunnel here.  The impact of this on business is also an issue that the Minister with responsibility for trade might wish to come before the House to discuss.</p> <p>I also wish to highlight and discuss the point that today is day one of the new restrictions under level 5.  This House will discuss and debate today and tomorrow additional legislation in respect of penalties, rent and protections for those living in rental accommodation.  It is a difficult time for the country and I am concerned about the impact on the mental health of citizens for these six weeks.  One thing I will say is that we have learned from the last lockdown and we have made some changes.  The social bubble proposed is a very positive measure for this period, in that we recognise that some people who live alone will need to meet up with other households.  We are asking people to limit that to one other household and to have that social bubble.  The fact that the schools are remaining open is also a very positive impact.  Six weeks of these restrictions is difficult but I hope that at the end of the period, we can reopen.  The question being asked is whether we can be sure that six weeks will be enough.  When I listened to Dr. Tony Holohan, he stated his belief that if we do the right thing and follow the guidelines of these six weeks, the time they have set aside is sufficient to flatten the curve and reopen the country in time for Christmas.  That is what we must be looking forward to.  </p> <p>The legislation this House will debate today and tomorrow is emergency legislation to protect our citizens and to ensure that we can get through the next six weeks.  I look forward to debating those items with colleagues over the next couple of days and I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

Although it is somewhat late because there has been a slight change in it, I again appeal to the Leader to make arrangements to provide sufficient time for Members, some of whom are travelling long distances to be present.  We need time.  The Senator is the Leader of the House and she assured me last week that she would do her best.  I believe it is not unreasonable to have available to Members the proposed Order of Business she wishes to bring to the House a minimum of one hour before proceedings begin.  It is our job under the Order of Business to consider what business the Leader is proposing.  It is the Members who decide it by a vote and we accept the democratic decision.  That is what the Order of Business is.  I appeal again to the Leader to take that on board and ask her to address that point in her replies here today.  I do not support No. 1, which is the motion that we received last night.  I thank the secretariat which must be under enormous stress and pressure.  I was working at my desk and it came in just before 9 p.m.  That shows the level of commitment and work of our staff-----</p></speech>

I thank them for that.  Unfortunately it gives us very little time to consider it or to discuss it with our colleagues.  We are a small group of five Senators and other groups have bigger numbers.  I ask the Leader to take on board the difficulties and practicalities around that and to use her position as Leader of the House to do something about it going forward.  She might also address that point in her response to the House today on the Order of Business.  I therefore do not support this item.  I do not believe there is any good enough reason to not have an Order of Business tomorrow.

Today we have woken up to lockdown No. 2.  Up to 150,000 people now have no jobs to go to.  Others are returning to working from home in less than ideal conditions.  While of course the lockdown is necessary and the ratio of spread of the virus is deeply concerning, our contact tracing system collapsed over the weekend under the volume of cases.  This is simply not good enough.</p> <p>The WHO has repeatedly said that lockdowns are a mechanism to stop the spread of the virus while countries get their houses in order.  A lockdown buys time to put in place a robust testing and tracing mechanism.  This Government squandered the first lockdown.  There was an enormous sense of goodwill from the public.  They put their faith in the Government to put in place the necessary hospital capacity and ramp up testing and tracing.  Now they find that did not happen.</p> <p>The Be On Call for Ireland campaign saw tens of thousands of people sign up to help in the Covid battle.  From those who came forward, a pool of 1,480 people were eligible, 755 of whom went through the entire process and yet were not hired.  Some 300 job-ready applicants have already dropped out.  In addition to the Be On Call for Ireland drive, many more part-time and semi-retired GPs came forward to offer their services for contact tracing.  Instead of seizing their expertise, they were subjected to reams of form filling, including, in at least one case, a GP being asked for his leaving certificate results.  In the ultimate insult, those who were hired were offered zero-hour contracts with no sick pay during a pandemic.</p> <p>It is simply not good enough.  The vast majority of people in this country, young and old, will play their part in bringing the Covid numbers down.  They will stay home, wear their masks and socially distance, but they will not tolerate their efforts being wasted a second time because the Government failed to get its house in order.  Medical workers who are exhausted will not tolerate it.  Teachers, childcare workers, bus drivers, cleaners and retail staff who are continuously being put at risk on the front line will not tolerate it.  Existing contact tracers who are worked to the bone will not tolerate it.</p> <p>The Government has an enormous opportunity to restore public faith in the system.  It should hire contract tracers directly, not through a recruitment company that is charging a 20% premium, and pay them a decent wage.  Trying to do contact tracing on the cheap will cost us in the long run.  It will not just cost us economically.  It will cost us in terms of our mental health, well-being and the public buy-in which will collapse if the Government does not get this right.  I know the public will do their bit, but we need the Government to play its part.</p></speech>

I hope Members will agree that we need to do something about it.<br/><br/>Today, I wish to again highlight the urgent need to recognise the heroes of Jadotville.  I know this has been mentioned by several speakers in the Chamber but I believe we have come to a point where we need to do more.<br/><br/>Since I had the honour of being elected to the House I have listened to colleagues support the call for these gallant soldiers to finally get the recognition they deserve.  Many continue to fight for this on their behalf.  Recently, along with Labour Party colleagues, I received a reply from the Minister for Defence stating that in recent years his Department has had several representations outlining the courage and bravery of A Company.  The Minister finished his reply by stating that he would consider any additional documentation, information or evidence to support any request for additional medals but that no new information had come to light.<br/><br/>I have spent the past couple of weeks speaking to families who have loved ones who were involved in this engagement.  They continue to search for justice for their loved ones and continue to uncover new documentation on this important matter.  I know they are in constant contact with the Department.  They will never give up and neither should we.<br/><br/>I am informed that 11 or more county councils have supported this request in recent weeks.  I was also informed recently that there may be nine surviving members from this engagement.  I encourage everyone here to come together as a House to support this call once and for all.  I call on the Cathaoirleach to show us how to do that, whether by letter or whatever else to the Minister for Defence.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish to take the remainder of my time to talk about the retail sector and the many jobs and services provided by the sector in our towns and counties.  During this pandemic, many of us have been forced to change the way we shop.  This has had an impact and will continue to have a serious impact in the coming six weeks on the many retailers throughout the State.  Local enterprise offices have helped many retailers get online for the first time with grants to retailers as well the search and start initiative, a new online route for their customers.  A recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i>promoting 100 Irish-based online retailers stated that up to 70% of Irish consumer online spending leaves this country as people shop with multinationals.  This must stop.  We have to start shopping locally.  We must start buying Irish as much as we can.  Specifically, in the coming six weeks, we must do so to save as many jobs as we can.  I encourage Members to get involved in that campaign.</p></speech>

However, it is important that we put in place supports for students immediately.  Some students have on-campus commitments and rental commitments.  We need a proper process for all third level institutions to ensure that refunds are given immediately.  Also, we need a process around the private rental market for students.  Additionally, now that students can no longer avail of the payments under the PUP scheme, we need to examine what has happened to those students who fall outside of the SUSI grant system and, therefore, cannot get the work they were doing at the weekends to be able to supplement their living.  I ask, as a matter of urgency given the lockdown, that the Minister would look at how such people can be supported.  We cannot see this generation sink into poverty any more than they already have.  We need to ensure that people do not drop out.  We need to ensure they get the education they want and require, because it is of benefit to society.</p></speech>

We spend &euro;5 billion doing online shopping.  More than two thirds of this goes outside the country.  If we are buying more online, we need to look at the Irish companies.  As the Senator said earlier, there is a good article by Conor Pope in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I strongly recommend that people look at it.  We also have <i>buyirishfood.ie</i>and there is importance of buying local.  Luckily, the farmers' markets have not been shut down this time.  We have to look at quality over quantity.  Every year in this country, 1 million tonnes of food are wasted by being thrown away.  Customers get a better personal service if they support local businesses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are the character, the make-up and the heart of all our towns and villages and we need to prioritise spending on money locally.  Even if people go to the big chains or supermarkets to do their shopping, they also have sections of Irish products.  People should take the time and look at the label.   If it states, "Packaged in Ireland", it was not made in Ireland but if it states, "Produced in Ireland", it was produced in this country.   Let us put our money where our mouth is and go all out to buy Irish.  If we could all spend &euro;5 or &euro;10 more per week on Irish goods we could save thousands of jobs.   Now is the time.   Let us prioritise buying Irish.</p></speech>

Yesterday at the Joint Committee on Health, we heard from representatives from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the Irish Medical Organisation and it was shocking to hear what they had to say.  We heard about the disgraceful treatment of student nurses during this pandemic.  Student nurses are exhausted.  They are expected to work over and above their undergraduate status, they are exposed to the dangers of Covid and they get either no payment at all or an allowance of &euro;50.79 per week.  Failure to pay them amounts to exploitation.</p> <p>A common thread running through all the submissions is understaffing and the negative impact this is having on patient care.  Everyone is in agreement that the nurses are prepared to jeopardise their own health to save lives.  The increase in spending on health of &euro;4 billion is to be welcomed but it could be wasted if staffing levels are not addressed.  Understaffing of hospitals can lead to poor outcomes for patients and increase the number of deaths.  We have relied on recruiting nurses from abroad but with the travel restrictions this may prove impossible.  It is important to retain Irish nurses in Ireland and increase the number of college places so we can satisfy the demand for nurses.  The allowance that was paid in March must now be reintroduced.</p> <p>The mental and physical toll of this pandemic on nursing staff is enormous.  Some 50 nurses per week are getting infected by the virus.  Research has shown that front-line hospital staff and other key workers have a higher chance of experiencing mental health difficulties during the pandemic.  The Covid-19 pandemic has created stressful working environments for many people.  Having regular contact with people who experience severe symptoms of Covid-19 or die from it becomes traumatic over time.  It is important that the necessary mental health services are made available to all front-line workers experiencing trauma from dealing with the impact of this pandemic.</p> <p>I thank all the healthcare workers and front-line workers who are risking their health to save lives.  We are deeply indebted to them all.  However, although saying thank you is important, they are not enough.  If this gratitude is to be given meaning, it should lead to an overdue reassessment of who we value most in society and how we treat them.  It should not have taken a pandemic to expose how poorly paid, insecure and badly treated so many health workers, without whom society cannot function, truly are.  I would like to ask the Minister to come in and give us an update.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Wall on the Jadotville men.  We need to do something about it at this point as it is just not on.</p></speech>

Cathal died on 10 October.  He suffered from metachromatic leukodystrophy.  He was extremely fortunate in his loving and caring family: his father Les, mother Linda, brother Ciaran and sister Holly.  Some weeks ago, I introduced the National Screening Advisory Committee Bill 2020 in the House, which would allow for the screening of up to 40 disorders and save the lives of 50 children each year in Ireland.  We should, in Cathal's memory, commit ourselves today to ensuring this situation is urgently addressed.</p> <p>I refer to the wonderfully welcome message from Pope Francis, who said gay people were part of the human family.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Of course they are and it is perfectly obvious.

An area I feel needs to be looked at, and I raised it in the previous D&aacute;il with the then Minister with responsibility for local government, unfortunately to little avail, is the area of online voting - not electronic voting - and the necessity for a proper debate in the Houses to recognise that if we were bounced into an election in the next year, we would really have an issue with voting by way of pencil and paper at polling stations.

If we can collect the taxes of the people of this country online through a secure portal, then voting online safely should also be possible.</p> <p>Last year, I met the Gov2U group, which promotes democracy throughout Europe.  Up to 14 countries have some form of online voting.  Estonia, a small Baltic nation, was the first to introduce permanent national Internet voting.  It has gone from 1.9% of votes cast through online voting to almost 30% in the parliamentary elections there last year.  Interestingly, it also keeps the pencil and paper as a voting system for the electorate.  If we are looking at electoral reform, it is incumbent on us before any Bill is drafted to have a robust and proper debate that would also consider online voting and its potential, not only in terms of ease of access but also in helping younger people to participate in democracy and voting.</p></speech>

Specifically, I am given to understand that citizens under the age of 18 have no right whatsoever to change their names.  I can see why this would not be a problem normally, but the circumstances of this rigidity specifically affect a number of women who are estranged from their husbands and the fathers of their children, and who now have children who have a different name from them.  If the children have not taken any part of their mother's name and have their father's name, a mother who is estranged from that person and from whom the children might also be estranged must now in regular circumstances in engagement with the State, such as passport control or dealing with the Garda and social and family protection services, not only explain the nature of her relationship to her own children but also prove they are her children.</p> <p>I suggest that the rigidity means these women cannot change this but we should put in place a system that allows somebody in these particular circumstances to register a double-barrelled surname that includes the name of the mother in the official name of the child and does away with this bureaucratic difficulty that many women have.  Many women have raised it with me personally with regard to when they are dealing with the State or officialdom in the country.  I would like to see us do something to facilitate it and to be much more flexible in how we approach the various types of families we now have in the country.</p></speech>

It has never been done by any Senator here before.  I would like to call them in to account for their chaotic mismanagement of this crisis and to give reasons, backed up with solid evidence, why we are ignoring smarter strategies as we face into level 5 restrictions.</p> <p>This nation is in shock this morning.  We are in level 5 again.  We are yo-yoing in and out of lockdowns.  We, as politicians, have failed with our messaging.  Even Opposition parties have failed.  Perhaps our constant questioning of every single move that the Government has taken did not work.  It has not worked for the likes of Deputy Mary Lou McDonald and all of those who have questioned every single move that the Government has made in trying to protect our people.  It should be about how we can protect our people.  I believe that level 5 is a step too far.</p> <p>The Irish strategy is short-sighted.  It is led by politicians who are pandering to lobbyist groups so that football and alcohol trump the health and wealth of this nation.  We failed in our messaging in respect of level 3 restrictions.  Perhaps it needed to be tweaked.  We did not get buy-in from the public because we had protestors, anti-maskers on our streets, and because of golfgate.  There are many reasons why we did not bring the public with us.  We have to look at ourselves when we ask why we are at level 5 this morning.  It is down to us.  We should not be in this position.</p></speech>

It remains no more than a promise.  The Government last year signed a contract with National Broadband Ireland to the value of approximately &euro;3 billion.  Since then, we have heard precious little from National Broadband Ireland on when it intends to begin the installation of broadband.  At the time, the estimate was five to seven years but we have no indication as to when it will begin and end.</p> <p>We are now in level 5 and have asked the Irish people to take extreme measures and stay at home.  We still expect them to provide appropriate services while working from home.  We expect our college students to participate in lectures and advance towards examinations.  We expect people to do their banking without going to the bank.  We effectively expect people to live their lives from home, to the greatest extent possible.  Yet, 540,000-odd people have no access to high-speed broadband.  I appeal to the Cathaoirleach and to the Leader to try to organise a debate here as quickly as possible with the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to see if anything can be done to roll out a wireless service to some of those areas as a kind of stopgap measure.</p> <p>Like many others in this and the other House, I take calls from people about this matter on a daily basis.  Those people could manage until now but, with the level of restrictions that we are now placing on them, they can do so no longer.  Unless we are prepared to address that in some way, we will make it much more difficult for people to remain in their homes.</p></speech>

I am echoing the sentiments of Senator Pauline O'Reilly in speaking up for our third level students.  They are in the most invidious of positions because two of their academic years have now been affected.  There are great supports for them and there is no doubt that the Minister has brought in great things.  The injection of &euro;50 million in the budget was great and equated, in the instances of some students to whom I have spoken, to them receiving &euro;250 back.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The problem, however, is that many of them have paid up front for accommodation and are not getting that accommodation refunded, yet they are not allowed on campus.  That mechanism, therefore, is not working.  They cannot work in part-time jobs and their whole lives have been disrupted at a time when they are not on campus to receive their lectures, so they are not getting the benefit even of the discussions among themselves that might happen when they are coming out of lecture theatres or sitting around the coffee dock.  They are not getting the additional growth and development that normally comes from campus life.</p><p>At the beginning of this academic year, they were promised they would attend one lecture session on campus per week, but unfortunately that has not transpired, although that is for good reason, given that we are in level 5.  This is a group whom the media and people in general are quick to criticise if there is a social gathering, even though the vast majority are trying to get their qualifications.  If they are final year students, they may be worried about what the next year will hold for them, what they will do after college, whether there will be jobs, what the prospects will be and what their future will look like.  At a time when the world should be their oyster, it is not.  We need to address that and have the Minister hear statements from us on that.</p></speech>

Last year, I visited Colombia as part of a Justice for Colombia peace monitor delegation.  I travelled extensively through the country and witnessed at first hand horrific stories of human rights abuses.  I visited a small town called Cajibio in the Cauca region and met a young man, Jayder Quintana, who was just 17 years old when I met him.  At the beginning of this month, he was gunned down and murdered.  A few minutes before he was murdered, a policeman came to check his identity card to see who he was, and then the right-wing paramilitaries arrived and gunned him down.</p> <p>Jayder was a member of the FENSUAGRO trade union, which has a relationship with the Unite union here and in Britain.  The most dangerous country in the world in which to be a member of a trade union is Colombia.  Trade union members have been gunned down in their hundreds.  Some 1,000 people have been murdered since the peace process was initiated four years ago.  The key problem is that the Colombian Government is not implementing what was agreed to at that time, in respect of rural reform, justice and the country's national commission for security guarantees.</p> <p>The Colombian Embassy is very active in Dublin.  I call for a foreign affairs debate in order that we can discuss the matter in greater detail.  I have written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to request a meeting.  I want to understand what measures the Government will take to put pressure on its Colombian counterpart.  To be fair, while the people at the embassy are very decent and fair people, we are talking about a far-right government that seems to be watching on as people are slaughtered month after month.  We have to do what we can to ensure, for people such as Jayder, murdered like so many in Colombia just for trying to build a better life for his family and community, that something fundamental will be done by the Government.  We need to hear justice for the people of Colombia.</p></speech>

It is really important.  We have to examine human rights throughout the world and see what we can do.</p> <p>The issue I raise relates to my friend, Pat Tinsley, whom I have spoken about in the House previously.  Pat and 29 others have been diagnosed with amyloidosis.  No treatment is available in this country, although it is available in Northern Ireland, the UK, Europe and the US.  The treatment's name is patisiran.  I have engaged with the company that produces it.  It would give a new lease of life to the 30 sufferers in this country.</p> <p>I raise this issue again in the context that &euro;50 million was allocated in the budget for the provision of high-quality healthcare through the availability of innovative medicines.  That is really welcome and it marks a major shift in public policy towards the funding of new medicines.  When I spoke previously about the issue, I requested a debate on it with the Minister for Health.  That the money has been allocated in the budget is a really significant development.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health to have this process expedited in order that we support these 30 people?

The dispute centres on a funding shortfall of &euro;1.2 million for veterinary inspections of smaller slaughterhouses carried out by the local authority vets, who also work with the local enterprise offices to develop new businesses as well as overseeing the regulatory standards.  The current contract runs out on 30 November, with the CCMA indicating that it will not continue to provide these services because of a shortfall in funding.  This issue is quite close to me in my local village, which is home to the Rawles abattoir, which services nearly all the butchers throughout the entire county.  We have Uncle Bok, which provides Biltong for the entire southern African market in Ireland, and Herterich's artisan butchers, which are renowned for their quality throughout the country.  These are small local enterprises in our community.  They are not the Goodmans or the large supermarket chains.  This issue needs to be resolved immediately to give certainty to these businesses prior to Christmas and to keep the veterinary service within our local authorities in order that they can work with the local enterprise offices to continue to provide more jobs.</p> <p>Finally, I support Senator Wall in his comments.  Collectively, we need to come together to recognise the men of Jadotville.</p></speech>

I have only been here six months but it seems like a record, even for this House, so I reiterate that we will oppose the Order of Business on that basis.</p> <p>I am thinking of all the many Nigerians living here in Ireland today.  They are in all our communities.  #EndSARS is a movement against police brutality in Nigeria and for an end to the special anti-robbery squad, SARS.  SARS is a controversial unit of the Nigerian police force.  The dissolution of SARS was announced over the weekend, to be replacement by SWAT - same thing, different acronym.  There is an outcry over this entirely unwelcome replacement of the very body the people of Nigeria are protesting against.  The international community is watching with dismay the fury and outcry on the part of the people of Nigeria and the extremely heavy-handed approach the Government of Nigeria is taking against these protestors.  My heart goes out to the victims of the shootings in Lekki, where people were peacefully protesting around the toll gate and were fired upon.</p> <p>What is happening in Nigeria is reprehensible, and the international community must not be silent.  There is enormous energy going into disrupting the protestors rather than engaging with them and meeting the demands of these people.  The demands include the immediate release of all arrested protestors, justice for the deceased victims of police brutality, appropriate compensation, and an independent body to oversee the investigation and prosecution of all reports of police violence.</p> <p>This is about more than just SARS.  It is about ending police brutality and about better implementation of laws, better leadership and more accountability.  I request that the Minister for Foreign Affairs condemn how the people of Nigeria are being treated.  Peaceful protestors are being gunned down, and this is reprehensible.  I hope this House will join me in condemning this senseless violence and that it will support the promotion of peace in Nigeria.</p></speech>

The reason I say this today is that Packie was once a director of football in the FAI.  He and one of his colleagues and many more staff were turfed out of that organisation at a time when a member of his departmental team was raising financial irregularities within the FAI and taking those concerns to the board of Sport Ireland.  Nothing was ever done about them.  The only result was that Packie, all his team around him and his department were turfed out on the back of a money-saving exercise shortly after 2011, after the irregularities were raised.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall Blaney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1812"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1812&amp;amp;pid=NiallBlaneyIND&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I find it extraordinary that last week the CEO and chair of Sport Ireland were reappointed for another term.  Is the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform aware of, and did he approve, the reappointment of the CEO for another term?  Is he also aware that the reappointment of the chair goes against the regulations of Sport Ireland which state that nobody can be appointed for more than two terms?  I find it disgusting that these two individuals have been reappointed, considering how they handled the financial affairs of the organisation, the saga which surrounded John Delaney's term in office and the financial irregularities that are now coming to light.  I ask both Ministers concerned to open an investigation into these irregularities, dating back to 2010.</p></speech>

They are the heroes of the hour and continue to keep us all safe.  They have been joined in recent weeks by new heroes, and it is not an exhaustive list.  We should remember teachers and childcare workers on this poignant day when level 5 restrictions are introduced.  They have kept the lights on in this country.  They have stepped up, putting themselves in harm's way, so that this country continues to function.  We spoke today, and have done so the past, about honouring the A Company heroes of Jadotville, and we should do so.  However, we should also honour and recognise the work of teachers.  As someone who is proud to have spent a few years as a teacher, I am conscious of the diverse logistical and other challenges faced by principals, teachers, caretakers and special needs assistants in every school community to make their schools work.  They are all working for Ireland like never before.  I know the Leader of the House will agree to honour them and recognise their role.  In the longer term, the honour they deserve involves receiving equal pay for equal work, reducing the teacher-pupil ratio to the standard European norm, giving childcare workers a salary that is commensurate with their incredible and crucial work, and showing them the dignity and respect they deserve and have earned.  I urge this House to remember them today of all days.  We must do something constructive and real, and not just pay lip service.  When we get out of the Covid pandemic, and we will, let us express in tangible and real ways the great work they have done.  They are the soldiers of today - the living soldiers.</p></speech>

I have no interest in changing my daughters' names, but I have come up against the obstacles and complications that the Senator has highlighted.  I have had many conversations on this issue.  One stands out more than the others because it took place at passport control.  I have one daughter who is a Wallace, one who is a Jones, and I am a Ruane.  That has led to some very awkward conversations.  Obviously, none of us look alike, which makes it even worse.</p> <p>The issue I want to raise today spans across a few Departments, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and involves everyone who is in control of funding expenditure for youth, addiction, community, and mental health services.  Over recent months, I have had many conversations about the concerns of many of those services about underspends this year as a result of service provision being somewhat restricted due to the Covid pandemic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Service providers are afraid that when they seek next year's funding at the end of the year, the underspends will make them look as though they do not need so much funding.  As the underspends were caused by a very exceptional year, I hope the Departments in charge of many of the community services will issue an instruction or guideline to them that allows a six-month grace period that lasts into 2021, thus allowing enough time for them to spend their money and they do not have to rush to spend it before the year is out.</p><p>It would be very helpful if the Departments were able to widen the scope for the expenditure because some it will not be spent on service provision and many projects may need to invest in particular capital that is necessary to continue to provide services due to Covid-19.  Widening the scope would not cost the State any money because the money has already been assigned to the projects but would allow projects more room to manoeuvre and prepare for 2021 in terms of how different the work looks for many of these sectors. </p></speech>

I note that when Paul Reid was interviewed on radio today, he expressed his regret and apologised for what happened, which is commendable.  I suggest that we invite the Minister for Health here to specifically debate Covid halfway through the six weeks of restrictions at level 5.  It would be an opportunity for him to engage with us on Covid, review how we are doing and talk about a roadmap that lasts right into 2021 because there is no doubt we will have to live alongside Covid-19 for some time to come.  Even if a vaccine is rolled out, it will take a significant amount of time for it to percolate down.

Members in both Houses have previously raised this matter.  We should not allow it to be repeatedly discussed and raised here, as there is cross-party consensus.  As Senator Wall mentioned local authorities, I note that two former members of the Army, Councillor Joe Malone in Kilkenny and Councillor Gary Laffan in Wexford, tabled motions on the issue with their local authorities as has happened across the country.  The Defence Forces have a lot of bigger issues but the recognition of the Jadotville men is a small issue.  Only eight brave men who served in Jadotville remain and I ask the Leader to seek an assurance from the Minister for Defence that he will come here to debate this issue.</p> <p>I welcome the statement that the Taoiseach made this morning concerning the development of a shared island unit and its priorities.

Somebody who currently awaits their driving test has had to wait over 30 weeks.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is prohibitive for young people, and some not-so-young people, not only in terms of enabling them to drive unaccompanied but for many who need to be able to drive to work.

"Please, no" is all I could say to that.  Let us spare ourselves the future misery and confusion and let us see what happens in the US election in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 allows income from the sale of artistic works to be exempted from income tax in certain circumstances.  The works involved must be original and they must have "cultural and artistic merit".  Applications are made annually in respect of specific works - books, plays, a collection of artworks, etc. - and individuals can earn up to &euro;50,000 tax free in the year the determination is made.  The question of what works qualify as having that cultural or artistic merit is assessed by the Revenue Commissioners with advice from the Arts Council based on set guidelines.  It seems that the granting of exemptions for non-fiction books has been a bone of contention for more than a decade.  In 2013, the Arts Council complained to the Revenue that its role was being undermined by the tendency to grant exemptions to ghost written sports biographies and political memoirs.  For non-fiction books to be considered, they should have a cultural theme, such as a biography or an autobiography of a writer or painter.  Where appeals are made against applications, more than half have been successful.  The Arts Council provides expert opinion but, here again, the council has said that all manner of appeals are being upheld.  The council differs from the Revenue in some determinations.  It seems political memoirs should not quality but there is certainly no justification to allow serving politicians or retired officeholders with generous pensions to avail of a tax break in this situation.  They should pay tax on royalties as they would on other income earned in retirement.  This is something that can be addressed in the coming finance Bill.  It is something we ought to address.  We are spending a great deal these days.  We are borrowing a great deal.  We should certainly take any opportunity we have for prudent retrenchment.</p></speech>

The Bridge Street-Linenhall Street area has been a neglected part of Dundalk for the past 40-odd years for various different reasons.  It is a part of the town of Dundalk that has the most sincere and genuine sense of community.  Other parts of my town have benefited from urban regeneration funding over the past couple of years but the north end, Bridge Street and Linenhall Street, have been consistently left behind.  We have people like Mr. Martin McElligott, who is the manager of the business improvement district scheme, BIDS, in Dundalk.  We have people on Louth County Council who are pushing hard to improve this area.  However, they cannot do that unless they get substantial funding.  I am talking of funding in the millions of euro which would be required for urban regeneration to totally transform the streetscape to make it more attractive for new businesses to move in and to make it more attractive for people to go and shop in that area.  The area has a wonderful sense of community and it is crying out for substantial funding.  I would appreciate it if we could invite the Minister to this House at some stage in the near future to talk about urban regeneration funding and the benefits that it can have for towns right across Ireland, in particular, for the area of Dundalk I raise here today.  It would be important to do that and push for urban regeneration funding in the provincial towns and large towns, such as the town of Dundalk.</p></speech>

It is with great sadness I rise to tell the House of a story that is breaking online in the Roscommon Herald in recent hours.  A nursing home in the Roscommon-Galway border - I will not mention it or the people involved but the names are here - has been left in a state of absolute emergency after the majority of staff and 26 of the 28 residents tested positive for the coronavirus.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The director has been in tears.  She tested positive herself.  She has no symptoms but obviously cannot go to the nursing home.  The result is that the nursing home has been left with one nurse, one care assistant, one chef and one food server.  The HSE's intervention was sought.  It promised to help and did send one nurse but, because so many staff have been affected, that nurse and one care assistant were left in charge of the patients.  One resident has died and two are being hospitalised today.  It has been described by a local GP, Dr. Daly, as a state of emergency.  It is really sad and we have seen this before.  I will not prolong my contribution as I will be working behind the scenes later but I ask the Minister, whom I know will be very compassionate, to bring this to the attention of the Government and get the HSE to do everything possible in the coming hours to sort this out.  If it is not sorted, most of the residents will end up in hospital.</p></speech>

It is a private nursing home.  The circumstances indicate exactly why we have moved to level 5, which is to protect and save lives.  All of these measures that we have to endure, such as wearing a mask and taking a step back, are about saving lives.  The nursing home is in dire straits.  We are talking about the tracing and testing capability of the HSE but we also need to ensure we are supporting private nursing homes so they will have adequate staff, especially when staff are testing positive.  As Senator Murphy pointed out, it is an emergency ask.  I that this be raised with the Minister for Health so a request can be made of the HSE that it allocate resources urgently.  I assume it is through primary health care so we are talking about Community Healthcare West.  The resources need to be assigned today.  We need the nursing home and the people in such dire straits to be supported.  God forbid that we would have a loved one going through something like that.</p> <p>The other point I want to make is on staying safe at this time because the evenings are getting darker. There was a fatal accident involving a pedestrian this morning outside Strokestown.  All of us are going to be driving, speeding or rushing to where we need to go, but people will be walking with no footpaths in rural areas on dark evenings.  Please be careful; please be safe.  I will work with Senator Murphy on getting support as soon as possible.</p></speech>

We noted quite recently that many members of the public are of the view that off-licences should be closed.  I do not agree but I cannot understand why the Government has not at this stage implemented minimum unit pricing, which is included in the legislation.  There was a big debate on this at the time regarding the prices in the North and South.  At this time, people cannot travel from either jurisdiction given the travel restrictions.  I therefore call on the Leader to liaise with the Minister for Health in order to introduce minimum unit pricing.  The Government should liaise with the authorities in Northern Ireland and reach a joint agreement in this regard.  This is the opportune time to do that.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  Today is the first day of the lockdown. Everybody working in front-line services obviously has our support but I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to address, with Dublin Bus, the provision of public bus services in the city.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ordinarily a Dublin Bus double-decker will carry more than 100 passengers but because of the restrictions only 17 passengers will be allowed on them.  We encourage parents and children use the public bus service to go to school.  During the lockdown earlier this year, we had good weather and children were home from school, but we are now entering the period of worse weather, darker mornings, afternoons and evenings with less capacity on the buses.  I am not asking Dublin Bus to do anything that would be in any way dangerous for either the drivers or the passengers but we need to ensure the full capacity of the bus service is made available to commuters in the city.  The Leader will know that people commute from County Meath and far beyond the city.  However, by the time the buses get to the Navan Road, Cabra or Drumcondra the city commuters cannot actually board.  It was not too bad this morning because although it was cold, it was dry but it will be lashing rain soon enough.  We need to ensure everything is being done to maximise capacity on the Dublin Bus service.</p></speech>

Should it read "to be taken at 1.30 p.m. or 15 minutes after the conclusion of No. 1 or whichever is later"?</p></speech>

The next number of weeks are probably going to be difficult not just for the operations of this House and the D&aacute;il but for every Irish citizen.  We woke up this morning with level 5 imposed on us.  Senators Murphy and Dolan brought the impact and reality of this virus home to us with clarity, when they described the information released this morning on the nursing home in County Roscommon, on the County Galway border.  It shows us how dangerous and precarious things are.  Precarious does not even come close to describing how the families of the residents and staff must be feeling this morning.  When we finish voting here, the first call I will make will be to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and Mr. Paul Reid to ensure the services are put in.</p> <p>There were many requests for debates this morning.  Depending on how we sit over the next couple of weeks I will try to accommodate them, particularly those related to Covid, given the Covid committee is no longer sitting.  However, we need to be cognisant of the health and the welfare of all the people who keep these Houses running.  To that end, I want to put on record my genuine appreciation for the officials, ushers, catering staff and absolutely everybody who tirelessly come in here every day to keep these Houses running and to help us and support us in doing our jobs.  I will, however, arrange for debates to be facilitated as quickly as I can.</p> <p>Last week Senator Craughwell, who is not in the Chamber, asked for a debate on education and I committed to providing that.  I tried to arrange for the Minister for Education and Skills to come to us today but unfortunately she had a very busy schedule.  She will, hopefully, be back to us the week after next for a debate on substitute teachers.  A number of colleagues said this morning that it is very easy for us to be appreciative of our healthcare workers, which we are, but I am always fascinated by the divide and very contentious debate when we talk about our teachers.  I really find it fascinating.  I do not think I was particularly lucky with the teachers my four children have had, and continue to have.  The commitment teachers show not only to education and the quality of education but to the overall well-being of all our students is second to none.  When I see the debate becoming vicious towards teachers, suggesting they are being precious about their own healthcare and well-being and that of their children, I get somewhat angry.  Perhaps that is not justified but I do not want a society where we all start pitting ourselves against each other.  Whether we are all at different levels of being "in it together", we all must experience the same precautions and engage in the same activity and behaviour to protect ourselves, our families and each other.  I do not think turning on particular sections of society is in any way helpful.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we sit for a substantial time during the six weeks of lockdown, a debate with numerous Ministers about Covid and its related issues would be helpful &ndash; I do not mean this disrespectfully &ndash; in holding people to account in the absence of us going about our normal daily schedule, given that we will be told to work from home as much as possible.  I will facilitate that debate.</p><p>We will not be in a position to vote for the proposed amendment.  Senator Boyhan raised this request last week as well.  We are working in an extraordinary time.  There are not just Covid restrictions, but also other obstacles to running our business normally.  We are not in our own Chamber because of objections from certain quarters.  We have no guarantee that we will be in this Chamber on any day except, perhaps, a Friday.  Even that is not guaranteed, given that the D&aacute;il might choose to sit in this Chamber every single day.  Schedules change at very short notice.  This week's schedule was issued yesterday at lunchtime.  It was again issued today at 10.23 a.m.  Based on interactions with the Seanad Office, there was a slight change at 11.20 a.m.  The Cathaoirleach highlighted the exact wording a second ago.</p><p>I ask Senators for a little latitude and understanding.  These are not normal times.  Our officials and staff are working flat out to ensure that we can try to hold Ministers to account by having this House and the Lower House functioning as much as possible.  However, there are constraints, and they are not just the obvious ones owing to Covid.  I will continue trying to provide as much space for debates as I can, but I am cognisant of the fact that we need to mind not only our own health, but the health of those who support and work with us to keep these Chambers open on a daily basis.</p></speech>

I oppose this section because it proposes to extend section 6(4) of the Investment Limited Partnerships Act 1994 in a way that allows for the participation of limited partners in an advisory committee or gives limited partners the right to appoint someone to this position.  This creates the new possibility of giving a limited partner the power to take part in the business of an investment partnership in a way that could challenge the distinction between a limited partner and a general partner.  The rationale for the extension of this safe harbour should be clarified.  It creates the risk that the general partner will be de facto controlled by the limited partner without later engaging their responsibility.  I want this on the record so that I can propose some amendments to section 7 on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The Minister has described the legislation as a key part of the Ireland for Finance strategy.  He stated, &quot;Ireland's success in attracting top-tier global financial services is set against an increasingly dynamic and competitive backdrop.&quot;<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are essentially talking about passing a law to better facilitate the growth of private investment in this country and to allow these investment funds to come together to further seek and achieve greater profitability.  This is a key and explicit policy goal for the Government.  My amendments propose to set the kinds of conditions we will expect in return.  I echo some of the concerns expressed in recent weeks about the Government's legislative priorities.  I question why legislation like this is being scheduled and is moving through the Houses when we still await many important legislative commitments made in the programme for Government.  It speaks volumes that a law designed to advantage a small number of private investors, operating at an already high level of profitability, is being debated today over other important legislation related to climate change or even the surely more pressing creation of the corporate enforcement authority, all of which are listed on the Government's autumn legislative programme.  It also speaks to something more fundamental about the perspectives underlying the Government that, at a time when global solidarity is so needed and the demands on our Parliament so high due to the pandemic, Members are here debating a law to attract more private investment funds to the country, while at the same time nothing is being offered in many other areas in need of reform.  This needs to be said and I am disappointed that this is the legislation to which priority is being given.</p><p>My amendments relate to the same issue.  If, as a State and as a Parliament, we are going to go so far as to change the law simply so private investment funds can consolidate and further pursue profits, we all want to know what these funds will do in return for the favourable legislative environment we are gifting them.  At a time when Ireland is drawing much attention internationally for being a centre of international tax avoidance by multinational companies and private equity actors, it seems more than fair to ask what these firms offer in return to the real people living here in our communities, beyond direct employment in the firms themselves.  If investment partnerships benefit from the kind of measures contained in the Ireland for Finance strategy and this Bill, they need to be required to pay a social or environmental dividend back to the State in which they operate.</p><p>Amendment No. 2 would empower the Central Bank, when considering applications to allow the formation of a new investment limited partnership, to set conditions that would ensure that the new investment fund partnership actually made a positive contribution to civil, social, economic or cultural life within the State.  If we as the State are going the distance to facilitate the creation of these new legal vehicles, it seems entirely fair that we would ask such funds to also describe how they will use their investment policies to support the lives of citizens and communities living here.  It could be as straightforward as demonstrating they will support local community initiatives and sports clubs.  These funds need to show that they are here not just for the favourable investment climate or low tax rates but that they are willing to work to improve the lives of people in Ireland in exchange for the kind of beneficial legal personalities we give them here.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 is straightforward.  It would give the Central Bank a role in determining the degree to which the investment policies of a new proposed investment partnership would support initiatives that contribute to our efforts to fight climate change.  It is ironic that he is no longer a Member of the House, as it was former Senator Michael D'Arcy who actually inspired the tabling of this amendment.  He did so on Second Stage, when he commented that: "investors are [significantly] ahead of everyone else ... because, If we destroy the world through climate change, there will be no world economy".  Through this amendment, I am proposing that if it is the case that the thinking of investors is so well developed and conscious of their investment policies related to the combating of climate change, let us then make it an explicit legal requirement that they must demonstrate this before giving them this favourable legal investment vehicle.  It should be easy for the investors that former Senator D'Arcy was talking about to demonstrate this to an appropriate level to the Central Bank.  Consequently, I am proposing that we make it a condition for granting this new form of partnership.</p><p>These are two sensible and straightforward amendments relating to the kinds of conditions we will set before we grant these new investment partnerships to groups of private investment funds.  It seem fair that if the Government plans to give them a favourable legal environment in which to invest, then they should have to demonstrate how they will use these favourable conditions to the common good of the people and communities who live in Ireland and to assist in our collective challenge to combat the climate and biodiversity crisis.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope the Minister of State can accept the amendments.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is welcome.  I support these sensible amendments.  Our party is disgusted at the fact that Committee Stage is being curtailed, and effectively guillotined, today.  Was former Senator D'Arcy not right in what he said about investors being way ahead?</p> <p>When I asked the Minister of State about something last time, he promised he would have an answer today.  Was a lobbying document from the industry submitted to the Minister of State's Department and was there a refusal to release same?  I would appreciate an answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#EEE00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address these amendments.  Interestingly, this is our third debate on Committee Stage.  One Senator complained that we were not giving it enough time and said that we should not conclude it today whereas the previous speaker complained about us giving it too much time and asked whether it was a reflection of Government policy that we were spending so much time on this type of legislation rather than other legislation that people might consider more necessary at this time.  I have been given two conflicting views about the time afforded this, our third session on Committee Stage.</p> <p>I will give a general answer to the question on freedom of information, FOI, requests.  Where an FOI request is made in respect of any matter, including this, a decision is made to refuse, grant or part grant that information.  If someone is not satisfied with the response, he or she has the option of appealing the decision.  Regarding the situation Senator Gavan raised, my understanding is that a decision was made and that the requester has not made an appeal on same.  The requester had the option of pursuing the matter but did not take it.  That is the end of the request if the requester does not want to pursue the matter by way of appeal.  If my understanding is wrong, then I will correct it on Report Stage, but there currently is no live application under the Freedom of Information Act for consideration in respect of this Bill in the Department.  One application was made and dealt with and has not been pursued.  That is the end of the story.  I cannot add anything further beyond outlining the facts of the situation.</p> <p>While I understand where Senator Ruane is coming from with her amendments, I am not able to accept them because the Bill incorporates much of their spirit and content.  I will elaborate.  My reasoning has two parts - first, the role of the Central Bank and the EU and, second, the forthcoming EU legislation on sustainable investment.</p> <p>The Cental Bank is responsible for the authorisation and supervision of investment funds established in Ireland.  As such, it is not a matter for the Oireachtas to set out the rules and conditions of any investment fund.  That is why we have a Central Bank, which is the regulator.  It will approve or not approve the particular proposals put to it.  It is not a matter for the Oireachtas to adjudicate on the investment priorities of individual funds except to say that they must operate within the legislative guidelines, the Central Bank's regulatory rules, the EU's rules and any forthcoming EU legislation on sustainable investments.  The Central Bank's mandate is to protect the best interests of consumers and supervise regulated funds.  It cannot require an investment fund to invest in a certain manner or with a particular objective.</p> <p>However, I hope that the second part of my reasoning will provide some comfort that there is EU legislation covering investment funds.  It focuses on sustainable investment and investment funds with an environmental, social or governance objective.  The European social entrepreneurship funds regulation, EuSEF, already provides a regulatory framework for funds with a social investment objective.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That already exists at EU level and we are bound by it.  An investment limited partnership may be established under the regulations that would be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Another EU regulation on sustainability disclosures in the financial services sector was recently agreed and it will apply from March of the coming year in regard to any funds established under this legislation.</p><p>Overall, the EU legislation provides for a comprehensive package of measures aimed at directing private sector finance towards mitigation of climate change and other environmental threats, which is very important.  It will have an impact on investment funds, regardless of whether they label their financial products as green.  Under EU regulations, there is already provision in regard to ensuring funds can come under the sustainable development heading and the green environment heading.  I do not have to repeat that it is also an opportunity to increase employment here in Ireland by providing this service.  All in all, I think the spirit of what the Deputy is talking about is already enshrined in the original legislation and, on that basis, I am not in a position to accept the two amendments.</p></speech>

It again goes to one of the fundamental problems and concerns I have with the Bill, which is that it can effectively represent a reduction in liability for limited partners.  At the same time, section 7, on which we divided the House, gives very meaningful powers, including powers in regard to boards, to limited partners while they are protected.  Again, they are getting the power but not the responsibility.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Specifically, this amendment proposes that a majority of partners be calculated as a simple majority whereas the Bill proposes that a majority of limited partners will be "calculated by reference to the value of contributions of the limited partners at the time the determination of that majority falls to be made".  Effectively there could be one individual who is a limited partner, is protected from liabilities, who, and because he or she has a majority of such section of the shares that sit with limited partners, is calling the shots while avoiding responsibility and culpability.  That is a real concern that I have, which is why I would prefer a simple majority of limited partners be calculated rather than a situation whereby the value of contributions determines that.  I do not want to have a situation of a silent partner or power behind the power.</p><p>While I have not tabled amendments on section 14, which is around the withdrawal and substitution of general partners, I will reserve the right to come back on that question in that section.  What we do not want is, for example, a limited partner who remains constant while general partners change.  That is my concern on that amendment.</p></speech>

The structure of the investment limited partnership is not based on one partner, one vote.  That is the essence of this Bill.  People can invest different amounts into an investment limited partnership, so the essence of this legislation is that the majority should not be calculated based on one partner, one vote, but should be based on their contributions.</p> <p>If I could draw the analogy, it is a bit like a person who has shares in a company.  Every single shareholder does not have an equal vote.  It is based on the number of shares that shareholders own in the company.  It is not a mutual society like a building society where everybody has one vote.  In trying to explain it, I would say that the situation is more akin, although not exactly, to shareholders at a meeting.  Some people have more shares than others, and therefore get more votes at an AGM.</p> <p>The structure of the investment limited partnership is not based on one partner, one vote.  It is based on the contribution of partners, as outlined in the partnership agreement, which is clearly stated.  When a person agrees to invest in a partnership, he or she knows the agreement being entered into, which is based on the size of his or her contribution.  That determines the person's relative position rather than it being a mutual partnership in which every person has one vote.  It is based on the person's contribution and is therefore akin to the situation of a company shareholder and the number of shares that person holds in a particular company.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Does that mean that any member of the Garda who may be nosey or whatever might decide to see who is on the register?</p></speech>

A similar issue of clarity arises in section 63, concerning which information is shared with which public bodies.  I will bring forward the same question when we reach section 63 because we need to have appropriate safeguards to ensure there is no inappropriate sharing of information.</p></speech>

No sergeant or similar member of the Garda can seek the information.  It must be an officer from inspector level up who seeks it.  This measure does not apply to all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>To be helpful to Senator Higgins regarding who can have access, the soul purpose of the Garda, the Criminal Assets Bureau and those types of organisations getting access to the register of PPS numbers in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is merely, only and exclusively to validate the PPS number, the date of birth and the identity of the person involved.  They have no authority to receive any information that they can share beyond that.  They have no authority to share information with any other body.  The parent Department holding it is the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Other people have access to the register to check those specific three details.  They also have no access to obtain that information back out and share it again.</p></speech>

The Bill should stipulate the area of the Garda concerned because it currently refers to "any member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.179" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#HHH00800"><p>The proposed new section 55 of the 1994 Act relates to "Unrestricted access to beneficial ownership information in central register".  As the proposed new section 55(1)(a) refers to "a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not below the rank of inspector, who is engaged in the prevention, detection, investigation or analysis of possible money laundering or terrorist financing", the Bill deals specifically with the issue raised by Senator Burke.</p></speech>

At present, the Bill simply requires that a statutory declaration be made that the general partner had not been notified of any order or resolution to wind up or liquidate, and similarly, that the general partner had not been notified of the appointment of a liquidator or similar person.  I am proposing to extend that provision because it is crucial that such a statutory declaration should also be able to confirm that no limited partner has been notified of an intention to liquidate or appoint a liquidator.  This proposal reflects my concern that there is real power without responsibility and culpability here.  I do not want us to end up with a statutory declaration where, in theory, the general partner can claim it did not know of the appointment of a liquidator even though an active limited partner, possibly a board member, may have been aware of such a situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-10-22a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020102200002#JJJ00400"><p>This amendment relates to a statutory declaration that a general partner must make on a migration-out stating that it has not been notified of a resolution or other order to wind up the investment limited partnership.  It seeks to add a provision that the general partner is not aware of a notification made to a limited partner of a resolution to wind up the investment limited partnership.</p><p>The problem with this proposed amendment is that the role of the limited partner must be distinguished from that of the general partner in this legislation.  It is essentially one of the key cornerstones of this legislation that the general partner is the person responsible for the running of the partnership and the limited partner's role is limited and it has no role in the management or decision-making roles of the investment limited partnership.</p><p>Section 6 of the 1994 Act prohibits a limited partner from taking part in the conduct of the business, as I have said.  In contrast, the general partner's role is to conduct the affairs of the investment limited partnership.  The role of the limited partner is, therefore, restricted to that of a passive investor.  Consequently, a limited partner cannot have a role with regard to winding up the investment limited partnership.  Limited partners are passive investors.  To take on such a role would mean that a limited partner is taking on a management role acting as a general partner and this would entail the loss of limited liability.  That is the essence of it.  Limited partners are passive investors, not participants in the management of the investment limited partnership.</p><p>Finally, notification to wind up should be served or made to a general partner.  If this is not done, the service would not be considered properly made and would arguably be ineffective <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the investment limited partnership.  A notice of liquidation served on a limited partner would not be valid in any event.</p></speech>

That is my concern.  I note that this entire section - section 40, in relation to the migration-out - relates to the question of funds moving location as convenient.  It relates to that concern we might have of chasing services or products on offer elsewhere.  I reserve the right to bring forward similar amendments, and indeed wider amendments looking at the question of the changing of jurisdiction or the migration-out of partnerships, on Report Stage.</p></speech>

There may be an argument to be made in certain circumstances &mdash; we need to interrogate these &mdash; about not having cross-liability between different sub-funds.  An example would be where there is a large number of pension schemes.  Regardless of the lack of cross-liability, I am concerned that there is no upward liability.  The umbrella fund should be liable for the failure of a sub-fund to deliver.  My amendment would leave the lack of cross-liability between sub-funds but remove the excuse for the overall fund not being subject to upward liability.  I will be proposing much more specific measures because we see these products at work in Luxembourg and elsewhere.  We must learn from the problems and concerns regarding these products.</p></speech>

If accepted, it would adversely affect the segregation of liability between the sub-funds that this legislation seeks to establish.  It would result in inconsistency between other investment funds' legal structures which are currently available in Ireland and it would expose investors to the risk of cross-contamination of liability between unconnected sub-funds.  Each sub-fund will hold a separate pool of assets whereby the liabilities of one sub-fund will be segregated from those of another.  What the Senator suggests means that certain sub-funds could be liable for others although they have no direct involvement in them.  Segregated liability ring-fences the assets and liabilities of each sub-fund, and the structure is available to all other regulated fund vehicles in the country.  This process is in line with the normal process to date.</p> <p>On the section, I may table a technical amendment on Report Stage to correct typographical error in the printed Bill, which refers to "limited partners".</p></speech>
