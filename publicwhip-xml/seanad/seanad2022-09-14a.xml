    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#B00300"><p>I thank the Cathaoirleach and welcome the Minister of State.</p><p>I will speak today about energy.  While many people are terrified at the thought of their energy bills landing on the doormat, families must also contend with the prospect of blackouts.  It is a long time since we had blackouts in this country.  I remember having them when I was a child but most people will not remember them because they have an expectation of a functioning energy system as part of the social contract they enter into with the State.</p><p>I will leave to another day the issue of how we got into this mess, which has been the subject of much debate, and focus instead on what the Minister will do to make sure we have enough gas and electricity for the winter and we do not face blackouts.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told an Oireachtas committee two weeks ago that Ireland would voluntarily reduce its demand by approximately 15%.  We have had some announcements in the past week about reducing energy use in the public sector and we also had the relaunch of the &quot;Reduce Your Use&quot; campaign.  Some of the measures being taken in public buildings, for example, the use of thermostats to reduce temperatures, beggar belief and raise the question as to why they were not being taken in the first place.</p><p>The Government's plan seems to leave much of the heavy lifting to households.  One Minister quoted in the <i>Irish Independent</i>newspaper used the language of the warmonger, Donald Rumsfeld, in stating the Government would use a tactic of shock and awe in regard to households.  For anyone who needs reminding, &quot;shock and awe&quot; is defined as a strategy based on the use of overwhelming power to force or paralyse one's enemy and destroy his or her will.  If that is the approach the Government will take, it does not suggest it has citizens' best interests at heart.</p><p>If people are driven into energy poverty and further cuts in energy use, many households will go without basic necessities such as heat and light.  Electricity is not a luxury for most people.  Energy should be a right.  As we are all aware, in many households people do not have any more lights to turn off or extra rooms they are not going to heat.  They have already cut their energy use to the bone.</p><p>I will raise one example of where the Government should seek to reduce demand, namely, advertising billboards.  According to the NGO, Adfree Cities, large billboards, particularly LED ones, use vast amounts of energy.  Over a year of operation, the electricity used by a typical LED billboard screen equates to that of nine households.  When running for a full year at maximum output, usage can be as high as that of 33 households.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> One example that was highlighted yesterday on social media showed an LED screen illuminating the whole of a junction in Rathmines.  I subsequently submitted a complaint to the council because I think the brightness of the billboard breaches its planning conditions.</p><p>The Government should look at this.  The German Government has already identified billboards as part of its demand reduction because it recognises how frivolous and unnecessary their energy usage is in advertising consumer products by massive corporations.  The German Government has passed a law called the short-term energy supply security measure.  It restricts illumination of billboard advertisements to six hours a day.  We know we have a different situation in Ireland in that we are not as reliant on gas as Germany is, but we do have crunch times.  Surely the Government should look at turning off LED-lit billboards between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. and between 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. to help reduce the pressure on our grid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#C00200"><p>EU Regulation No. 2022/1369 was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 5 August of this year with the aim of improving the co-ordination framework for national gas demand reduction measures in case of a severe disruption of gas supplies from Russia.  As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war, there is a heightened risk of a complete cessation of supplies of natural gas from Russia to Europe.  Gas supplies from Russia to Europe have been severely reduced over the past year and continue to be a cause of concern for Europe's energy security.  This has resulted in natural gas prices that are approximately ten times the levels seen just two years ago.</p> <p>The continued supply of natural gas to Ireland has not to date been reduced or interrupted as a result of this reduced supply.  The UK, from where we get 75% of our gas, is at a strategic advantage compared with other European countries with a diverse source of gas supplies.</p> <p>This regulation requires member states to use their best efforts to reduce their gas demand by 15% over the winter.  The regulation provides member states with the freedom to choose the most appropriate measures to reduce their gas demand.  The measures chosen, however, should be governed by criteria such as being clearly defined, transparent, proportionate, non-discriminatory and verifiable.</p> <p>The regulation highlights that it is necessary to consider the interests of protected customers and also urges member states to think about measures that affect customers other than protected customers.</p> <p>The regulation outlines certain measures that member states should consider such as reducing gas consumed in the electricity sector, encouraging fuel-switching in industry, national awareness-raising campaigns and targeted obligations to reduce heating and cooling in order to promote switching to other fuels and to reduce consumption by industry.</p> <p>The regulation requires that the competent authority of each member state - in our case the Commission for Regulation of Utilities - takes the necessary steps to update its national emergency plan to reflect voluntary demand reduction measures by 31 October of this year.</p> <p>My Department wrote to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and Gas Networks Ireland to request that they develop proposals for gas demand reduction measures in response to the requirements set out in the regulation on co-ordinated demand reduction measures for gas.  The Department has received these options and is working with the CRU and GNI to prepare proposals for the energy security emergency group to consider.  It will be important that the measures will be able to have an impact on demand reduction for this winter and that they do not negatively impact protected customers.  We must also be mindful that the majority of Ireland's natural gas is used in the power generation sector.</p> <p>The Government has already taken actions that will reduce our gas use.  Last week the Government approved a suite of energy efficiency measures across the public sector.  We have also implemented national awareness-raising campaigns to encourage people to reduce their energy use.</p> <p>Ireland has a derogation from having to comply with mandatory demand reductions because it is no longer directly connected to another EU member state.  However, by having a voluntary demand reduction plan, Ireland is showing solidarity with other member states.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#C00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response.  The issue is not showing solidarity with other member states.  What I think many households would like to see is the Government showing solidarity with households as well and asking businesses to do their part in reducing our demand on the electricity system.  We know that we are buying in gas-powered generators and that we have a particular issue around the crunch times of 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and the early morning.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State said that the measures should be proportionate and transparent.  It is not too much to ask that we would turn off LED billboards during those crunch times of pressure on the grid, especially given that we are shifting from backless advertisement billboards to these LED-type ones and the multiple and the hundreds of so-called phone kiosks that are popping up around the country.  They are supposed to be telephones, but we all know that the legitimate reason for them is that they are free advertising for the phone company that had telephone boxes there previously.</p><p>That would be a proportionate measure and would show solidarity to households.  These billboards are completely non-essential use of electricity.  We are asking businesses to curtail their usage to reduce critical demand at those hours to help prevent blackouts for households.  It would be a proportionate measure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#D00200"><p>The Government has to lead by example on this and the public sector has been asked to turn down its thermostats to a maximum of 19&deg;C and to turn off the power an hour or two before the end of the working day where that is feasible, reasonable and safe, which it would not be in a hospital, obviously.  We have also asked that public sector buildings and bodies turn off display lighting at night, where it is not there for the purpose of safety.  That should, of course, extend to the corporate sector.  Just as the Government has a role to lead by example, the corporate sector has to do its share of the work and it can never be the case that we ask the public to do something that the Government would not do or the corporate sector would not be asked to do.</p> <p>I agree that display advertising should be constrained and reduced.  I will talk to the CRU about that.  The regulator has come out with a set of proposed tariffs for the corporate sector that increase the cost for corporations.  They are especially targeted at large energy users.  There has been a public consultation on this, which is now closed.  I am waiting to see what comes back from the CRU on this, but it will charge large energy users, such as data centres, more to use electricity during peak hours.  It will also charge them more where there is any threat to the supply.  It will increase the tariff when the wind drops and we are more dependent on gas than we usually are than on renewable energy.  Large energy users are not happy about that.  The corporate sector has to come to me in its pre-budget submissions.  It is not happy about that, but it has to happen.  There has to be solidarity between Government, the corporate sector and the public.</p></speech>

I know he was in the RDS earlier at the Worldskills event for apprenticeships, an area in which he is doing considerable work.  I thank him for taking the time to take this Commencement matter.</p> <p>I also acknowledge his interest and determination to ensure that Waterford and the south east achieved their long-held ambition to have a university in the region that could act as a catalyst for growth.  However, I am sure he will also agree that while that milestone on 1 May was important, the real work only starts now to ensure that Ireland's newest university realises its vision of becoming an educational and research institution of international standing.  That requires additional facilities and resources, the adjacent space to expand and a leadership team to achieve this vision.</p> <p>With that latter point in mind, I compliment the Minister of State on his appointments thus far: Professor Veronica Campbell, as the new president; former Provost of Trinity College Dublin, Dr. Patrick Prendergast, as chairman; and Ms Jim Bergin of Glanbia and Ms Ruth Beadle of Sanofi, as board members.  Nobody can question their suitability, expertise and determination to ensure that South East Technological University, SETU, becomes the driver that it needs to be for the south-east region.</p> <p>As the Minister will be aware, I have engaged with both him, the T&aacute;naiste and their respective teams, on the topic of the acquisition of the former Waterford Crystal site on numerous occasions over the past 12 months.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While the Minister and T&aacute;naiste have both been categoric in their utterances on the Government's commitment to expanding the footprint of the SETU campus in Waterford city, unfortunately there are still some who wish to deny that progress is being made on the issue and who say that ring-fenced funding essentially equates to nothing and that if the Government wanted to, it could click its fingers and make it happen overnight.  Any objective analyst will say that while the process is exceptionally frustrating, including for me as a politician and, I am sure, Deputy Harris as Minister, failure to follow the various steps could put the entire project in jeopardy, which would be in nobody's interest.  It would, therefore, be helpful if the Minister could outline the process that has been undertaken to date and explain the process that is to take place and the attached timelines to secure this site, which will future-proof our new university and its growth in Waterford city.</p><p>I acknowledge the letter the Minister sent me last week that confirmed the Higher Education Authority, HEA, sent him a report on 1 September regarding the site.  I know he has acted swiftly to seek the approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to enable SETU to commence formal negotiations with the owner of the site.  It is urgent to give SETU the mandate to ensure it can conclude negotiations with the vendor.  I understand there was a great deal of work and engagement at the front end of the process on the part of the then Waterford Institute of Technology.  I am sure that banked work will come to fruition at the back end of the process, but of course it needs to be given the green light as soon as possible.  I hope the Minister can give assurances in that regard.</p><p>I cannot overstate the importance of this site both from both practical and symbolic points of view.  Not only will it future-proof the growth of the new university in Waterford, as I have said, but it will also give an enormous lift to the people of Waterford to know that a site that once employed thousands will be repurposed to educate and accommodate the next generation of young workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#E00200"><p>I thank my colleague for raising this important matter, not only today in Seanad &Eacute;ireann but also almost daily.  I am aware of his genuine, deep commitment to and understanding of the importance of a university for Waterford in the south east in terms of educational access, economic investment, balanced regional development and ensuring Waterford can harness and reach its incredible full potential.  I thank him so much.</p> <p>I really enjoyed being in what is now SETU with the Senator on designation day.  I could sense genuine excitement and a genuine buzz from the staff and students after years of debate and discussion.  Finally, we were moving forward, and finally the south east, including Waterford, was getting a university.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for his comments on the appointments.  I, too, think President Veronica Campbell brings an unquestionable and exceptional depth of experience to the role.  I wish her well as the first president.  I also wish well the governing authority, chaired by Dr. Paddy Prendergast, former Provost of Trinity College, and so many other excellent people, including the deputy chair, namely Mr. Jim Bergin, and Ms Ruth Beadle.  I thank them for their work.</p> <p>As the new academic year begins, students graduating from the SETU in Waterford do so with a university qualification.  The institution has now taken its rightful place in a national network of five technological universities, serving all our regions and fulfilling a key commitment of the programme for Government.  As the Senator rightly implied, there will be some who constantly wish to denigrate or talk down the process.  It is making real, tangible progress.  I believe the people of Waterford get and know that, but he is right that they want to know what is next.  They are dead right to want to know that.</p> <p>Since 2013, the Government has been providing significant financial support to technological universities, specifically the project in the south east, including Waterford, first through the higher education landscape fund and subsequently through the transformation fund.  The establishment of the new technological university is a significant milestone for the region.  I believe this new university will grow and thrive.  A key part of the growth and thriving is the expansion of the footprint in Waterford.  To be categoric, it is the Government's intention to physically expand the footprint of the technological university in Waterford.  I am strongly committed to this, as are the T&aacute;naiste, Taoiseach and all the other members of the Government.  My Department is as well.  We are doing this because we believe it will enable SETU to cater for and prepare for increased enrolments, with more students staying in and coming to Waterford, as well as delivering the infrastructural transformation that reflects its new university status and mandate.  As the Senator said, we have set aside funding to ensure this capital expansion can be realised.</p> <p>I am pleased to update him, as I did in my letter to him recently.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Earlier this year, SETU submitted a detailed preliminary business case for expanded capacity to the HEA in accordance with public spending code requirements.  In other words, it sent in a business case looking to expand the footprint.  This considered demand analysis, enrolment projections, current and future space requirements and an analysis of options for delivery of the additional capacity.  The HEA has issued a report to my Department in recent weeks - on 1 September, as Senator Cummins said - and my Department is now engaging with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on taking the next step.  As Minister, I am limited in terms of commercial sensitivities but I can assure the Senator, as he has asked me to, that this is a very important issue for my Department.  We are keen to move on this quickly but in doing so we have to get value for money and we have to make sure we fulfil the strategic objectives of SETU.  I will certainly keep Senator Cummins and Government and Oireachtas colleagues in Waterford up to date in regard to this matter.  I hope I can reassure him that the support for the expansion of the SETU Waterford campus remains a key priority for me, for my Department and for the Government.  I look forward to updating him further on developments in due course.</p></speech>

It is important to lay out the timelines attaching to that process.  I appreciate that the Minister is facing constraints with regard to commercial sensitivities while SETU negotiates with the owner of the site.  I am trying to ascertain the expected timeline for it to be given a mandate to do so.  I am relatively confident that the work that was done at the front end of this process by the then Waterford Institute of Technology will yield a positive result at the back end of the process, but SETU has to be enabled now to proceed to the next step in this regard.  I appreciate that this is not solely within the remit of the Minister's Department, but I would appreciate it if he could provide an assurance on the timeline that he expects from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for him ultimately to give SETU the sanction.</p></speech>

It is worthwhile to outline the progress that has been made with the campus expansion because sometimes that can be overlooked.  Five steps have had to be gone through.  The first step involved a recognition by myself, by my Department and by the Government, in agreeing with the position of the Senator and other Oireachtas colleagues, that we needed to expand the footprint in Waterford.  That step is in place.  Setting aside funding to make that happen is in place.  The second step was the business case.  In other words, Waterford Institute of Technology, which is now SETU, put forward a very detailed comprehensive preliminary business case with projections, analysis and all of that.  I thank them for that work.  The third step was the carrying out of the report - an independent analysis of the situation from perspective of the taxpayer and the Department - which has gone to the HEA.  The fourth step involved my Department receiving a submission from the HEA.  We now have that.  The fifth step, which is where we are now, involves my Department engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the report and on a potential mandate for negotiation.  If anybody in Waterford wishes for whatever reason to suggest that there is any sort of lacuna or vacuum here, factually it does not stack up.  Designation day was May.  We are standing here in September having gone through five steps.  I am saying that I want to see the engagement taking place as quickly as possible.  Obviously the budget has to be the first, second and third priority for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department now.  However, I would like to see intensive engagement between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform towards the end of this month to try to move this project forward as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign has highlighted in advance of budget 2023 that drug and alcohol task force community projects are places where lives are changed and lives are saved.  These organisations do extraordinary work.  During the past year, in one drug task force area in which I have experience, alcohol and cocaine were the most common drug problems.  There was an increase in cases treated for cocaine of 83%.  Alcohol treatment also increased twofold with twice the numbers supported compared to 2020 and 2021.  Benzodiazepine cases increased in the same period by 150%.  The task force area also experienced an increase in drug debt intimidation.</p><p>These are exceptional projects and they have not had their funding restored since the savage cuts of the recession that was triggered by the banking crisis.  There has been no increase in core funding since 2013.  They are serving more people in the community with less money than they had prior to 2011.  In the meantime, the cost of everything has increased, especially now we are facing an absolute crisis.  I acknowledge there have been strands of <i>ad hoc</i>funding such as strand 2 in 2019, cocaine money in 2022 and the community enhancement fund in 2022.  As much as they are welcome, they are normally for new initiatives and do not contribute to the sustainability of projects and core funding.</p><p>I want to paint a picture of a current situation faced by the St. John Bosco Youth Centre, an exceptionally well-run centre.  They have taken great steps with their efficiency and prudent governance decisions to maximise their funding in the service of their community.  I have their permission to share their experience.  Their building is 1,500 sq. m.  It was built at various stages by the community of Drimnagh between the 1950s and 1970s.  The centre opens seven days a week, 51 weeks a year.  It is open in excess of 90 hours a week.  It is used by a wide variety of groups, including youth work projects, Youth Caf&eacute;, Montessori, Merchant's Quay Project, Solas youth justice project, addiction support groups and the Dublin 12 drug and alcohol task force.  It is also utilised by different nationality groups as well as for community events.  The centre sees 600 people in its services and activities daily.  The Bosco has an exemplary record of managing its finances and has shown itself to be a really resilient organisation over its 70 years.  It has a record of being extremely prudent and has demonstrated through the cuts in its energy bills that it has taken steps all along to make the most out of the money it has and to be as sensible as possible in the decisions it makes.  However, on 22 September the centre will run out of contract with its gas supplier.  That will bring it from 2.5 cent per kWh to possibly 17 cent per kWh, a sevenfold increase in the cost.  To put this as an average monthly cost, it will go from &euro;700 a month to &euro;4,900 on average.</p><p>The current energy crisis represents a big threat to the community and voluntary sector.  I would say it poses an even bigger threat than Covid did as it does to our whole society.  Just as the development of vaccines and effective public health measures were the way to minimise the threat of Covid, there is an urgent need to put in place a plan to limit the cost impact on organisations within the community and particularly for those who are struggling with drug addiction.  We hear all about business supports.  We hear about the cost of living interventions.  I have great faith in what is going to be in the budget.  We hear about lots of other measures but it is really important that no one is left out.  Community organisations, especially in the space of drug prevention, treatment and support must be sheltered from the storm of the cost of living.  The most vulnerable must be protected.  I am asking that there is advocacy and a strong voice in this place to make sure these organisations have their core funding increased to meet the cost-of-living crisis.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to update the House on funding for community-based drug and alcohol services and acknowledge the role of Senator Seery Kearney as chairperson of the Dublin 12 drug and alcohol task force.</p> <p>Senators may be aware that the Department of Health completed a mid-term review of the actions in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, which, as Senators are aware, is a health-led response to drug and alcohol use.  Based on the learning from the mid-term review, six strategic priorities for 2021-25 were identified.  One such priority is to enhance access to and delivery of drug and alcohol services in the community.  The priority seeks to enhance community care for people who use drugs by providing health and social care services at the community level to meet identified health needs.  This will be supported through the development of a drugs services care plan formulated on the basis of the six new health regions agreed by the Government in 2019.  A particular focus will be put on ensuring access to services for women, people in rural areas, ethnic minorities and the LGBTI+ community.  This priority will consider models of care for people who use drugs and have comorbidities.  It will also address the stigma linked to drug use and drug addiction and its impact on access and delivery of health services.</p> <p>I am happy to inform the Seanad that, as the Senator outlined, in December 2021 I created a &euro;2 million fund, namely, the community services enhancement fund, to enhance community-based drug and alcohol services.  The fund supports the aforementioned strategic priority under the national drugs strategy for 2021-25.  The Department also provides &euro;28 million for 280 community-based drug and alcohol services annually.</p> <p>Under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE provides financial assistance to organisations by means of a grant.  Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service the HSE may provide.  In October 2018, an agreement was reached by the parties at the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in respect of a process of pay restoration for staff employed in section 39 organisations who met certain criteria, rather than the types of individual workers who are employed in them.  Only organisations that received in excess of an agreed specified amount from the HSE by way of the service level agreement process were included.  It must be acknowledged that section 39 organisations are privately owned and run and that their terms and conditions of employment, once in line with employment legislation, are strictly between the employer and the employee.</p> <p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, the Department developed a framework for the restoration and continuation of drug and alcohol services in a planned and appropriate manner in line with public health advice.  To support the framework, the Department provided once-off funding of &euro;480,000 in November 2020 for the restoration of drug and alcohol services, including the adaptation of services and premises, online meetings and personal protective equipment.  The Department also provided an additional &euro;2 million for residential drug and alcohol treatment services in 2021.</p></speech>

While I appreciate the initiatives that have been taken - the community enhancement has certainly been valuable - it is the core funding that actually needs to be increased.  Even if we did not have energy, cost-of-living and inflation crises, 2013 was an awfully long time ago.  How can extraordinary organisations such as the St. John Bosco Youth Centre meet a jump from &euro;700 to &euro;4,900 in its average monthly energy cost?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The answer to that is they cannot do so without shaving either staff or services to the 600 people who attend their premises every day.  While the prevalence of drug use is the same across all societies and sectors, the greatest impact of drug use is where there is greatest deprivation.  Such communities are in a stranglehold.  We must make sure community organisations are safeguarded and strongly supported.</p></speech>

The Senator outlined the case of the St. John Bosco Youth Centre in Drimnagh.  The fact that the gas contract price has gone up from 2.5 cent per kilowatt hour to possibly 17 cent per kilowatt hour or from &euro;700 to &euro;4,900 per month is unsustainable.  My officials and the Government are very aware of the matter.  The additional operating costs for community-based drug and alcohol services and other section 49 services will be considered as part of the 2023 Estimates process.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  It is a significant concern for these services and services across the board.  My Department is taking this on board.  The next two weeks will be interesting but we hope the matter will be addressed in the budget.  I have brought this message very clearly to the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance.</p></speech>

It has been four years since the historic vote to repeal the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  After that referendum, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, promised legislation to establish safe access zones outside hospitals.  The Minister of State knows that, unfortunately, that promise was not maintained.  He also knows that a commitment was given in the programme for Government to establish exclusion zones around medical facilities.  Unfortunately, in May 2021, the Minister of State told me in a Commencement matter debate that there was no need for this legislation.  On the back of that, the Together for Safety campaign group drew up its own Bill and I was very proud to introduce it in the Seanad, with cross-party support.  As the Minister of State knows, that Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad.</p> <p>One of the frustrating aspects of the past couple of years has been a constant promise by the Government to introduce a Bill.  The Minister gave me an assurance that the Bill would be introduced by March 2022 but, again, we did not see the Bill materialise.  Thankfully, the heads of a Bill were published in August but I emphasise the crucial importance of moving swiftly with this legislation.  The Minister of State will agree with me that everybody should have the right to access healthcare, including abortion services, in dignity, privacy and safety.  People should have the right to go to work without having to worry about being observed, harassed or intimidated while doing their job.  Additionally, there have recent reports from members of the general public that residents and businesses near these facilities as well as service users find their presence incredibly distressing.</p> <p>What is the status of the plan to advance the Government's safe access zones Bill?  The Minister asked me whether I would work with the Government when it introduced its Bill and I gave him a firm commitment that we would.  I want the Minister of State to tell me the timeline for this Bill.  As I am sure he will acknowledge, after four years, we have been left waiting for far too long.  During the summer, the Minister said he expected the Bill to be fully passed through both Houses by Christmas.  Will the Minister of State confirm that this is the timeline?  If it is not the timeline, will he outline what the expected timeline for the Bill will be so that we can have a firm expectation as to when we will see these key issues addressed?</p> <p>It is not a coincidence that only one in ten GPs is offering abortion services.  One of the factors that has been acknowledged by the Department is that these protests are having a chilling effect in terms of the provision of services.  That is why it is so important that we see action and swift action from this Government.</p> <p>The Minister of State received an excellent submission from the Together for Safety group regarding the Bill.  I will briefly highlight three key concerns regarding the content of the Bill the group has raised.  The first involves ensuring that industrial action is protected in the Bill.  The Minister of State knows that in our Bill, we made sure industrial action is fully protected.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am a little surprised there is no reference to that in the heads of the Bill for the Government's proposed legislation.  I again ask for a specific assurance that protection of industrial action will be included in that Bill.  </p><p>The second issue is that of empowering garda&iacute;.  The language in head 4 of the proposed Bill needs to be changed from "may" to "shall", thereby empowering garda&iacute; to take necessary action, should the circumstances call for it, and ensuring that action is taken in every instance.</p><p>I also ask the Minister of State for an assurance that the Bill will use inclusive language.  It is important that it incorporates such inclusive language to recognise and acknowledge that transgender and non-binary people may become pregnant and require access to termination of pregnancy services.  We request that the wording "women and pregnant people" be used throughout the legislation, where appropriate.  </p><p>I would appreciate positive and clear responses on those points.</p></speech>

I believe the vast majority of us agree that nobody should be harassed, insulted, intimidated or interfered with in any way, or have their decision to access lawful healthcare services subject to attempted influence in an unsolicited way by strangers.  The Government is committed to ensuring that anyone needing a termination of pregnancy can access services in safety and with privacy and dignity.  This commitment is reflected in the programme for Government.</p> <p>Progressing safe access zones legislation is a priority for the Minister, and he and his officials have placed a substantial focus on developing robust policy and legislative proposals, recognising the complexity of the issues involved.  The Minister brought detailed legislative proposals to Government at the end of July, and he was delighted to secure Government approval for the general scheme of a Bill.  The objective of this general scheme and its underlying policy is to protect the right of a woman to access a healthcare service safely, with privacy and dignity, and without facing unsolicited attempts to influence her decision to access it.  It will also protect service providers and their staff in the course of their duties and responsibilities.  </p> <p>The proposals aim to establish a 100 m safe access zone around all healthcare facilities that can provide termination of pregnancy services, not just those that currently do, including, for example, all hospitals and GP practices.  Within those zones, conduct which is intended to, or may reasonably have the effect of, influencing the decision of a person regarding availing of, or providing, services related to termination of pregnancy will be prohibited.  Careful consideration has been given to developing proposals that balance a range of rights, including the right to protest, while ensuring that the legitimate aim to protect the right of a woman to access, and to access safely and with privacy and dignity, termination of pregnancy services is achieved.  </p> <p>For the general information of the House, the general scheme of the Bill for safe access zones was published by the Minister for Health in early August and it is available on the Department's website.  The general scheme also provides further detailed explanatory notes on the proposed provisions.  Following Government approval, the Department has engaged with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Data Protection Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties seeking any observations they may have.</p> <p>The Department will continue to engage closely with the Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in drafting the final Bill, recognising all the complexities involved.  The Minister for Health will also seek the support of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny of the legislative proposals as quickly as possible and he acknowledges the helpful public discussion on safe access zones in recent months.  The Minister is committed to seeing the Bill drafted as quickly as possible so that it can be introduced to the Oireachtas, while ensuring the final legislation is as robust as possible.  The Senator mentioned a Christmas timeline, and I will try to get information regarding the timeline from the Minister.  He looks forward to the support of the Senator and, indeed, everyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas in progressing this important legislation.</p></speech>

In one sense, it is positive.

It is a worry because we have already been waiting four years.  I understand the need for pre-legislative scrutiny by the health committee.  Does the Minister of State have a date for when that could begin, for example?  My worry is that, to be frank, we will not make the Christmas deadline as suggested by the Minister during the summer.  </p><p>It would also be helpful for me if the Minister of State could confirm that protecting industrial action will be part of the Bill.  It should be; there should not be anything controversial about that.  Will he confirm that the Garda will be given the necessary powers?  Equally important, will he commit to ensuring the Bill has inclusive language, for example, using phrases such as &ldquo;women and pregnant people&rdquo;?  It is very important that the Bill uses inclusive language.  Can the Minister of State give a positive response on those points today at the very least?</p></speech>

He welcomed pre-legislative scrutiny and raised issue relating to industrial action and inclusive language.  I will bring them to the Minister.</p> <p>Again, I think he will agree that those who wish to protest about termination of pregnancy may continue to exercise that right practically everywhere else, including outside of these Houses but such protest may not occur at the access point of healthcare services where the intention of protest activity is, or could reasonably have the effect of, influencing a woman's private healthcare decision.  I understand departmental officials are working with the Office of the Attorney General to progress the drafting of the Bill.  I will try to get the Senator as much information as I can.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, to the Chamber.</p> <p>On 5 August, Oranmore Orthodontics issued a text message to say that the practice was closing.  I will not get into the ins and outs of why, but that was development for parents in the area.  The practice informed parents that it is no longer practising.  Hundreds of children were left high and dry in respect of their dental care.  A small number were able to get an orthodontist appointment quickly, but now have to pay extra for this, having previously paid in full for the treatment to the other practice.  They do not know whether they will be reimbursed for their full payments.  The vast majority of parents have been unable to get anybody to see their children.  It seems that everybody is washing their hands of this, including the Dental Council of Ireland, the Dental Complaints Resolution Service and the Department of Health.</p> <p>As of today, there are still no practical solutions for parents or, more importantly, for children &ndash; minors &ndash; in Oranmore, Claregalway and the general area.  A meeting was held with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, online last week with some parent representatives and Oireachtas Members.  It was described in an email by parent representatives who attended as &ldquo;disappointing&rdquo;.  That is an understatement.  The response that we received was extremely disappointing.  All we heard at that meeting was that there is no legislation in place in the case of an orthodontist practice closing.  There is a serious lack of specialist orthodontists in the country.  There is no legislation in place to deal with any orthodontist practice where a nurse or an orthodontist could fall ill or where it could have to close for health reasons or where they pass away.  The Minister has indicated that he is unwilling to put emergency legislation in place to support this unprecedented case, stating that legislation takes months to put in place.  Yet, as I said, the text message went out on 4 August and here we are on 14 September.  More than a month and a half has passed.</p> <p>A departmental official who attended the meeting said it is acceptable for parents and patients to travel to Clonmel or Dublin every six weeks for a ten-minute appointment.  They got no responses from the Dental Council, which said it contacted 30 orthodontists within a 1.5-hour radius of Oranmore.  Parents cannot find those 30 orthodontists.  They can find four, but they do not know where the other 26 are.  The Dental Complaints Resolution Service is refusing to support parents.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The parents are in limbo not knowing how to claim for the additional expenses incurred to continue their children's care.  More importantly, the majority of patients have not secured an orthodontist willing to take on their care and there is no sign of an orthodontist willing to take on these patients any time soon.  The Dental Council has advised dentists, although we have to get this in writing, not to take on patients.  Some orthodontists who were initially willing to take on patients have suddenly decided they cannot do so or they will not do so on the advice of the Dental Council.</p><p>The Minister, it seems, is unwilling or unable to come up with solutions to solve this problem.  Officials in the Department have suggested that orthodontists are being sought in Kildare, Cork or Clonmel.  Why can the Department not engage with the Dental Council to find a locum to cover this practice while we sort out this mess?  This situation is having a major impact on parents and, more importantly, on youngsters and minors.  Parents are being left in limbo.  Many of them paid out full costs and cannot afford to pay again.  They do not know whether they will be reimbursed for the money they have paid.</p></speech>

On 11 August, the Department was informed by the Dental Council that it had successfully applied to the High Court to suspend an orthodontist with a practice in Oranmore, County Galway, from the register of dentists and dental specialists.  As the court proceedings are ongoing, the Dental Council is not able to discuss the details of the case due to the <i>in camera</i>court proceedings.</p><p>Since this matter was brought to the attention of the Minister, he has been very concerned about the situation and the consequences for patients and families.  His primary focus has been the care of affected patients.  Officials from the Department have been consulting relevant stakeholders in the dental profession to explore possible solutions, within the confines of the ongoing High Court process.</p><p>On 8 September, the Minister met patient representatives and local representatives to listen to their specific concerns and consider possible options.  He has been given assurances that the Dental Council and the Orthodontic Society of Ireland are using their influence to encourage dental practitioners to support these patients.  The Orthodontic Society of Ireland is advising the public that it is co-ordinating with its members and the appropriate bodies to seek ways to resolve this matter to ensure ongoing care is restored as soon as possible.  To support patients in receiving continuity of care, the Dental Council has written to orthodontists located nearest to the practice to seek their co-operation if former patients of the Oranmore practice seek their help.</p><p>It is usual in cases where dentists are indisposed abruptly through death or illness that care is absorbed by other dental practices over time.  Orthodontic practices are commonly wound down in an orderly fashion and patients continue to receive care in other practices.  However, I appreciate that at present parents feel this transfer of care is taking time and are very concerned.  In view of this, the officials and the Minister will continue to explore all options available to them to help secure continuity of care for the affected patients of Oranmore Orthodontics.</p></speech>

I appreciate he has been provided with the script.  It is very brief and provides no answers.  It contains statements I do not believe are factually correct.  The Minister has been given assurances that the Dental Council and the Orthodontic Society of Ireland are using their influence to encourage dental practitioners to support the patients.  Dentists have informed parents the Dental Council advised them not to take on patients from Oranmore Orthodontics.  This directly contradicts what the Minister of State has said.  The Minister of State said the Dental Council had written to orthodontists located near the practice to seek their co-operation.  Parents are being told the exact opposite and that the Dental Council is telling practitioners not to do so.  We do not know the reasons for this.  It may be a power play.  I do not know.</p> <p>I will recount the story of one family.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The daughter's braces broke and she was in pain with the wires sticking into her jaw.  Her parents said: "No-one would help them so we resorted to a pliers being used to cut the wire to give my daughter some relief."  That is worth repeating and is not the only case I have heard where parents' only solution has been to go and find a pliers in emergencies in Galway.  It is, therefore, time for the Dental Council, the Minister and the Department to step up and sort this out now.  As I said, on 4 August, parents were texted that the practice was winding up and on 14 September no solution is coming from the Department.</p></speech>

The Minister was given assurances that the Dental Council and the Orthodontic Society of Ireland were using their influence to encourage dental practitioners to support these patients.  The Senator has said otherwise and I will bring those views back to the Minister.  I assure the House that the Department is consulting stakeholders across the dental profession to support the continuity of care for the affected patients in Oranmore.  As the case is before the High Court and is subject to <i>in camera</i>proceedings, there is a limit on the information I can provide on behalf of the Minister.  The Senator has articulated that situation.  It is very worrying and it is a situation we should not be in.  Again, I will bring the Senator's views directly to the Minister and try to get this resolved.  I again thank the Senator for raising this very difficult situation, which is one that should not occur.  I hope all the stakeholders will redouble their efforts to resolve this.</p></speech>

This is one of the biggest issues, if not the biggest issue apart from housing, that I have received representations on in my office over the past couple of weeks.  I am sure colleagues are in the same boat.  The issue is parents are seeing their children left at the side of the road; that is the bottom line.  Whether we like it or not, that is what is happening throughout south Kildare and its bordering counties of Laois and Offaly.  I will relay two quick quotations from parents because they reflect what is happening.  The first states: &quot;I have been refused bus tickets that we have had over the last number of years, we now are left with no option but to pay &euro;60 per week for taxis , other than that I will have to give up work&quot;.  The second parent states:</p> <blockquote> 	I have been on to the bus provider last week and yesterday again. The bus goes by our gate everyday with 5 - 6 empty seats in the morning.  [There are more in the afternoon because some parents go and drive to school to collect their children].  The bus holds 33 kids but the bus operator has not received any numbers or names from bus eireann, so cannot tell me if the bus is actually full or not [because he has not received that information].  </blockquote> <p>This is what is going on.  Nobody knows how many spaces are available.  Nobody knows what is going on.  Why can we not allow people aged over 70 to drive buses?  We need solutions.</p></speech>

This is especially so in rural areas and I am sure in the Minister's own constituency as well, where there is just no other choice.  He will be very aware of that.  In areas of east Galway and Roscommon around Ahascragh, Kilconnell, Ballyforan and Dysart, we do not have a myriad of transport options.  There is no Luas or train line running through these towns.  I have been at public meetings in Ballygar and Mountbellew and parents are in despair; it is a lifeline.</p> <p>Making it free was a wonderful initiative.  It has brought in 44,000 students and families who are benefiting and has reduced the cost of transport for families.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My understanding is that with 122,000 tickets issued out of 130,000 applications, there is a shortfall of 8,000 travel tickets.  Based on an average journey of ten km - two return journeys a day means a 40 km daily total - I estimate that if we issued those 8,000 tickets, we could take 320,000 km per day of family journeys off country roads.  I ask the Minister to imagine the amount of emissions reduction and the savings on fuels this would mean for these families.  I put it to her that we need action now for these families.</p></speech>

I have never seen it before in my time in the Oireachtas.  Realistically, I have 172 or 173 kids on to me from west Cork at the moment.  The majority of them had school tickets last year but because of the change in the scheme, they have been effectively thrown off the bus.  These are working families who are trying to live their daily lives and their routine has been taken away from them.  To compound that, I have spoken to a parent whose child is availing of the school bus scheme this year for the first time.  She is caught for the Wednesday afternoon collection, so the child uses the bus service once a week.  This means that on the other nine journeys, the seats are empty.  The system is broken.  We need to put a budget in place to make sure we can cater for all kids and not leave thousands of children at the crossroads without school transportation.  We need a new system in place because it is chaos at the moment.</p></speech>

Like other speakers, I look forward to the day when all schoolchildren will be collected and we will not be having questions about concessionary tickets.  I welcome the initiative that the Minister introduced here as a first step along that journey.  Unfortunately, the unprecedented take-up on this scheme has resulted in children who have school transport tickets every year not getting tickets.  I know one particular family whose child is now doing the leaving certificate and has had a ticket for her six years in secondary school, and this is the first year that they have not been able to get a ticket for her.  Many parents are working and are under stress to keep things going.  The last thing they need at the moment is to have to deal with this problem.  It is estimated that 1,800 children in counties Monaghan, Cavan and Louth do not have a school bus ticket at present.  I know the Minister is working hard on this issue.  I look forward to being told what the plans are to address it.</p></speech>

The unintended consequence is that children who received concessionary tickets for the last number of years, and eligible tickets in some cases, now do not have a seat on the bus.  I know of between 50 and 60 children in County Louth from villages such as Ravensdale, Castlebellingham, Annagassan, Collon and Ardee who are all trying to get into Dundalk, Drogheda and Dunleer, but do not have tickets for those buses.  The buses are leaving each day half full because the people who have received tickets do not need them or are not using them.  As the last speaker here, I ask the Minister on behalf of the parents of those students in County Louth to set out what the plan is to fix this.</p></speech>

Before I address the specific issues raised, I will provide an outline of the significant extent of the school transport scheme which provides transport on a daily basis for tens of thousands of children across the country to mainstream and special education settings.  The purpose of the school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  In July 2022, the Government announced funding for the waiving of school transport scheme fees for the 2020-23 school year as part of an extraordinary package of cost-of-living measures.  This measure has saved families up to &euro;650 per year.</p> <p>School transport ticket registration for the 2022-23 year closed on 29 July, by which time almost 130,000 applications or registrations were received for mainstream school transport.  This figure includes 44,299 new applications, as well as rollovers from the previous school year.  This indicates the very strong level of demand for tickets.  Some 124,000 tickets for the mainstream scheme alone have already been issued to applicants.  At the start of the last school year, approximately 103,000 children were carried on mainstream school transport services.  Therefore, approximately 21,000 additional places have already been created free of charge.  There has been an increase in tickets allocated across all counties.  We are continuing to process applications and to issue tickets as soon as extra buses and drivers are sourced and become available to provide transport to the higher numbers qualifying for the service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, regrettably the unprecedented numbers of new applications for the upcoming school year have led to some delays in issuing tickets.</p><p>The normal eligibility criteria of the scheme still apply and tickets continue to be allocated in line with these criteria.  Pupils at primary level are eligible where they live no less than 3.2 km from their nearest primary school.  At post-primary level, students who live no less than 4.8 km from and are attending their nearest or next-nearest post-primary school are eligible.  Any pupils who do not meet these criteria are deemed not eligible, or otherwise known as concessionary applicants, and are allocated a ticket, as has been previously the case, based on the availability of a seat when all eligible children have been catered for.</p><p>In line with normal practice, all eligible children who completed the application and ticket registration process on time for the 2022-23 school year will be accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation.</p><p>In addition, pending completion of the outcome of the full review of the school transport scheme, temporary alleviation measures at post-primary level continue for the 2022-23 school year.  As I previously outlined, these measures will provide transport for students who are attending their next-nearest post-primary school.</p><p>With regard to the review of the school transport scheme, the Department commenced a review in February 2021.  The review is being conducted with a view to examining the current scheme and how it currently operates, its broader effectiveness and sustainability and that it adequately supports the provision of services to students and their families.</p><p>The review encompasses the school transport scheme for children with special educational needs also.  The review of the primary and post-primary school transport schemes will examine each element of the schemes and includes eligibility criteria, trends, costs, cost drivers and overall effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the schemes.  The review will also examine the potential for integration of different strands of the scheme and a more co-ordinated approach with other Departments that also use transport services.</p><p>Wider considerations relating to operation of the scheme are taking place in the current phase of the review.  As part of the current phase of the review, the technical working group has undertaken extensive consultation, including running a public survey for parents, guardians and students who use the service and those who do not use the service but who would like to.  These engagements have yielded extensive data for consideration.  The group has also consulted a broad array of stakeholders, including schools, special education interest groups, industry representatives and other Departments.</p><p>While work on the review was impacted somewhat by the challenges of the pandemic and the impact of the current conflict in Ukraine, it is anticipated that the final phases of the review will be completed shortly, with recommendations on the future operation of the Department's school transport scheme.  The steering group will continue to report to me on an interim basis as regards the progress of the review.</p></speech>

By allowing every child in the country to avail of free school transport, the Minister can no longer maintain the same eligibility criteria.  We told every child in the country we will provide free school transport without even bothering to prepare by providing for extra buses.</p> <p>The demand is not unprecedented.  When the Cabinet decided in June or July to provide free school transport, the Government should have said we had better get more bus drivers and buses before proceeding to give free school transport.  That is clear and obvious.  We cannot apply the same rules and eligibility criteria.  We cannot give free school transport to everyone in the country and then say we are sorry but we do not have enough buses.  What is the plan?</p></speech>

It is important that it is comprehensive.  I look forward to the outcome but there is a sense of urgency with it because we need to get our house in order for next year.</p> <p>Some operators tell me there are issues with regard to solutions.  There is a particular issue with the buses and another issue getting people to drive them.  I could be working for a private operator taking schoolchildren to a football match and back to school again.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If I were to work for Bus &Eacute;ireann, however, I would not be able to drive those same children home to their mums and dads in the evening or to collect them in the morning.

That needs to be reflected in the tenders if we are to have a bus service going forward.</p></speech>

This issue is not about the review of how the transportation system will work for schools.  The issue is that there was a change and we had a mass of people come on board looking for the scheme.  Because of that, people who were always on the bus have been thrown off the bus.  That is my problem.  I am aware of hundreds of kids in west Cork who have been eligible to ride the bus for four or five years and are now thrown off it because the criteria have changed.  As a result, we need an urgent budget put in place to accommodate the people who have been left behind.  We have left thousands behind, hundreds of them in west Cork.  The distances involved are quite amazing.  I am talking about places like Belgooly and Riverstick all the way to Rossmore.  I had a meeting in Rossmore a few weeks ago at which we heard that 28 children were on the bus last year but are off it this year.  That is because of the change that was made.</p> <p>This is therefore not about the review.  It is about the next ten days and about what we can do to make sure we have a budget to accommodate the children we left behind.</p></speech>

There is no space or capacity on the buses.  Suddenly, everyone has learnt about the criteria in respect of full eligible tickets and concessionary tickets.  There have been last minute notice emails.  There is the communications side of things and the family portal.  Children have been left on the side of the road.  I heard from a mother working at Portiuncula Hospital who had to leave the hospital to come out and pick up a child left at the side of the road.  Is this the fault of bus drivers?  No.  Is it the fault of inspectors?  No.  We need to be smarter about how we use the resources at hand.  This is an issue because it is affecting rural Ireland more than city centres, where there are so many other choices.  We do not have taxis to bring people from A to B.  That does not exist.  Yes, maybe if one is in the town centre, one can get a taxi, but one cannot do so out in rural areas.  I know that this is a huge issue for the Minister as well.  Let us be smarter about using our resources.  Let us use the budget allocation for private contractors.  Let us take into account their extra fuel costs.  Let us take the individual travel off the road and reduce emissions.  Let us make things safer and let us help rural Ireland.</p></speech>

We cannot wait for reviews.  Colleagues have said that.  As for the example I gave the Minister of the incident involving the child, she is a special needs child.  I did not say that in my initial contribution.  She is losing school days because she cannot get to school, but the school bus is going past her door with five to six empty seats on it.  We need to contact those operators and ask them how many people are on their buses and how many spare spaces they have.  We need to ensure that those over 70 years of age can drive our buses.</p> <p>Local Link has a huge part to play in this as well.  In my area a great Local Link service was announced and we asked if it could go at 4.15 p.m. to accommodate schools.  The answer was "No" because it has to go at 4 p.m.  Now those who could accommodate themselves on Local Link cannot do so.  It is a matter of joined-up thinking but it has to happen now.  Children are on the side of the road.  Parents are handing in their notice.  This is an urgent issue, and everyone in this House knows it.  The Government needs to act.</p></speech>

There was no change of criteria in that respect.  It was made very clear that the announcement was for those who were eligible for the school transport scheme.</p> <p>It is significant to note the numbers.  This time last year we had 103,000 tickets issued and students availing of the system.  At this point we have 124,000 availing of the school transport system, and availing of it free of charge, so it has been a considerable cost-of-living measure for many families, for many of them amounting to &euro;650.</p> <p>I referred to the review because it was specifically referred to in the questions put to me as part of the Commencement matter.  The review is ongoing and is charged with looking at eligibility, so there may well be an opportunity going forward to change eligibility, but there was nothing about changed eligibility in the announcement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Norma Foley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=NormaFoley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not for one minute underestimate any of the difficulties for the families in accessing the school transport system.  It is for that reason that I initiated the review in the first instance.</p><p>Where there are specific challenges, we continue to work through them.  It is fair to say that there have been challenges in terms of additional buses and drivers, but excellent work is going on there and those who are eligible are being catered for.  Where there is scope to do otherwise, as we have seen previously where there is additional capacity as a consequence of those eligible being catered for, which will continue going forward, then there will be provision made going forward.</p><p>I continue to look at every possible avenue that we have.  I continue to look at resources, including in discussions with the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, with regard to it going forward.  It is a significant achievement that 124,000 children are availing of free transport at this point.</p><p>I specifically wish to reference a question that was raised in terms of special education.  There should be no issue there.  I would appreciate if the Senator would share the details of that case with me because there should not be an issue when it comes to special education.</p></speech>

On behalf of the House, I sent a letter to my counterpart, the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord John Francis McFall, expressing our sympathy on the death of Queen Elizabeth II, whose visit to Ireland in 2011 did a lot to deepen and strengthen relationships on this island.  Her use of the Irish language on that visit was a symbolic gesture that was deeply appreciated by all the people of Ireland.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1646" speakername="Ollie Crowe" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#U00200"><p>I welcome the UK ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Paul Johnston, and his colleague, Mr. Jeremy Wilmshurst, to the House and share with them our condolences on the passing of Queen Elizabeth II.  Her visit to Ireland in 2011 was a significant moment in the history of our countries and will long be remembered.  That visit was a success in no small part thanks to the warmth and grace displayed by Queen Elizabeth II.  We remember the visit as we offer our support and condolences to all those who are mourning her passing.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann not accepting card payments.  That this is still the case in 2022 is totally unacceptable.  The reality is that the number of cash payments and of people who use cash regularly are falling consistently.  That trend has been more or less exacerbated by the pandemic, for obvious reasons.  For one of the main transport providers in this country, a State-owned operator, still to provide no option to pay by card and seemingly no imminent plan to bring in such a payment system reflects poorly on it, to say the least.  This is an issue that staff in Galway have raised with me.  Drivers are frequently criticised over it, which is obviously not acceptable.  Front-line staff are being blamed for it when the matter is entirely out of their control.  From my experience of Bus &Eacute;ireann in Galway, the drivers and other staff are excellent; however, when a person does not have change, there can be a significant confrontation, which leads to a difficult working environment.</p> <p>The Government is one that wants to encourage people to travel on public transport to build up and expand the system.  This can be achieved if non-regular users have a positive experience when they use the services.  The Leap card, as all Members will be aware, is fantastic, but irregular users will not have one.  Contactless payment is essential from that point of view.  </p> <p>Contactless payment is also important to tourists who visit our country.  We know how important the tourism sector is to the country.  Little things can become big things for people.  Tourists who might want to take a number of buses while here need to be facilitated.  We should ensure the process is as smooth as possible.  Whether we are dealing with visitors or our own people, it is essential that we send the right message.  It is essential that we offer the 100,000 welcomes to tourists.  This needs to be considered immediately.  I ask the Leader to raise the issue with the Minister for Transport and request that his Department prioritises the matter so it will be rectified in the immediate future.  When staff, tourists and citizens are complaining, you know there is an issue.</p></speech>

We have three third level institutes in Limerick: the University of Limerick, TUS Limerick and Mary Immaculate College.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I have received many calls from people not just in Limerick but throughout the country who cannot source student accommodation.  The students' unions in the three third level institutes have started a campaign encouraging people to rent a room.  That is something that has been suggested and I raised it myself.  However, there is a fear among some of the older people in the community that it will affect their medical cards.  Certainly I believe that the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is on board.  I have contacted him.  He met with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  However, I believe if the Minister for Health was to sign off on this it would be a win-win not only for students but for older people as well because it would help older people with the cost of living.  As we can see everything is going up.  In regard to students, it would also guarantee them a room.  It would not be a full solution but it would go some way towards helping.  We need to ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, if he will sign off on this because the suggestion is with him now.  </p><p>The other issue is the National Transport Authority.  Schools are back and a number of bus routes were removed.  This is following up on Senator Crowe's theme.  The National Transport Authority now needs to put pressure on Bus &Eacute;ireann to restore some of these bus routes because many children are having an issue with getting to school.  I am not even getting into the school passes because I know there was a Commencement matter on that earlier.  It is a serious issue at this stage.  People are having many problems getting children to school.  </p><p>The last issue I wish to raise is the cost of living.  We will have a debate here later on the energy crisis.  We all have to put our shoulders to the wheel in coming up with overall solutions in regard to making things better for all families going forward.</p></speech>

Her Majesty when she visited Ireland won the hearts of the nation of Ireland in a few short words and she is indeed a sad loss.  I ask also that the Government might consider allowing employees to take some time when the funeral of Her Majesty takes place.  It may be something odd to say but our country has grown quite a lot in recent years and I think it would be a decent and honourable thing to do.</p><p>I have spoken on search and rescue services many times in this House.  I am not going into the detail of it today but facts were released in recent days through <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  I have had two Private Members' sessions here and on both occasions the Minister did not do the courtesy of answering the questions I asked.  There is now clearly a <i>prima facie</i>case for a conflict of interest in the establishment of the business case for our next search and rescue service.  The people of Ireland are entitled to know why we are going to be paying somewhere between &euro;1 billion and &euro;1.5 billion for a contract for five helicopters in four bases while our brothers and sisters in the UK are getting 18 helicopters in 12 bases for &euro;1.6 billion.  I ask for time to have the Minister, the senior Minister, in here to discuss this matter and let us see where we are going with it.  </p><p>The Cathaoirleach is aware of the fact that the report on our secretarial assistants' claim came out today.  Quite frankly it is a good deal for those who have just joined the service but for those who have served us for many years it is a terrible deal.  There is about &euro;800 a year, at best, in it before tax for senior secretarial assistants.  I know the Cathaoirleach sits on the commission.  The author of this report clearly failed to understand the job of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and in particular those who work for us within Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  I ask the Cathaoirleach in particular to ask that we go back to the drawing board on this issue.  It is an appalling misunderstanding of the work.  The Cathaoirleach's own secretarial assistant puts in a massive amount of work keeping all of us informed all the time.  We need to better respect those who work for us.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I know that the woman who works for me is often down in my office at 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock at night finalising things for the following day.  I ask all of my colleagues to join with me on this issue and support those who support us because we could not do the job we do without these people.  They are not secretaries or administrators.  They are researchers and they are support people.  I could not operate without Jean in my office and I think that all of the rest of us are the same.  I ask the Cathaoirleach to bring that to the committee and ask the Leader to write a letter to the commission to that effect.</p></speech>

I have spent quite a bit of my time over the past month or so travelling around my constituency of Laois-Offaly meeting people from all walks of life.  Such activity is a central part of our democracy and helps to inform us, as public representatives, about the issues close to the lives of our constituents.  The hardship caused by the continued cost-of-living crisis is clear and this Government is determined to bring forward measures in budget 2023 to support those who are most impacted by the crisis.</p><p>On my travels I visited local producers and entrepreneurs.  To hear their stories and concerns highlights to me that it is now more important than ever to support local businesses.  They are the beating heart of rural Ireland and I shall speak about some of the wonderful examples in counties Laois and Offaly, including the Ferbane Food Campus.</p><p>Ferbane is a community that suffered hundreds of job losses linked to Bord na M&oacute;na restructuring in the 1990s.  The Ferbane Food Campus has enabled and supported 30 local food businesses.  The campus has also trained more than 300 people over the past 20 years.  One such business is Ballyshiel Artisan Foods which produces delicious, chocolate-based products that are made from locally supplied milk.  I had a really interesting chat with Tommy and Karina about the potential to expand into food tourism, which would combine the food that they produce with the local, beautiful bogland landscape.  What a unique tourism offering that will be.</p><p>I welcome the objective of the Ferbane Food Campus to collaborate with local farmers for short supply chains.  This is something that my Department and Food Vision 2030 supports.  I look forward to the day when I will enjoy a food trail where we can discuss the <i>terroir</i>of west Offaly with hints of chocolate and cranberry on the palate.</p><p>Despite the current cost of living we are lucky to see some new businesses opening.  An example is Audrey Kingston who has recently opened a new pharmacy in the centre of Mountrath and I wish her all the best.  Another example is Ballintubbert Gardens and House, which is located near Stradbally.  It is a beacon for the ecotourism sector of the midlands and earlier this year the gardens achieved full organic status.  This week, I was lucky to see the gardens in late summer splendour and so can anyone as the venue is open to the public next Saturday, 18 September.  I can attest to the fact that the gardens are truly a feast for the senses.</p><p>There are other excellent examples of ecotourism.  For example, one can <font color="#2F2F2F">stay at Mount Briscoe, which is near Daingean in County Offaly.  Mount Briscoe Farm has belonged to the same family for seven generations and been organic for over 20 years.  It also offers some traditional and some less traditional sustainable accommodation options.  The farm produces wonderful food, which will be served </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">al fresco</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F"> to some lucky customers on the evening of Tuesday, 20 September.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  I wish to mention the heat-pump and soon to be solar powered outdoor swimming pool in the gorgeous village of Ballinakill, County Laois.  It is another ecotourism attraction.  The village will host the Pride of Place judges on Friday so I wish everyone the very best of luck.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  From Ballinakill to Ballyshiel, Ballintubbert to Mount Briscoe and so many more places that I could mention, these are the hidden gems in the hidden heartlands of Ireland.  With the wonderful entrepreneurial spirit of these enterprises, together with support from relevant State agencies, and Government support for greenways and blueways, these places will not remain hidden for long.</font></p></speech>

In that spirit of reconciliation that was reflected in the exchanges between Martin and Queen Elizabeth, I acknowledge her support for the peace process and, in particular, during her historic visit to Ireland; for her remarks that she wished things had been done differently; for the respect she showed in the Garden of Remembrance when bowing her head to those who died for Ireland's freedom; and for the respect she displayed towards an Ghaeilge, the Irish language.  These are all important moments in our peace and reconciliation processes.  In the past 24 hours, at Hillsborough Castle we have seen even more historic moments develop and take place in the changed, and changing, relationships between Ireland and Britain.  That is to be welcomed and encouraged, and will no doubt continue in the time ahead.</p><p>I want to mention, on a personal level, the passing of a well-known, respected and committed Republican Irish language and women's rights activist, Donncha Mac Niallais.  He was centrally involved in the development of the Irish language in the city of Derry and throughout the county.  He was associated with the Irish language education sectors.  The Alliance for Choice Derry, after Donncha's passing, said this week that he was a committed champion for a woman's right to choose for many years.  He was also a former Republican prisoner and was a dedicated proponent of our peace and political processes.</p><p>I welcome the period of consultation that was carried out by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee on Ireland's constitutional future.  I thank all of those who took the time to make submissions to that initiative.  I look forward to the work of the committee, hearing people's views and engaging with those views across the spectrum, no matter where they fall on the question.</p><p>It is under sad circumstances that the ambassador is here, but in acknowledging this sad occasion I also acknowledge the election of the new British Prime Minister, Liz Truss.  I recognise her appointment and encourage the Irish Government to remain steadfast in ensuring the political relationships between Britain and Ireland are restored and that the Good Friday Agreement must be at the heart of our joint approach.  We must ensure that for all the importance of symbolism, the institutions to which we all give support are back up and running and deliver for all our people.</p></speech>

Evictions are up 55%.  While the housing issue is complex and takes time to address, there is something we can do on an immediate level to try to bring those numbers down.  We know the majority of people entering homelessness come from the private rental sector.  The number of evictions due to landlords selling up is an issue and a problem.</p><p>During the winter months in France, people were not allowed to be evicted into homelessness.  From our perspective, we should look at changing legislation.  The Labour Party has included in our renters' rights Bill that when a landlord is selling a property, which has a tenant is in place, that tenant may stay <i>in situ</i>.  It is the same when it comes to a commercial tenant.  If I were to buy a Brown Thomas building from the current owners or any other building on Grafton Street, the commercial tenants on the lease have the right to stay.  If I do not want them to stay, I would have to buy them out of the lease.  That gives them security of tenure and a right to stay.

That report is now on the Minister's desk.  We know that a potential 100,000 units built over the course of the Celtic tiger from 1991 to 2013 have defects.  I was on a call last night with constituents who are living in an affected building.  They are being told their bill is going to come to at least &euro;68,000.  They are terrified that the fire officer is going to kick them out.  That has already happened to one person in Priory Hall.  We need to move immediately in the budget for a redress scheme for these people who are affected by construction defects.  We must make sure that is retrospective.  These people need certainty.  That work needs to take place as soon as possible.  They are terrified the fire officer will kick them out.  They are terrified that there is no certainty around whether they are going to start the works.  We have established the precedent in the mica scheme and we need to extend that to the 100,000 people who are affected by construction defects.</p></speech>

I also want to be associated with the condolences to Ambassador Johnston and to all in the UK who are in mourning.  It is a very sad day.</p> <p>There are many things which we all know eat away at the peace of mind of ordinary Irish people as winter approaches.  One issue common to almost everyone is the increasingly crippling cost of living.  Energy providers across the Irish market have repeatedly hiked their prices in an extraordinary and extortionate fashion.  Energy companies have cynically invoked the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other geopolitical events to justify these price hikes.  The remarks of the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, about price caps and a windfall tax are very encouraging.  We have yet to see the specifics but I am hopeful and positive that it will be a decisive and meaningful intervention.  That was very welcome today.</p> <p>The cost of living crisis is impacting everyone, but it cannot be said that it is impacting everyone equally.  That is the real concern.  In June, the ESRI published a report indicating that an unprecedented 29% of households are living in energy poverty.  These households spend more than 10% of their net income on energy.  Since the publication of that report there have been a number of vicious price hikes, so the situation is undoubtedly worse now.  In a very low economy such as Ireland, many households at the bottom of the income gradient will be faced with making impossible choices.  How do people choose between keeping their children fed and their house warm?  The impact of inflation and poverty does not only affect low-income households.  It has the potential to wreak widespread economic havoc.  That is what I want to highlight today.  The soaring cost of living erodes even middle-income earners' spending power.  This means that people are less likely to go to restaurants or to the theatre, improve their homes or purchase consumer goods.  This erosion of demand then threatens the viability of businesses that are themselves struggling with high energy costs.  If these businesses close, the resulting job losses only further weaken demand.  The vicious cycle is evident here.</p> <p>Protecting consumer demand, particularly among low- and middle-income households, is essential for the purposes of social justice and effective economic management.  That is why I am asking the Government for bold and ambitious thinking in respect of the recent recommendations of the Low Pay Commission.  The Government is set to accept the commission's recommendation of an 80 cent increase to the minimum wage.  The two members of the commission nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have dissented from this recommendation because it is an insufficient response to inflation.  I ask that the Government institute an increase to the minimum wage above the 80 cent recommendation.  I urge it to do so.  Workers on the minimum wage do some of the most essential and difficult work that keeps our society functioning.  We are failing them badly.  They deserve real security and relief.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Finally, I send my condolences to the families who lost children.

We sadly lost a little girl of eight years of age in County Roscommon as well and we are thinking of her today.  It has been a sad time for many families, particularly when so many children have lost their chance to live, which should not happen.</p> <p>I very much support the comments of Senator Craughwell regarding staff and ensuring our staff are well paid and looked after properly.  My colleagues and I will insist that the staff get a proper deal.  Everybody accepts that.  I refer to Senators' staff in particular.  Each Senator has one member of staff.  They work very hard and, at times, very long hours.  We have to look after them.</p> <p>I think of the campaigners outside the gates of Leinster House today, particularly those campaigning with regard to cystic fibrosis.  I think of the 35 children who need a particular drug.  The matter has not been cleared up.  I know the Taoiseach and the Minister are aware of it and want to do the right thing, and they will, but it is urgent that the drug be made available to those children.  As far as I know, when they get to 12 years of age, they can have the drug.  I met Caoimhe and Fiadh, sisters aged eight and six, respectively, who have Ballinasloe connections and who were outside Leinster House campaigning today.  It was difficult and sad to see them out there.  I appeal to the Leader to use her good offices to ensure that drug is made available to those 35 children.  It is urgent.</p></speech>

It was an excellent event, with three segments; one relating to diversity; another to young people's participation in politics; and another to female participation in politics.  Each of the three segments was of very high quality.  The contributions, the standard of debate and the ideas that were spoken about were excellent.  I propose that we follow up on this in the Seanad by having three separate debates on those specific issues.  In particular, we should debate the issue of diversity and minority groups because that is an area in which we are failing badly.  I commend our colleagues, Senators Warfield and Flynn, on speaking at the event yesterday, along with the other speakers.  In terms of youth, it is shocking that there are only three Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann under the age of 30.  That figure was a lot higher two decades ago.  There is clearly an issue in that regard.  Although gender quotas have worked and we have 40% female representation in this House, there is work to be done in that regard in politics overall, such as at local authority level, and indeed in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  That is something we could debate.   We could consider issuing recommendations to follow up on the good work that was done yesterday.</p> <p>I agree with the remarks of Senator Crowe in respect of transport.  I have spoken regularly on the issue of standardised fares.  In County Clare, there are several different buses serving a route from north Clare to Ennis and they are charging different prices.  We need to standardise it.  It needs to be fair to everybody - urban, rural, within counties and within the country as a whole.</p></speech>

All other eligible children and adults with cystic fibrosis in Ireland have already gained access to Kaftrio with the exception of the 35 children at the centre of this dispute.  Lack of agreement could delay access to Kaftrio for up to five years for some children.  Without Kaftrio, some might not even make it that far.  However, the HSE's corporate pharmaceutical unit and Vertex have tied themselves up in a pricing dispute.  Despite having met multiple times from the start of the year, there has been no meeting between them since 4 July.  That means more than two months of no progress.</p><p>I raised this issue in the Chamber in June and it was raised in the D&aacute;il as a parliamentary question in May.  The response was that talks were ongoing.  We were not told that negotiations would take a primary school summer holiday.  Seeing as how neither the HSE nor the Minister seem to be prioritising their interactions with Vertex, I decided to reach out to it myself.  I spoke on the phone yesterday to its executive country manager who filled me in about the negotiations.  I am sure the families of the children in question would be interested to hear that Vertex actually offered to cover these children at the same cost per patient as in the existing agreement but as this would involve an additional budget commitment by the HSE, it was not quite good enough.  It was not one of the many mantras of Covid along the lines that "we should not be gambling with lives" but apparently haggling is okay.  I met Philip Watt, the CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, outside Leinster House this afternoon.  People with cystic fibrosis do not need more boardroom meetings or margins in an Excel spreadsheet.  They need that medicine and we need to get it for them.  I heard children talking out there today.  I saw families who have lost daughters and daughters who now have children with cystic fibrosis waiting on this drug.  It is criminal that we are not signing this document this week.</p></speech>

I would go further and second the proposal by Senator Craughwell.  I believe we should write to the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and ask that those people in the public sector who want to view the funeral and who deemed her their queen be facilitated.  I ask that the private sector try to facilitate that as well.  I think it is only right given the large steps taken and the leadership shown by her in the past number of years, particularly since the Good Friday Agreement was signed.  At a time when we are talking about sharing this island, it is only right that this be done.</p> <p>I also request that we write to the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, regarding the help-to-buy scheme.  This scheme has helped over 30,000 people buy or build their homes over the past five years.  It has been a vital cog in ensuring that people had enough money along with their deposit to get a family home.  It is a vital scheme for which the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage increased the grant to up to &euro;30,000 in the past couple of years.  It is very important it is retained.  It will reach the end of its life at the end of this year and it is important that a provision is included in the budget to ensure families can get this extra support of &euro;30,000 to buy homes.</p></speech>

I understand that counties are to submit lists by tomorrow with two wastewater projects per county.  I certainly do not wish to detract from the claims of any other counties, all of which also have high demand.  County Galway, however, being the second biggest county, has a huge deficit in wastewater treatment schemes.  It has only approximately 33 wastewater treatment schemes, compared with 93 in counties Tipperary and Donegal and more than 150 in County Cork.  Therefore, a case could be made for counties such as Galway to have more than two of these schemes granted.  We also have two offshore islands with inadequate sewerage schemes, namely, Inis O&iacute;rr, and Inis M&oacute;r, at Cill R&oacute;n&aacute;in.  This is an excellent scheme, with 85% of the funding coming from the Exchequer and 15% from local authorities.  </p><p>A case could be made in this regard.

Therefore, I ask the Leader to engage with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to see whether the number of grants for Galway, and other similar counties, could be increased from two to three or four to allow the backlog in this regard to be cleared.  </p></speech>

The late Queen played a significant role, particularly in 2011, in improving and working with us all in the reconciliation process between ourselves and our closest neighbour.  We all probably have friends and family living in the UK.  I certainly do and I am sure many other people do too.  We have great connections with our closest neighbour and Queen Elizabeth II certainly helped to improve those relations.</p> <p>I welcome everybody back.  It is an important time in our country and we need to be examining the issues affecting us.  Most of them have been addressed.  We have talked about the cost-of-living crisis.  In that context, I would like to see a debate on retrofitting and other ways we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.  Many people would like to undertake retrofitting.  Some do not have the cash, but, equally, there is a shortage of people available to provide these services.  I would like to hear from the Minister how we are ramping up delivery in this area.  Senator Moynihan referred to houses that were badly built from 1991 to 2013, but we all know of much older houses that also have poor insulation.  People want to do this type of work, and not just for their budgets but also to improve their standard of living and the quality of life they experience in their homes.  The problem is the labour is just not there to do this.  </p> <p>I also echo Senator Craughwell's support in the context of the issue concerning secretarial assistants, those who help us in everything we do.  I refer especially to those here in the longer term.  It is, of course, great that the new entrants are having their rates of pay improved, but it is also important that those who have been here longer, and who have shown just how valuable they are, also be recognised for all their contributions.  </p> <p>I mention as well today's State of the Union address by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.  She outlined the potential of windfall taxes and money being available to divert back to all of us, particularly to those most in need.  Reference was also made to the EU's solidarity with Ukraine.  The news coming from there in recent days has been positive.  I am not sure if anyone else has mentioned this point yet.  I refer to supporting the people of Ukraine and their President in all they are doing to try to re-establish control of those territories taken over during the illegal invasion in recent months.  I thank the Leader and wish all of us the best for the next few months.</p></speech>

This is simply because each week and each month the situation continues to get worse.  The figures for July are shocking.  The number of homeless people rose to 10,568, including 3,137 children.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is higher than the previous peak in October 2019.  I have to put it to the Leader that the policies pursued by this Government directly resulted in that increase in homelessness, specifically, the decision to lift the ban on evictions in April of last year.  Since then, homelessness has increased by 25% and child homelessness is up by 43%.  That is the record of this Government since April of last year.  Family homelessness is up by 30%.  </p><p>We are spending half of what we need to on housing.  Those are not my words; those are the words of the Government&rsquo;s own think tank, the ESRI.  We need an immediate ban on evictions.  We need a doubling of investment in housing.  However, perhaps the issue that shows quite how out of touch the Government is is the refusal of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to raise the income thresholds for local authority housing.  An increase has been allowed in just five counties.  In Limerick, the threshold is &euro;30,000 for a single person.  Does anyone on the Government benches think that someone earning more than &euro;30,000 can fund their own housing at this point in time?  They are facing rents of up to &euro;1,500 a month.  They are trapped in the rental market and local authorities are saying that they will not help them.  The threshold is there at &euro;30,000.  The Minister has a report on income thresholds on his desk since last December and he has refused to publish it.  That is a political choice he is making that is trapping hundreds of thousands of working people in this horrific rental market where they are paying ridiculously over the odds and have no prospect of getting out.  These are Government choices.  We need better choices.  I am asking for an urgent debate on this issue.</p></speech>

I express my condolences as well to the Royal Family on the death of Queen Elizabeth II.  I congratulate King Charles III and wish him well.</p> <p>I would also like to be associated with the other expressions of sympathy to the families that have been tragically lost over the past week.  We had one in County Mayo as well.  It was a very sad week for this country. </p> <p>I would like to ask for debate on inland fisheries.  We should invite the Minister with responsibility, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to the House as a matter of urgency.  We do not have a junior Minister for fisheries or inland fisheries, so the full responsibility is with the Minister.  I received information that things are not all what the are supposed to be in relation to Inland Fisheries Ireland and there are issues relating to the board.  The chairman of the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland has resigned and there are problems with staff and employment.  We should have an urgent debate on all those issues in the very near future.</p> <p>Recently, Inland Fisheries Ireland published a report on the western lakes and plans for them.  However, not all of the lakes are included.  For example, the Castlebar lakes in my own area do not seem to be included.  We have had weed cut every year on those lakes.  So far this year, the weed on those lakes is overgrown.  We have had that weed cut every year, but there does not seem to have been any action this year in on weed cutting on those particular lakes.  </p> <p>I would be delighted if the Leader could arrange a debate on inland fisheries as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I have been inundated in County Tipperary with calls from parents whose children have been getting the bus for a number of years and, because of an increased demand, have not been able to get on it this year.  In particular, I refer to the bus route between Drangan and Ballingarry.  My colleague, Councillor Mark Fitzgerald, is dealing with an awful lot of parents there who have still have not gotten any answers.

I know of one person who only needs a seat on a school bus for the journey home on Wednesday afternoons.  On nine of the journeys a week that seat is free.  It is incredibly frustrating for people who genuinely need the bus twice a day five days a week.  Certainly the view out there is that this has happened because of the decisions the Government made.  I am not sure this is entirely true but we need to make sure the issues facing people who are genuinely struggling and have had to make changes to their work or employment over recent weeks, which they did not expect to have to do, can be sorted as quickly as possible.  On the route I am speaking about, Drangan and Ballingarry, the issue is a very simple one.  Kavanagh's bus company has a bus ready to go to bring all of the children.  All we need is for it to be signed off by the Minister.</p></speech>

The issues we faced over the summer, in August in particular, had to do with school transport.  This has been highlighted.  The Government made a commitment to provide free transport for the year.  We have neglected to provide transport for some and this is not acceptable.  From our children at home I am aware of two routes to Moyne Community School and the secondary schools in Ballymahon.  I know of one family where the father drives to Dublin at 6.30 a.m. and the mother drops their children and those of other people from 7 a.m. because they do not have transport.  I know of another family with three children who have no transport to school.  We need a debate on this.  We need to sort out the situation for families.  It is unacceptable that this has happened.</p> <p>I cannot understand why this issue arises every year.  Applications are made in April but payments are not made until the end of July.  Why can this not all be sorted out over the summer?  The same issue arises every year with problems at the start of the school year.  It is not acceptable and somebody has to answer for it.</p> <p>I met a large group of parents from Cystic Fibrosis Ireland outside Leinster House, including someone I know very well.  Jillian McNulty is well known to Senators.  She led the campaign for the drug Orkambi.  I was delighted to see her there.  I was not expecting to see her because she received a kidney transplant only three weeks ago.  She is doing well and in great form.  I was delighted to meet her outside.  She was campaigning for 35 children from throughout Ireland who are not able to receive a life-saving drug called Kaftrio.  This is not acceptable.  Some of the children were there today, as were the parents of other children.  The HSE cannot come to an agreement with the drug company to fund this treatment.  The treatment exists and it is accessible.  Other children receive it but these 35 children do not.  This is not acceptable and I want to highlight it to the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

She made such a stir when she travelled to Ireland in 2011.  It tugged at everyone's heartstrings to see the effort she put into every meeting she attended and speech she gave when she was here.  It built an awful lot of bridges that we need to continue fighting for.</p> <p>I also want to speak about the cystic fibrosis group whose members were outside the gates of Leinster House today and who were mentioned by Senator Carrigy.  There was a young mother there with links to my home town.  Two of her daughters cannot access the drug.  It is a very difficult situation.  From what I understand, the Minister for Health will meet the pharmaceutical company involved on Friday.  This is the notice given to the group.  We would like to see some action taken.  The negotiations on it are difficult.</p> <p>I acknowledge the funding that has come through CL&Aacute;R, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, and her Department.  Yesterday, a second tranche of funding was announced.  This includes more than 15 projects in County Galway and 12 projects in County Roscommon.  Funding through CL&Aacute;R for towns and villages has increased from &euro;5 million to &euro;7.5 million, which means a large number of groups and communities will benefit.  Many people received positive news yesterday and I hope we will see more rounds of CL&Aacute;R funding in the future.  It is all thanks to the Our Rural Future policy driven by the Government and Fine Gael.</p></speech>

It is marvellous to be back in here again.  I hope everyone, Members and staff alike, had a pleasant summer.</p> <p>I rise to continue with the topic I raised in the House just before we finished for the summer, that is, animal welfare in Dublin Zoo.  Dublin Zoo responded via the media to the statement I made then to call for "an independent investigation into these allegations" and that seems right and proper, but what did the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage do?  That Department oversees the zoo by the way, not that one would have known that over the summer when I and my office were being bounced from Department to Department.  No-one seemed to have a clue who was in charge and it was certainly a lesson for bright-eyed and bushy-tailed me.  I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to figure out who was responsible for the zoo.  It was, by all accounts, the mystery of the summer.  I am thankful the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage realised the error of its ways and that it was the body that had responsibility for the zoo and had the protected disclosure.</p> <p>Colour me surprised when I learned, once again via the media, that the Department's own body for parks and wildlife would be investigating the claims made in the protected disclosure.  I fail to see how it is possible for the same body that routinely inspects the zoo to now be charged with investigating the allegations of animal mistreatment.  The allegations in that protected disclosure - more of which I will be raising in the coming weeks - should be properly and independently investigated and I do not understand how a body that was already overseeing the zoo can be charged with looking at things again.  It is investigating its own investigations and that is ridiculous.</p> <p>I have spoken to some of the staff of Dublin Zoo who were interviewed as part of this investigation.  They told me they felt very intimidated.  Another staff member was told they could not count when it came to issues of missing or indeed additional animals.  The investigators also told staff they were there to investigate animal welfare and not issues of management or human resources.  Let me assure Members that issues of human resourcing and management were covered in the protected disclosure.  I am now not entirely sure what body is responsible for that.  Will I be sent on yet another wild goose chase from Department to Department until the Minister eventually cottons on that these things fall under the Department's remit?  To add insult to injury, there are no transcripts or recordings available of those interviews, despite interviewees making requests for their own data.</p> <p>I had hoped I would come back here with news these concerns were dealt with and that a robust, open and fair investigation had taken place.  However, I think I was overly ambitious and I do not have faith in the investigation.  The staff I spoke to do not either.  It seems to me there is going to be a whitewash to try to silence and cover up the allegations disclosed to me and shared with the Minister responsible.  We owe more to the animals in the zoo, the public and the staff, and as politicians we owe more to our own public, than to stand over this ridiculous investigation and silencing of brave staff who are coming forward to raise real, genuine concerns for the animals because they know and believe Dublin Zoo can and should be the best zoo in Europe.  I am immensely disappointed and can only try to relay the frustration, fear and disappointment on behalf of the staff who have come forward and spoken to me about this investigation and how things are happening.  I assure everyone here I will not be letting this go.</p></speech>

What we saw this afternoon was a real, passionate cry for help in so many ways.  The 35 kids who are waiting for this drug are stuck in limbo as they wait for the negotiations next Friday between the Department and the drug company.  Accordingly, I suggest to the Leader that we might write to the Minister to say the matter was raised.  Perhaps we should put on the schedule that the Minister should come in and speak about the issues regarding CF.  It is a real issue in so many ways for these poor families who are caught in limbo.</p> <p>The other issue I wish to raise is the report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare that was published recently.  This a huge issue, especially the recommendations on inheritance tax and how that is going to affect people.  There is an expectation out there that there are going to be huge changes.  The changes will have a huge impact on society if they happen and a debate in this House would be appropriate.  There will definitely be different views in the House but if we look at it from the agricultural point of view, these people are just making a living.  If they must pay capital gains tax on land transferred from a farmer to his or her son or daughter at the percentage being talked about, it would mean the entity itself would be unviable.  Therefore, we will have to be very conscious of what we are talking about and the real knock-on effect it will have for rural Ireland.  We have a huge issue at the moment with the age profile of farmers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we are to implement this measure, the age profile will only go one way for the obvious reason that farmers will not be able to afford to transfer their land.

We need to allay fears and make sure we get the right message out there, particularly when it comes to that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1653" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#FF00300"><p>I thank colleagues for raising the various topics today.  Senator Lombard requested a debate on the taxation and welfare report.  I suggest we would have to allocate a hell of a lot more than the normal 90 minutes to that particular report.  I note the large amount of sensationalist reporting and scaremongering in recent weeks, maybe to fill the pages of our newspapers because there was not much else to fill them with.  I will be pleased to arrange a debate.  I am even more pleased that the Taoiseach announced yesterday that the kite flown by a newspaper with regard to inheritance tax is not one that will be considered in the budget negotiations over the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>Senators Lombard, Dolan and Carrigy, and Senator Keogan who led on the matter today, raised the issue of the 35 supporters of children who are outside the gates of Leinster House this afternoon.  It is fair to say that we all support the people who are waiting on this drug, Kaftrio.  We know the life-changing impact it has had from the previous campaigns by parents of children aged over 12 who were provided with the drug some years ago.  When the negotiations were held between the HSE and the company that makes the drug in 2017, the drug had not then been verified for use by children under the age of 12.  Therefore, even at that stage we could not have included children under 12.  I totally appreciate that and that is why they were not included then.  However, we now know the benefits the drug would provide for the 35 children whose parents were outside the gate today.  They come from all parts of the country.  It is a crime that we have been farting around since 4 July talking about how much we are going to pay when an offer has been made to provide the drug at exactly the same price that is paid for children over the age of 12.  I am embarrassed to have to say that I will write today to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, not just expressing the Seanad's wish to have this matter sorted out but, on behalf of Senators, seeking a meeting with the Minister and the Taoiseach.  There are some instances and issues that are above and beyond politics and this is one of them.  I thank colleagues for raising this matter.</p> <p>I wish Senator Hoey well in her investigations and her representations on what is clearly a distressing issue for the staff of Dublin Zoo related to the welfare of the animals there.  When a protected disclosure is made to a Minister or Department it is incumbent on them, under the legislation as written, to carry out an investigation.  It seems bizarre that those doing the investigation are investigating themselves.  I wish Senator Hoey well with this matter and I hope she will not be given the run-around in future.</p> <p>Senators Carrigy and Ahearn requested a debate on school transport.  The initiative, which seemed to be wonderful when it was announced, has clearly had unintended consequences because thousands of children who were able to get a school bus last year cannot get school transport this year.  Saying we have issued 125,000 tickets this year whereas we only had 102,000 tickets last year does not herald this as the success we would like to think it is.  We have a kind of Groundhog Day every single year when school transport issues arise and everybody raises them.  It is the same issue every single year.  This year, we have added fuel to the fire and we certainly cannot wait any longer.  The Minister was in the Chamber earlier taking a Commencement matter with a number of colleagues.  I will ask for a debate because this issue needs to be resolved sooner rather than later. </p> <p>Senator Burke requested a debate on inland fisheries which I will facilitate.  Senator Gavan requested a debate on housing which I will also facilitate.  Senator Horkan requested a debate on retrofitting and the shortages of labour that seem to be stalling these projects, and I will facilitate that.  Senator Kyne asked me to engage with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, regarding the level of funding for water treatment facilities around the country.  It seems bizarre that a county as large as Galway only has 33 such facilities.  While Tipperary is a large county, the difference - 33 facilities versus 99 - does not correspond to the size of those two counties.  I will engage with the Minister on the matter.</p> <p>Senator Blaney asked me to write to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, urging him to continue the help-to-buy scheme, which has been a success for all of those who have managed to get their tax back and help pay towards their houses.  I will be happy to do that.  </p> <p>Senator Conway requested debates on the three topics that were central to the debate at a symposium in Dublin Castle yesterday.  Again, I will try to facilitate that.</p> <p>Senator Murphy, among other colleagues, raised the secretarial assistant contract negotiations and the recommendations issued to all of us this morning.  An invitation has been made to every one of us to respond to the recommendations.  As mooted today, some elements are welcome while others are clearly not welcome.  I encourage all Senators to make their views known and make representations on behalf of their staff.</p> <p>Senator Black asked us to be bold and ambitious with regard to the increase in the minimum wage.  This will be the tenth increase in the past ten years, which is welcome.  I fully understand and appreciate that certain bodies do not feel the increase will cover the cost of living.  I will certainly relay that view on the Senator's behalf.</p> <p>Senator Moynihan asked for the construction defects report on 100,000 homes.  They are homes.  Sometimes reports describe them as "units" but people live in houses or homes, not units.  These are real people's lives.  They have been living in stress and fear for far too long.  I will write to the Minister asking for a resolution or at least a response to the report he has had for many months now.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke very eloquently about the response to the Queen passing.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, spoke this morning about food producers in counties Laois and Offaly.  Senator Craughwell asked us all to write a letter to the commission regarding secretarial assistants.  He also sought a debate on a conflict of interest that has been uncovered.  In fairness to the Senator, as we are all aware, he protests in the House week in and week out about not getting answers.  Finally, during the summer, he did get answers and they were not pleasant.  I will seek a debate with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, with regard to the search and rescue, SAR, tender and the business case.  </p> <p>Senator Byrne highlighted the student accommodation issue at the University of Limerick and Mary Immaculate College and asked me to check with the Minister for Health with regard to the effect on medical cards, which I will certainly do today.</p> <p>Senator Crowe stated that is unacceptable in 2022 that Bus &Eacute;ireann does not take card or phone payments.  Cash is no longer the only acceptable payment method and he asked that the company be brought out of the dark ages.  I will certainly raise that matter with the Minister for Transport</p></speech>

It is great to be here and starting Seanad Private Members' business on a very important issue.  All of a sudden, it seems that energy is the cornerstone of everything in the economy and society in terms of how we survive but, in reality, that has always been the way.  It is the fuel that feeds us, drives us, heats us and it has always been central to how an economy or society functions.  Sadly, it is now a weapon of war.  The crisis has also made energy a threat to our democracy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Fianna F&aacute;il has tabled this motion, which draws particular attention to the increase in rising prices due to inflationary pressure on the price of energy driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the unprecedented challenges faced by households and businesses.  We must ensure that people are supported and protected in the face of the rising cost of living.  We must protect those most vulnerable in society.  Budget 2023 must be a cost-of-living budget that should contribute to helping every household and business in the country.</p><p>As we all know, energy poverty impacts hundreds of thousands of families and individuals every day in Ireland, yet, at the same time, hundreds of millions of euro of clean energy is being dumped as well.  The recent ESRI report on energy poverty and deprivation in Ireland warns that up to 43% of households are at risk of energy poverty.  The motion specifically calls on Government to ensure to the greatest possible extent that measures are focused on those who need them most such as vulnerable households, carers, persons with disabilities, pensioners and the many thousands of families who can be described as the working poor or the squeezed middle.  We must provide specific and targeted financial supports to households and businesses to help with the soaring cost of energy prices and prevent job losses.  We must proactively engage with energy companies to address the rising energy prices for households and prioritise the development of renewable energy infrastructure, including expediting planning decisions for infrastructure.  This is an emergency.  Let us not waste this emergency to do something positive for our people, our climate and our economy.  Indeed, all of us are acutely aware of the impact of rising energy prices on households.  These households are our friends, neighbours and parents.</p><p>It must be highlighted that the Government has taken action throughout 2022.  The electricity cost credit of &euro;176, excluding VAT, was applied to 2.1 million households.  This was a &euro;377 million measure on top of a range of measures introduced in February to tackle the rising cost of living, including the lump sum of &euro;125 for people in receipt of fuel allowance.  People received a fuel allowance payment of &euro;1,139 this year compared to &euro;735 in 2020-21.  The Government also ramped up the very welcome home retrofit supports for households.  Month by month delivery of free energy upgrades for households at risk of energy poverty have doubled in the past year.  This is an achievement and must be recognised.  Unfortunately, as we all know, and this is why we are speaking here this evening, these increases and good supports will just not be enough at the minute because of the external costs and the energy crisis.  I believe there is a need for a new short-term fuel assistance payment for struggling working families who do not qualify for fuel allowance.  Families just will not be able to pay their bills.</p><p>I was very glad earlier that Ms Ursula von der Leyen outlined in her state of the Union address to the European Parliament that the European Commission is proposing a cap on revenues of companies that produce electricity at a low cost.  These companies are making revenues they never accounted for and never even dreamt of.  In a time of such crisis, it is immoral to make such profits on the backs of struggling citizens.  In these times, profits must be shared and channelled to those who need them most.  We will provide those direct supports to our citizens and businesses and we will take money off those energy companies that are making unjustified gains.  There is no other solution and we must do that.</p><p>I read that senior Government officials said they are awaiting further details on that European Commission announcement and how much Ireland could expect from those new revenue raising plans.  This is welcome news.  I am sure it will cushion the blow to the Exchequer of the energy crisis.  The emergency levy that will be placed on oil, gas and coal firms alongside the separate measure to cap revenues from renewable electricity generators at less than half the current market price is good news for Ireland.  Ireland has the second highest share of wind in its electricity mix with 31% in 2021.  Only Denmark is ahead of us at 44%.  It shows that we are one of the top two European countries producing wind energy.  As has been said previously, a lot has been done but there is a lot more to do.  It shows the capacity, however.  We are at too low of a level at the minute but it shows the capacity of what this State can do in creating wind energy and sustainable clean energy.  That is something to be relished.</p><p>I have told the Minister on several occasions that we must work within our own resources to ease the burden on vulnerable homes.  We should utilise some of the wasted energy to tackle energy poverty while helping Ireland meet its climate targets.  We must ask EirGrid, ESB Networks and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to work with the Government and Minister and immediately publish a strategy to utilise as much of that wasted energy as possible as we curtail a colossal amount of energy in this in this country.  Some &euro;400 million worth of energy was curtailed when the turbines were turned off.  We need a way to harness that energy when supply needs are low to create a place for that curtailment to go.  We must commence a dedicated programme of work targeted at those who are in or most at risk of energy poverty, seek to reduce the amount of renewable energy wasted in 2023, create targets and mandate the companies to make sure they are reducing wastage.  We all know that waste of energy at this minute is a greater sin than it ever has been.  We should not waste clean green energy.  We must find collective solutions and put mechanisms in place to divert that surplus renewable energy into Irish homes that are experiencing or at risk of fuel property.</p><p>One way I outlined to the Minister previously, which I introduced in the Seanad as a Commencement matter few months ago, is EnergyCloud - a not-for-profit way of managing how we can use that wasted energy and put it back into people&rsquo;s homes.  By installing a small bit of infrastructure in someone's hot water tank, he or she can wake up in the morning and the hot water tank will be warm for that home.  We can identify the vulnerable households easily.  We can install that technology in people&rsquo;s homes easily and EirGrid can press a switch and direct that wind energy to those vulnerable homes.  It is not the whole solution; it is part of the solution.  It will create the impetus to make sure wind energy companies are not wasting any energy.</p><p>We have much work to do.  We need to be ambitious for our renewables.  I am so ambitious for what we can do in this country.  We can be an energy superpower on the west coast on the periphery of Europe and use our natural resources.  Our natural resources are free and thankfully, they are available every day.  We need to use them.</p><p>Going back to our motion, however, budget 2023 needs to be a cost-of-living budget.  It must be targeted to help people, keep people in businesses and keep them warm in their homes.</p></speech>

Like all my colleagues and the Minister and his officials, we now recognise that we have a serious crisis on our hands.  All of us politicians must give hope to the Irish people now.  We do not need to frighten and upset them.  We need to tell them we will get them through this.  I ask that everybody works together, even if we disagree on some issues.  I know the Opposition will have different views on different issues.   However, we need to get people through the next six months in particular.  That is the one plea I would make.</p> <p>Following up on what my colleague, Senator McGreehan said, a number of weeks ago, I highlighted in the local press in my area in the west and the midlands quite a number of family-run supermarkets, in particular, whose energy bills have gone from &euro;8,000 and &euro;9,000 to &euro;15,000 and &euro;16,000.  I was shown one bill yesterday when I met retailers in a local town in east Galway that had risen to &euro;24,000.  In general, if that were to last for a year it means those types of family businesses and supermarkets would be spending up to &euro;250,000 on one expense.  I do not care what type of turnover a person has in a small business, that is not sustainable.  Some domestic users also contacted me whose bills have gone from &euro;350 or &euro;360 up to &euro;700.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That increase took place over the two-month period from 28 June to 26 August.  Admittedly, that family has looked at the usage of electricity in their home.  They have showers and a pump for their water and that is a big user of electricity.  I accept that we can all make some savings and be more efficient in how we use electricity but we have to try to keep the lights on and keep industry going.  I welcome the fact that a package is being readied for domestic users and businesses because there is no doubt that it is much needed.</p><p>Like Senator McGreehan, I want clean energy.  We want to get away from fossil fuels but we have to be careful.  I refer to the great work being done here but even Alliance 90/The Greens in Germany see that they have to stall the digger for a little while to ensure they keep the lights on there and keep the energy coming.  We cannot walk ourselves into darkness.  We must use every opportunity available to us to keep those lights on, while having the debate about people being more efficient.  I agree with the Minister about lights in public buildings.  All of that is important because in some regards we have become careless about the way we use electricity.  It often amazes me that we do not always turn off the lights when we leave our offices.  At the same time, we need to bring our people with us.  We need the wind to blow these weeks and it is not blowing greatly.  It is beautiful weather but we need the wind to blow to generate electricity to get us over this.</p><p>We cannot shy away from having a reserve of gas.  If we need to have a reserve of gas in our country, then we need it.  This is the reality of keeping life, people and business going.  We cannot shut the country down.  This is the Government's responsibility.  It will be addressed properly.  It is the Government's responsibility to use every common-sense avenue open to it to ensure we have that power.  I go back to Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations.  I agree that fossil fuels are expensive and hard to run.  The Government has pumped money into our area and that is gradually getting through, but we should get somebody to investigate Lanesborough and Shannonbridge power stations to see if we could reactivate them in some way.  Maybe there is some fuel we could burn in them.  Why not get somebody working on that straight away?  It may only have been a small percentage that was being generated in those two power stations - in fact, it was very small - but every extra percentage of power we have is important to us.  Maybe all these things are going through the Minister&rsquo;s mind as he considers what we should do.  I ask him not to go back to fossil fuels but to see if there is some use we can make of these stations in the short term, particularly Lanesborough because that was quite a new station.  I accept that it will not happen overnight.  We could even have the reserve there.  If we look at something and get some experts in, we could do something with some other type of fuel.  Crops can be grown.  It is possible and it can be used.  Perhaps hydro energy can be used.  There are opportunities and possibilities out there.</p><p>By the way, I accept that we should continue the progress of clean energy as much as we can.  I am a fan of wind energy and it can work.  We need to get energy generation at sea working.  When energy generation takes place inland, we need to be careful that we do not upset people too much.  We have been waiting for regulations for a long time to ensure wind turbines are more than 500 m from any person's house.  That has not changed.  It has been going on for years and it needs to change.  There is a general acceptance of wind power, and it can work, but maybe we put the cart before the horse in some ways.  Maybe we should not have slammed the brakes on some of the power stations we had before we got all these things up and running.  Having said that, it is important to have our own supply and our eyes are open to that now.  We must ensure we do not have to rely on somebody else for it; that is the road to go down.</p><p>In the short term, I urge the Minister to ensure that we do everything to keep the lights on and that there is a package for domestic users, retailers and businesses in general to help them out.  We cannot allow a massive recession to come out of this and that could easily happen.  I thank the Minister for listening to me.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.117" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#LL00300"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I fully accept the anxiety expressed by Senator McGreehan about the short-term consequences for many people in this country, particularly for small businesses, arising out of the massive increase in energy prices.  These increases are right across the board, from shopkeepers and hoteliers whose electricity bills have shot up to restaurants, small traders and small manufacturing businesses.  They are extremely vulnerable.  I know the Government is proposing to bring in a suite of measures to address that issue but it is a serious economic threat in the short term.  I accept that between now and the end of March of next year, there is a serious threat to many Irish small and medium enterprises and consequently to jobs.</p> <p>Like the Minister, I do not think this energy crisis is something that will just blow over some time in March of next year.  It is greatly to be hoped that that will happen, but the Minister said this is like the oil crisis of the 1970s.  I am of the view that we have to plan for the next five to ten years in a way which consolidates Ireland&rsquo;s economic interests.  The first duty of a Government is to ensure the economy keeps functioning.  At the moment, 52% of our electricity consumption is gas-generated and more than 70% of that comes through two interconnectors which converge on the Moffat interconnector in Scotland.  That is a serious thing because if anything went wrong there, this country would simply be blacked out and we would fall on our knees economically.  We are extremely vulnerable, therefore.  Now that the UK has left the EU, it is not bound by the energy sharing equality arrangements that applied before.  I do not believe that because of the Single Market in Ireland, the UK will put the boot into us with regard to gas supply.  It is probably the case that if nothing goes wrong, there will be an adequate supply from Norwegian waters and the North Sea gas reserves.</p> <p>That is probably the case but we have nothing to be complacent about.  Our native gas fields are rapidly depleting.  The Corrib gas field will be gone in a number of years and even though there is potential for its further expansion, the Minister is not speaking publicly in favour of that.  The Minister has said that the Barryroe field is in deep water but it is not; it is only 100 m deep.  That is potentially one of the largest hydrocarbon fields as yet unexplored in Europe.  I do not accept the proposition that it should not be explored.  I accept the proposition enunciated by the Minister in 2007 that we should maximise exploration in order, as far as we can, to have a degree of energy security.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the Ballylongford LNG proposal, I am not particularly tied to LNG coming from one part of the world or other.  It does not matter to me whether it comes from the Gulf, Texas or wherever.  I just want to be sure that we have adequate storage facilities in this country.  The Minister has indicated that he expects to get the report of a study on our options in the matter in the near future.  While that is welcome, that work should have been done a long time ago.  He has said that batteries is one option and gas storage is another.  We need gas storage.  In one shape or another we will be dependent on gas reserves from somewhere for the next 30 years.  On any view, we must develop our own gas storage facilities.</p><p>The Minister has melted his position slightly.  Although he is still against Ballylongford, he is now saying that if there is to be gas storage, it will be under Government management.  Is it to be under Government management and what does that mean?  I am not particularly worried who manages our storage, but who will build it?  Will the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications build it if the Minister succeeds in persuading An Bord Plean&aacute;la to refuse permission for the present proposals for Ballylongford?  These kinds of issues are really important.</p><p>This is the basic point.  We, as a country, want to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, but we do not want over the next three, five or eight years to be in a crisis that causes major problems for the country.  We do not want to be vulnerable to shortages for whatever reason arising in the North Sea or the Norwegian gas fields if we can avoid it.  Therefore, LNG importation is a good idea and, as Senator Murphy said, the Minister should now embrace the idea of gas storage to ensure as far as possible we do not have blackouts and brownouts.  I fully accept, as the Minister has said on a number of occasions, that we need to alter our energy consumption patterns.  Doubtless, the increase in prices will have that effect no matter what.  However, it is not simply a matter of just turning down the thermostats or taking shorter showers if our industry and small enterprises end up buckling under this crisis, which may last for years.  The responsibility for failing to deal adequately with that scenario lies with the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.119" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1666" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#MM00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the Chamber.  I think the last time we met was at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action in Leinster House.  I am not a member of the committee, but I took the opportunity to attend so that I could be briefed on this important issue.  We had four hours of debate that day.  This debate is still ongoing and we still need clarity on many issues.  Obviously, what the consumer will pay will be addressed in the budget.  Businesses also need to be included in that.  For small shops, such as a Centra, the cost of electricity and other power has gone from maybe 15 cent or 16 cent per kWh and is heading towards 50 cent per kWh at the moment.  That is a significant burden, which will be passed on.  We need to debate how we deal with that at the primary level as part of the budget.  I hope the budget will introduce measures for everyone in that regard.</p> <p>I am always concerned about people in one section of society - widowers.  When their partners die, they lose &euro;250.  While they get the living alone allowance of &euro;20, they still must heat their house and have the same living costs.  They are down at just over &euro;200 a week.  They probably do not have the ability to earn that anywhere.  In the budget we need to ensure that section of society is energy security-proofed when it comes to the cost of heating their houses.  Some of these houses have been heated by solid fuel and there will be a major change there.  I wonder if they will have the interest, ability and energy to go through that process.  I ask the Minister to take into consideration how we might deal with that group.</p> <p>I wish to speak about Ireland's potential.  Ballylongford is quite far away from Cork.  There is a proposal relating to a gas main from the old Kinsale gas field.  During the summer it was spectacular to see the enormous cranes take up the platform over three days.  That pipeline infrastructure is still there.  Is there potential to have a floating LNG terminal in the harbour?  We have the pipeline and we have the infrastructure at Aghada.  People have talked about the ability for us to become part of the solution with a floating LNG terminal in Cork Harbour.  It would provide a short-term solution to that problem.  We may then see the gas field used for a carbon-capture project in the future.</p> <p>I have previously asked about the potential for anaerobic digestion.  Anaerobic digestion is a significant tool that is underused in the State.  We have 12 active anaerobic digesters.  Northern Ireland has approximately 74.  Our policy regarding these has been totally underutilised.  We need to find a mechanism to allow anaerobic digestion to be used.  During the summer I had the privilege to visit one of these.  They told me it took them six and a half years to get planning permission.  Some 1.5 labour units per year are spent on the compliance work relating to these entities.</p> <p>The co-operative movement needs to play a role in the roll-out of anaerobic digestion.  It has been successful in other parts of the agricultural industry.  Government needs to get all the actors together to ensure we can deliver a network of anaerobic digestion throughout the country.  That would be welcome by everyone in rural areas.  Throughout the agricultural industry and commercial industry there is potential to join all the dots for the benefit of society.</p> <p>I am concerned over the potential for amber alerts and how we might deal with them.  I have listened to the regulator, representatives of EirGrid and everyone else regarding the key issues with energy generation.  They spoke about of having a special tariff between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. in the hope that industry and households might change their approach.  However, we milk cows between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  We cannot milk them at 2 p.m. or midnight.  It would be totally inappropriate to apply a special tariff to 6,500 dairy farmers between 5 and 7 every evening.</p> <p>During the hearings I attended in Leinster House a few weeks ago, it became obvious that the regulator never even considered it.  I ask the Minister to intervene personally to ensure that people milking cows are not caught by a tariff increase of 12.5%.  Otherwise, there will be lads and ladies working at midnight to milk cows or else milking cows at 2 p.m.  There is a practical solution that the Minister needs to address.  I ask him to consider the issue.  It affects 6,500 farm families and would mean another surcharge on an already expensive electricity cost.</p> <p>It has got to the point that farmers are now investing in generators because they think it might be the cheaper option for evening milking.  I do not think that is appropriate.  Unless we get direction, we will have this cohort of society who cannot change their processes and workload working at midnight.  I ask the Minister to look into that issue personally.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Of course, the real issue will be the price we pay for energy.  The approach the Minister has been taking, if I read the media correctly, of helping out through the budget with two or three extra payments, is the appropriate way forward.  That is a real, welcome initiative that, it is to be hoped, the budget will deliver on.  I sincerely thank the Minister for listening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-09-14a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022091400002#NN00200"><p>The Minister is welcome.  I thank the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators for tabling this important motion.  When it comes to energy, we need to do three things.  One of the most important of those in some ways, and the most immediately important for the people of Ireland, is to deal with the issue of cost.  We must be very clear with people that the cost of energy is not related to energy security.  Those two issues have to be decoupled when we discuss the motion and the matters raised by Senator McDowell, which I will come back to.  The third important issue is the climate crisis, which is not going away.  We have to follow the climate action plan because the things we do to address the climate crisis are the things that can help us with the other two issues, namely, bringing down the cost for everyone - not immediately, which is why we will put a whole suite of measures in place in this budget and have in fact done so over the past year to the tune of &euro;2.4 billion - and, critically, the issue of energy security.</p> <p>I am not trying to target Senator McDowell on this, but he happened to speak not long before me.  There is no point in talking about where energy security was 15 years ago.  When Wind Energy Ireland representatives appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, they spoke about how offshore, floating, renewable energy was pie in the sky 18 months previously.  It was just an idea and a notion.  It was not something they could see being delivered as quickly as it can be now.  Likewise, hydrogen is something we are now talking about and seeing delivery of.  Aberdeen has a hydrogen hub that is being used for services there.  It is quite correct that we should put investment into sustainable energy and a secure energy future.  Gas and fossil fuels are not that.  The 80 GW off the coast of Ireland are what is secure.  We know that any amount of exploration off the coast has found relatively small pockets of fossil fuels.  We can choose to keep on going down that same trajectory, enforcing on the Irish people a lack of energy security and rising prices, or we can choose to continue with the plan, which has already in the term of this Government seen 3 GW contracted for offshore renewable energy.  That is what will bring us out of this.  It is very important to point that out to people.</p> <p>I note the amendment tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is important to point out that the plan it refers to is about putting a price cap on energy prices, but it does not deal with the cost of energy.  One way or the other the Irish people will pay, whether it is through their bills or debt, which the UK is looking down the barrel of.  Sinn F&eacute;in's plan is a bailout of energy giants.  It puts money in the pockets of fossil fuel elites in Russia and right around the globe because an energy cap will guarantee energy company customers will only have to pay a certain amount, those companies can charge what they want and we will just keep on shovelling money into them.  The approach we take is that we will support the most vulnerable, that we will also provide support universally for everyone because everybody is suffering right now and, crucially, that we will work within the European Union.  It is important to do that to ensure we have what people here call a windfall tax but ensures we take money from the energy companies and put that money back into countries so they can support their people.  That is the honest way to do it to get the people and the companies who are making the most to pay for it.  When it comes down to price caps, those with larger houses, the richest people in the country, are the ones who will benefit more than the poorest.  This is why I agree with Fianna F&aacute;il Senators that we ensure to the greatest extent possible that measures are focused on those who need them most.</p> <p>Let us look at what we have done since January and since the previous budget.  This includes: a fuel allowance increase of more than 50%, or &euro;1,139 compared to &euro;735 in the previous year; an emergency electricity credit and if reports are to be believed, we will now see several more of those credits; an excise duty reduction; a VAT reduction to 9% on all electricity and gas bills from May until October; a working family payment increase of &euro;10 in the previous budget; back to school clothing and footwear allowances; and a 20% reduction in public transport fees and a 50% reduction in those fees for young people.  These are measures that are targeted and that matter to people.  Let us do more of that.  Let us not talk about giving money to companies that are profiting.  The other point, and this is where the two issues cross over, is the more and the longer we give money to these companies and fossil fuel elites around the globe, the longer we will see fossil fuel companies instead of seeing investment in renewables, which is the only thing that will ultimately lead us out of this.</p> <p>I ask Sinn F&eacute;in to look again at this incredibly flawed policy.  I hope it is just a flaw and not just populist because we have to be honest with people.  These are difficult times.  We are in the middle of a war.  That war is what is creating these price hikes for people.  We are asking people to play into the hands of Putin by speaking about an energy cap as if that is the way out; it is not.  It is leading to more problems for Ukraine and Ireland.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate that.</p> <p>I thank Senators for raising these important matters and allowing us time to discuss them today.  Clearly, the current situation where we are witnessing significant increases in energy bills and the cost of living is a matter of real and serious concern.  The Government is keenly aware of the growing pressures this is placing on families and businesses.  As Senators will be aware, in recognition of this situation, we have already put some &euro;2.4 billion in place as part of a package of support policies and measures to help our people in this difficult time over the past year.  The increased cost of energy is an issue that is affecting not just Ireland but all European states.  Increased international gas prices as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have experienced a serious knock-on effect in the market.</p> <p>In speaking to the motion, I will deal with substantive issues of Government policy and household supports for energy costs.  First, I will set out the global market developments that have affected Irish energy prices.  I will then set out the functions of the independent regulator, the CRU, in respect of these matters, including its highly relevant activities in consumer protection and monitoring competition.  Finally, I will outline Government policy and what we are doing in providing significant assistance for households' energy costs, both in terms of energy efficiency and welfare supports.</p> <p>First, it is important that I outline what has been happening to prices in the market.  I want to clarify that the energy price increases we have seen are not Government, or even regulatory, decisions and are not due to Government or regulatory decisions.  Price regulation of the energy market ended many years ago.  Suppliers compete with each other and set their own prices accordingly, as is to be expected in a competitive, commercial and liberalised market.  Increases in wholesale energy prices, following rises in international gas prices, have been the principal driver of these increases.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eamon Ryan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->International wholesale gas prices began to rise in 2020 and unprecedented increases have continued as a result of the volatility in the international gas market driven by the ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war.  These gas increases feed directly through to retail electricity prices because the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.  As this is a European-wide phenomenon, an extraordinary meeting of the EU Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council was held on 9 September in Brussels.  The purpose of this meeting was to address the extraordinary situation of energy prices in the EU, and to agree to advance work on possible emergency measures to mitigate the impact of higher prices on consumers and support demand reduction for gas and electricity to strengthen the EU's winter preparedness.  Following the meeting, ministers invited the Commission, by late September, to propose additional potential measures, including capping the revenues of inframarginal electricity producers with low costs of production such as renewables like hydro, nuclear, biomass and wind, and to propose emergency and temporary interventions, including a wholesale gas price cap.  These are very important developments.  At that meeting, I worked very closely with my European counterparts, and I will do so again over the coming weeks.</p><p>I will turn to the role of the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in these matters.  Senators will be aware that CRU, which is the independent energy regulator, has a wide range of economic and customer protection responsibilities.  As part of its statutory role, CRU has consumer protection functions and monitors energy retail markets to ensure competition benefits the consumer.  CRU also overseas non-price aspects of competition.  It has taken, and continues to take, steps to increase transparency and consumer engagement in retail markets.  This includes, for example, developing various codes of practice that set out customers' rights.  These can be found in the suppliers' handbook.  Additionally, CRU can certify price comparison websites.  It leads the roll-out of smart metering and participates in initiatives like the supplier-led voluntary Energy Engage Code, which is where suppliers will not disconnect a customer who engages with them.</p><p>In August, following Government-enacted legislation that allows a negative public service obligation, PSO, levy, CRU published the annual PSO levy decision paper that outlined an annual saving of &euro;89.10 per year for household electricity bills from 1 October.  This will be reflected in bills as soon as possible within the 2022-23 PSO period.  In August, following engagement with customer representative groups, energy suppliers and network operators, CRU announced enhanced consumer protection measures.  They include an extension to moratoriums on disconnections, extended debt repayment periods, reduced debt burden on pay-as-you-go top-ups, better value for those on financial hardship meters and the promotion of a vulnerable customer register.  In terms of Government policy, the best long-term approach for Ireland is to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets by investing in energy-efficiency and renewable energy, expanding interconnection with European and neighbouring markets and deepening the internal market in energy.  Increased market integration, as noted by the EU agency of energy regulators, has introduced significant benefits for customers, including cheaper electricity.</p><p>The renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, has already begun delivering sustainable and cost-effective indigenous renewable electricity projects, as recommended by Senator Pauline O'Reilly.  Projects under the first RESS auction, RESS 1, are expected to contribute an increase of approximately 15% in our renewable energy generation capacity by the end of next year.  Projects under RESS 2 are expected to deliver an additional increase of nearly 20% to our renewable energy generation by the end of 2025.  The nature of RESS auctions means that renewable generators partaking in them pay back to electricity customers when electricity market prices are high.  CRU has calculated that RESS 1 projects are expected to return &euro;313 million to consumers through the PSO over this year and next year.</p><p>The cheapest energy to produce is the energy we do not use.  The Government has committed to supporting households with their energy costs through promoting energy-efficiency measures. The wider package of energy-efficiency supports, which are available from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, make it easier and more affordable for homeowners to undertake home energy upgrades for warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes that have lower energy bills.  It is through the warmer homes scheme and grants for cavity wall and attic insulation that we can do this best.  This year has seen the highest ever allocation for SEAI retrofit schemes.  A total of &euro;267 million has been allocated for these schemes in 2022 and this will support almost 27,000 home energy upgrades.  Of this sum, &euro;118 million has been dedicated to energy poverty schemes which will deliver over 4,800 free energy upgrades.  The average retrofit value per home has increased significantly from &euro;2,500 in 2016 to &euro;18,750 today.  In addition, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the local authority retrofit programme in 2022, thereby delivering approximately 2,400 B2 retrofits of local authority homes this year.  Furthermore, an unprecedented &euro;8 billion of funding from the national development plan will be available to support the implementation of the plan through SEAI residential and community retrofit schemes through to 2030. </p><p>I will highlight the extensive Government supports in place to support consumers to meet their energy costs.  Throughout 2022, the Government has taken action in response to rising prices through a variety of measures.  The electricity costs emergency benefit payment saw 99% of domestic electricity accounts being credited with a payment of &euro;176.22, at a total cost of over &euro;377 million.  This scheme was part of a &euro;505 million package of measures that was put in place to address the increasing cost of living.  These measures included increases in the fuel allowance and a reduction in VAT on electricity and gas bills from 13.5% to 9%.  A &euro;350 million measure, which was included to temporarily reduce excise duties on petrol, diesel and market gas oil, cut excise by 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel.</p><p>The Government is committed to supporting households with their immediate energy costs through targeted ongoing schemes.  The fuel allowance payment of &euro;33 per week is paid for 27 weeks from late September to April, and is a total of &euro;924 each year.  This supported over 370,000 households last year.  The estimated cost this year is &euro;366 million.  The purpose of this payment is to assist those households in most of need with help with their energy costs.  As part of a package of measures totalling &euro;500 million, an additional lump sum payment of &euro;125 was paid to all households in receipt of the payment.  This fuel allowance payment is the equivalent of almost four weeks of additional fuel allowance.  A further lump sum of &euro;100 was paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance in May as part of the measures included in the national energy security framework.  This means that low-income households saw an overall increase of 55% in the fuel allowance support provided through the fuel allowance season, compared with last year.  A recipient household, which would have received &euro;735 in fuel allowance last year, saw that increase by &euro;404 to &euro;1,139 this year.</p><p>The household benefits package consists of a set of allowances that help with the costs of running a household.  This was also increased to help to cover electricity and gas costs.  Recipients are paid &euro;35 per month.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances.  Exceptional payments can be made to help to meet an essential once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet from his or her own resources.  Additionally, the living alone allowance, which is targeted at recipients of certain social welfare payments who live alone and often have significantly higher heating costs, is paid at a rate of &euro;19 per week in addition to primary social welfare payments such as the State pension.  The back to school clothing and footwear allowance was increased by &euro;100 for each eligible child under the scheme this year.  The amount being paid for each eligible child aged four to 11 years is &euro;260 and the rate payable for each eligible child aged 12 and over is &euro;385.  Furthermore, funding for the school meals local projects scheme, which is financed by the Department of Social Protection, was increased from &euro;47.5 million in 2017 to over &euro;68 million this year.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eamon Ryan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2028"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2028&amp;amp;pid=EamonRyanGP&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To date, 1,361 schools and organisations have received funding.</p><p>My Department recently published a review of the strategy to combat energy poverty alongside a public consultation which closed on 5 September last.  This will inform the development of a new action plan to combat energy poverty which will set out the whole-of-government response to energy poverty to be implemented ahead of the coming winter, as well as key longer term measures to ensure that those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected.  It is intended that the new plan will be published shortly after the budget.</p><p>As I have highlighted, the Government has long provided and will continue to provide practical supports for those struggling with their energy costs.  We are in unprecedented times.  I listened to Senators' contributions and they are correct that this requires further Government action.  My speech has concentrated on some of the measures that have been introduced in the last year.  Obviously I cannot outline the measures that will be introduced in the budget because the budgetary process will be completed over the next two weeks.  That said, we are committed to a range of measures similar to those that have already been implemented because they are targeted and practical ways to get our country through an incredibly difficult period.  It will not be easy.</p><p>We have to be careful that we are not divided from our European colleagues in the measures we take.  One of the ways in which this war is being played out is through the European Council, whereby the Russian Government is looking to divide us.  It is important in order to provide protection to our country and support for our people that this war does not see the division that is being sought in the measures that are being taken.  We can and will get through this.  This will be done through investment in energy efficiency measures and investment in alternative, non-fossil fuel supplies and in energy storage in the interim period.  We can and will do that in a way that is practical, most affordable and that helps us with our low-carbon transition so that our country is more reliant on its own resources rather than being able to be blackmailed and held to ransom by distant fossil fuel producers, which is the cause of this crisis.  We have to be strong and resolute in taking on that blackmail but we can and will do it.  The Government is committed to giving every resource and support it can to Irish people to get us through this.</p></speech>

There is a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of people are exploiting the current situation to try to argue the case for an LNG terminal in Shannon.  What they are not saying is that LNG will do nothing to address the costs that people are facing.  Those of us who follow this closely and understand the energy wholesale market will watch the LNG tankers turning in the ocean and going to the highest bidder.  It is not realistic to expect that Ireland, a small country, would be able to bid against Asia when it comes to getting LNG tankers to come here for a price that we can afford to pay.  This is a commercial industry which will be selling LNG at market prices to Ireland.  That is why a State storage facility is a much better approach, if we must have a storage facility at all.  It also matters where the LNG comes from.  If it is coming from fracked gas, it is destroying communities.  If we believe we are entitled to drink fresh water and have a healthy environment to live in, then so are people in other communities.  Buying in fracked gas means that we do not support that belief and are quite content to have other communities destroyed in order for us to have gas</p> <p>It is bizarre to hear calls for the opening up of exploration licences as we watch mainland Europe experience heatwave after heatwave and widespread drought.  The River Rhine has dropped to levels such that energy supplies cannot be transported along it.  We have nuclear power stations being shut down in France because they cannot be cooled.  One third of Pakistan's land surface is under water while people in this House are seriously calling for more fossil fuel exploration.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report is absolutely clear that there can be no new fossil fuel exploration and no new fossil fuel infrastructure.</p> <p>It is important to point out that those who are arguing for an LNG terminal need to be honest with people.  It will not bring down the cost of energy for anybody on this island.  There is also confusion on another point.  It does not matter how full that energy storage is.  Our problem at the moment in terms of possible blackouts has nothing to do with the supply of gas but with the generation of power.  That is a separate issue.  There is a lot of conflating of issues here to further certain agendas.  People are effectively exploiting a war to further their agendas.</p> <p>I will now turn to the amendment, included in which is a reference to the issue of demand and why we are facing blackouts in this country.  We know it is because the demand for electricity could outstrip supply.  We have arrived at that position because we have rolled out the red carpet for data centres.  While it is a Green Party Minister sitting in the Chamber today defending Government policy, we all know that Fine Gael for the past ten years has had a policy of not asking any questions and not putting in place any strategy to enable us to accommodate all of these data centres.  Its policy was to keep on taking them in while not asking any questions about what sort of data they were storing or whether these data were critical for our economy.  We are now dealing with the consequences of that policy.  It has led to the catastrophic failure of our energy system and it is jeopardising our grid.  In the context of gas and gas security, what is also not being looked at is the fact that because there is a moratorium on data centres getting connected to the electricity grid, they are putting a huge amount of unsustainable pressure on our gas supplies.  Gas Networks Ireland, which I met this week, is saying clearly that it is really concerned because it will not be able to connect data centres to the gas network due to the unsustainable pressure this would produce.  All of this is happening at a time when we are trying to reduce energy demand by 15% to do our bit for the war effort in the context of gas supplies.</p> <p>The amendment makes reference to the Government's data centre policy.  It also refers to the Government's failure to adequately protect households and businesses.  The energy poverty strategy lapsed in 2019.  I welcome the Minister's statement that the new strategy will be published after the budget but I hope it takes on board some of the points that were made in the previous energy poverty strategy.  We need to be collecting data on household incomes because we cannot have a strategy if we do not actually measure how bad the situation is around energy poverty.  Likewise, we need to make sure the recommendations will be followed up this time.  The CRU was told to conduct an analysis of the barriers that prevent people from switching energy supplier.  The CRU keeps telling people, through radio advertisements, to switch supplier to save on their energy bills but we know from organisations like Age Action Ireland, the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and Citizens Information, as well as various Traveller organisations, that there are barriers to switching which include credit ratings and difficulties with direct debits.  The CRU has not produced the data it was asked to produce in 2019.  That is why the Government is reaching for blunt instruments like the energy credit which is causing frustration.  Many Travellers did not even get the energy credit and are hearing of more credits being rolled out in the budget.  I want to hear guarantees that members of the Traveller community will get those energy credits and will not be let fall through the cracks as they did previously.</p> <p>I heard some criticism of Sinn F&eacute;in's policy on an energy cap but our energy cap goes hand in hand with a windfall tax to make sure fossil fuel companies are not profiteering on the back of the war.  We have repeatedly called, since as far back as December 2020, for the energy market in the EU to be reformed and for the decoupling of gas and renewable energy.  However, the Irish State was one of nine states that opposed that.  I note that there has now been a shift in position and while I welcome that, we have lost time on it.  Particularly for countries like Ireland which have so much indigenous renewable energy, we need to ensure that this renewable energy is leading to reductions in people's bills.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It will not do that when it is coupled with the cost of gas because the vast majority of the renewable energy produced in this country at the moment is under the old arrangements whereby the energy companies do not pay back the public service obligation, PSO, levy when they are making excess profits.  I could go on and on about energy because it is one of my hobbyhorses.  I hope the Minister of State will take on board some of the comments in our amendments.  I know he will not accept our amendment but I think he needs to work constructively with the Opposition on this matter.  Perhaps when the Government brings forward the credits, it may look favourably this time on the amendments we brought forward last time which excluded holiday homes, second homes and the homes of millionaires.  That can be done using data from the Central Statistics Office.</p></speech>

There are two issues at play.  This will be the winter of energy.  There is a need for Ireland to transfer from a fossil fuel-based economy to an energy system based on renewables.  We must exploit the significant potential we have in wind.  That need is now more pressing than ever.</p> <p>The cost of energy is spiralling out of control.  That has people worried and staying up at night.  They are wondering whether they can afford to heat their houses.  People will inevitably fall into energy poverty.  It is up to the Government to have a Covid-type response to the immediate concerns around the energy crisis.  Energy costs will be unsustainable for people, families and, in particular, small businesses over the course of the coming winter.  We are hearing reports from people whose energy bills are in some cases ten times as expensive as they were last year.  Coming off the back of the Covid pandemic, many businesses will not be able to support that.  Many people who are now working from home will not be able to support that.  We need immediate action from the Government to alleviate the pressure and tackles the outrageous prices.</p> <p>The Labour Party has said we need to take three crucial steps and they must be adopted by the Government to address the soaring costs of energy for households.  We need the immediate introduction of a windfall tax on the excessive profits of energy companies.  I take on board Senator Pauline O'Reilly's comments in that regard.  However, a windfall tax is needed.  We also need a maximum price cap on energy bills.  Our neighbours are doing that.  The Conservative Government in the UK is doing that.  We also need to extend the eligibility for the fuel allowance for low- and middle-income households to protect those who are most at risk of energy poverty.  These are significant short-term measures that will help people to get through the winter.  We cannot justify a society in which exorbitant energy company profits are taking precedence over families in energy poverty.  Some may say that cannot be done because we cannot afford it.  We need to be cognisant of the fact the Department of Finance figures show a surplus of more than &euro;6 billion so far this year.  Many of our EU partners are already taking radical action in this area.</p> <p>The Minister has said, and it has been reiterated in this House, that a longer term strategy needs to be involved.  That strategy does not include things such as liquefied natural gas, LNG, or allowing turf to be commercially used.  The strategy is not reliant on fossil fuels.  We cannot use this crisis as an excuse for allowing that or allow certain people to use it as an excuse to make that argument.  We are in this precarious position because of our lack of long-term planning.  We must use this crisis as an opportunity to transition away from our current energy policy and not fall back on the old reliables.  Beyond the emergency measures needed this winter, we need to adapt a long-term strategy and change our attitudes and policies to meet our climate targets through an approach that involves wind energy and exploiting our natural resources.  We must not fall back on the old reliables.  Diversifying our energy supply by pushing for more renewables will also enhance our energy security and ensure we will not be in this precarious position if another war breaks out on our eastern side in ten years' time.</p> <p>Ireland has one of the best wind resources in the world.  Wind energy could potentially make enough energy every year to power each home in this country and allow us to make money by selling it back to the European grid.  We need to be become a superpower of wind energy.  However, we will only do that through a strategic vision.  We must not use every crisis as an opportunity to fall back.  We hear whataboutery in respect of long-term energy policy in this country.  I am glad Senators O'Reilly and Boylan, who are more expert than I am in this area, have tackled Senator McDowell's comments about LNG.  I fear that is the debate that will come forth.</p></speech>

I commend my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues on tabling this Private Members' motion.  It is timely in advance of the budget.  There is no doubt the cost-of-living inflation is to fore of everybody's mind as we approach budget day.  There is possibly a long winter ahead.  The cost of energy and fuel is of particular concern.  We all hope we have a mild winter.  It would be excellent if that were to happen.  We hope to avoid a winter similar to that of 2009 and 2010.  I remember a morning in that period when my car registered a temperature of -17&deg;C.  If we were to have similar conditions this winter and the wind did not blow, it would be serious.  That would be serious at any time but would be particularly so when supply and demand in our energy system are so finely balanced.  That is a concern and a worry.  The Minister of State cannot prevent it if the weather turns in that fashion.  It is a matter of concern to me and to households throughout the country.</p> <p>The budget has been brought forward because of the cost of living and inflationary pressures.  I hope and expect the Government to sign off on a package of supports in respect of energy costs for households throughout the country.  It is vital those people who are facing higher energy bills will have support to make it bearable and realistic for them to afford the bills that will fall due.  The money that has been spent heretofore to support people in respect of the cost of living has been welcome.  It is worth pointing out that those supports are possible because the economy is in good order as a result of how it has been managed over a long number of years.  We have a surplus we can reinvest in supporting people who are under financial pressures at the moment.</p> <p>I will move to consider the balance of supply and demand.  There are some medium- to long-term plans, including the France-Ireland interconnector, which will be important for the provision of energy security.  The interconnector will provide linkage to another EU member state.  We have linkage to the UK, which is important, but it is no longer a part of the EU.  It is important we have the solidarity with the EU that the Celtic interconnector will provide between Ireland and France when it is up and running.</p> <p>In respect of fuel costs, gas will be the main concern, especially on the east coast.  There are many parts of Ireland that do not have a reliance on gas and, therefore, will be particularly dependent on home heating oil.  The issue of turf has been discussed.  If ever there was a year when it was important for people to have turf and for us to get a positive solution in respect of the regulations for smoky coal and turf cutting, this is the year.  Home heating oil remains important as a heat source for many rural dwellers.  It is important that assistance is provided for those who will have to pay high costs for home heating oil this year.</p> <p>We also know the electricity credit was well received.  I hope a similar targeted measure will again be considered.  I cannot pre-empt the budget but that is an important consideration.</p> <p>In respect of the longer term, the Bill to create the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, has been passed and the office needs to be established.  That process is going through the various stages that are necessary.  There is, however, still some concern about the delivery of offshore infrastructure and the speed with which that can realistically be achieved.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have seen commentary in the UK going back to the era of Prime Minister Tony Blair in which he spoke of "rustling up" a nuclear power station.  An offshore wind farm cannot be rustled up in the space of a week, month or year.  We need to be acutely attuned to the issues here and the fine balance between supply and demand.  We have these natural resources but there will be a period of time or gap in which supply will still be constrained.  However, we can plan to ensure we maximise the great resource that offshore wind presents to us. </p><p>The Derrybrien wind farm has been mentioned previously by other speakers in these Houses.  There are legal issues involved in the ins and outs of this.  It is hard to explain to anybody in the midst of a crisis why we would dismantle a wind farm.  Again, while it is a legal matter, it does not make sense and it is hard to explain to people why it might happen.</p><p>Regarding energy prices, many of the current problems we have relate to the cost of gas.  We know the reason for that is the illegal actions being taken by Putin and Russia.  We have to mitigate those as we cannot prevent or change them.  We are a buyer on those terms, as are countries across Europe.  While we do not get Russian gas directly, obviously there is an impact on the cost of sources in Scotland, Norway and elsewhere.  I commend the motion and I fully support it.</p></speech>

I thank the Senators who tabled the motion.  The budget will be very much about mitigating and reducing costs and we will see that in a number of different areas.  One of the key areas will be around the fuel allowance and the people who are most vulnerable.  I am looking forward to seeing what will be done in that regard and also as regards supports for businesses.  On a matter that has been raised previously, small businesses, such as retailers, hotels and restaurants, are out on their feet because they are being forced to deal with incredibly high costs.  It will not be easy to manage how we support them.  There are long-term solutions such as engaging more renewable energies.  We have done so much over the lockdown and during Covid-19 to support these employers and employees of businesses and now we need to be smart and innovative about how we will support them going forward.  They are dealing with challenges.  We have seen positive developments such as the increase in the minimum wage announced today.  However, when it comes to energy costs, I look forward to seeing what will come out of the budget in terms of supports for businesses.</p> <p>I am sure the Minister of State will get a chance to speak at the end of the debate.  I know the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has spoken already.  I am interested in the short-term measures the Department will potentially take.  We know about the long-term measures and what has been done under just transition.  There is legislation on microgeneration pending that will deal with solar energy and give farms and schools access to renewable energy, which they will then be able to sell back into the grid.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on the timeline for some of those measures and the short-term measures that can be implemented quickly.</p> <p>How will the Government use new technologies?  We often speak about how we are going to reduce energy costs.  People are going to be smarter and maybe think about reducing usage during the peak period between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  That will indicate the cost of electricity.  How are we using new technologies?  We see sensor lights that turn on and off when people walk into the room.  How do we support those technologies?  Are there short-term measures that would help businesses reduce costs?  Are there any grants or funding for those types of technologies that could be rolled out very quickly and would help those businesses in the months ahead?  This a difficult time and we have a very challenging time ahead.  I look forward to finding out how we are going to be smart in dealing with that and engaging with and using innovation to support us.</p></speech>

This issue affects every house and business in the country.  Much of the debate has been focused on households and their costs.  One of the major issues businesses have is uncertainty as they have no idea what is coming in the budget.  They have no idea how to manage in the next few weeks or what they will do in the winter months.  People have a fair idea of what households are going to get.  Figures of &euro;500 and &euro;600 have been mentioned a number of times.  I do not know whether this is true but households have an idea of the kind of support they will get from the Government.  From listening to comments made by the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, they are certainly of the view that households will be supported over the Christmas period and into next year.  I suspect some money will be held back for next year because we do not know where we will be in a number of months.</p> <p>It is clear from talking to businesses that they have no idea what the Government will do for them.  They are in a very difficult position.  The problems they face range.  The annual electricity bills of businesses such as Centra, Spar and SuperValu stores have gone from &euro;90,000 to &euro;220,000, which is a massive increase.  Energy bills for coffee shops have gone from &euro;5,000 to &euro;10,000 and the bills for pubs have also increased massively.  News reports from the UK show that pubs are closing because of the cost of energy.  We obviously do not want to get to that point.</p> <p>The fear I see among people is that they believe they may have to make a decision to reduce production because of the cost of electricity.  Reducing production reduces employment.  We are very fortunate that more than 2.5 million people are employed in this country.  We do not want to get to a position where, through no fault of their own, businesses are having to make harsh decisions that have an impact on employment.  They do not want to do it but they are in a precarious position.  If we can do anything, it should be to give businesses some sort of certainty over the winter months.</p> <p>Another issue people raise with me concerns supports.  Businesses want to change their ways.  Sometimes we struggle to get individuals, for example, farmers, to change their ways and become more environmentally friendly.  Businesses want to do this.  They want to purchase solar panels and invest in renewable energy but they do not have the types of supports that are given to households and individuals.  Something has to be done to support businesses this Christmas and over the winter period in addressing the immediate issue.  However, they also need grants or some sort of support to help them change their ways by purchasing solar panels and investing.  Many businesses are doing this already and spending massive money.  Centra shops and so on are now investing &euro;130,000 in renewable energy to reduce their heating and energy costs because their bills have gone from &euro;90,000 to &euro;200,000.  They need to be supported in this because it is a massive investment.  There is a long-term effect obviously.  However, if we are going to support every household in the country, surely we can also do it for businesses.</p> <p>I would appreciate an answer on this next point because nobody ever has one.  Someone living in a house on the main street in Clonmel can get electricity as a private domestic unit for approximately 20 cent per kilowatt hour.  However, if someone else opens a coffee shop next door, that business will pay over 50 cent per kilowatt hour.  The product being provided is exactly the same.  There is no difference between electricity that goes into a private household and electricity going into a small business, yet the price is totally different.  The only thing I have ever been told by someone who works in the sector is that one of the reasons the price is much higher is that businesses are less likely to pay the bill fully than households, which will always pay.  This is an outrageous viewpoint because it means businesses that pay their heating bills are subsidising those that may not pay them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It makes no sense that the same product goes to two different buildings for a totally different price.  Businesses feel like they are being taken for whatever.  It does not seem fair.  At a time when they are at the pin of their collar, simple issues like that need to be addressed.  Those energy companies need to answer honestly about how and why that is happening.</p><p>The most important thing is to give businesses certainty and hope that they will be supported.  We have been through crisis after crisis in recent years, including Brexit, Covid and now Putin's war in Ukraine.  We have supported those businesses through Covid and I do not think we are a Government that wants to let them go under this winter because of energy costs.  They know the Government has supported them for the past two years when they needed it.  They are calling on us again and I ask that the Minister of State and the Department give that support.  I know they will do so, but ask them to give clarity as quickly as possible. </p></speech>
