    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#A00300"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I support the Neurological Alliance of Ireland with regard to the shortage of neurological nurses.  I will speak specifically about University Hospital Limerick.  The last time a neurological nursing post was advertised and filled was 2019 when a nurse was needed for multiple sclerosis.  As we are aware, there are many neurological conditions.  A report shows there is a shortage of up to eight nurses in University Hospital Limerick.  There are three nurses there at present, along with a number of nurses who assist in the area.</p> <p>Putting in place neurological specialist nurses helps to reduce waiting lists.  It also helps people with their conditions.  Sometimes people end up in hospital and taking up a bed.  Being seen by a neurological nurse helps to keep people out of hospital and reduce waiting lists.  Many specialist nurses are able to deal with these conditions.  It also means the patients do not have to see the doctor or professor involved.  It would be cost-effective if these positions were filled.  As I said, the last time a post was filled was in April 2019.  I tabled a Commencement matter on the issue at the time.  At that stage, there was a shortage of three nurses.  There is now a shortage of eight nurses.  I support the national campaign.  More than 800,000 people in Ireland have neurological health conditions.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister of State has to say today.</p></speech>

I will read the statement but I have my own opinions, which I will add at the end if that is okay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1695" speakername="Maria Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#A00500"><p>That is perfect.</p></speech>

I know this is an issue close to her heart and one she has raised on previous occasions.  I also understand how important it is to the people of the mid-west that such services are available when needed and that they are adequately resourced and staffed.  In this regard, the Government and Department of Health are fully committed to improving patient services and having patient-centred care in Limerick and throughout the country.  This commitment is reflected in the unprecedented level of funding being targeted at the health service in budget 2022.  This funding will help build on the support that has been provided to University Hospital Limerick in the form of additional staffing, in particular in the development of increased bed capacity over recent years.</p> <p>As is always the case, more can be done.  University Limerick Hospitals Group, ULHG, fully recognises the need for additional resources in neurological services.  This is why, in 2021, ULHG sought and received approval for two additional consultant neurologist posts to help address the deficit in the service.  The recruitment process to fill these posts has commenced and interviews are scheduled to take place on 28 October.  It is hoped that both of these posts will be filled from the campaign.</p> <p>ULHG is committed to developing the service in line with population health and consistent with the model of care outlined by the national clinical programme for neurology.  It has advised the Department of Health that there are two specialist nurses working in neurological services at University Hospital Limerick.  It is important to note these specialist nurses are supported by a total of nine nursing staff providing services in a range of specialties, including services for Parkinson's disease, which has two clinical nurse specialists and one clinical nurse manager.  Epilepsy services at the hospital have one clinical nurse specialist and one staff nurse.  Multiple sclerosis services at University Hospital Limerick have one clinical nurse specialist.  Stroke services operate with one advanced nurse practitioner, one clinical nurse specialist and one level 2 clinical nurse manager.  In addition, the neurological services at ULHG work with the designated stroke and neurology ward in University Hospital Limerick, where all staff are trained to care for neurology patients with a multidisciplinary approach that also incorporates allied health services, including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am assured University Limerick Hospitals Group remains committed to the progressive development of neurology services within the group.  It has noted that this is a core focus and has committed to improving the service for patients, given its importance.</p><p>What I have just read is the contribution prepared on behalf of the Minister.  I too am aware of the shortage of an additional eight nurses the Senator mentioned.  In Galway, there is a shortage of an additional nine nurses.  There is a dearth and deficit, not just in the mid-west or Saolta University Health Care Group but throughout the country.  In budget 2022, only 91 nurse specialists were sought for neurology services that support a wide range of patients.  Not only do they provide a wide range of patient supports but they are invaluable in preventing emergency department admissions or admissions to beds.  Where that specialist care is in place, it can serve a longer-term benefit for the patient by keeping him or her in the community.  My ask of the Department of Health and the Minister, on foot of this debate, is that we will make this a priority following budget 2022 and that we will start advertising for posts.  While it is fantastic that the consultant posts are being advertised, they will be only as good as the team around them.</p></speech>

I fully agree with her.  While it is wonderful that two nursing posts are being advertised and filled, the Government should make this a priority.  I thank her for saying she will take the issue back to the Department and put emphasis on it.  If the positions were filled, fewer people would be in beds taking up trolleys.  University Hospital Limerick is in the newspapers every day of the week regarding the numbers of people on trolleys and waiting lists.  If these posts were filled, it would go a long way towards alleviating that.  It would ultimately be value for money and would give relief to the patient, who has to be at the centre of this.  Many people with neurological conditions undergo much pain and suffering and that would be somewhat relieved if these positions were filled.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State and look forward to working with her on the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#B00300"><p>The Minister, in his prepared concluding statement, reiterates that the Government, along with the Department of Health, is fully committed to improving services and having patient-centred care in Limerick and throughout the country.  This was reflected with the significant funding allocated to improving our health services in budget 2022.  University Limerick Hospitals Group is fully cognisant of the need for additional resources within the neurological services.  That is why it continues to develop the service and is recruiting two additional consultants in neurology services in 2021.  This investment is vital to ensuring the ongoing operational and strategic development of neurological services for the people of Limerick and throughout the mid-west.  As I said earlier, this should be a priority and I fully agree with the Senator.  When we prioritise the recruitment of neurological nurse specialists, we support people to live a fuller life in their communities.  At the same time, I acknowledge the hard work of the staff at University Hospital Limerick.  We can prevent repeated admissions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#B00600"><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House to deal with this issue.  He will be aware of the history of sail training in Ireland.  For many years, including during my childhood, although I was never a trainee on it, I was often on board the <i>Asgard II,</i>which many people throughout Ireland will fondly recall as a sail training vessel that worked for many years with people from non-sailing backgrounds, that is, people who would never ordinarily have had an opportunity to get on a sailing boat and to experience what it is to be at sea under the power of the wind alone.  It brought together people from all kinds of communities and gave them an opportunity to experience the marine in a way very few of us get to do.</p><p>As the Minister will be aware, in 2008, the <i>Asgard II</i>was sailing to France for maintenance and, unfortunately, seemed to hit something.  Ultimately, it took on water and sank in September of that year.  It still lies at the bottom of the Bay of Biscay.  Although there was a campaign to raise and restore it, I think that, realistically, that moment has passed, even though we know where it is and it was not badly damaged in the sinking.  The cost of bringing it back would be exorbitant.  Moreover, we recognise that the <i>Asgard II</i>, although a fine vessel and one of which we all have fond memories, was a relatively small vessel in the context of the kinds of ships used for this kind of sail training and tall ship sailing.</p><p>While called the <i>Asgard II</i>, the vessel was named after the <i>Asgard</i>, which was used to smuggle guns to rebels in Ireland at the time of the fledgling status of this State and which is available to see at Collins Barracks.  It is not actually connected to that ship, however, and I do not think there is a need for sail training vessels to have that historical connection.  Their purpose is to provide a vehicle for people who want to get involved in or experience sailing.  The importance of that is undisputable.</p><p>I pay tribute to the Atlantic Youth Trust, which has been at the forefront of pushing the idea that there would be, once again, a proper Irish sail training vessel that would allow many people from various backgrounds to get involved in sailing and to experience what it is to be in the marine industry.  The Atlantic Youth Trust and Enda O'Coineen, to whom I have spoken about this and who lives in my constituency, is a committed philanthropist in this area, as well as being a former chairman of Coiste an Asgard, the governing body that managed the <i>Asgard II</i>, have identified a vessel that is afloat and available in Sweden and that could be purchased to become a new Irish sail training vessel.  It is a model of a 1909 Danish schooner but it was only built in the early 1980s and is a solid steel ship of 164 ft.  It is a significant vessel, much larger than the <i>Asgard II</i>, but a suitable vessel to replace it as the Irish sail training vessel.</p><p>The Minister already has been contacted about this but I raised this issue to encourage him to go down the path of allowing this vessel to be put in place and allowing us to put back on train a proper sail training programme for Ireland and the people on this island.  I refer not just to the Republic; this is, I hope, an all-island venture.  Ultimately, we are a marine community.  We live on an island and are connected to the sea, yet many of our people do not get an opportunity to enjoy that connection to the sea.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us there is support for this project at Government level and we can progress it.  I hope we can look forward once again to having a fine square-rigged, tall-ship sail training vessel available to people from throughout this island, from all backgrounds, and particularly young people who have never experienced sailing, that will allow them to get on the water, feel what it is like and, I hope, build a connection with the sea that lies all around this island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#B00700"><p>As the Senator noted, the <i>Asgard II</i>sank in 2008.  The Government subsequently decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued, as recommended in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  Significant capital and ongoing costs are associated with investing in a national sail training vessel and a detailed analysis would be required prior to any new Exchequer funding being committed.</p><p>The Department of Defence provides funding to Sail Training Ireland, a charity founded by individuals previously involved with Coiste an Asgard.  A performance delivery agreement stipulates that &euro;85,000 be used to provide a sail training experience for 50 trainees from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Sail Training Ireland has an all-island focus, supporting trainees from both North and South, and charters vessels rather than owning and operating them.  I am advised that no sail training took place in 2020 or 2021 due to Covid restrictions.  It is anticipated that funding will be provided in 2022, subject to the resumption of a sail-training programme.</p><p>Separately, in 2015, as part of the Fresh Start agreement, the Government undertook to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to agree on a funding plan for the Atlantic Youth Trust project.  A similar commitment was included in the 2016 programme for Government.  The proposal was to build a new tall ship at an estimated cost of &euro;15 million, with an ongoing funding requirement.  Officials in my Department held meetings with the promoters and the Department for Communities in Belfast to explore the project.  Progress was slow, in part due to political difficulties in the North.  There is a commitment in the current programme for Government to work with the Northern Ireland Executive to build on plans to deliver a youth development sail training project to provide opportunities for interaction and engagement for young people both North and South.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is also involved in fulfilling this commitment.  On 24 September 2021, a new submission was received from the Atlantic Youth Trust.  I believe this is the proposal the Senator is referring to.  Officials from my Department and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media met with representatives of the Atlantic Youth Trust yesterday, 13 October, to discuss the submission and request further information on a number of matters.  The trust has committed to revert on a number of the queries raised.  Clear guidelines have been issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to evaluating any such proposals.</p><p>The Government is currently engaged with two sail training organisations, and we remain supportive of the principles of the sail training programme.  We would like to see this run on an all-island basis, where possible.  I look forward to progressing in a positive way.</p></speech>

I am delighted to hear that there is that level of engagement.  I really am grateful to the Minister for his commitment to this.  It is obviously important that this goes through the right channels and is done in the right way to ensure a sustainable programme over a period of time but I really do hope that no political difficulties prevent this important scheme from going ahead.  I say that as one who comes from the capital of sailing in Ireland, D&uacute;n Laoghaire - although the Minister, as someone from Cork, may not accept that contention - but this is something that will benefit the whole of Ireland and towns and cities around the coast from D&uacute;n Laoghaire to Waterford, Cork, Galway, Derry and Belfast.  This is an asset for the people of Ireland.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is engaging, the commitment from Government and the fact that there is obviously will for this to happen at Government level.  I hope it will happen soon.  This is an asset and it introduces people to a sport, a means of trade and a means of getting work and employment in our marine industry, which is absolutely invaluable.  We cannot ignore the importance of sail training for bringing people into that and giving them an opportunity they otherwise might not have.  I thank the Minister for coming in today.</p></speech>

He appreciates the value of sail training and the opportunities it opens up for many young people who may otherwise not have the opportunity to benefit from it.  I have spoken to many people, some of whom I know well, who say that their time on the <i>Asgard</i>changed the direction of their lives as a result of the people they met and the experiences they had.  That is effectively what sail training is about.  Looking at the models in other countries, I believe the best model is that of New Zealand, which is operated by the Spirit of New Zealand Trust.  Through the schools in New Zealand, people are selected to be part of that sail training programme for set periods, which benefits them as individuals in terms of personal growth, confidence, teamwork and all of the other things that sail training can potentially uniquely provide for those who benefit from it.  The Government acknowledges the significant benefits that sail training brings to the personal and social development of young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds and those with disabilities.  The Government's support for sail training is evidenced by my Department's funding of Sail Training Ireland and our engagement with the Atlantic Youth Trust on its proposal for an additional sail training project in Ireland.</p><p>It is important to note that any funding of new sail training vessel, combined with an ongoing maintenance fund, would require a substantial financial commitment from the Government.  Prior to any such commitment, it is essential that the proposal be assessed in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's guidelines and that it provides value for money.  In other words, this needs robust assessment.  A generous offer has been put to the Government and we are considering it.  I hope we will be able to work with both the Atlantic Youth Trust and Sail Training Ireland to provide a project that is exciting and positive but that also provides value for money and is run in a fully transparent way.  Most importantly, it must enable us to provide a platform for sail training in Ireland from which many young people can benefit.</p></speech>

I thank him for taking time out of his schedule to be here.  I appreciate it.  This morning, I will raise the issue of the urgent need for a new fire station in Ballybay.  Ballybay fire station provides cover not just to the town itself, but to the wider mid-Monaghan area.  Back in 1977, a report was commissioned which determined that the fire station fell short of the minimum requirements of a modern fire station.  That was in 1977 - many years ago.  The current station, which is a single-storey structure, is located in the centre of Ballybay and has no parking facilities attached.</p> <p>I pay tribute to the nine dedicated crew members attached to the fire station for their loyal and dedicated service, both in the past and at present.  I pay tribute to all who have been attached to the station down through the years.  They have given excellent service not just to the people of Ballybay, but to the people of the wider hinterland of mid-Monaghan.</p> <p>The current crew and the people of Ballybay and the mid-Monaghan area deserve a new fire station.  I hope the Minister of State will have positive news for me in that regard this morning.  I pay tribute to local councillor, S&eacute;amus Coyle, who has worked tirelessly on this issue.  Only last week, he put a motion before Monaghan County Council which highlighted the urgency of addressing this issue.  I pay tribute to all members of Monaghan County Council and, indeed, Ballybay town commissioners down through the years who have worked and pushed tirelessly to get a new facility for the town.  There is no doubt but that there is an urgent need for a new facility there.  I would like the Minister of State to push the matter with his Cabinet colleagues in order to ensure that this facility is provided to the crew that currently works there and the people of Ballybay and the wider Monaghan area.</p></speech>

The provision of fire services in a functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Act 1981 and 2003.  My Department supports fire authorities by establishing policy, setting national standards for fire safety and service provision, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.</p> <p>My Department recently announced a new fire services capital programme for the period covering 2021 to 2025, with a funding allocation of &euro;61 million.  Following extensive engagement with the fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works and so on were received.  The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of: the area risk categorisation of the fire station, which relates to population, fire risks and so on; established health and safety needs; the state of development of the project, which relates to whether a site has been acquired and so on; and the value for money offered by the proposal.  The new programme will see six replacement fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 fire station projects, nine fire station refurbishments and the allocation of 35 new fire engines.  In order to optimise the use of the available capital programme funding, my Department reassesses the status of projects in the programme annually.  Some flexibility is normally available to advance projects that are ready and that offer best value for money, taking account of the state of readiness of projects more generally.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All requests for funding from my Department's fire services capital programme are considered promptly and have regard to local authorities' own priorities, consistency with national policy, the value for money offered by proposals and the totality of requests from fire authorities.</p><p>Project consideration stages in my Department include submission of preliminary and detailed appraisals, submission of design brief, selection of site, application for approval in principle, appointment of design consultants, submission of a preliminary design, planning application, submission of preliminary cost plan, detailed design and cost plans and tender process and construction stages.  Each step is subject to approval from the Department.</p><p>Monaghan County Council has indicated that a new fire station at Ballybay is a priority and is included in the list of proposed new-build fire stations under the 2021 to 2025 capital programme.  My Department received a detailed cost plan for this project on 24 September, outlining an estimated total build cost of &euro;1.7 million.  This proposal is currently under consideration and my Department will continue working with the council to progress this project.</p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter, along with Councillor Coyle and members of Monaghan County Council.  We will certainly give it the highest priority and it is on the list for the capital programme.  It will therefore be given due assessment in that regard.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that the case has been well made that this is a priority.  I welcome the comments this morning and I trust the Department will work with Monaghan County Council to ensure the facility is built without delay and as soon as possible.</p> <p>I might digress when I have the Minister of State to raise the matter of peat in County Monaghan.  Monaghan is well known for many things, one of which is mushrooms, and we have a serious problem there now because peat products are essential for that mushroom industry.  I ask the Minister of State to take it upon himself to address the matter urgently because many jobs in County Monaghan depend on it.</p></speech>

Again, I thank the members of Monaghan County Council and the executive for advancing this.  I join the Senator in paying tribute to fire service personnel, who do heroic work in the county and throughout the entire country.</p> <p>On the peat question, I am expecting to receive a report on alternative materials from Dr. Munoo Prasad by 20 October.  The Government is trying to address the matter but as I stated, we are caught in a legal bind over this.  All efforts are being made to try to resolve this as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

The premise of this matter is to call for the removal of the disablement benefit as a disqualifying payment for the winter fuel allowance for those persons who meet the income means test, which is currently set at &euro;100 above the State contributory pension plus the living alone and dependant's allowance.  This will rise to &euro;120 from 1 January as a result of the decisions made in budget 2022 by the Government, and this is very welcome.</p> <p>I admit I was not aware of the disablement benefit payment until this matter was brought to my attention by two separate constituents in County Waterford over the past 12 months.  The payment is administered under the occupational injuries scheme and it can be paid if a person suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or from work or by getting a prescribed disease contracted at work.  Payment is only made where the level of disablement following the accident or disease is at 15% or more.  Where the level of disablement is assessed at 20% or more, a benefit is paid weekly or every four weeks.</p> <p>My issue is that disablement benefit is classified as a disqualifying payment for the winter fuel allowance along with other social insurance payments like the jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit and maternity benefit.  If a person is in receipt of a 40% weekly disablement payment of &euro;93.60, which is below the &euro;100 threshold for additional income, that person is still automatically excluded from the winter fuel allowance scheme.  This is unjust and wrong, and it is probably on account of the payment being classified as a benefit instead of an allowance.  The net result is we are saying that if a person has a small private pension of less than &euro;100 per week on top of the contributory pension and living alone allowance, the State will support him or her with rising fuel costs to the tune of &euro;924 per year via the winter fuel allowance.  If a former worker, however, was unfortunate enough to be in a workplace accident or pick up a respiratory illness due to working with asbestos, for example, the State will not be in a position to support him or her with rising heating costs.  This is an anomaly that must be addressed and I ask the Minister of State to raise this query with the Department so that it can be addressed without delay.</p> <p>To be clear, I am not asking for those in receipt of disablement benefit who are above the means test limit to be included.  I am merely asking that those in receipt of the payment who are below the income means test are factored in.  Currently, this would mean that those in receipt of the 40%, 30% and or the 20% disablement benefit payment would qualify, and from January people in receipt of the 50% disablement benefit would also be able to avail of the fuel allowance.  It is only right and proper that the Government consider this move.  I certainly believe it to be a reasonable proposal and I would not bring it the floor of the Seanad if I did not see it as reasonable.  I certainly hope it can be looked at favourably.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#D00600"><p>As the Senator knows, the Department of Social Protection pays a range of benefit and assisted income supports, including fuel allowance, which is available to long-term social welfare recipients.  On 27 September 2021, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, announced the start of the national fuel scheme for the 2021-22 season.  A budget of &euro;292 million has been set aside for this season to pay an estimated 370,000 households.  The purpose of the payment is to assist the households with their energy costs and the allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full and only one allowance is paid per household.</p> <p>On Tuesday this week, in budget 2022, the fuel allowance was increased by &euro;5 per week.  The means threshold was increased and eligibility was extended for certain groups.  As a result, it is now a payment of &euro;33 per week for 28 weeks from October to April, giving a total of &euro;924 per recipient in a full fuel season from now on.</p> <p>Disablement benefit is a benefit under the occupational injuries scheme.  It can be paid to a recipient who suffers a loss of physical or mental faculty because of an accident at work, an accident travelling directly to or from work or a prescribed disease contracted at work.  The contribution requirements for the scheme are minimal when compared with other Department benefit schemes.  Payment is only made when the level of disablement following an accident or disease is assessed at 15% or more.  The rate of benefit depends on the degree of disablement.  It is paid at a personal rate without increase for dependants.</p> <p>In 2020, the estimated expenditure on the scheme was almost &euro;70 million, with over 14,500 recipients supported through the scheme.  People in receipt of disablement benefit without another payment may work full-time or part-time and continue to receive benefit payment.  In other words, they are not prevented from generating additional income.  In the alternative, it can be and is paid in conjunction with most social welfare payments, including the jobseeker's benefit, the jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, the invalidity pension, the State pension and the one-parent family payment.  It is not considered as means for most social welfare means-assessed schemes, except for fuel allowance, supplementary welfare allowance or the working family payment.</p> <p>An incapacity supplement is an increase payable in addition to disablement benefit where a person is considered to be permanently incapable of work as a result of an occupational accident or disease and does not qualify for another social welfare benefit, such as illness benefit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The incapacity supplement is a qualifying payment for fuel allowance.  Therefore, while disablement benefit on its own is a disqualifying payment for fuel allowance, because a person may continue to take up work or may receive another social welfare payment in parallel, qualification for incapacity supplement in addition to disablement benefit qualifies that recipient for fuel allowance, subject to satisfying all other criteria.</p><p>The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct limited resources available to the Department of Social Protection in as targeted a manner as possible.  In budget 2022, the Government has already made a significant commitment to extending the fuel allowance both in terms of the value of the payment for recipients and extending the means of threshold, and shortening the time limit required of all jobseeker allowance and basic supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, recipients across the access scheme.  This additional investment will cost &euro;60 million in 2022.  </p><p>Disablement benefit can be paid to people in employment and in addition to most social welfare payments.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional need payments may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost which customers are unable to meet from their own resources.  This may include exceptional heating costs.   </p><p>Removing disablement benefit as a disqualifying payment for fuel allowance would require careful consideration within the overall policy and budgetary context and I understand that the Department is examining this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and, in particular, the last line of his response that that the Department is examining this matter, which is positive. </p> <p>I will emphasise again some of the points I made earlier.  I am not looking for this for everybody who is in receipt of disablement benefit, and the Minister of State said there were 14,500 recipients.  I am asking about somebody who is in receipt of that payment and is below the means test.  What percentage of those 14,500 recipients are in receipt of 50% or less?  I would argue that it is a significantly lower figure.</p> <p>The Minister of State's response stated that qualification for incapacity supplement in addition to disablement benefit qualifies the recipient for the fuel allowance.  The issue here is with older people, in particular, who have transitioned on to the pension and will not be able to receive that supplement payment.  These are the two constituents I am referring to here, that is, people who are long since out of work and are living on their own and are struggling with rising fuel costs.  They are being excluded from support under the fuel allowance because in one case the person was unfortunate enough to have had a workplace accident while in the other case the person has a respiratory illness as a direct result of work.  I do not think that that is right and proper.</p></speech>

I reiterate the Government's commitment to providing income supports to the most vulnerable, in particular in the context of the fuel allowance.  This was demonstrated in last Tuesday's budget with rate increases for both the fuel allowance and the living alone allowance as well as extended eligibility for the fuel allowance for certain cohorts of long-term welfare recipients and an increase in the means threshold.</p> <p>Other supports are available in addition to the fuel allowance.  The household benefits package consists of a set of allowances which help with the cost of running a household and include allowances towards covering electricity or gas costs.  Recipients, the majority of whom are pensioners, are paid &euro;35 a month.  The Department of Social Protection will spend approximately &euro;195 million this year on the household benefits package to almost half a million customers.</p> <p>The targeted flexible support provided to those in need by the supplementary welfare allowance must also be emphasised.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payment may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources and this may include exceptional costs.</p> <p>Of course, the best long-term approach is for Ireland to insulate customers from rising energy costs and that is to invest in energy-efficiency.  Budget 2022 commits &euro;202 million in carbon tax revenue to fund the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland residential and community retrofit schemes and a further &euro;10 million from the Exchequer for the solar photovoltaic, PV, scheme.  This investment will support more than 22,000 homes in energy upgrades, including more than 6,000 homes to building energy rating of B2.  It will deliver warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills.</p> <p>Some &euro;109 million under this &euro;202 million allocation will be used to provide free energy efficiency upgrades to households that are in or at risk of energy poverty.  more than 4,500 upgrades will be carried out under the SEAI scheme and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will invest a further &euro;85 million as part of the local authority retrofit programme in 2022.</p> <p>Having said all that, I accept that the issue the Senator has raised is a specific one.  As he correctly said, it is an anomaly and I will certainly take that on board.  I believe the Minister will provide a response on the specific issue the Senator quite rightly highlighted that could affect quite a large number of older and vulnerable people, in particular.</p></speech>

I was shocked to learn this morning that we had 60 million electrical devices in Ireland in 2020.  That includes all household devices, phones and all types of lighting, etc.  These items were brought into the country and purchased.  It is a huge number when we consider how they are used.  Households are being called on to recycle at least five items this week and ensure they are disposed of appropriately.  This can be done at all of our recycling centres around the country.  I must mention Silliot Hill recycling centre in County Kildare, which is an excellent resource.  It is important that we endorse this call to reuse and recycle.  We must also think about electrical equipment that we buy.</p> <p>Recently, my fridge-freezer, which I had for less than seven years, broke down.  I would have paid for it to be repaired because I felt the lifespan of a fridge-freezer should be longer than seven years.  However, I was surprised to learn that seven years is the average lifespan of such products.  It is shocking to think that such large pieces of equipment are effectively disposable.  We need to issue a call to the manufacturers in relation to that also.</p> <p>Yesterday, Kildare County Council awarded a contract for the Athy distributor road to BAM Ireland.  This will allow the company to take possession of the land in the coming weeks, with construction to commence shortly afterwards.  The project is vital to Athy and the surrounding areas.  It is a project that I have continuously championed, along with my colleagues.  I am glad to see it moving forward.  I wish to issue a gentle reminder that the next important project in County Kildare is the construction of a second bridge in Newbridge.  We need to keep that on the radar.</p> <p>The third matter I raise concerns changing facilities and the need for Ireland to keep up to date with legislation in this area.  New legislation on this has been introduced in England.  In Ireland, we only have 17 publicly available changing facilities, and they are mainly in Dublin.  It is about accessibility for persons with disabilities and those who have babies and small children.  Going to the toilet is such a natural function.  To think we should have to plan our lives around that is shocking.  Funding has been provided in England for an extra 150 changing facilities a year.  Currently, there are 1,400 places in England.  Ireland pales in comparison with only 17 such facilities available.  We must call for more adequate changing facilities.</p></speech>

That is why, as a Government, we made the decision in budget 2022 to increase the fuel allowance immediately by &euro;5 a week for 28 weeks.  What may have been missed by some people is the increase in the income threshold for the means test, from &euro;100 to &euro;120, as of 1 January 2022.  This will enable many more people to qualify for what is a very important payment.</p> <p>I spoke earlier in a Commencement matter debate on disablement benefit and the fact that it is a disqualifying payment for the fuel allowance.  This issue must be addressed.  We must also ensure that those in receipt of the carer's allowance, particularly those on the half-rate payment, who meet the means-test requirements under the increased income threshold of &euro;120 are paid the fuel allowance.</p> <p>Yesterday, I spoke about the &euro;1.8 billion hole in the Opposition's alternative budget in relation to housing and its claim that it could build 20,000 public homes at a cost of &euro;3 billion.  A primary school child could tell us that &euro;240,000, which is the average cost of providing a social home in Ireland, multiplied by 20,000 is &euro;4.8 billion.  That leaves a &euro;1.8 billion hole in the Opposition's calculations.  It would be appropriate if we could schedule a debate in the House on affordable housing policy so that Opposition parties and those of us in government could outline what each of us is proposing.  Under the Housing for All plan, the Government intends to introduce two affordable schemes next year, the first home scheme and the local authority affordable purchase scheme, both of which are based on an equity model wherein the State will take an equity stake in the property being purchased to bridge the gap between the cost of the home and what has been approved in the mortgage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This contrasts greatly with what the Opposition is proposing in that you will get a mortgage for &euro;200,000 to pay off over 20 to 30 years but you will never own the land on which the house is built and you will be restricted in terms of whom you can sell the property on to.  My constituents and the people who I speak to tell me they want support to get on the property ladder and they are in favour of an equity stake being taken in the house but they do not want to be restricted in who they can sell that property on to in the future and they do not want a hold over the land on which the house is built.

In the short time available to me last night I made some points which I wish to put in context today.  I understand it is intended to convey the resolution of this House to Members of the British Parliament, specifically the House of Lords.  I have no problem with that proposition.</p> <p>Going back to what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said, it is time that we examine all the alternative ways to consider historic cases.  This House should have a considered debate on that subject where we could consider at great length what the realistic possibilities are of having a reconciliation based on some form of historic review.  For my part, I am of the view that there is little or no chance that MI5 or MI6 or, indeed, the army council of the IRA and those who are still under its sway will ever participate in an open way in some kind of truth commission.  We will never find out officially who planted the bomb in Enniskillen or who blew up this person or that person.  I do not believe we will ever get to the bottom of the Scappaticci  stakeknife issue because there are two organisations, the British security establishment and the Provisional IRA, which do not want us to find out what happened in respect of that.</p> <p>As I said last night, given that it was the case that the leadership of Sinn F&eacute;in sought immunity from criminal prosecution for IRA volunteers for their part in the Troubles during the period from 1998 to 2007, of which I have personal knowledge, we need a more honest and truthful approach to the question of whether it is only to be private soldiers in the British Army who are prosecuted for these offences while their superiors and people who are concealing the truth walk away scot-free, or whether an imbalanced, one-sided investigation of historic crimes, such as we are faced with at the moment, is really going to bring about reconciliation or is it going to make the victims of those unexplained crimes of the IRA and others feel more bitter and more alienated in the future.  It is time we had such a debate.</p></speech>

I want to mark it by honouring the contribution of women and girls to agriculture and rural community development in Ireland.  In agriculture, women have long been referred to as the invisible unpaid workforce on farms and there is plenty of evidence to back this up.  NUIG research from a few years ago indicated that women are the sole owners of just 10% of all farmland in Ireland with most of these women owning the land through marital transfer rather than succession or inheritance.  Only 4% of farms registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are in joint male and female names.  We know that one quarter of our farms' workforce is women.  These figures do not tally well for equality.  No other occupation has such an imbalance in property ownership.</p> <p>As rural women, we are not a homogenous group and I have been unfailingly inspired by so many rural women I have met.  Indeed, there are many in this Chamber.  As Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have had the opportunity and privilege to visit farms and rural enterprises throughout the country and have been lucky enough to encounter many wonderful women with unrelenting drive, determination and resilience to be innovative and industrious, to diversify and to drive on after personal trauma and difficult times.  These are daughters and sisters, widows and mothers who all striving to provide for themselves and their families in sometimes very remote rural areas.</p> <p>We are going to need every ounce of that determination and innovation as we tackle the huge climate and biodiversity crisis we face.  It is vital that we as a country continue to deliver on the sustainable development goal of gender equality with every pillar of society supporting the others.  We expect it of other countries, why not of ourselves?</p> <p>With each new land registration, herd number or farm payment in a woman's name, each new qualification she gains, each new female successor named, each business sale she makes or each rural tiktok video she posts, rural women are challenging prevailing culture.  They are challenging the future face of Ireland's rural enterprises.  I honour them all for the part they play in ensuring our young girls know of the possibilities open for them.  They have to see it to be it.</p> <p>To rural men, we need your support in this too.  I ask the farmers of Ireland why their daughters not their successors.  What can we as policymakers do to help?  How do we address that cultural bias that exists?  We need to keep young women in rural communities and farming is as good a way as any of doing this.</p> <p>Finally, to all my rural female colleagues and friends, let us enjoy our day on International Day of Rural Women and be sure to pause and admire the beauty of rural Ireland and celebrate our part within it.</p></speech>

It is transformative in terms of what it does in helping families facing real difficulties in daily life.  The dignity of knowing they have support for their loved ones and that they can plan a day or a series of days out makes a real difference in their lives.  This is something I have raised in the Seanad previously, so I would support working with Senator O'Loughlin and other colleagues into the future.</p> <p>Throughout this week a number of us have referenced the fact the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly will take place at the weekend.  A number of Members of this House and the D&aacute;il will travel to represent the Oireachtas.  There is a large, engaged and active Irish diaspora and community in Britain.  It has been a challenging and difficult time for it.  It has been an uncertain time, not least with Covid-19 and with Brexit and everything that came with that.  I call for statements on the diaspora strategy from Government.  It is timely as we have not had those statements in this term.  In regard to the diaspora, we would need to keep in mind that we need to be engaged and active on this issue beyond and around St. Patrick's Day, and that is not to demean or belittle anything that is done around St. Patrick's Day.  It is a very important time for the State and for all of us.  If Covid-19 has shown one thing, it has shown that we can be connected in ways that we never had before.  There is an opportunity for us all to engage with the diaspora using new technological means.</p> <p>I have long advocated in this House for the referendum to extend presidential voting rights to the diaspora and citizens in the North.  That remains a very live and active call.  That is perhaps something the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for the diaspora could update us on.  As we emerge and reconnect, please God, post-pandemic, it would be timely that we have an update on the strategy and on how the Government and the State support services throughout the world are engaging with the  diaspora to ensure it has all the support and help needed to get back on its feet, whether business organisations, cultural organisations or our Irish community.</p></speech>

My home town has been waiting a long time for this announcement.  It is great news and has been widely welcomed by the people of Athy.  All we want now is to see the diggers on the ground - the sooner, the better.  I also support colleagues in regard to the construction of a second bridge in Newbridge, which is essential for the growth of the town.</p><p>I wish to raise two issues with the Leader.  The first is the lack of garda&iacute; in the south Kildare area, which causes problems both for morale in the force and in the interactions with the Garda stations in our communities.  We all welcome the allocation of an additional 800 garda&iacute;, as announced in the budget, however, the communities in Kildare South want to see the garda&iacute; on the beat, on their streets and in their communities.  They want to hear a local Garda on the phone when they ring their local station, rather than being transferred to a station in another town.  It is safe to say that the garda&iacute; themselves want to ensure that their units are at full capacity and are not left without the adequate cover to perform their duties.</p><p>In Athy Garda station, I am told we have 11 regular garda&iacute; who are trying to service four units.  Each unit should have a minimum of five regular garda&iacute;, however, Athy station has only 11 and is, therefore, short nine garda&iacute; in these units, at a minimum.  Historically, and for some reason it has never been explained, the number of garda&iacute; per head of population in Kildare South has always been among the lowest in the State.  This must change given the expanding population in the towns of Newbridge, Kildare, Athy, Rathangan and Monasterevin.  Each of these towns has a growing population and needs additional garda&iacute;.  Will the Leader arrange a discussion with the Minister for Justice on policing and Garda numbers?</p><p>The second item I wish to raise is an issue I have previously raised with the Leader.  It is the urgent need to record the location of all automated external defibrillator, AED, lifesaving devices, for which many communities around the country have fundraised.  There are some wonderful initiatives in place around the country, such as in Enniscorthy and in Laois where they have developed apps that show the exact location of these defibrillators.  During a Commencement matter debate, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Frankie Feighan, informed me that I had given him the chance to speak about the exceptional work carried out by those in these communities and that he expected &quot;that the funding provided by the Government in 2021 will result in real progress in the development of an AED register, and the HSE is already making progress on some of the practical elements that need to be [done] in that regard.&quot;  However, when following up on this progress, my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, received the following reply from the Minister of Health this week, four months on:</p> <blockquote> 	The location, maintenance and upkeep of these devices is a matter for the supplying organisations.  The HSE is not responsible for the supply or upkeep of AEDs. As such, an AED register would not be within the scope of the Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest Strategy. </blockquote> <p>I know the Leader has supported the tremendous work of first responders in this country and the wonderful groups who fundraise in their communities to provide these AEDs.  There is something seriously wrong here and I would appreciate it if she would follow up with the Minister, as this is an essential national life-saving service.</p></speech>

A month ago, many Members of this House and the D&aacute;il went out in support of the Union of Students in Ireland when it held a demonstration to highlight the issue of housing poverty in the student population, the unaffordability of student accommodation and concerns about a the conversion of purpose-built student accommodation to short-term lets.  I met with representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland and they welcomed the Housing for All strategy and the multi-annual funding that this Government has committed to address the housing crisis.  They specifically welcomed: the fact that Housing for All gives powers to the technical universities to build not-for-profit purpose-built student accommodation; the innovations made in regard to the rent controls and the legally binding rent caps introduced by this Government; the fact that it can no longer be demanded of students to pay six-months' or a year's rent in advance; that payments up front are limited to two months; and that they have extra protection in regard to their notice periods.</p> <p>They welcomed of all those initiatives, however, they have another concern.  In the recent budget, they were pleased with the increases in the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant and the modifications to the qualifying threshold in that regard.  More than 72,000 students will qualify for the SUSI grant this year.  They are concerned that a holistic approach has not been taken by the Minister and the Department on the funding of third level education.  Will the Leader invite the Minister with responsibility for third level education to come to the House  to address the issue of the funding of third level education and, in particular, the enabling of the third level institutions to provide not-for-profit purpose-built student accommodation.</p></speech>

That is a welcome move, however, at the same time we recognise that there are many other pages online that are ignored by Facebook, such as pages that spread misinformation and abuse about which nothing is done.  A great feature of the Internet is that it is a forum for free speech and people can express what they think and what they like.  On the one hand that is wonderful while on the other hand it is enormously damaging.  Whatever about the Internet, social media platforms have become a very toxic place for many people and the difference between these platforms and the Internet, crucially, is that they have owners, moderators, editors and people who are in charge of them.  In many instances in regard to those pages, the owners, moderators and editors are doing absolutely nothing to safeguard their users.  Platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, have become toxic places for many people, and all Members of this House have been the victims of pile-on harassment, whereby abuse is piled on a person due to something he or she said that is unpopular with a particular group.  It is notable that when that person is a woman, the abuse is invariably sexualised, and the threats and abuse targeted particularly at females in the public eye is notable for the nature of its content.  We all suffer with it but there is a particular focus on females in the public eye.</p> <p>I have reported many tweets that Twitter subsequently informs me are not in breach of its terms and conditions.  I do not understand this because the tweets propagated misogyny as well as defamation, etc., against men and women in the public eye.  We should put greater pressure on those platforms to takes some of the responsibility.  Many of them are quite proactive, such as YouTube which responded to laws passed by Congress on copyright.  It is very quick in removing content if it fears an action may be taken.  In this country, social media platforms appear to act with impunity.  We should have a debate because enough is enough.  The users of social media platforms are being damaged by the material that is put online and we as a Legislature must seek a debate on that subject.</p></speech>

The paltry &euro;35 million allocation in the budget for the Defence Forces for next year will only cover the increase in salaries as result of the most recent round of public service negotiations.  Last week, we were hosted in Haulbowline, Cork, the Naval Service depot, by the flag officer and his entire team.  It is absolutely appalling what is going on.  Seven of our nine ships were tied up last Friday in Haulbowline, while there are European vessels coming into Irish coastal waters to patrol Irish fishery areas.  Have we no pride left whatsoever in this country or in the services we offer?  Sailors at sea receives &euro;56 per day, which is subject to tax, PRSI, the universal social charge, etc.  They therefore come out with about &euro;22.  If they take a fisheries officer on board with them, that fisheries officer will get the full Civil Service overnight rate which amounts to about &euro;147 tax-free, as will a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if on board that ship.  Where is the equity in that scenario?</p> <p>I have been harping on about the Defence Forces for the last seven years and I am getting tired of it.  We had an incredible meeting last Friday where the flag officer took the initiative to step back and allow his people talk to us without interference from commissioned officers or those at the top.  We heard pride among the men and women we spoke to.  They had pride in the service they were charged with.  Later in the day, a captain of a ship said that when the crew go to sea, at each rating they have four different rates of pay because of allowances that were introduced.  That is not equitable and cannot last.  Thus, I am afraid we are looking at the death of the Defence Forces - the Naval Service, the Army, and the Air Corps - in the coming years.  In two or three years, at most, we will no longer have a Naval Service.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P.

I welcome in particular the greater staffing in terms of special needs assistants, with funding provided for more than 1,100 special needs assistants.  There will be 980 new special education teachers, 620 of whom will provide additional support for children attending mainstream classes, including in new and expanding schools.  Funding has also been provided for an additional 360 posts to facilitate the opening of 287 new special classes.  The latter will provide more than 1,700 new places and 140 new special school places in 2022.</p> <p>Senators of all parties and none will appreciate how much these additional resources are needed.  Like other Senators, since the beginning of the pandemic I have spoken about the particularly damaging impact that lockdown has had on children and their families.  The parents of children attending these schools and classes have told me about the regression that lockdown caused - and continues to cause in some instances - for children and the incredible strain it has put on their families.  While lockdowns involving the closure of schools are hopefully a thing of the past, the families of these children have spoken passionately about the need for greater resources in schools and classrooms.</p> <p>Having spoken to the Minister of Education about the matter on a number of occasions, I know she is very aware of the issue and was determined to ensure that additional resources were allocated in budget 2022 in order that these children and their families will have greater resources in the years ahead.  I commend her on ensuring that such resources were allocated.  I would be grateful of the Leader of the House would invite the Minister for Education to Seanad &Eacute;ireann in the coming weeks in order that we may have the opportunity to discuss this and other matters in more detail.</p></speech>

The shortages affect many sectors.  I will go through just a few of them.  In respect of agriculture, there is intensive pig farming in County Cavan.  The processing sector there is experiencing shortages such that batches of pigs cannot be sent for processing to create new stock.  This is creating a nightmare scenario in the sector.  In the dairy sector, a few hundred farms assistants are needed across the country.  My good friend from Cork, Senator Lombard, will be much more <i>au fait</i>with that than I am, but it is the case.  It is the same right throughout the agriculture sector.</p><p>According to F&aacute;ilte Ireland, two thirds of businesses in the hospitality sector are underperforming because of a lack of labour.  The shortage is also affecting nursing homes and the entire health service.  When home help packages are approved, there is nobody to provide the care.</p><p>Obviously, we must be solution-focused in our efforts.  There is no point in identifying the problem and not seeking to solve it.  Therefore, we need to fast-track work permit applications from those outside the country immediately.  I understand that quite a number of applications are being processed.  They must be fast-tracked.  We are trying to eliminate the direct provision system, and rightly so.  However, we need to fast-track the direct provision process.  Asylum seekers who come into the country should, within reason, be brought into the labour force as quickly as possible.</p><p>I ask the Leader to advocate for a holistic and whole-of-Government radical approach in respect of this issue and ensure that it is done.  This is a most serious matter.  It is particularly serious in view of the fact that there are people from non-EAA countries who are willing to come into the State.  If they are willing to come to this country to work, it is shocking that we cannot speed up the process and get them here immediately.  I look forward to hearing the Leader's response in respect of this crucial issue.  I could cite more examples chapter and verse, but now is not the time.  I will provide them if required, however.</p></speech>

I respectfully suggest that it might be connected to the last topic that my good friend and colleague, Senator O'Reilly, raised.  One of the big issues we have in this country, of which the Leader will be aware, is that we have the largest proportion of workers on low pay of any country in the EU, at 23%.  Indeed, it was a topic that was explored by my colleague, Patricia King, of SIPTU.  She quoted the papers produced by the Government's own tax strategy group, which estimated that 750,000 employees earned less than &euro;400 per week in 2019.  That represents 31% of the total class A PRSI employees.  What that means, in essence, is that many people who work for a living are unable to earn a living.  We know this because they are paid significantly below a living wage.</p> <p>As the Cathaoirleach will know, the living wage for next year has been increased to &euro;12.90 because of the significant increase in the cost of living that everyone in the country is facing currently.  I do not want to fight the budget battle again but I call for a debate on this particular topic.  The reality is that while I welcome the 30 cent rise in the minimum wage, if you take the Government's record as a whole over the first two budgets, then you realise that the total increase in the minimum wage has been 40 cent.  This means that over the scheduled five budgets of this Government, we are at best are on course for a &euro;1 rise in the minimum wage.  That will leave us further behind the living wage than ever.  I know the T&aacute;naiste has spoken about moving to a living wage, and I welcome that.  It will not happen without a significant step change in current budgetary policy, including these first two budgets.</p> <p>My colleague, Senator Joe O'Reilly, mentioned nursing homes.  As a trade union organiser, I can tell Members that there is a reason why nursing homes cannot get staff.  It is because they are not allowed to organise, they are not allowed trade union representation and they are paid appallingly.  Unfortunately, that goes for a number of other sectors to which the Senator referred.  That, in turn, raises an issue to which I keep returning, namely, that of collective bargaining.  Until we have collective bargaining rights in this country and until working men and women can organise themselves and have trade union representation, the scourge of low pay will be with us.  I urge the Leader to organise a debate on this topic.</p></speech>

I know that many people wish to continue going into bars and restaurants over the winter months, but the prospect of sitting beside unvaccinated groups in the absence of public health restrictions makes many people feel very uncomfortable and could limit business within the hospitality sector.  Among constituents and business owners I have spoken to, there is a general consensus that retaining the use of digital Covid certificates during the winter months for entrance to caf&eacute;s, bars and restaurants would be a smart idea.</p> <p>It would provide peace of mind for customers and ensure that those who have enjoyed indoor dining over the past few months will continue to support their local hospitality businesses during the winter.  The continuation of the use of digital Covid certificates would also act as an incentive for those still unvaccinated to go and get the vaccine.  At the moment, a disproportionate number of those entering hospital with Covid-19 are from a small sector of the adult population that remains unvaccinated.  While less than 10% of our population is unvaccinated, the group to which I refer is driving approximately 50% of all hospital admissions.  We must ensure that public health is protected during the winter months and that people feel comfortable going into hospitality environments in order that business remains strong for caf&eacute;s, restaurants and bars in the period ahead.</p> <p>The digital Covid certificate system has worked extremely well to date.  Business owners are familiar with the set-up and customers are now well used to presenting their certificates before they sit down.  The continuation of the system is a win-win for customers and business owners alike, and will act as an incentive for people to go and get vaccinated.  It is important to state that people have a choice of getting vaccinated or not.  That is right and proper, and is the correct thing to do.  However, we, as a Government, have a responsibility to protect the 93% of the population who have chosen to get vaccinated and be protected.  It is important, over the winter months, that we protect those people so that they can have as normal a life as possible, albeit with some restrictions still in place.  The digital Covid certificate is a key element of that.  It supports businesses, because there are still many people who will not come back into those settings because they are still nervous.  If we get rid of the certificate, it will increase their nervousness.  I stress the need to continue with the use of the digital Covid certificate system, which has been in place for a number of months, after Friday of next week.</p></speech>

We still have a major logjam in the system.  Forestry licences are not being issued, which is having a knock-on effect for landowners and farmers, as well as the price of timber in the building market.  I understand prices have risen by 45%, which is significantly increasing the cost of building new houses.  That has an effect on people with mortgages, etc.  If the Minister came before the House, we could introduce whatever further legislation is required to deal with that. </p><p>As I travel home by the canal, I have noticed the evenings are becoming dark.  I was struck by the large number of people on bicycles, tricycles, mopeds or whatever else.  I would estimate that not even 10% are wearing yellow vests, highlight themselves or have lights.  It is a danger to be a driver trying to get through Dublin at the minute.  I am sure it is the same in all other cities.  I want to highlight that.  Perhaps we should consider legislation to deal with this, because there is nothing to deal with people who are not wearing yellow vests.  As I said, it is a danger for those driving out of the city at present.  People are jogging or running or are using mopeds.  I want to highlight that issue.</p></speech>

I understand there are approximately 127,000 farms in Ireland, one eighth of which are owned or operated by females.  We had a really interesting discussion on this issue at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 21 September.  More debate and acknowledgement of it is required.  Maybe we could use this good Chamber to have such a debate and bring the women's forum involved in agriculture before us.  That would be a good meeting.</p> <p>I also raise the issue of sports capital grants and the budget.  Realistically, there is a call for &euro;200 million for sporting projects under the current call for funding for clubs.  Of the &euro;40 million allotted in the previous budget, &euro;12 million has been spent, which means that &euro;28 million is left.  There is a deficit in the fund, to say the least.  Funding projects is a huge issue.  Projects give communities the ability to empower themselves and provide local amenities for children and adults.  During Covid times, we saw the benefit of having such amenities.  A debate on sports capital grants and the allocation provided for in the budget, in particular through the Finance Bill, would be very welcome.  If we get the budget for this right, it will have an impact on every village and town in Ireland.</p></speech>

This morning, the committee heard from various wheelchair users, including a fantastic woman, Ms Karen Smith, from Changing Places Ireland, and Ms Bernadette Egan, who is an architect.  I want to read a small piece of what Ms Egan had to say about what happens when she goes out and about on a daily basis.  She said she faces difficulties most people take for granted, and went on to say:</p> <blockquote> 	Will the entrance door be too heavy and awkward to open or is there an out-of-order platform lift?  Will I need to search for a key for the &quot;accessible&quot; toilet?  Will it be too small for my motorised wheelchair, and will I need to jostle the bins or get hit over the head by a loose drop-down rail?  If there is a fire, will I wait for someone to find me and try to slide me on a deckchair down a steep staircase?  These are just a small sample of the questions about the accessibility of the built environment I try to answer before leaving home as I attempt to map out my day mentally. </blockquote> <p>People with disabilities who live among us have lived experiences that we do not see.  We have a list of things, such accessibility to buildings, lifts and toilets, and we think that is enough.  That is not enough for a truly inclusive and equal society.  Everybody has to be able to do ordinary things every day, such as go to a caf&eacute; or supermarket and meet friends without facing a plethora of worries that have to be negotiated before even having to deal with the incumbrance of his or her disability.  This House is the place to get that conversation started, and I ask that we facilitate a debate on that.</p></speech>

There is a shortage across all enterprises in Ireland.  I ask the Leader to raise the matter with the relevant Minister because a solution is badly needed.</p> <p>I call for a debate on Irish Water.  It is now six or seven years since the organisation was set up and it would be timely to have a debate on it in the House.  Between 2021 and 2025, &euro;6 billion will be spent on water services infrastructure the length and breadth of the country.  How is further expansion planned?  Does the issue come up at local authority meetings?  I do not see it raised in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Local councillors know exactly where growth is taking place.  I often wonder how one would apply for an extension to a sewerage or water scheme and how applications progress from the point where such works are needed to the planning stage.  I do not see any great strategy or purpose in how things are done.  I do not think this issue is being raised at local authority meetings.  I would like a debate on it because a significant sum of money, &euro;6 billion, will be spent on water infrastructure in the next four years.  We could have a review of Irish Water, ask how it has progressed, the amount of money it has saved and the advances it has made over the past six or seven years.  I would welcome a debate on this issue.</p></speech>

I ask the Leader to convene the House early for such a debate.  There is a rising number of Covid cases and, to paraphrase, the virus is on a new trajectory.</p> <p>It is important that all of us use appropriate language.  Statistics do not lie.  Dr. Anne O'Connor stated that the 10% of the adult population who are unvaccinated are driving 50% of admissions in hospitals.  That is a stark figure on which we should all reflect.  I appeal to all of Members, as leaders, to urge those who are unvaccinated to get vaccinated.  I am a civil libertarian and appreciate the rights of individuals, but it is important that we have a measured debate on the lifting of our Covid restrictions on 22 October.</p> <p>I believe we should go ahead with the reopening of the country but, like Senator Ahearn, we should keep the Covid app and certificate as part of what we are doing.  I cannot comprehend the approach of NPHET and the Government regarding face masks.  We either have them for retail and public transport or we do not have them at all.</p> <p>We should have a measured reopening and a proper conversation about it.  I appeal to members of the Cabinet to step away from the microphones between now and the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday and not add to the tension and hype.  Let us give certainty to the hospitality sector which has been decimated.  Let us all appeal to those who are unvaccinated to get vaccinated.  It is a public health issue.  I appreciate the rights of individuals not to get vaccinated, but the fact that 10% of the adult population is driving 50% of hospital admissions tells its own story.</p></speech>

I want to build on the comments of Senators Ahearn and Buttimer.  The figures do not lie.  Professor Philip Nolan spoke on the radio this morning.  Everybody is calling for certainty, but unfortunately if certainty was given today, it might be the wrong certainty.  It might be the certainty people do not want to hear.</p> <p>I agree with everything Senator Ahearn and, in particular, Senator Buttimer said.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask people who have not been vaccinated to please think about it again.  I ask them to think about it not just for themselves but for their families, elderly relatives, brothers, sisters, children, neighbours and the people they interact with in supermarkets and shops, on public transport, in the workplace and anywhere else they may go.</p><p>It is so awful to hear of people who decided not to get the vaccine and, especially in America and Britain, the Covid-19 deniers who think that it will not happen to them.  On YouTube, there are videos of such people saying that they wish they had got the vaccine.  The vaccine is available and free.  More than 7.2 million doses have been given to the Irish population and we know it works.  I think I heard Dr. Colm Henry at the weekend saying that 67% of the people in intensive care units had not received a vaccine and 3% or more had only received one dose of vaccine.  Most of the people in intensive care units have not been vaccinated, despite us having the highest vaccination rate in the EU and almost in the world.  I give credit to all the people involved for that, as well as the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and the Government in general.  All those healthcare workers have helped to do this.</p><p>If people have not been vaccinated, I ask them to think about it again.  The risks from getting Covid-19 are far greater than the risks from being vaccinated.  They are multiple times greater.  I ask all the influencers and celebrities to advocate for this.  They all have their own followers and they bring people with them.  This is not necessarily about young or older people but it goes right across society.  It is about 300,000 people in the qualifying population - children are not in that population.  They have decided, for whatever reason, not to be vaccinated.  That cohort comprises the vast bulk of people in intensive care units.  Some of them will die, which is terrible for them, their friends, families and everyone they might leave behind.  I urge people to think about it and to please get the vaccine.  As the phrase goes, it is for all of us.</p></speech>

My mother was a powerful force on our farm and 30-odd years ago she was probably the only woman in the mart able to reverse a tractor and trailer.  That is changing, however.  I was involved in the visit of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, to County Galway.  He was at Maam Cross mart last night and there were quite a few women in attendance, along with quite a few men.  They were farmers who wanted to hear what he wanted to say.  Ms Maria Walsh MEP also attended and spoke about the importance of women's voices in agriculture.  The Minister will meet women to highlight this importance in the forthcoming Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations.</p> <p>As Fine Gael spokesperson on further and higher education, I look forward to attending the UCD Student Union meeting this evening to discuss Government support for students accessing affordable accommodation.  In the budget, through the Department led by the Minister for Further and Higher, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, we have increased the income eligibility criteria for the SUSI grant by &euro;1,000 and added &euro;200 to the grant while decreasing the distances applying to the adjacent grant from 45 km to 30 km.</p> <p>I also highlight the Global Wave of Light.  In Ballinasloe, Portiuncula University Hospital will join many others illuminated by pink and blue light tomorrow, Friday, 15 October, from 7 p.m. to mark pregnancy and infant loss.  Throughout Ireland and across the world landmarks and buildings will be lit by a pink and blue light as part of a continuous wave to recognise, acknowledge and remember babies who have passed away due to miscarriage, stillbirth, neonatal death and other causes of infant loss.  The Global Wave of Light asks all of us, including families, loved ones and supporting organisations, to join together in remembrance.  I hope I speak for all my Senator colleagues in saying that our thoughts are with women, their partners and families who suffered this type of loss.</p></speech>

Not only could my mother do that as well but she could drive a stake and tell all the lads how to do that properly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1653" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#M00400"><p>It is funny that the Cathaoirleach is congratulating a woman on being able to drive a tractor because the vast majority of women on farms in rural Ireland know well how to drive tractors.  They drive them on a weekly or daily basis.  Senator Dolan, along with Senator Tim Lombard and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, mentioned that International Day of Rural Women will be celebrated this weekend.  Any of us with any relations involved with farming know the absolutely enormous contribution that women and their daughters play in the running of farms, food production and the love and care of the land we have seen over generations and decades in this country.  I hope each and every one of them gets a day off this weekend, which would be very unusual in the world of farming.  They should be honoured and enjoy the weekend.</p> <p>Senators Garret Ahearn, Jerry Buttimer and Gerry Horkan raised this morning the concerns raised about Covid-19, and perhaps hyped a little by the media, given there can be a frenzy to grab a Minister and hope he or she would say something wrong.  We know 22 October is a day many Irish people have been looking forward to.  To put the matter in context, the NPHET models released in August indicated an expected increase in hospital numbers, including those in intensive care units, in October and November.  We had a spike yesterday and the day before that will cause concern.  Nevertheless, the reported numbers are currently tracking the most optimistic scenarios from August's models.  We need to temper the comments somewhat.</p> <p>Senator Horkan is right, nonetheless, in saying it is shocking that 70,000 people got their first jab and did not bother showing up for whatever reason to get the second dose.  What is really concerning is that because of the 300,000 people who may have made the conscious decision not to get a vaccine, we must now have a debate as to whether society will allow those 300,000 people who have made that personal choice to put everybody else's health in jeopardy.  Senator Horkan is correct that we must have a conversation about it.  The schedule for next week has already been agreed, but I will do my best to try to put something in the schedule next week so we can have a conversation about what the people we represent feel about this and would like to see happen.</p> <p>Senators Burke and Joe O'Reilly both mentioned a matter this morning that has been raised on the Commencement on a number of occasions.  We have a shocking shortage of people to work in particular industries, including agriculture, hospitality and healthcare.  I recently visited a farm in north County Dublin where an entire crop of scallions had to be left in the ground because there was no labour to harvest them.  That is criminal.  To answer this, we can first look at the 100,000 people still on the pandemic unemployment payment and try to find out why they are still on it in light of the fact that all of our industries are open.  We should absolutely fast-track a permit system for the people across Europe and further afield who want to come to work in our agriculture and hospitality sectors and healthcare service.  I support the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, in the work he is doing to ensure that can be fast-tracked.</p> <p>Senator Burke also asked for a debate on Irish Water.  I will try to arrange that as quickly as possible.</p> <p>Senator Mary Seery-Kearney spoke about the work of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters this morning and the lived experience we all take for granted when we do not really know how much preparation and stress is involved with many people's lives just to do what she described as ordinary.  I will organise a debate on that.  I heard the Minister say the cost of disability report will be published at end of this month so I might wait so we could have a full and lengthy debate on the reality of the costs affecting these people's lives and what must be remedied by the State.</p> <p>Senator Miche&aacute;l Carrigy spoke about the very obvious reaction we would have expected yesterday from the Friends of the Earth in pointing out that Bord na M&oacute;na exported for the first seven months of this year before it ceased harvesting.  That was simply because it had contracts it had to fulfil.  I am not sure if Friends of the Earth was suggesting that those contracts should have been breached.  We absolutely know there is no peat in Ireland for the moment for the producers that need it.  We described here last night the untenable position of having to ask businesses to import peat of a lower grade that will output a lower grade of product from Ireland than we have been used to.  It will also increase our carbon footprint, so it is a lose-lose position for everybody, and we all recognise that we must find a resolution to that.</p> <p>The Senator raised a concern, given that the nights are getting darker, that people are putting their lives at risk by not lighting up when walking, cycling, scooting or skating.  We must highlight that matter and I will try to have a debate on road safety in the next couple of weeks if possible.</p> <p>Senator Gavan spoke about low pay and the need for a debate around the living wage.  The Senator knows that the Low Pay Commission has been set up to determine what should be the minimum wage every year.  We are given the specific directions for the target at the end of the programme for Government and it knows where we want to get to.  The Senator is correct, however, in saying the time is running out for us to get there.  It might be worth sending a letter as a gentle reminder but I can genuinely say the commitment stands, as I was the one who made it in the first instance.  It follows through into this programme for Government but the Senator is correct to highlight that the time is running out.</p> <p>Senator Craughwell spoke about the very welcome additions to the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but highlights a stark difference in what he sees as &euro;35 million being put into the Defence Forces.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a debate request in with the Minister.  I know the Senator is aware of that.</p><p>Senator Crowe asked for a debate on education, particularly the welcome additional announcements this week of 1,100 special needs assistants and 980 new special education teachers.  I will do that as quickly as I can.</p><p>Senator Fitzpatrick talked about her interactions with the students' unions over recent weeks and how much they have welcomed all the new announcements in the budget in recent days.</p><p>Senator Wall talked about the increase in the numbers of garda&iacute; in the budget but expressed concerns about the numbers allocated to south Kildare.  As I think he will be aware, that is an operational matter so I cannot interfere with it.  He might write to the Commissioner himself to make him aware of the concerns of the people of south Kildare.  Senator Wall also welcomed the contract for the Athy distributor road finally being awarded, as did the Fianna F&aacute;il leader this morning, Senator O'Loughlin.  I am sure they will welcome the boots on the ground when they see them, as will the people both Senators represent.</p><p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile spoke of the BIPA meeting this weekend and the Irish diaspora strategy statements request.  That is a really good idea, so I will try to arrange that as quickly as I can.</p><p>Senator McDowell, as eloquently as only he can, made a really thoughtful and considered debate request.  I will put it to the relevant Minister.  I cannot promise the Senator I will get a positive response to the request, given the nature of the debate and given that the contributions from some quarters might elicit certain emotional feelings at a time when they might not necessarily be welcomed by other contributors.  The Senator is right, however, that we must have an honest conversation.  It cannot be honest and pleasing only to one set of people affected by the atrocities of the legacy of that period.  I certainly will ask for the debate because it would be a valuable one and I would really enjoy listening and, I hope, contributing to it.  I will come back to the Senator.</p><p>Senator Ahearn raised the means test increase.  It will allow a considerable number of families to access the fuel allowance, on which families definitely rely.  That in itself should tell us its own story, that is, that people need to rely on the allowance because of cost increases.  We all need to be mindful of that.</p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il lead speaker today opened the Order of Business by talking about international e-waste.  The flippancy of some people today is such that when something breaks they just throw it in the bin and get a new one.  I had to get my washing machine fixed in recent weeks for the third time in about three months and the man said to me, "Would you not just throw it out?"  No, I will not just throw it out.  It is a very important issue for the Senator to highlight, so I thank her for making people aware of it.</p><p>I ask the Chair to indulge me.  Nobody raised this but I would like to raise it.  All Senators are aware that a group of wonderful, thoughtful women established an organisation called #BetterMaternityCare over recent months because of inequalities in access to care, particularly the discrimination against the partners of women having babies in our 19 maternity hospitals.  They took to our streets last week and were supported by all Senators, and I thank everybody for going out to them.  In some way, leaders in this country, particularly healthcare leaders, thought that that would be the end of it, that we had had our day and had our say and that we would go back to doing the normal things we all have to do.  This week a lady called Breege O'Connor gave birth to her second Covid baby.  She is a wonderful woman and gave birth to a lovely little baby boy.  The reason I highlight this is that she had to have her entire labour period in the car park of the Coombe Hospital.  What she was offered was to come in on her own and leave her husband in the car or walk up and down the car park of the Coombe Hospital to suffer her labour on her own with no pain relief or support.  She was left in the car park by the people in the Coombe Hospital until just before she was ready to give birth to her little son and was at that stage brought in.  I do not know how anybody in this country can think that is acceptable, but what is really bizarre is that the treatment she and her husband received is absolutely okay under the HSE guidelines that were issued on 13 September.  I want to put down a marker here to say it is absolutely not okay for any woman at any stage of her labour period to undergo labour and suffer pain in the car park of any hospital in this country.  It is an unfit service, it is reprehensible, and I would nearly go so far as to say it is inhumane that we would ask any woman to make a choice between coming into the hospital on her own or staying in a car park to go through labour just because she needs to stay with her husband.  It needs to stop now.</p></speech>

In summary, the two amending agreements provided for the reform of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, as well as the introduction of the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, SRF, from January 2022, two years ahead of schedule.  I will provide more detail on the content of the amending agreements, as well as the Bill, during the course of my opening statement.  This represents a significant political development following protracted political discussions and is a substantial milestone in the development of economic and monetary union.</p> <p>The background is that the ESM treaty was originally signed on 2 February 2021, establishing the ESM as an international financial institution to be funded by capital contributions from ESM members.  Our participation in the ESM was approved by the Oireachtas in 2012.  The direct recapitalisation instrument was designed at the height of the euro area crisis when the banking union was still in its infancy.  As the House is aware, this instrument has never been used and has to a great extent become outmoded due to the development of the bank resolution legal and institutional framework.</p> <p>On 18 December 2013, Ministers agreed on the need for a common backstop to the SRF.  At the euro summit of June 2018, Heads of State and Government agreed the ESM would provide the backdrop to the SRF itself.  Leaders then asked the Eurogroup to continue with work on this.  This is what we did and, leading on from that, in December 2018, the terms of reference for the common backstop were then agreed by Heads of Government.</p> <p>What is in this proposed treaty reform?  There are four complementary and mutually enforcing building blocks.  The centrepiece of ESM treaty reform is the establishment of a common backstop to the SRF, with the ESM as the provider.  It will be available as a last resort to support effective and credible crisis management within the Single Resolution Mechanism, SRM.  Loans from the backstop to the SRF will be repaid via contributions from the European banking sector.  There will be no use of taxpayers' money.  The size of the credit line will be aligned with the level of SRF funds, which is set at 1% of the deposits in the banking union, with a cap of &euro;68 billion.  </p> <p>The second element is the early introduction of a common backstop.  The Eurogroup agreed to the entry into force of the common backstop two years ahead of schedule, at the beginning of 2022.  This is a very significant development and an important step towards completing banking union.  </p> <p>The intergovernmental agreement established a transitional period of eight years, during which time national contributions would be progressively mutualised into a common fund.  In other words, in the early years of this agreement, levies collected nationally were to be ring-fenced, applied for the benefit of institutions from the relevant States that are making the contribution.  These are referred to as national compartments.  These compartments are being steadily mutualised and will be fully mutualised by 2024.  A point to note is if there is no recourse to the backstop during the remaining term of the transitional period, there will, in effect, have been no substantive change to the resolution framework. </p> <p>Following the November agreement, EU ambassadors signed the amending agreements to the treaty in January 2021.  My Department received legal advice that the legislation that implemented the original agreement should be amended.  That is why we are in the Seanad today.  The early introduction of the common backstop will bring real benefits and real stability to the European banking sector.  It will protect taxpayers' resources.  The size of the contribution that will be supplied by each member state was estimated in November 2014.  Ours will be, or was at that point, &euro;1.815 billion.  However, following a review of risks in the European banking system our contribution was revised downwards to &euro;815 million.</p> <p>The second element is the reform of the precautionary conditioned credit line, PCCL.  This involves the modernisation of the ESM's financial assistance toolkit.  This credit line is being reformed to enhance its effectiveness in order to prevent minor crises from developing into more serious ones.  This is fundamental to any ESM member whose economic and financial situation is fundamentally sound, but could be affected by a shock that may end up being beyond its control.</p> <p>The third element of treaty reform provides for a stronger future role for the ESM in the design, negotiation and monitoring of future financial assistance programmes.  The existing treaty allocates the various tasks in the ESM's operations to the European Commission, the European Central Bank, ECB, and the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  The reality is the IMF, over time, has stepped back from this work.  The treaty amendment regarding the enhanced role of the ESM is, therefore, necessary so there is certainty regarding the roles of the institutions should a member state require assistance.</p> <p>The fourth and final element of ESM treaty reform concerns the debt sustainability framework in the context of ESM financial assistance.  A key principle of the ESM since its establishment is that financial assistance should only be provided by the ESM to member states whose debt is considered sustainable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Three improvements are being made.  First, a new common methodology for conducting the debt sustainability analysis of a prospective programme country has been jointly developed by the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and the European Commission.  The second is an improvement to the debt sustainability framework via the introduction of single-limb collective action clauses.  This allows for changes to the terms of the bonds to be made subject to a vote by the holders of the bonds.  If a majority approves a change, it becomes effective for all the bonds.  The final improvement involves changing the role of the ESM to facilitate dialogue between a member state and its private investors.</p><p>I will quickly address the content of the Bill.  Section 1 deals with definitions in the legislation.  Section 2 provides for the approval of the ratification of the agreement amending the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism by the Oireachtas.  Section 3 provides for an update of Ireland's paid-in capital to the ESM following the end of the temporary correction periods for three of the founding ESM members, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia.  This section also provides for amendments to the European Stability Mechanism Act 2012, including a new definition of "Treaty".</p><p>Section 4 provides for amendments to the European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Act 2014.  Section 5, titled "Approval of terms of Intergovernmental Agreement", provides for the approval of the ratification of the Single Resolution Fund intergovernmental agreement amending agreement.  Section 6 provides for amendments to the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 and redefines "Agreement" in the legislation.  Section 7 provides that any expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  Section 8 is a standard section defining the short Title of the Bill. </p><p>There are three Schedules in this Bill, each composed of two parts.  Schedule 1 is the amending agreement to the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism.  Schedule 2 is the text of the treaty.  Schedule 3 is the intergovernmental agreement.</p><p>As I mentioned at the outset, the purpose of this Bill is to seek the approval of the Oireachtas to ratify two amending agreements agreed by the Eurogroup last November.  That agreement to reform the ESM treaty and to bring forward the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund is an important step forward.   When the agreement is implemented early next year, it will make our monetary union more resilient, will boost confidence in tour ability to quell a crisis before it develops and will strengthen the crisis resolution capabilities of the euro area, should they be required.  I will conclude my opening remarks here and look forward to the debate.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on a very busy 48 hours.  That is a very short time but I know the Minister put in a lot of work previously.  Well done on the budget and best wishes for the future.</p> <p>We are here today looking at amendments to the Eurogroup agreements that were signed off on last November.  These relate to the European Stability Mechanism and the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, which is to come into effect in January 2022.  Ireland has certainly been to the forefront and very proactive in making sure that the euro is sound and that there is competitiveness and great stability.  It is a great breakthrough that we are looking at this two years earlier than was expected.  The Minister is to be complimented on managing to get a reduction for Ireland.  No state will be able to borrow if not considered able to pay those funds back and that is to be welcomed.  The Minister said that this is not going to cost the taxpayer any money.  That is really significant because there was some misinformation out there.  I welcome that.  </p> <p>Much of the Bill is technical but the early introduction is certainly to be welcomed.  We are now to pay &euro;815 million where we were to pay &euro;1.815 billion and the Minister is to be complimented on achieving that reduction because it took an awful lot of work on behalf of Ireland to negotiate those terms.  The Minister and his team have worked tirelessly to put forward Ireland's case.  I wish this Bill all the best.  I also wish the Minister all the best in his endeavours.</p></speech>

The poorest 30% of families will see the greatest gains from Tuesday's budget.  That goes to show that fairness was at the heart of that budget.</p> <p>The Bill before us today is rather technical.  We will be supporting this Bill, which ratifies the amending agreements on the European Stability Mechanism treaty, the Single Resolution Fund and the intergovernmental agreement.  The agreement reforming the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, treaty signed in January is a crucial stepping stone on the path to reinforcing economic monetary union and is a significant accompaniment to our efforts to support economic recovery which will boost confidence in the euro area's ability to quash crises before they escalate.  All euro area members are required to ratify both amending agreements in order to implement the Eurogroup agreement from November 2020 with regard to the ESM treaty reforms and the introduction of the common backstop two years ahead of schedule, which has to be welcomed.</p> <p>Most of the issues have already been covered but the agreement will make the ESM more effective and flexible, including by providing a common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund by means of a credit line at the beginning of 2022 which is, as I have said, two years ahead of schedule.  This decision, taken by the Eurogroup, regarding the early introduction of the backstop recognises the considerable efforts by the European banking sector, supervisors and member states in significantly improving all risk reduction indicators in recent years.  The common backstop will help to ensure that banking failure does not harm the broader economy or cause financial instability.  It will be financed by contributions from the banking sector and not the taxpayer, as the Minister has outlined, thereby reducing the link between banks and sovereign states in the banking union.  The ESM treaty reform will expand the ESM mandate with a new task and responsibility.  It will equip it with more accessible precautionary credit lines and give it a stronger role in financial assistance programmes for crisis prevention.  Together with the early introduction of the common backstop, this will help to ensure the euro area is capable of handling challenges as they arise.</p> <p>The European banking sector is in a far stronger and more resilient position today than it was ten years ago.  This was never more obvious than during the pandemic crisis, when it was able to maintain financing to the economy.  We have benefited from that.  I could probably list a page's worth of financial supports this Government has been able to give society and businesses to help them survive the pandemic but this was all made possible by the work of the banking union since 2021.  The decisions being enacted now are another crucial step in this regard.  With the ESM treaty reform and the introduction of the common backstop, we strengthen the safety net we created for our European citizens.  This Eurogroup is committed to continuing to work on the completion of the banking union and the further development of the European Union monetarily.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of my party on the Finance (European Stability Mechanism and Single Resolution Fund) Bill 2021.  This follows the agreement reached by the Eurogroup in November 2020 in respect of the ESM reform package and the signing of amending agreements to the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism and the Single Resolution Fund inter-governmental agreement in January 2021.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to ratify these amending agreements in order to implement the Eurogroup's agreement on ESM treaty reform and to provide for the coming into force of the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund by 2022.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The European Stability Mechanism was set up in 2012 with the superficial objective of providing loans to financially distressed eurozone countries in order to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone member in question and of the broader eurozone.  As we all know, the assistance provided by the ESM was subject to strict conditionality.  During the financial crash and subsequent crisis, it was often extended with strict conditions of austerity and structural reform, recipes for societal pain and hardship that are now recognised by many not only to have harmed citizens but also to have hampered economic recovery and deepened recession.  It is no surprise, therefore, that the ESM remains toxic and feared in many member states.  At present, &euro;1.27 billion of contributions has been paid into the ESM, with a capital subscription of &euro;11.1 billion.  The ESM can provide to members in instances such as loans within a macroeconomic adjustment programme with austerity conditions.</p><p>I will not revisit our European Financial Stability Facility programme, which began in December 2010 and concluded in December 2013.  Instead, my focus is on the provisions of the Bill.  The Bill responds to reform proposals arising from the Eurogroup agreement in November 2020, that is, addressing a gap in the banking union by allowing the ESM to act as the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund amending the ESM's precautionary financial assistance instruments and measures aimed at changing the operations of the institution itself.</p><p>On the first, under the changes the ESM will become a common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, the agency responsible for resolving failing banks in the event the fund does not have sufficient funds.  The stated purpose of this is to prevent governments from having to rescue large banks at the expense of taxpayers, with any money lent by the ESM being repaid by the banking sector.  On the second, there are proposed changes to the preventive and precautionary features of the ESM, with the stated objective of making it easier for members to access credit lines.  Finally, on the third, there are proposals to strengthen co-operation between the Commission and the ESM.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in is on record in respect of our opposition to the structure and operation of the ESM, which has in the past placed strict conditions of austerity and hardship on member states, with serious harm inflicted on workers, families and households during the period following the financial crash.  This legislation is wide in its scope and proposals, with significant implications for the operation of the ESM and the SRF.  We will listen carefully to the contribution of the Minister with regard to its provisions and look forward to further scrutiny of the Bill in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  There are open questions as to whether these changes will require a referendum before being given effect, and I ask the Minister to respond to that point.  In addition, are there plans to end the austerity conditionality of the ESM's credit lines which, as we now know, are a failed experiment that policy elites now regret?</p><p>We will not oppose the passage of the Bill to Committee Stage but look forward to further scrutiny of its provisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.86" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#S00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  It is good to have him in the House.  The idea of a common response and common action in respect of financial and fiscal threat is something everybody supports.  The idea of the common backstop and a stability mechanism is, of course, important but there is much to discuss in the detail.  Significant mistakes have been made in the past and it is not clear how they have been learned from.</p> <p>It is important that we be clear that the Eurogroup is separate to our EU institutions and is not one of them.  The EU, as a collective, comprises the Commission, the Council and the Parliament.  One issue, which is cross-cutting and which we saw play out over the period of austerity, relates to what was perhaps an excessive influence of the Eurogroup, as a separate set of common aligned actors, on our actual collective structures, which were put in place so substantially by our treaty systems, and on the operations of the European Union.  I am concerned also about how the ESM is likely to be engaged with, something I will come to presently.</p> <p>Another concern relates to the criteria attached to the precautionary conditioned credit line.  This credit line has never been used and was, effectively, designed in a way that made it unusable because the eligibility criteria for access were not achievable.  When I spoke to officials in the Minister's Department, they told me that prior to the Covid crisis, only nine countries in Europe would have been eligible to avail of it.  The precautionary credit line is meant to function for the European Union and all European countries to ensure that if there is a crisis in banking, it will not spread.  If that tool is applicable to only nine countries, we are not doing a proper job of having a precautionary safety net that will work throughout the Union.</p> <p>That was the case prior to Covid.  When I engaged with the Minister previously on this issue, he pointed out that many of the fiscal criteria had been suspended in regard to the credit line and the credit that had to be provided during Covid.  That too, however, points to the fact the precautionary credit line and the tools we had were inadequate and that additional and different approaches needed to be taken in respect of the Covid crisis.  What we want are tools that will work in whatever crisis comes.  We know a climate crisis is coming - that is one we can anticipate - but there are many others we do not know about, and we want tools that will work.</p> <p>The concern is that in these new reformed mechanisms for the European Stability Mechanism, the exact same fiscal criteria are proposed to be reintroduced, such as a general government deficit not exceeding 3% of GDP and a government structural budget above the country's specific minimum debt benchmark where the debt-to-GDP ratio is below 60% or with a reduction in the differential in respect of 60% over the previous two years on average.  We need not get into them, but those criteria did not simply contribute to the precautionary credit line not working in the past.  They overdetermined policy throughout the EU for a period with a devastating effect.</p> <p>I engaged actively with the European semester process.  When the process became about the fiscal criteria and not about, for example, the Europe 2020 vision of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, a very long, resourced and collective vision of what it might mean to have inclusive and sustainable growth throughout the EU, we lost ground.  Europe has failed across the board to meet its targets under the Europe 2020 vision of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth because there was a prioritisation of short-term balancing of the books.</p> <p>When we discussed this before the summer, the Minister indicated he understood that some of the fiscal measures needed to be adopted and that we were returning to using the tool, although it would be changed.  In respect of the budget, however, there was a contribution in the Seanad from a Minister of State who talked about the fiscal rules being exactly as they were, even though they did not apply during this budget and even though we know they led to bad decisions in the past.  One such bad decision, which was in the news last week, related to the fact those fiscal rules were invoked and the fact that having to act off the balance sheet was being invoked to explain why we were leasing instead of building for a decade.  In this budget, however, when those rules do not apply, we are still leasing.  Some 2,600 of the houses that are coming will, apparently, come through leasing schemes.  We are still channelling money that is bad value into short-term leasing instead of into long-term assets, even though we have the space.  That is the impact of these fiscal criteria.</p> <p>The Future of Europe process, which is under way, involves the Commission, the Parliament and national parliamentarians, and I am lucky to be one of those parliamentarians who will be involved in that process.  I sometimes sense there is an Overton window in this context.  There was a moment when we could make different kinds of investment but with the fiscal controls before it and a two-year window where they were suspended, and then they came back.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not believe it can be an Overton window; it needs to be a reframe. </p><p>I have some questions on practical matters.

How will we firewall these two parts of the process?  How will we be clear on what exactly the Commission is doing by comparison with what the ESM is doing?  Could the Minister clarify the position on the precautionary credit line?  </p><p>On the banking aspect, because ultimately this is also about banking recovery, why on earth are we not imposing a banking levy on Ulster Bank and KBC next year?  Why are we rewarding them for leaving the State by telling them they will be exempted from the banking levy?</p></speech>

This is actually a very important debate.  I commend Senator Higgins on her contribution.  The backdrop is that the European Commission will publish next week its economic impact statement on the effect of the pandemic on the European economy and its implications for member states.  I am acutely conscious that there are differing ideologies in this debate but, to be fair to the Minister for Finance, he has been steadfast in his approach and held a steady line.  Our country has benefited accordingly.  I commend the Minister for his stewardship and work on the budget.  It is important that we support the common backstop and stability mechanism.</p><p>This debate should be had in the context of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.  We should consider what has happened in the world since the eurozone was created in 1999.  None of us could have predicted what transpired owing to Brexit and Covid-19.  We have had three reviews of the euro.  Senator Higgins is right about the review but let us not have a debate in which it is argued that we can print money <i>ad nauseam</i>, borrow at will and have a three-card trick like Sinn F&eacute;in can have, with each-way bets on all sides, because we cannot.  </p><p>I have been struck by the debates on the US budget in the US Houses of Congress and the associated negotiations therein.  The US President, Mr. Joe Biden, made a very simple remark that resonates with many of us; he said America pays its bills.  Translated for us, we must pay our way as well.  To be fair, the Minister for Finance, in his Budget Statement and pronouncements to date, has always made the point that we will access credit and borrow but not borrow <i>ad infinitum</i>and forget about the future.  That is why the rainy-day fund should be commended.  The Minister and former Minister, Michael Noonan, should be praised for having had the foresight to have the rainy-day fund when they were criticised by many.</p><p>When I hear Members speaking about contagion and austerity, I note that we forget one thing: if Ireland were not a member of the European Union, where would it get the money to keep afloat for a decade?  I remind Sinn F&eacute;in's Senator Gavan, in particular, that the current Government, its predecessor and the coalition Government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party had to scrape to put the pennies together to keep our country going.  That is the reality.  I am a proud European, and I am a proud advocate, as is Senator Higgins.  It is important to have these debates.</p><p>I refer Members to Article 12 in terms of the principles in the Bill, which are important.  Mentioned is the issue of safeguarding the financial stability of member states and providing stability support.  I encourage Members to examine Articles 14 to 18, inclusive.  Has the European Union got everything right?  Of course not.  Have we?  No.  We live in an imperfect world.  To be fair to the Minister, however, he has striven to seek an approach that is inclusive and mindful of our deficits and that we are part of a European Union that has put in place supports and buttresses for member states.  The treaty reform is welcome.  A debate is necessary but, at the same time, access to credit and to finance is equally important for us.  Although we will never have a unified approach, we need commonality.  We are better to be in the middle than not.  I commend the Minister for his work and thank him for being here today.</p></speech>

I wish the Minister well with it and congratulate him and the Ministers in the other member states for getting this work done two years ahead of time.</p> <p>The Title of the Bill, the Finance (European Stability Mechanism and Single Resolution Fund) Bill 2021, says it all.  It is all about confidence and stability.  This is what this Bill is about.  It is complicated and technical, and its language makes it very difficult for the ordinary person to understand it.  When dealing with the Bill we must reflect on the hardship we went through since 2008 or 2010, and probably right up to 2016 or 2017.  We saw banks closing and there were no credit lines, including for businesses.  We saw the loss of businesses and cuts to wages, pensions and so forth.  As a nation, we had more difficulties than probably any other European country during the period in question.</p> <p>This Bill is what all the great heads in Europe came up with when they put their heads together.  They have come up with a strategy for people within the eurozone so confidence and money can be supplied to nations or banks that get into difficulty.  That is my understanding of this Bill.  We do not have our own currency so we cannot regulate our own currency.  We cannot adjust our currency because of our debt.</p> <p>We must reflect on the fact that when we were in trouble, it was not just the banks that were the problem.  We were living beyond our means and we could not bridge the gap between what we were spending and what we were taking in as a nation.  We could not regulate the currency so we had nowhere to go.  Therefore, we suffered greatly as a nation.  I am delighted that this Bill is in place and that the great heads in Europe have brought this mechanism about and put it in place.</p> <p>As I understand it, if the country is in difficulty, or if the banking sector or a section thereof within the State is in bother, the fund can kick in.  Is it true that funds can be acquired by the banking sector or the nation itself?  What is the case if the nation itself is living beyond its means?  Can it have access to the funding being put in place?</p> <p>Ireland's contribution to the fund is over &euro;800 million.  Is that an annual contribution or a once-off contribution?  If the latter, is there an allowance for inflation and depreciation?  Ireland was taking in &euro;52 billion in 2012 or 2013; now the annual budget is over &euro;90 billion.  The amount has nearly doubled.  Therefore, in five or ten years, the fund may not be worth what it is today.  I ask the Minister to clarify how much we are paying in.  Can the nation itself access this type of funding? </p> <p>We are on the right track.  Europe is on the right track in this regard.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paddy Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1866"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1866&amp;amp;pid=PaddyBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have seen how the nations of Europe with their own currency had a great advantage over countries that were in the eurozone so this legislation is very welcome.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.93" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1696" speakername="Gerry Horkan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#U00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his remarks.  It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge that the Minister has been appointed President of the Eurogroup.  It is great honour for him, and for Ireland, to hold the position.  As no other Senators have indicated a wish to speak I invite the Minister to conclude the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-10-14a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021101400002#U00300"><p>I thank the Acting Chairperson and I thank the Senators for their contributions.</p><p>I wish to emphasise the two overriding objectives of this legislation in my concluding comments.  The first one is the priority of trying to ensure that if there is a further banking difficulty, the taxpayer is protected from that, and the money that the banking sector contributes into what will eventually become a mutual fund is the source of support and intervention for European banks as opposed to what happened in the past where it was the taxpayer who had to make the first intervention and, indeed, in most cases, all of the interventions to prevent even greater financial and banking difficulties.  So that is the first priority in all of this.  It is to protect the Irish taxpayer and the European taxpayer in the event of us having to confront further acute banking difficulties in the future.</p><p>The second objective is the changes that have been made to the operation of the ESM to provide support to countries in the event that they encounter further very high levels of economic difficulty.  While this legislation is, and Senator Burke made the fair point, very dense and full of schedules, actually the two key features in it are simply how can we handle banking difficulties better in the future, and what would we be able to do differently, and better, if a member of the European Union found itself in the situation where it was facing really exceptional financial difficulty.</p><p>I heard many of the different points that Senators made and thank Senators Maria Byrne, Casey, Gavan, Higgins, Buttimer and Burke.  In most of the contributions that were made, and the vast majority of them, there was an acceptance of the role that Europe has played in our economic prosperity and our current level of development.  There was also an acknowledgement from everybody, and from me, that during the last crisis there were clearly things that could have been done differently.  That has influenced the development of this legislation.  It is looking to find a new way of dealing with banking and financial difficulty that countries could face.  I believe it is a significant step forward in how we can strengthen the governance and the strength of the euro area.  Very simply, the euro area is that group of 19 countries with whom we share a currency.  Anything that can strengthen the resilience and the strength of the euro in the long run is to the benefit of Ireland because we are a small country and because we are such an open economy inside the euro area.</p><p>I shall deal with some of the particular questions that have been put to me.  Senator Gavan made a point about the austerity of the past.  What I would say about that is however one could describe the budget that I and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, announced on Tuesday, one could not describe it as an austerity budget.  This goes back to some of the points that Senator Higgins made.  This is despite the fact that we have incurred an additional &euro;34 billion worth of debt.  At any other point in our economic history if we, either on our own or with other countries, incurred that level of debt it would have had an immediate and total effect on the next budget brought forward.  While many in the Opposition will say we should have done more and, indeed, there were some in the Government who will sometimes argue that we should do more as well, any fair-minded person would not look at a &euro;4.7 billion budget and say it was an austerity budget.  It tried to make progress on things that are really important in our society and in our economy.  That did not happen on its own.  It happened because during the height of the Covid pandemic the European Central Bank and the European Commission made decisions that were completely different from where we were a decade ago to help us in the funding and financing of that debt.  Of course, what was also different was that all countries were confronting that crisis at the same time with the crisis being a health crisis.</p><p>In the debate that is to come regarding the fiscal rules, and Senators Higgins and Gavan again made their views clear on that, I think we should begin that debate by acknowledging that however one could describe the current budgetary policies that are being brought in, after a surge in Government debt, one could not describe them as being policies of austerity.  That points to the fundamental change that is already happening regarding how we are trying to lead out of the terrible health crisis that we are trying to put behind us.</p><p>As to the specific points that Senator Higgins put to me regarding the role of the Eurogroup, she is correct that the Eurogroup is not an institution in the same way as the European Central Bank or the European Commission.  On the other hand, it is the only grouping within the economic policy-making architecture of the European Union in which elected governments are directly represented.  They are not represented in the Parliament.  They are not represented in the Commission and they are not represented in the ECB.  The point has been made that the Eurogroup is an informal group.  It may well not have the official status, as the Senator correctly said, of the other institutions but it is the only group within which the ministers, who are elected directly or appointed directly by national parliaments, have a direct say and that is another form of legitimacy that I believe is incredibly important.</p><p>A further charge that is sometimes made about the work of the Eurogroup is that when we are dealing with issues like this it excludes non-euro area countries.  That overlooks the fact that when the Eurogroup is dealing with banking union we sit in inclusive format.  In other words, the non-euro countries are in those meetings as they were in the meetings that led to this agreement.  </p><p>As to the point that Senator Higgins made about the fiscal rules, and they are referenced here within legislation, we will, I suspect, be having a broader debate with Senators regarding the role of conditionality and how conditionality is designed.  The overall point I would make about conditionality is, the Irish taxpayer is now a contributor to, for example, the budget of the European Union in a way we never have been before.  On a <i>per capita</i>basis we are now one of the highest contributors to the European Union.</p><p>Regarding the people who look to this Oireachtas - the people who elect us both directly and indirectly - one of the things that they will always ask us to do is ensure that the money they pay in their taxes is efficiently and fairly used.  Yes, there is conditionality in the different funds that we discuss here but that conditionality is directly driven by the taxpayers who pay into funds wanting their governments to be able to tell them what that money is used for.  I think in the debate around the design of conditionality there is a principle beyond that and that is worth acknowledging.</p><p>Regarding the points made about the design of conditionality and what it could be in the future, it does to a degree feed into the fiscal rule debate that is approaching.  When I engaged in this discussion with Senators a year ago I am sure that I did say that the general activation clause of the fiscal rules would be triggered for 2022, and that has happened.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Paschal Donohoe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2244"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2244&amp;amp;pid=PaschalDonohoe&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=14"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->During that period, we will have a discussion regarding the nature and design of the fiscal rules across the European Union.  There is, as Senators know, a variety of views about fiscal rules and their future.  However, I expect that the Commission, later in October, will relaunch the consultation regarding fiscal rules, within which governments and parliaments will be able to make their views known.</p><p>The Senator also put to me a point about the semester process.  It is worth saying that even though the Stability and Growth Pact is referenced heavily in the semester process, many other non-fiscal issues are also referenced.  The bigger question will ask what will be the future of the semester process, given the processes that are now in place and the recovery fund.  These are debates and questions to which I am sure we will return on Committee Stage.  I thank all the Senators for their questions and views, and for their support for the Bill, in most cases.  This is an important Bill about the long-term resilience of the currency we use and share.  I commend it to the House.</p></speech>
