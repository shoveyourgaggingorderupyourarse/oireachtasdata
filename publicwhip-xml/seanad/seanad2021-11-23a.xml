I hope he will share the details of this discussion with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  I would have appreciated the Minister's presence here today, but I know she will be at the Oireachtas committee meeting on Wednesday.  I thank the Minister for State for his time.</p> <p>We are losing web records at an alarming rate.  Some 60% of the national libraries across Europe have in place adequate copyright law to allow them to collect appropriately the contents of state domain websites, which in our case is the .ie domain.  The relevant legislation here is the Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Law Provisions Act 2019.  I have been covering this issue for many years.  I met representatives of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment when that Bill came before these Houses.  The Seanad passed an amendment to that Bill that I brought forward, but it was later removed by the then Minister, John Halligan.</p> <p>Section 108 of the Act stipulates that, within 12 months of enactment, the Government shall bring forward a report on the feasibility of establishing a digital web archive or digital legal deposit.  Twelve months have well and truly passed.  In fact, the President signed the Act into law on 26 June 2019.  As it stands, the National Library of Ireland is anxious that we are losing web records at an alarming rate.  I am anxious the Government is breaking the law because it has not brought forward that report.  The National Library of Ireland is concerned, and understandably so, that by not copying websites with the .ie domain, it is in breach of current copyright law.  The library's representatives recently told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media that for each year they are unable to collect or disseminate the contents of the .ie domain websites, approximately 50% of web records are lost.</p> <p>As I have said before, a black hole will be created in our country's memory if we continue to fail to put in place a digital legal deposit.  The hold-up seems to be in the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, which I understand was given the responsibility for producing a report on the feasibility of establishing the scheme.  What is the Minister's view of what the scheme should look like?  When will the report be brought to Cabinet?  As I mentioned, the Government is now breaking the law on this issue.  We are facing excessive loss of online material for the current and future generations.  It seems there is no urgency from Ministers to take ownership of the issue and to set up a digital legal deposit scheme.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, who is unavailable this morning to take this Commencement matter.</p> <p>Legal deposit legislation is an important instrument in national cultural policy.  In Ireland, as in most countries, it is relied upon to ensure the published output of the nation is collected and preserved by one or more prescribed institutions in order that citizens and researchers, within the country and abroad, are guaranteed permanent access to the intellectual and cultural memory of the nation.  Some countries have amended legal deposit legislation to incorporate the deposit of their published digital output, for example, websites and electronic publications.  This is digital legal deposit, and it exists to various extents in the UK and some EU countries, including France, Germany, Spain, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.</p> <p>Section 29 of the Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Law Provisions Act 2019 introduced a provision for copyright libraries to request a publisher to deposit a copy of a digital publication first published in the State.  This introduced digital legal deposit in Ireland.  Further consideration is being afforded to a wider initiative that would capture the web, particularly the .ie domain.  At present, the National Library of Ireland, NLI, collects a wide range of websites and stores them permanently.  All the websites collected by it are collected with the consent of the owners.</p> <p>Section 108 of the 2019 Act provided that the Government would bring forward a report on the feasibility of establishing a digital legal deposit scheme to serve as a web archive for the .ie domain contents and advise of the steps taken towards that goal.  Within a year of publication, 50% of web resources are gone or are unrecognisable, but the work of the NLI means Government publications and online websites documenting most aspects of public life in the 21st century will not be lost to future researchers.</p> <p>Since 2011, the NLI has been selectively archiving the web, moving towards the creation of an archive of Irish websites.  There are several practical and administrative limitations to that process, but perhaps the greatest concern is the fact that it does not provide for a complete record of Irish-content websites.  The library has a statutory mandate to collect for the benefit of the public.  It can also meet the resource requirements to gather and preserve the information.  Legislation could be introduced to give the library the right to conduct a full domain trawl of all .ie websites of Irish interest periodically.  To capture a complete record of Irish websites, the domain trawl would include the collection of content behind paywalls.  The intention would be that the NLI would make the content available on its premises, as with other resources.  This is not a simple issue.  However, the owners of websites whose content lies behind a paywall have rights as publishers in general and are important stakeholders in that context.  The agreement of relevant publishers would be appropriate and desirable in respect of any legislation.</p> <p>On progress, the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is working with the NLI on exploring the feasibility of expanding the library's capacity to establish a digital legal deposit scheme to serve as a web archive for the .ie domain.  Work is ongoing in this regard.  There are differing views on the introduction of a digital legal deposit, and it is important that consultation incorporate all those views.  It is hoped to bring forward a report in the coming months.</p></speech>

I have not learned anything new.  On his reference to the Act introducing a provision allowing copyright libraries to request a publisher to deposit a copy of a digital publication, the scheme is not really a scheme at all.  We are aware that the NLI is understaffed by comparison with its equivalent national libraries and, therefore, actively requesting it to make copies of records is hardly realistic.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is extraordinary that the Government accepts that we are losing material but has not produced a report that it is legally required to produce.

I am working with what the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has provided to me.  This is not my area of responsibility, but I will revert to the Minister and express the Senator's concern about the response he is getting.  My scripted reply is very clear that the report is due but, as the Senator said, the replies to his questions have said it will be a number of months.  I will raise the concern the Senator has expressed and his view that valuable material is being lost.  That is critical to our State, so I undertake that I will raise that with the Minister, Deputy Martin.</p></speech>

I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State when I say I would have preferred the Minister, Deputy Harris, to be here.  I appreciate the Minister of State's time.  I understand that the Minister is at a Cabinet meeting.</p> <p>The issue I wish to raise is access to third level education and, most importantly, the affordability of third level education.  The introduction of free education in Ireland in 1967 was a historic moment.  It is one that we as a country experience the benefit of every day, not just socially but economically, and something we are recognised as a nation around the world for having achieved and led on.  Today, outside Leinster House, students will protest about the financial barriers preventing students in Ireland from accessing third level education.  Education is not just good for the individual, society and our economy but is also an investment in our collective future.  Financial barriers are preventing an increasing number of students from accessing education.  I appreciate that the Government in place over the past year has recognised those barriers and taken action to address some of them.  The recent improvements to the SUSI grant in the budget, specifically the increase in the income thresholds and the qualifying distance and the enhanced funding of &euro;17 million which the Minister, Deputy Harris, secured for the enhanced student assistance fund, were really welcome.  I have also engaged with the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, on the caps on rents, the caps on upfront payments for student accommodation, the reduction in the notice period for students to give on accommodation and the direction given to local authorities not to allow purpose-built student accommodation to be converted to short-term lets.  That is all very welcome.</p> <p>The reality, though, is that the research that has been conducted indicates that the cost of a four-year degree is &euro;50,000 on average, which is still too expensive.  In Housing for All, the &euro;20 billion commitment that has been made to address the housing crisis is welcome but, on top of that, Covid has had an impact.  The number of digs has reduced.  Families are no longer willing to take additional residents into their homes, quite understandably.  The pressure on students is therefore enormous.  I know that the third level institutions have been given &euro;170 million or &euro;180 million in funding to build purpose-built student accommodation and that the technical universities have been given funding.  However, we need an urgency on the provision of affordable student accommodation because the accommodation element is proving to be a very significant cost.  The Union of Students in Ireland is asking the Government to take action to remove these financial barriers.  It requests specifically that the &euro;3,000 student contribution charge be abolished.  It also asks for further reform of the SUSI grant scheme.  More than anything, it is asking the Government to take urgent action to ensure that student accommodation is affordable to all students.</p> <p>I hope the Minister, Deputy Harris, has sent the Minister of State here with some good news.  I look forward to his reply.</p></speech>

Rent increases in student accommodation are capped under the rent pressure zone provisions.  From this year onwards, students cannot be made to pay more than two months rent upfront when commencing a tenancy, ending the practice where students had to pay several thousand euros upfront to secure accommodation.</p><p>A number of supports are available to students facing financial barriers to attend higher education.  The principal one of these is the student grant scheme, which assists more than 70,000 students annually to access third-level education.  The student grant scheme includes a non-adjacent rate of grant, which is a higher rate of grant that takes into consideration the additional costs which may be associated with living further away from college, such as accommodation costs.</p><p>From September 2022, the distance for the non-adjacent rate will be reduced from 45 km to 30 km, meaning that more students will qualify for this higher grant rate.  Students experiencing exceptional financial needs can apply for support under the student assistance fund.  The allocation to the student assistance fund for the 2021-22 academic year is &euro;17.2 million, which includes an additional &euro;8.1 million on the Covid-19 return to education funding.  </p><p>Fundamentally however, this challenge is one of supply.  As a country we need to dramatically increase the supply of all types of housing and accommodation, including student accommodation.  That is why the Government has launched Housing for All led by my Department.  This sets out a series of actions to be delivered to fix the housing crisis.  The plan is backed up by the largest ever housing budget in the history of the State, at in excess of &euro;20 billion, to transform our housing system.</p><p>The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, contains a commitment to work with higher education institutions to ensure that more accommodation is built on- and off-campus using cost-rental and other models.  An important element of this is to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to low-cost financing.  </p><p>Since 2017, the Housing Finance Agency has approved a total of &euro;157 million in loans to support the provision of more than 1,400 new students bed spaces across three universities.  At present the technological universities, TUs, are unable to borrow to build their own student accommodation.  Housing for All contains a commitment to support our TUs to develop purpose-built student accommodation through access to appropriate financing such that TUs borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency.</p><p>The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and the Minister, Deputy Harris, have been engaging with representatives from the higher education sector on this issue to better understand how they can be supported to build more student accommodation.  Together with these stakeholders and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we are looking to develop a stronger pipeline of affordable student accommodation which we know is critical.  As part of that work we will examine the potential for the use of funding models such as cost rental in the education sector as well as examining existing barriers to the building of student accommodation.</p></speech>

I accept and welcome the innovations that the Government has made in enabling the TUs, the consideration of the affordable cost-rental model, the other innovations in the capping and limiting of the rents and upfront payments and the reduction of the notice periods.  We have to go further, however, to fully ensure that any of the purpose-built student accommodation that has been built is hit with a vacant property tax if it is not being used and that students who are struggling financially are supported through the assistance funds which are in place.  The Government and the Minister of State need to be ambitious to ensure that every person and citizen in our society has access to third-level education.</p> <p>Education makes people smarter and better and enables people to make better choices for themselves, to live smarter and better and to make a greater contribution, not just to their own immediate community and family but to our society at large.  We have the proof of the value of investment in education.  As we move out of Covid-19, let us make an investment in our future to ensure that every citizen has access to third-level education that is affordable and, ideally, free.</p></speech>

This is a big statement.  Now we have it on the CAO form and students considering their third level options can see there are more alternatives and more stable careers, which is very important.  We want to try to get as many people as possible into further education.  We want to eliminate all barriers to access.  Education is the key to unlocking all our potential.  Throughout the history of the State we have seen how important this is.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, will be to the forefront working to ensure we build more low-cost affordable housing in our institutions throughout the State.  Be it at a technical university or the university network, on-campus accommodation is very important.  We continue in our singular focus to do this.</p></speech>

At this point, there is a very real and serious problem with families being able to register the births of their newborn babies and get a birth certificate for that child.  A child born in Cork today will have a birth registered in two to three days.  If that same child was born in Dublin the wait for an appointment for registration would be weeks and in some cases months.  I know of a child born four weeks ago and the date for the registration of the birth is 16 December.  Waiting matters because families cannot access child benefit or the GP card.  We know that in some instances it delays housing applications.  I know of families that have had to pay for an infant baby to go to a GP because they do not have the free GP card.  For low-income families or single parents having to pay for everything themselves or for families with a good income but paying exorbitant rents, the waiting matters because of the GP card, child benefit and other supports from the State.</p> <p>There is a failure on the part of the HSE and the Department of Health to address the enormous backlog that exists in Dublin.  There is an irony that if I had a baby today I could drive to Meath or Louth in two or three days' time and register the baby's birth but in Dublin I would be waiting for many weeks.  Nobody should have to commute any number of miles, particularly after the birth of a baby, to get the baby registered.  There is a very real question as to what the HSE is doing.  I understand there is a backlog of between 500 to 600 applications for the registration of births that arose from the time when people could only apply online.  We have the culmination of those applications online plus people waiting for an appointment.  It is intolerable that in November parents and families are waiting.</p> <p>This is not the totality of the problem.  Trying to register the birth of a child is one thing; trying to get a birth certificate is another matter.  When I came to these problems there was a strong whiff of the wild west about trying to purchase a birth certificate in this country.  At present, people in Dublin are directed to order a birth certificate online.  It is made clear there is no facility to order a birth certificate over the phone.  The HSE website suggests there is no walk-in facility.  Last week, I informed the Seanad that families had come to me who in desperation had rung the civil registration office and were told to put money in an envelope.  They received the birth certificate within a few days.  A family told me they needed a birth certificate to get the child baptised and the church directed them to the civil registration office in Kilkenny from where they received the certificate in a few days.  Another family told me an official in the office told them there were 19,000 unread emails regarding applications for birth certificates.</p> <p>Of most concern to me is that families told me they were able to purchase a birth certificate from third parties.  This day four weeks ago, we engaged in an experiment of sorts whereby a family allowed me to purchase a birth certificate for a baby who was only a few weeks old.  The mother went through the civil registration service on Lombard Street on the same day.  I paid &euro;46 and she paid &euro;21.50.  I received the baby's birth certificate within six days.  She is still waiting four weeks later.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is something wrong with a system where families are forced to pay extra to get a birth certificate.  If these third parties and companies are able to go to civil registration offices outside Dublin and purchase birth certificates at a profit to sell back to families, the question must be asked as to why is the HSE not doing something similar.  Why is it not distributing the caseload that has built up in Dublin to other civil registration offices across the country?  Not only does it make a mockery of the State, but it is unnecessarily forces parents to pay extra.  It is also important to note that there is a risk, when people are handing their money over, that they may never see the birth certificate.  One company, Births, Deaths and Marriages, which was taking up to &euro;50 from people, went belly-up in the past number of weeks.  People handed over the money and ended up with no birth certificate.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p></speech>

I pass on her apologies.  I also understand the Senator has had discussions with the General Register Office, GRO, on the issues that she has raised,</p> <p>We share the concerns expressed by her.  The issue is of huge concern to the Government.  I understand that some parents have suffered delays in excess of 12 weeks, and perhaps longer, in having their children's births registered.  These delays and backlogs are being experienced in the eastern regional registration area.  Thankfully, other registration areas appear to be less affected.  </p> <p>The House will be aware that the HSE is responsible for the day-to-day delivery of civil registration services.  The Minister for Social Protection has only limited functions with respect to how the HSE delivers the service and has no direct role in the performance of any of the operational areas.  I wish to emphasise that what we are dealing with is clearly a performance issue and not a weakness in policy.  </p> <p>The HSE has advised that the cyberattack significantly impacted its computer systems in mid-May 2021, and that it continues to struggle with the impact, particularly in its largest office in Dublin.  Allied to these difficulties are those caused by the restrictions on public access and staff of registration offices both in Dublin and nationally.  I understand that the cyberattack resulted in the local registration services being out of action for five weeks from mid-May.  It was not until much later in July that some of the critical systems were passed fit for servicing, resulting in severe disruption to service provision and backlogs that are proving difficult to clear. </p> <p>Senators will be aware that many civil registration offices are located within other health services in clinics or close to maternity hospitals that continue to be subject to restricted public access.  The staff, to their credit, have continued to maintain the civil marriage services, and continue to manage notifications from couples wishing to get married.  Some 1,500 births fall to be registered in eastern areas, placing a continued pressure on the service.  Not unusually, the eastern area has suffered some short-term staff shortages due to the promotion and retirement of key staff over the past few months.  Recruitment is under way to fill vacancies, but it will take time for new staff to get up to speed.  Additional temporary staff have been recruited to tackle the backlogs and provide additional support with respect to its customer service channels.  Staff are also working at weekends.</p> <p>The Senator has identified additional concerns that the Minister wants to address.  PPS numbers are automatically allocated once a birth has been registered.  Parents do not need to do anything for the PPS number to be allocated.  Adjustments follow automatically to child benefit payments and the Minister has committed to ensuring that any delay in child benefit resulting from the backlog will be made good and arrears will be paid quickly.  The Senator also asked if there is any relationship between the websites she mentioned and the HSE or the GRO.  To my knowledge, there is no connection, contractual or otherwise.  My understanding is that they operate as third-party certificate resellers.  </p> <p>I am encouraged by the manner in which the service has recovered, having suffered such a significant setback earlier in the year.  It would be useful if communications could be improved so that any person looking for a certificate is encouraged to look to their local registration office or to the GRO, which provide a similar service.</p></speech>

I am conscious that he is responding on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection.  I thank her for the response.  I originally submitted the matter to the Minister for Health but it was redirected to the Minister for Social Protection.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am glad to hear from the reply submitted by the Minister for Social Protection that this is a performance issue.  Indeed, it is a performance issue for the HSE to address and, therefore, it is one for the Department and the Minister for Health, who have responsibility for the HSE, to address.  I am glad to hear efforts are being made to address recruitment, but as the written reply makes clear, "Not unusually, the eastern area has suffered some short-term staff shortages".  It is simply unacceptable that families will be waiting 12 weeks to register the birth of their baby.  This could be so easily resolved by allocating some of that work to other offices.  While I accept efforts are being made, they are simply not good enough.</p></speech>

I will raise the issue with the Minister for Social Protection and the Department of Health in the context of any jurisdiction it has over the HSE in this regard.  As a parent, I appreciate how frustrating it can be when trying to get a child registered, given many key services flow from that.  I will raise the matter with the Minister and try to accelerate the provision of those resources.  The prepared contribution indicates staff are working at weekends and trying their best to alleviate the backlog.  The addition of new staff will, I hope, make the key difference.</p></speech>

I tabled this matter to seek clarity on how the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is dealing with a major fire incident that happened at a halting site in Bantry on 9 November.  Has a report on the fire been filed and a fire hazard safety assessment completed?  What is the long-term housing plan for the people who live on the site?</p> <p>On the night of Tuesday, 9 November, a major fire happened at a halting site in Bantry.  One unit was totally burned to the ground.  It was a significant fire, covered widely on social media and also in the press.  The issues regarding the site go back generations, in many ways.  What has the Department done about the fire and what assessments has it carried out on the site?  Has it examined its cause and how it could be prevented from happening again?  How safe is the site now?</p> <p>As the Minister of State will be aware, unfortunately a very significant fire happened at a halting site in Carrickmines in 2015, in which ten people lost their lives.  Some of the recommendations that came from the coroner's court are worth reflecting on.  The coroner recommended that the exemption from fire and planning regulations for emergency sites be changed.  There is an exemption in regard to planning and fire safety on temporary halting sites.  The site in Bantry is 25 years old, yet is considered to be of a temporary nature.  Are there, therefore, no planning or fire regulations for the site?  It would be a significant issue, not only for the patrons, one whom was injured in the fire, but for the entire town if there are no planning or fire regulations for the site.  The coroner's report on the Carrickmines fire further recommended that the powers for establishing emergency halting sites be used for the shortest possible time.  The Bantry halting site is 25 years old, one quarter of a century.  Are we really saying that is a short period?</p> <p>The report on the Carrickmines incident is something I want to reflect on.  We got an awful rude awakening in 2015 when ten patrons lost their lives.  There was a really significant fire in Bantry a week and a half ago and the same could have happened there.  There could have been a real tragedy.  Having spoken to people who attended the scene that night, I know it was by the grace of God that other units were not lost, with more people affected.  The site is located on a dead-end road and access is a big issue.  There are commercial units all around it, so the fire could have spread to them and had a significant impact on the entire commercial entity of Bantry.</p> <p>What is the long-term plan for the site?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How are we going to work on the health and safety issues there?  What is the Department doing with regard to the judgment of the coroner's report on the Carrickmines incident?

Can we put in place a structure to ensure these sites are managed appropriately?</p></speech>

Many vulnerable people rely on Cork County Council to keep them safe.  The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 provides that local authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and for the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes in their areas.  My Department's role is to ensure there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist local authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p> <p>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management led and oversaw a programme at national level to review fire safety in local authority-provided Traveller accommodation following the tragic loss of life at the Carrickmines halting site, which the Senator referenced.  We never again want to see an absolutely horrific event like that, where so many vulnerable people lost their lives.  Under direction from the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, local authorities undertook a major exercise aimed at enhancing fire safety in Traveller accommodation in 2015 and 2016.  One of the core objectives of the project is the development and roll-out of a community fire safety awareness initiative appropriate for the Traveller community.  The aim of this initiative is to get fire safety messages disseminated into the Traveller community, enabling Travellers to take practical steps in respect of fire safety issues commonly associated with living on halting sites.  To support this process, the national directorate, in consultation with key stakeholders including Traveller representative groups, developed an information leaflet and booklet on fire safety in the Traveller community.  </p> <p>My Department continues to engage with local authorities regarding fire safety on Traveller sites.  Fire safety matters are discussed at national Traveller accommodation consultative committee meetings.  From its contact with Cork County Council in respect of the halting site in Bantry, which operated for more than 25 years, my Department understands that fire safety inspections are carried out annually by the council on all Traveller-specific accommodation.  Cork County Council has carried out significant fire safety works on the site in Bantry.  These works protected the other families on the site on the night of the fire.  The council is working with the family affected to secure appropriate accommodation.</p> <p>I assure the Senator that the Department is doing everything it can.  Again, we have to look at the facts.  Last year was the first year in which all the capital expenditure funding in the budget was utilised.  The chief reason for this was the Covid pandemic.  We have increased the amount available in the capital budget for Traveller accommodation by 25% over the last two years.  Cork County Council needs to take advantage of that.  With regard to my responsibility, the money is there to support the members and executive of the local authority in making appropriate decisions to ensure the Traveller community has secure and sustainable accommodation.  We are working through an expert report.  I have established a programme board to respond to the 32 recommendations given to me by the all-party committee.  This board is having quarterly meetings with a view to driving that forward to ensure that Travellers have secure tenancies and that their conditions are improved.  However, we have to be very clear as to where responsibility lies.  I commissioned an audit last year during the Covid pandemic which looked at the HSE response in respect of 250 sites.  We must be clear that the money is there.  the funding is there and I call on every one of the 31 local authorities in this country to stand up to the mark and draw down funding to ensure that Travellers have sustainable accommodation.</p></speech>

I asked whether it had been completed.  It is important that we get clarity as to what assessment has actually been carried out on site since 9 November in respect of this incident.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The crux of the issue is that the coroner's statement on the Carrickmines incident states that the fire and planning regulations make these sites exempt.  Has that exemption stood?  If one looks at what is happening in Bantry, there is no way one could stand over the planning and exemptions when it comes to fire safety on these sites.  These are significant issues.  This is about learning from a tragedy that occurred in Carrickmines, taking note of what happened in Bantry in November and making sure, first, that there is appropriate planning and fire safety for these halting sites.  It was stated in the coroner's report that there was none.  When it comes to having the report on what happened that night published, we have no detail or knowledge of what happened.  I ask the Minister of State to make that report available to me as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I wish to be very clear about the line of responsibility.  It is primarily with the local authority in the first instance.  The local authority has advised me, on foot of the Senator's Commencement matter, about the work that has been undertaken as a result of the inspections that took place in Cork.  I will refer back to the Senator regarding whether the assessment has been carried out.  However, the Senator will note one of the sentences in my response was that the works Cork City Council had already carried out protected other families on the site from a worse potential outcome, but I will refer back to the Senator about the assessment.</p> <p>In addition, I emphasise that local authorities must step up to the mark in delivering Traveller accommodation through their plans.  The Office of the Planning Regulator is now conducting assessments of the plans to do that across the 31 local authorities because it is very urgent.  They have to step up to the mark.  As regards all the planning issues the Senator referred to, the local authority has primary responsibility to do that.  When the local authority comes knocking on my door for the funding, I can assure it that it will be wide open.</p></speech>

He is one of the great gentlemen of Leinster House.  He does a lot of quiet work and helps out Members in all sorts of ways in trying to get their message out.  We all know how hard it is to communicate in the modern world, but the print facility, under Christy, has been a phenomenal resource for Members and Senators down through the years.</p> <p>Christy said that he came here when he was 26 and had a full head of hair, and teeth.  I believe that he still has both but I am not too sure.  Christy and his wife, Paula, plan to take a long trip to Australia after Christmas.  We hope that they have a grand time Down Under, celebrate appropriately and think of us when they are on the beach while we get a bit colder here.</p> <p>My only advice to Christy comes from a message that was posted on the window of a shop in Kenmare.  After 48 years of delivering bread to all the shops in the area, the three Moriarty brothers retired.  They wrote in beautiful script on the window a message to all their customers, thanking them for their service and loyalty down through the years, and then said, "Now we must learn the art of how to spend time without spending money."  When Christy learns that in Australia, he might come back and impart all of that wisdom to us.  We wish Christy and his wife, Paula, and all the family a long and happy retirement.</p></speech>

He is a true legend.  Not many people have a 40-year career in the Oireachtas.  The best of good health and happiness to Christy, Paula and family.</p> <p>I also wish to congratulate a wonderful Kildare man, Christy Moore, a pure legend, on receiving a lifetime achievement award last week.  Christy is very much cherished by the people of Ireland, not just the people of Kildare.  He is authentic and has great honesty and integrity in both his singing and his writing and of course in terms of his story.  We are very proud of Christy and indeed of all of the Moore family in Kildare.  I am good friends with his sister Terry and his brother Barry.  When any of us think of Christy, we think of the ordinary man in particular and the way he has really given voice to the voiceless over seven decades.  It is an incredible achievement and I congratulate him and wish him well.  I want to mark the very profound impact he has had on music in Ireland.</p> <p>Yesterday the Oireachtas all-party group on dementia had a very interesting presentation from a team led by Professor Sean Kennelly, co-director of the Tallaght University Hospital memory clinic, about current innovations and trends in dementia research.  A lot of what he told us was eye-opening.  For example, there are new studies being done and they are going to be elevated to just a simple blood test that will identify the onset of Alzheimer's or dementia 25 years before it happens through proteins in the blood, which is quite incredible.  It struck home with me that 40% of dementia can be preventable in terms of lifestyle changes, particularly when we look at brain health around the age of 50.  We need to have a debate on brain health and the possibility of it being checked along with cardiac health and other areas we have checked at that age.  I would like to see a debate in the House on that.</p> <p>Especially in my own county of Kildare, we have significant housing issues.  We cater for two D&aacute;il constituencies.  There is a real need for extra staff in the housing department, particularly in social and affordable housing.  We need two more project teams to be able to deliver on the commitments that have been made under Housing for All.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would like to see a strong message going from the Seanad for that.</p></speech>

He gave great service here for four decades and was always fantastic to deal with.  He is very amenable and very accommodating, which is not easy at times.  I wish himself and his wife Paula all the very best.</p> <p>We have been very successful in this country with our vaccination programme. Ireland has one of the highest rates of vaccination in the world with nearly 95% of our population vaccinated.  This is a marvellous achievement.  It is a reflection on how seriously the people of Ireland take Covid and the challenges and threats caused by the pandemic.  I do not believe, however, that we are using to its optimum the vaccination infrastructure we have built.  The Covid-19 certificate should be used far more widely.  I cannot understand why it is not required for access to gyms, hairdressers, hotels and events that take place throughout the country.  The use of the Covid-19 certificate needs to be extended.  It is appropriate that it would be extended because it is a very effective way of protecting public health.  I cannot understand why a person can go into hairdressers, for example, without showing a Covid-19 certificate, given that he or she spends so long in the company of the hairdresser.  I cannot understand why the Covid-19 cert is not used in gyms.  I cannot for the life of me understand why it is not required in hotels, or at least when using the facilities in hotels such as bars, restaurants and gyms.  I want to see the Government coming out in the next few days with a measure for the increased use of the Covid-19 certificate, a certificate 95% of Irish people have bought into.  Such a measure will absolutely help to prevent the spread of Covid and it will be a very important public health measure.</p> <p>We have seen stories about nightclubs in Dublin opening at 6 p.m. until 12 midnight, which is a method to get around the restrictions.  The Government did not close the nightclubs.  In my view, the Government should have closed the nightclubs.  The Government should never have reopened the nightclubs.  Be it as it is, the problem now is that the nightclubs in rural Ireland are being discriminated against.  It is totally unrealistic for a nightclub in west Clare or other parts of rural Ireland to open at 6 p.m. until 12 midnight.  They must continue to pay their insurance and continue to pay their fixed costs whereas if the Government had closed the nightclubs, they would have some chance of dealing with their insurance and other fixed costs.</p> <p>In the absence of the Government doing the right thing by nightclubs and by the people who work in nightclubs, I would like the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, Deputy Sean Fleming, to come before the House to explain how he will deal with this.  I am told by clubs around the country that they are not getting a waiver on their insurance because the Government has not closed them.  I look forward to the Leader's response on these important issues.</p></speech>

I will start by congratulating Dublin city councillors for approving an 853-home development.  It is a very important decision and it took a long time coming.  There was much debate about Oscar Traynor Road and that site with regard to the quota and percentage of social houses, affordable houses and council-owned houses.  It is a council site and the councillors exercised their powers and functions, and they must be commended on doing so against a lot of resistance and negative commentary by a lot of people.  Dublin City Council members have approved these new plans for the development of 853 social and affordable homes.  The council's decision, which was backed by most councillors last night, is very important because 40% will be used for social housing, 40% will be used for cost rental units, and 20% will be for sale to low- and middle-income workers who qualify for the upcoming affordable purchase scheme.  I acknowledge the Government's role in that scheme.  This is a positive day.  It is positive in giving power back to local government and giving power back to councillors, in this case Dublin city councillors.  I commend them and acknowledge them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I note from an email that the Leader and Senator Gallagher are bringing in a Bill in regard to peat and doing a briefing tomorrow.  I look forward to attending that briefing.  I welcome the recent comments by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, on the availability of peat in the horticultural sector.  That is available in one of his statements issued two or three weeks ago in which he recognised that there were no viable alternatives to peat for the horticultural sector and that the Government needs to find a solution to the problem.  That is a very important statement from him, recognising that fact.  I now use this opportunity to call on the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, to publish the final report without any further delay.  It is feeding into much uncertainty in regard to the horticultural sector but particularly the mushroom sector.  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke<b>, </b>will be familiar with the horticultural sector in Lusk, north County Dublin, which is a huge, viable business.  In terms of organics and pursuing the horticultural food sector it is an important sector and one that we need to embrace and support.  It is madness that we are importing peat from Baltic states.  It should stop.  It is not appropriate.  We need to address limited resources of peat and use peat from Ireland for specific targeted areas for the horticultural sector.  I commend the Minister of State on his initiative in that regard.</p></speech>

As spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment I am all about accessing EU funding for the SME sector to support it in any way we can.  I am also all about Ireland never waning on its neutral stance when it comes to being involved in war.  I have deep concerns on the vague wording used about an event happening this weekend.  An event entitled EU Funding for Irish Defence and Security, Enterprise and R&amp;D - Maximising the Opportunities, is happening this weekend.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, will be attending.  It is very important that we do not move towards ever encouraging any SME, no matter how stuck we are for jobs, in getting involved in any way in manufacturing anything that can be used as weapons of war even if it is only a small component or something that can be used.  We are a neutral country.  I organised the very first anti-war protest at Shannon Airport before the Iraq war started.  I have protested outside the gates of Leinster House to maintain our neutrality.  This kind of event is deeply worrying.</p> <p>I do not know if I have to appeal to the Minister or to the SME sector.  Just because there is funding for something does not mean we have to go and get it.  There are many other ways of getting jobs and we are working very hard at creating other jobs including the green economy.  I would beg that our SME sector does not go down that road, that it holds on to its morals and ethics around what it gets funding for.  We do not want to turn into a small neutral nation that all of a sudden is supplying in any shape or form anything to do with war.  If wars ever solved anything we would not still be having them.  War is one of the biggest moneymakers in the world.  We know it is a huge global industry.  I have read many books about it.  I try not to get emotional about the money wasted on weapons of mass destruction and on small weapons because it is so wrong.  The terror has never resolved any issues, not in Iraq, not in Afghanistan, not anywhere.  We should have no hand, act or part, and I implore the Minister to tread very carefully with this kind of event.  I implore the SME sector to hold onto its moral compass and never take money that will enable it to manufacture anything that will be used in war.</p></speech>

This is at a time when inflation and rents are rising and energy costs are skyrocketing.  In its report released today the Society of St. Vincent de Paul said it is expecting as many as 200,000 calls to its organisation by the end of the year.  It is talking to people who face the impossible choice of heating their home, paying their rent and putting food on the table.  One in four people it has spoken to are cutting back on food and utilities.</p> <p>The St. Vincent de Paul appeal comes on the back of another report that came out recently from the Free Legal Aid Advice Centres, FLAC, the Pillar to Post report, which warned of rising household debt that has built up over the pandemic.  At least 36,000 payment breaks have been granted during the pandemic but due to a lack of data that might just be the tip of the iceberg.  We need emergency measures to address the perfect storm we now face this winter.  Sinn F&eacute;in called for a discretionary fund to be put in place to help people with their heating bills.  This was rejected by the Government.  We were told that the budget would increase the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance.  However, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, has confirmed to my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, that that will only benefit 4,500 households and will not come into effect until 1 January.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, confirmed to my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, that the increase in eligibility criteria will only benefit 4,500 households and will not come into effect until 1 January.  People need help now.  They need to heat their homes now.  The impact of energy poverty on households is not just about discomfort, it has real long-term consequences.  There are nearly 3,000 deaths a year related to fuel poverty on this island and children who grow up in poorly heated homes are more likely to develop respiratory diseases and have prolonged absences from school and, therefore, poorer outcomes in their overall life.  However, we still have no energy poverty strategy from this Government.  The last such strategy lapsed in 2019.  Where is the urgency to address what is happening in this country right now with rising energy bills and poverty?</p><p>It is all well and good to tell people to stop burning solid fuels but often, when one lives from week to week, the only way to manage one's budget is to burn solid fuels.  Sometimes that is wood collected from laneways, as was reported in the survey I did, or wood taken from skips to heat a home.  That is how people are heating their homes right now.</p><p>While I commend the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for the launch of its appeal and I would encourage anyone to donate to the organisation, it cannot be an excuse to allow the Government off the hook when it comes to energy poverty.  We need to hear from the Minister for Environment, Climate an Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  We should have a debate on the subject.  Where is the energy poverty strategy?  What are we doing to help those households who cannot afford to heat their homes right now?</p></speech>

I have been pleased to see that there has been an improvement in supports this year.  That is very much due to the work of Bainne Beatha and Ciudi&uacute;, and is a result of this Government listening to women talk about the need to support those who want to breastfeed.</p> <p>I must put on the record that I am appalled at the attitude within the Passport Office at the moment with regard to what it classifies as a medical emergency.  To give some context, we know there are long delays for first-time passport applicants at the moment.  I know a woman with a young baby whom she is breastfeeding.  She is a Czech citizen but has residency here.  She needs to travel to the Czech Republic on 5 December for urgent surgery and, of course, needs to bring her baby with her because she is breastfeeding that child.  There are long delays in the Passport Office.  I understand it can take up to eight weeks after a passport has been submitted for the Passport Office to begin to process that application.  Because of that long delay, that Czech woman wants to withdraw her passport application but she has been told that she must wait for eight weeks.  She cannot get her own passport back from the Passport Office.  Not alone is she not able to travel at the start of December for her surgery, she cannot bring her baby either because she cannot get a passport for the child.  We have asked about medical emergencies and been told that breastfeeding a baby does not qualify as a medical emergency.  We must see a shift in the mindset within the Passport Office with regard to these exceptional cases.  We must be seen to be promoting and supporting women who choose to breastfeed in this country.</p> <p>I have listened to the arguments about the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and why it should not be reopened to applicants and why the cuts that were imposed last Tuesday were justified.  It is worth reminding the House that the cut was imposed on the day restrictions were reimposed for certain elements of the night-time economy.  There have been reports that the Department of Finance has stated that in order to get more construction workers off the PUP and into the sector, the payment needs to be cut.  We must ask what dignity and respect we are affording to workers who are losing their jobs because of the restrictions.  What are we saying to DJs, musicians and people who work as bouncers on the doors of nightclubs about their skills and livelihoods?  We are telling them to go and get a job in a caf&eacute;.  There is a real issue here.  At the start of the pandemic, we did respect people's livelihoods and skills but that has gone over the past week, in particular.  It sends a poor message to those in the arts and culture sector, and to those in the night-time economy, about our respect for their livelihoods.</p></speech>

We all know the Bill is really important.  I commend the Leader on her work on it.  It is necessary to stop the hypocritical practice of importing peat.</p> <p>I wish to highlight the report of the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, called Grounded: Unequal access for people with disabilities to personal transport schemes.  I have stood here on many a morning raising the inaccessibility of transport services.  I have outlined how each Department is failing in respect of its responsibility to implement the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The scheme for the motorised transport grant and mobility allowance has been closed since 2013.  Many of us have raised issues concerning the disabled drivers and passengers scheme and the ridiculous hoops people have to jump through to get a primary medical certificate from the HSE.  In 2001, the scheme's criteria were highlighted by a former Ombudsman as being extremely limited and excessively restrictive.  I call for a debate on these schemes so we change our rigid, bureaucratic system to allow people to gain access to transport and services and live like the valued people they are in our country.  Every day, I receive emails from people who are just blocked out of, or barred from, our society.  The time is up on that.</p></speech>

When will the gambling control Bill be before the Oireachtas?  Are there any answers to my questions on the need to deal with the waiting lists affecting child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS?  I would like those questions addressed.</p> <p>I have two practical solutions to propose in the context of dealing with climate change.  First, given the threat to energy supply, there should be community wind turbines looking after every community and feeding energy into the grid and sometimes making money for them.  This could be based on the co-operative model that worked and developed Ireland at the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century.  It should be done immediately.  It can be done and should be done in every community.  A wind turbine should be put in each community for that community.  That is the first point on which I would like the Leader to follow up.</p> <p>Second, a small section of each farm in the country could be planted rather than having an ambitious plan to plant whole tracts.  A few acres of each farm could be planted.  This could be incentivised.  Most farms, certainly in the part of the world I come from, have a few non-arable acres, a few difficult acres or a few acres in a bad place.  These could be planted.  They would comprise a carbon sink.</p> <p>I had better observe good timekeeping because I will assume the Chair and cannot ask others to do what I do not do myself.</p></speech>

Human trafficking, which is a $150 billion global industry, is one of the greatest examples of violence against women and girls.  In addition, millions of women and girls are forced to marry and to work in terrible conditions for little pay and no chance of education.</p><p>Ireland's Actions Against Trafficking in Human Beings, which is the submission of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to the Council of Europe Group of Experts on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings, came out in October.  According to that report, Ireland is both a destination and a transition country for trafficking in persons.  Overall, more women than men are trafficked in Ireland, and almost all are migrants.  Certain sectors, such as hospitality, fishing, agriculture and construction, may rely on a workforce of people in vulnerable situations.  At the same time, victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation are almost exclusively migrant women.  Trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation in Ireland is highly gendered.  Based on the sources to date, it is established that at least 34 minors, mostly girls, have been trafficked in Ireland since 2013.  The UN special rapporteur on the sale and sexual exploitation of children, including child prostitution, child pornography and other child sexual abuse material, visited Ireland in May 2018 and published a report on her visit in November 2019.  In her report the rapporteur pointed to a lack of a dedicated and integrated strategy to respond to sexual violence against children.  She further noted gaps in data gathering, barriers within the criminal justice system and the need for care and recovery services to be bolstered around the country in order that services available to child victims are timely and continuous.  IHREC recommends that the State works with the Central Statistics Office to develop a methodology for collecting uniform and reliable data on the scale and different forms of sexual abuse and exploitation of children, in line with the recent recommendations of the UN special rapporteur's report on the sale and sexual exploitation of children.  Perhaps we could get the Minister for Justice to come before the House for a debate on this very serious concern.  It is awful to think that 34 children in our country have been trafficked since 2013.</p></speech>

It includes 40% cost-rental, 40% social and 20% affordable housing and is a physical manifestation of the legislation that was passed in these Houses, so we should congratulate the Minister on that.

I raised this last week and the Minister has agreed to meet the community behind the cost-rental model in St. Michael's Estate.  I would like to see more fresh impetus behind that scheme.</p> <p>I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has sought to exclude from the redress scheme those who were in mother and baby homes for less than six months.  I know other people have raised this.  I saw today that 30 clinicians have written to the Minister to say how damaging early childhood trauma can be and that it is shocking that these people have been excluded.  Whether you are one day or one year in such a place, it will have a really detrimental impact on you.  In the space of six months there is ample opportunity to be emotionally or physically abused.  Many children were boarded out, sometimes adopted out illegally or sent to industrial schools.  I would like to know the rationale for the exclusion of those who spent less than six months in these homes.</p></speech>

We see today promotions about buying on Black Friday and they will get greater and greater in number over the coming days.  It is the day on which you can get products cheapest, supposedly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If there was ever a year when we should try to promote local shopping, it is this year.  The Government has supported businesses throughout the pandemic, over the past 18 months and longer, but there is no greater support that an individual can give than to go into his or her local shop to buy a shirt or book because the money goes back into the community.  As attractive as some online offers seem to be in the context of people getting the best sale price they will ever get, much of the time this does not seem to be the case.  The prices are put up for a period in order that they can be dropped again for Black Friday.  The latter has become a phenomenon in America and there are major sales online in Ireland.  The Government needs to do as much as it can to support businesses in small towns such as the one I am from, Clonmel.  I accept, however, that Clonmel is actually a fine size.  If the Government or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment could set up a campaign of some kind for businesses that greatly rely on support from their local communities, that would be great.  We should encourage people, this year above any other, to shop locally and support local businesses as much as possible and to spend their money in shops in Clonmel and other towns.</p></speech>

We know that two key schemes were scrapped in 2013, namely, the mobility transport grant and the mobility allowance.  These were grants which allowed people to purchase motorised vehicles or to access taxis to go to work, to shop and to take part in the life of their communities.  It is bad enough that they were scrapped in 2013, but the fact that there are still no schemes in place for these people eight years on is just unacceptable.  I cannot imagine what it must have been like for people with disabilities listening to the Ombudsman express his deep frustration as he leaves his role and stating that after eight years in the job he has made no progress and that there appears to be no one in government willing to listen and take action on this key issue.  We often talk now about previous Governments and what they should have done, but this Government is not delivering for these people and nor did that which preceded it.</p> <p>How can it be that we have a Government which appears to be happy to sit with its arms folded and continue to discriminate against people with disabilities eight years on?  There is absolutely no excuse for this.  The Ombudsman made the point very clearly that the reason there has not been any action is because the Government is not prepared to spend the money.  That is not my view; it is the view of the Ombudsman as he leaves his role.  I am asking for an urgent debate on this issue.  It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that this action is not delayed any further as eight years of failure are more than enough.</p></speech>

It is almost exactly one month to Christmas.  I know that we all want to look forward to Christmas but all of the media talk and speculation is about lockdowns, shutdowns and circuit breakers.  It is three weeks since I contributed to the Order of Business because I was also hit with Covid-19.  Everybody is very alert to the infection rates and we are all frightened.  We have all been there and nobody wants to go back to the lockdowns.</p> <p>I do not believe that a lockdown is inevitable.  I listened to Dr. Tony Holohan.  He clearly stated that nobody has yet been infected, has been hospitalised or has, sadly, died in December.  With 80% of the population vaccinated and with more than 7.8 million vaccines administered, with the booster campaign already delivered to the most vulnerable who we are protecting, and with the Covid-19 certificate being more widely used and accepted, a lockdown is not inevitable.  We certainly have to increase, however, the public&rsquo;s ability to conduct their own screening such as people who are not symptomatic but who are engaged in education, entertainment, retail, in public transportation, all of whom are considered now to be high-risk activities which we need to recognise.</p> <p>The Government and the Cabinet are meeting this week and are considering all of the actions they can take to support businesses, the entertainment and hospitality sectors and all other sectors.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I urge the Leader to urge the Government to make antigen tests free and freely available instead of &euro;5 a test.  We want people to screen themselves two or three times a week, which is what people need to do when they are not symptomatic, to ensure they are safe and engaging in safe activities.  We need the Government to make antigen tests free.  I ask the Leader to write to the Taoiseach and the Cabinet subcommittee on Covid and urge them to make this tool available to the general public, who are reducing their contacts and increasing their social distancing.  They are doing everything they can to avoid a lockdown.</p></speech>

It is having a serious effect, particularly on many people in the tourism and hospitality industry, including pubs and restaurants.  My party colleague, Councillor Colin Dalton, works for a local cash and carry that covers the midlands.  I spoke to him this morning.  Businesses are afraid to order in advance for Christmas based on what is in the media.  They are afraid of being left with out of date stock.  We need to come out quite clearly and state that we will not have a lockdown.  We need to push a new communication message to get more people to get vaccinated.  There is a responsibility on the 7% of people who have not been vaccinated to look at the effect they are having on our hospital service.  I spoke to a relative who works as a theatre nurse manager in one of the major hospitals in Dublin.  A significant number of theatre staff are not vaccinated.  Unvaccinated staff are not allowed to work in theatres so hospital management must try to get agency staff to cover theatres because of staff who have not been vaccinated.  There is a responsibility on people.  We need to reinforce this message ahead of Christmas.  It has to be our priority this year.  We do not need a lockdown.  Businesses have suffered enough.  We need to support them.</p> <p>David McRedmond, the chief executive of An Post, was on the radio this morning.  As everyone knows, I work with An Post.  There is a responsibility throughout the Government to support the network.  It is a very difficult period for An Post.  Our social welfare business dived dramatically during Covid.  It is reducing by 12% per year.  The long-term future not just of rural post offices but of the entire network including in cities is at a very difficult stage.  I urge colleagues from all parties to support the network throughout the country.  It has huge significance for all of our communities.  The local post office is about maintaining communities throughout the country.</p></speech>

I hope he is not affected too badly by it.  I will continue on the theme Senators Conway, Carrigy, Fitzpatrick and others referenced on Covid and next month.  Here we are on 23 November and the month of December is traditionally the most important for the licensed trade and hospitality business, at between 2.5 and three times the normal month.  It is not like closing in March, November or October.  It is a significant month.  Of course we have to have balance and of course we have to make sure we are safe but it is so important that we encourage people.  We must look at the figures and try to make sure everybody knows the vaccination system is very safe.  I know we got a lot of emails in response to something I said to the Leader on another day.  They really work.  If we look at the figures that came out yesterday, the 54% in ICU who are unvaccinated are generally younger and extremely healthy before they get Covid but they end up in ICU.  They are healthy younger people who just did not think it would affect them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Everybody who has been vaccinated and is in ICU has an underlying condition.  We wish them all well.  However, the point is that vaccines work.</p><p>As others have said, vaccine certificates should be required for entry into gyms and hairdressers.  Why not introduce such a requirement for supermarkets and public transport?  I know it is difficult to police some of these things, but really, if people want to participate in society, they need to be vaccinated.  If they do not want to participate in society, that is okay.  They can stay at home; that is their business.  However, unvaccinated people are putting themselves, their families, the rest of us and the economy at risk.  None of us wants a lockdown.  It is in all of our hands to behave as best we can.  We can socialise safely.  If people are vaccinated, it is unlikely to do them too much harm if they do not have a pre-existing condition.</p><p>I ask the Leader to organise a proper discussion of this issue.  New communities may not be as tuned into mainstream media, newspapers and radio.  Let us ensure all are aware of the benefits of vaccination.</p></speech>

Senator Ruane is the chair of the Canal Communities Local Drug and Alcohol Task Force and I am the chair of the D12 Local Drug and Alcohol Task force.  First, we must remind ourselves the drug task forces, as we all commonly refer to them, are actually drug and alcohol task forces.  We recognise, particularly following the entry into force of the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018, that alcohol is a problem.  It is a drug and it affects communities and people's health.  Three people die every day of alcohol-related illnesses in Ireland.</p> <p>The short film is extraordinary.  It has hand-drawn by Sadhbh Lawlor and Gary Gowran.  It shows and demonstrates the incredible increase in the supply of alcohol and in the number of outlets supplying it in our respective areas, between the canal communities and Dublin 12.  In the period between 1991 and 2018, the number of outlets supplying alcohol increased from 45 outlets to 125 in what is quite a small community.  If you live in that area, at any one moment, you are no more than 300 m away from an outlet that will sell you alcohol.  For those who are recovering in the community, coping with the aftermath and trying to hold it together, especially in Covid times when it has been especially difficult and stressful, a short walk brings them past probably four outlets that sell alcohol.  I wish to bring the film to the attention of Members.  It is coming everybody's way.  It is going to be used by the drug and alcohol task forces and youth groups throughout the country.  It is very powerful and impactful.</p> <p>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, on having the courage to bring forward the Commencement matter on the minimum unit pricing of alcohol in January.  That will make a huge difference.  The figures are such that for every citizen over the age of 15 in this country, 40 bottles of vodka are consumed per year.  It is an extraordinary consumption.  Indeed, consumption has increased by 425% over a very short period of time.  We need to take that very seriously.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Fine Gael group, the Leader of the House, Senator Doherty, together with Senator Robbie Gallagher, presented the cross-party Horticultural Peat (Temporary Measures) Bill 2021 today.  The Bill shows how we can deal with the practical impact of the lack of peat for the horticultural industry, and that industry only.  Currently, peat is being imported, which does not make sense.  The Bill shows how to deal with those practical impacts.  It is a temporary measure and will support growers.  Only 0.12% of the total of Irish peatland is required to deliver the measure.  As highlighted by Senator Doherty, importing peat involves high monetary and environmental costs.  It is practical temporary step we can put in place until there is a viable alternative.  Limiting the number of licences will also ensure it is used for the domestic market only.  It is a practical measure that will be in place only for a short time until we have practical alternatives.  It is a measure that will prevent the higher costs of importing peat into this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank Senator Doherty for working on cross-party lines and for working with us as well to pass the Bill.</p></speech>

Tomorrow, the Irish Road Haulage Association will hold a demonstration outside Leinster House and will probably bring the city and the country to their knees.  Many road hauliers' businesses are on the line.  It is difficult for them to keep going in light of the high cost of road diesel over recent months.  That is not taking into account the carbon tax increase that will be in place from next May.  I propose the Government examine this issue and provide some form of rebate for road hauliers.  The price of diesel affects everybody because it increases the cost of food and the cost of the transport of food, including in regard to exports.</p> <p>More than any other country, we need road hauliers.  Most of our exports and goods in general are trafficked by lorries and road haulage.  The industry is a must for this country and is very important.  Hauliers would not plan to demonstrate tomorrow were they not feeling the pinch.  I ask that the Government introduce some sort of rebate.  We did this before in regard to road tax on goods vehicles, which was reduced a number of years ago, and something similar should be done to resolve the predicament faced by these people, who give a great service to this country.</p> <p>Never before was the cost of transport so competitive.  It is a very competitive industry.  This will put some hauliers out of business and will, eventually, affect the competitiveness of the entire industry.  Will the Leader convey that message to the Government?</p></speech>

He is a gentleman and a pleasure to work with.  I thank him most sincerely for his tenure in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>I support Senator McGreehan and commend the Leader and Senator Gallagher on the horticultural Bill.  It is farcical that we are importing peat.</p> <p>I rise primarily to seek a debate on the future of sport, particularly boxing.  There seems to be an all-out civil war in Irish amateur boxing.  The representative association's annual general meeting, AGM, scheduled for next weekend, has been deferred.  Candidates have been put forward and then retracted and 25 members were expelled last week.  Members of the Dublin, Leinster and Connacht clubs have voted no confidence in the central council.  It is a great concern that people of the calibre of Andrew Duncan are being treated the way they are.  I know him well.  He is a person of value, substance and high integrity who puts the sport of boxing first, second and third.</p> <p>Our boxers should be revelling in the joy of last summer with the deeds of Kellie Harrington and others who have achieved Olympic success.  Instead, there has been an Oireachtas committee meeting on Irish amateur boxing and there will be an independent review.  Will the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, come to the House for a debate on boxing?  Let us bring an end, once and for all, to this ongoing review that is damaging the sport of boxing from grassroots level to high performance.  The young boys and girls of our boxing clubs, and our young adults and potential and current Olympians, deserve boxing to be free from rancour.  Will the Leader invite the Minister of State to appear before the House for a debate on the future of sport, especially boxing, in our country?</p></speech>

We all feel it a little bit but the colder weather has not stopped the good people of D&uacute;n Laoghaire and south-east Dublin from swimming in the sea, despite the temperature having fallen so much.  We know the benefits of sea swimming and how good it is for the cardiovascular system and for building up the immune system.  There is no doubt about that.  The people who go swimming at Seapoint, the Forty Foot, Hawk Cliff and Sandycove are entitled to a minimum standard of water quality.  At the moment, they are not guaranteed it.  I go swimming less often than I would like.  The quality of the water varies greatly from one day to the next.  It is reasonable for people who swim in the sea to expect the water to be clean and hygienic and for it to be unlikely that they will pick up an infection, possibly bacterial, because the water being discharged from sewage plants is not properly filtered and cleaned.  UV treatment and ongoing monitoring of the water throughout the year, and not just in the summer, is needed.  People swim all year round and should be entitled to expect high-quality water all year round.  They should be given assurance by Irish Water, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities that the water is clean and free of bacteria that might make them sick.</p></speech>

Even people who are not as brave as some of those who have been doing it for years have taken to our seas.  I see it outside my office in Skerries all of the time.  It is just wonderful.  The very least people expect is for the water to be tested and for guarantees to be given.  I do not know if D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in the Senator's neck of the woods, continues to test, but Fingal County Council certainly does in ours.  I can write to Irish Water if that would be of any assistance to him.</p> <p>Senator Buttimer asked for a debate on sport.  I brought the issue of boxing, which Senator Carrigy raised last week, to the attention of Deputy Chambers.  I am very sorry to hear that the situation has deteriorated even further.  I can contact the Minister of State's office again today to see if we can schedule a debate not just on boxing, but on sport in general.  I will come back to the Senator on that.</p> <p>Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of the impending protests, which we are aware are to take place tomorrow.  The increase in the price of fuel is driving an awful lot of the discontent in certain industries.  The haulage, taxi and transport industries expressed concerns over the weekend.  I will certainly bring the Senator's concerns to the Ministers for Transport and Finance and let them know what the feedback is.</p> <p>A number of colleagues raised the issue of the Horticultural Peat (Temporary Measures) Bill 2021.  I will be very pleased to accept the amendment to the Order of Business in that regard.  I thank colleagues for their help.  I will take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues for their assistance and support.  I ask all of our Opposition colleagues to look favourably on the Bill after they have had an opportunity to look at it.  There is a briefing session tomorrow.  We hope to schedule debate on the Bill in the coming weeks.  There is a crisis in the industry that is not of the industry's own making.  I totally acknowledge that the Government should have addressed this issue before now but I hope it will now see our Bill in the spirit intended and understand its intent.  It aims to bring this issue to a conclusion by providing a derogation to the industry, which supports 17,000 jobs and, more importantly, produces food for every one of us, supplying the supermarkets and markets we go shopping in every week.  I thank Senator Dolan for raising the matter today.</p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the video, "Turning Down the Volume".  I wish her well.  She highlighted some shocking statistics.  I was sitting there and thinking that, because I do not drink vodka, it does not apply to me but that just means that somebody else is drinking a number of bottles on my behalf if the numbers are right.  I am sure that is true for many people in the country who do not drink spirits.</p></speech>

I will try to organise a debate on that level of consumption and the State's reaction to that growing issue.</p> <p>Senator Horkan and others raised an issue.  It is interesting to see that for every person who gives out about the fact that new restrictions may come in between now and Christmas, there is another who would very much welcome such restrictions.  That is not only the case in here, but in society.  Society is very divided at the moment.  People need to have the opportunity to earn a livelihood.  We have taken that away from too many people for too long.  We should do absolutely everything possible to keep businesses, venues and entertainment, including swimming pools, sporting venues, GAA clubs, restaurants and bars, open.  We need to keep society open.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must do everything we can to ensure we keep it open.

I listened to Mr. David McRedmond on RT&Eacute; this morning and heard his welcome call seeking more business to be put through the An Post network of more than 900 post offices around the country.  I appreciate they are doing banking on behalf of some of the pillar banks that have pulled out of some towns, which is an awful pity, but there is a great deal more that the State can do and should be doing.  During my time in the Department of Social Protection they played a huge role in alleviating fraud in respect of the social welfare payments made through the system.  One of Mr. McRedmond's biggest criticisms this morning was the fact that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, was paid directly into people's bank or Revolut accounts.  I have to be honest with Senators.  Obviously, I was a Minister at the conception of the PUP.  It was done for speed.  Many people did not have post office accounts so we just had to do it.  However, we have managed to tweak and refine that payment over time and now it is being wound down, but we certainly should be looking towards increasing the social welfare payments through the post offices.  It was a vital flow of revenue for them, but it also ensured that we saved revenue because of the human interaction with payments.  It is something we should definitely return to.</p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick mentioned lockdown and the media, and asked for antigen testing to be free.  That is something I concur with and I have been saying it until I have probably been blue in the face, but I believe we will get there eventually.  I am aware that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is bringing a memorandum to the Cabinet next week.</p> <p>Senator Gavan asked for a debate on the Ombudsman.  I have put in a request.  This morning's report is shocking and I am not taking away from it.  It is a sad reflection on the response of this Government and its predecessor to the shelving of the mobility grant scheme in 2013.  I acknowledge the Senator said that today.  I have a debate scheduled on the cost of disability report that I commissioned in 2019.  That might encompass both aspects because transport is obviously a huge cost for people who have different abilities or disabilities but if the Senator would like a separate debate, he might talk to me afterwards.</p></speech>

It is probably more important this year than it has ever been.  We will have campaigns in all our localities to try to support businesses on our high streets.  It is absolutely vital given how businesses have been afflicted in the last 18 months.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh and Boyhan mentioned the passing of permission last night for 853 homes to be built on Oscar Traynor Road.  That is very welcome.</p> <p>Senator Keogan spoke about violence against women and the 34 minors who were trafficked in Ireland in the last number of years.  The most shocking thing about that for me, if it was not shocking enough in itself, was the fact that it was two women who were trafficking those young girls in Ireland.  For the life of me I could not get my head around how a woman would use a young girl or woman in that industry.  However, the Senator asked for that debate and I will certainly organise it.  It will probably be in the new year, but I will do it as quickly as I can.</p> <p>Senator Joe O'Reilly had specific questions about the gambling control Bill and the CAMHS waiting lists.  I do not have an answer for the Senator, but I will make the request for the information today and refer back to him.</p> <p>Senator McGreehan spoke about the Ombudsman's report and referred to the provision of primary medical certificates.  She talked about valuable members of our community.  We all have them where we live.  There is a saying, if I do not get the words wrong, that the measure of any state is how it treats the most vulnerable.  We have left a lot to be desired, but we have an opportunity to raise this, supported by the Ombudsman's report, and to say that the time has come to stop talking.  We all acknowledge that it will cost money, but everything costs money.  It is about our choices, as Senator Gavan has said previously.  I thank the Senator for raising that.</p> <p>In response to what Senator Sherlock said, I cannot even fathom it.  First, I do not believe a woman should have to tell the Passport Office that she is breastfeeding just so she can get a passport to bring her small baby with her back to her country.  All of us have reflected in the last couple of months on the difficulties there have been in the Passport Office.  To be honest, it is infuriating to deal with it at present, and that is not to say that the officials are not trying their best.  They are lovely and helpful.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is dysfunctional at the moment.  The Senator has highlighted how dysfunctional, which is a real shame.</p><p>Senator Boylan talked about the Society of St. Vincent de Paul appeal that is being launched today, something it does every year.  We reflect on the fact that it is kind of sad that as a State we need to have these appeals every year.  We as a nation have hundreds of charities that do enormous and incredible work for different sections of society and different people who, at different times in their lives, need a little bit of a helping hand, although not necessarily consistently.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is one of the most loved and much lauded charitable organisations in the country.  I wish it success this year because it has extra families to help due to a number of reasons.  </p><p>I want to correct something that Senator Boylan said, namely that Sinn F&eacute;in had asked for discretionary funds to be made available for people.  They are already available, and have been available for probably 30 or 40 years, through the Department of Social Protection  They are called exceptional needs payments.  For the past number of years, the availability of those payments have become freer.  Some &euro;24 billion of taxpayers' money is now being spent through the Department.</p><p>Senator Garvey mentioned an event the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney is going to, which she thinks it is inappropriate.  If it is okay with the Leas Cathaoirleach, I will get more details of the event because if, as alluded to, I would think it is probably not appropriate.  I do not have all the details so I will come back to the Senator.</p><p>Senator Boyhan spoke about the peat Bill, and I want to thank him and welcome his positive contribution.  He mentioned the fact that planning for 853 homes had been passed yesterday evening.  </p><p>Senator Conway expressed his concerns and wishes around expanding Covid certificates to other services.</p><p>Senator Fiona O'Loughlin, along with the Leas-Chathaoirleach, wished Christy Moore continued success.  He has entertained all of us.  I do not think we think we own him just because we are from Kildare.  We all think we own a little bit of him because he is such a legend and a fabulous musician.  </p><p>On a more serious note, Senator O'Loughlin mentioned that her cross-party committee on dementia had a significant presentation from Professor Sean Kennelly.  The advances that are being made are wonderful, in particular for dementia and Alzheimer's patients.  We can now know about it years before it is diagnosed.  It is to be hoped that in a lot of cases, people are diagnosed before it is too late and the advent or onset of dementia and Alzheimer's disease is slowed down.</p><p>Nobody referred to Amanda Brown, so I would like to mention her.  She was on RT&Eacute; radio this morning.  I do not know if anybody knows who she is.  She is the stepdaughter of the late David Tweed.  I want to put on the record that her bravery, courage and, in particular, her dignity this morning was humbling.  She is a powerful woman and the testimony she gave and the fight she has had over a number of years is genuinely humbling to observe.  She deserves and requires the support and respect of people who have made inappropriate comments on the passing of David Tweed over the past couple of months.  I want to put on the record of the House that I thought she was powerful.</p></speech>

The crux of this amendment is what the Minister can stipulate in respect of that figure.</p></speech>

This is one that we discussed at length on Committee Stage.  My position has not changed.  It is considered that these amendments would be overly prescriptive.  We are changing it now to improve it from 15% to 30% but the intent is to allow the discretion with the local authority.  I do not have to advise Senators that we had an extensive debate on Committee Stage when there was lots of really good interaction.  This is about restoring planning to local authorities.  If we are restoring it to local authorities, we need to allow them and the planners to make those decisions.  I believe that up to 30% is the correct balance to strike.  We want brownfield development and mixed development, particularly within our cities where there has been a massive issue with regard to viability.  I thank the Senator for tabling the amendment but I have not changed my position and will not be accepting it.</p></speech>

With regard to LRD floor space not used for the purposes of housing, the amendment provides that there would be a public consultation for individuals and community groups which the planning authority would have regard to in the granting of permissions for that space.  The Government has spoken a lot about this legislation and new processes in the delivery of housing but it is essential that the process seeks to engage the public as much as possible in the creation of new communities.</p> <p>Amendment No. 10, similarly to amendment No. 9, will provide that with regard to student accommodation, the Minister shall provide for consultation with educational institutions, representative student bodies and elected members of the planning authority, who may in the course of such a consultation set out conditions in respect of student accommodation to which the planning authority must have due regard in rendering an opinion under section 32D.</p></speech>

In fairness, Senator Higgins outlined her position on this and I explained why I did not believe it would be appropriate.  My primary concern regarding student complexes is that they should not be used as permanent residential accommodation or as a hotel or hostel.  I issued this circular a number of weeks ago.  They are dedicated student accommodation complexes and that is how it should be, particularly always having regard to the general shortage of student accommodation.  We are tackling the matter and intend for it to happen.  I am happy that this provision is appropriate and it strikes the right balance for considering whether student accommodation development goes through the LRDs process.  I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

We need to take account of the impact of development on our emissions, to estimate those emissions, and to ensure that the most sustainable building practices are being used and are reflected in the law in Ireland.</p><p>Amendment No. 20 seeks to insert criteria into the determination of the application by the planning authority, particularly changes in building and planning guidelines, obligations under the UNCRPD, or other such issues that may have arisen as part of an area development planning process. </p></speech>

Again, we went through these in great detail on Committee Stage.  I propose to address amendments Nos. 4 and 20 first.  These are matters far more appropriate for building control and are dealt with in our building control and standards legislation rather than planning legislation.  The area of the rights of persons with disabilities is one that we all espouse and we make sure that we do have universal design concepts in place too.  To have this in the Bill, however, would simply take one element of building control and planning design and put it into the Bill as opposed to all others.  We do not think it is appropriate to put these amendments into the Bill.</p> <p>On amendment No. 5 and climate emissions, I debated this at length with Senator Higgins.  The whole area of embodied carbon emissions is addressed in the climate action plan and construction products regulation.  It is not appropriate for inclusion in this legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I cannot accept any of the three amendments.</p></speech>

To express carbon emissions so thoroughly within a Bill is inappropriate.  However, it would be remiss of me, as a member of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, not to highlight the fact that witnesses have come before the committee to report that building regulations are not centred on their needs.  Their ability to visit properties is catered for but their ability to stay over is not.  People can come and visit but there is no requirement for their needs to be catered for further.  It is fine if they are visiting the ground floor but there is no facility if they need to go upstairs.  When we come to building regulations and all those other aspects, we must ensure the voices of people with disabilities are included at the centre of the discussion and influence the outcome so that there is nothing about us without us.</p></speech>

Without rehashing and going over what we said last week, participative engagement by citizens and elected members of city and county councils is vitally important.  We need to see it in the context of a form of local government.  I posed a question here last week and thereafter received calls from three sitting councillors in Limerick.  I did not think too much about the issue until I received those phone calls yesterday.  If we are to have an elected mayor of Limerick, as we and others have been advocating, that mayor would have no function under the new legislation we are bringing in.  The mayor would be out of all of this.  We may change legislation in the future but we must strengthen the powers of our elected members in local authorities.  That engagement existed in the strategic housing development, SHD, process.  It is important that the LRD process will restore the previous two-stage planning process by returning the primary decision-making functions to the planning authority and the appeal mechanism to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As politicians, we sometimes get caught up in all the words and legislation but there must be three or four key measures, when one drills down into the matter.  In fairness, the Minister has said that repeatedly.  That is an important measure.  When I leave this Chamber, I like to think that I take away some concise messages and retain the full integrity of what they mean when I pass them on.  This is one of those key measures.  We are going away from the terrible SHD process.  We can forget about who was responsible and who prolonged that process.  That was yesterday and it is in the past.  Going forward, we will now have a two-stage process and I welcome that.  I support this amendment, in particular.</p></speech>

My colleagues and I were happy on Committee Stage when the Minister indicated a positive attitude towards this amendment.  I am aware that Senator Boyhan has worked with the Minister on this provision and I am glad that the role of the local authority members is being represented in this legislation.  The habit of SHD applications working outside the relevant county development plans has been a bone of contention for councillors for years.  I hope that our move towards this new LRD process will place a higher, more appropriate onus on the work of our local councillors in planning.</p></speech>

We have discussed these amendments and they have a great deal of merit.  The two amendments are similar.  I said on Committee Stage that we would work together to see how we can move the situation forward.  There is merit in such proposals although I did flag there may be issues around structure and wording.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I note that the Senators have come back with a revised wording for such a provision.  As I have said, amendments Nos. 6 and 7 are very similar but I am happy to accept an amendment in this regard.  Given that amendments Nos. 6 and 7 aim to provide for a broadly similar provision, we do not need both amendments.  I recognise that Senators Boyhan, Keogan, Higgins, Ruane, Craughwell and Black have all worked on similar amendments.  Therefore, I am accepting amendment No. 7 as the wording is consistent with the general wording of the Bill.  That is the amendment that Senators Boyhan and Keogan have just been talking about.  I would genuinely like to thank all Senators from both sides of the House for the constructive nature of the discussions around this provision.  To put it in context, Senator Boyhan is right when she says it is about bringing planning back to local government.  The SHD process review said it was good that councillors were involved in the submission stage, but it only went to the board then.  As we discussed on Second Stage and Committee Stage, we want to have both.  When every application is lodged, every local elected representative is going to know about it.  He or she must be informed about it.  It must not happen on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis and must not depend on which council is involved.  Every councillor will be advised when an LRD is applied for.  I thank the Senators for amendment No. 6 but I cannot accept it.  Amendment No. 7 is more precise and I am happy to accept it.</p></speech>

We have discussed much of this before.  It is disappointing that the Minister has not accepted the amendments we discussed on Committee Stage, which would retain the right of the city and county council.  The Minister made his case with regard to it.  We had a vote on it as well, and clearly it was not supported by any of the Government parties in the House.</p> <p>It is important that city and county councils, given their collective views, their huge involvement locally and their huge knowledge of their communities, would be supported.  This is a reasonable amendment.  As I said before, it is important to value their contribution.  All this amendment would do is give discretion to the planning authority to engage with local councillors ahead of an LRD meeting to get their perspectives on matters of interest or concern to the community that should be taken into consideration.  After all, these people represent the community.  Rather than having a situation where planners say to councils that they cannot discuss applications with them because the legislation bars them from doing so, we are proposing to give them the right and the discretion to engage.  We must recognise that we are merely giving the planners some discretion.  I recognise the enormous and valuable work done by planners.  I want to put it on the record that they work hard, often under pressure in terms of resources, time and expertise.</p> <p>Planning has become a complicated issue.  I am saying it is important to send a clear message.  I took the trouble to look at the number of Government Ministers, Deputies and Senators who have engaged or made objections.  I remind the House that observations are not always negative.  As the Minister said earlier, it can be an observation.  We always talk in the negative.  People can make positive contributions and positive statements in regard to planning.  It does happen.  I have certainly done it.  I have sent in submissions of a positive nature.</p> <p>I want the message to go out loud and clear today that we will support city and county councils in their efforts with the planners to have an opportunity to share their local knowledge and their understanding of the community.  Ultimately, planners make decisions.  We are back to a two-stage process.  I reiterate that this proposal will not stop any individual councillor from sending in a submission in his or her own right.  There is something to be gained in terms of that shared engagement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I like the idea that it is open and transparent.  It is not a matter of someone having a word with a planner in a room; it is a matter of a formal meeting at which concerns are shared.

It is a simple amendment, not one that forces the hand of or constrains the planning authority in any way.  It simply adds an express reference to the elected members of the local authority where the legislation sets out that the planning authority may meet persons who have relevant information prior to the LRD meeting.</p> <p>When we think of relevant information when it comes to planning, our councillors should be at the forefront of our minds.  As Senator Boyhan pointed out, local ties, boots on the ground, the eyes and ears of the community and knowledge of the physical area and the social environment all serve to place our elected members in a prime position to contribute in an indispensable way to decisions made regarding planning in their areas.  I hope the Minister will consider accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

He fully understands the need for councillors to be able to engage.  That will happen but it is important to put on the record of the House that the Minister has engaged widely with councillors, certainly through our group.

We accepted the previous amendment, but we cannot accept every amendment.  I will give the reasons we cannot accept those under discussion.  We have discussed this.  Let me return to the original point.  This is about restoring planning functions to local authorities, which is what the Government wants; however, it is also about restoring the primacy of the development plans.  We discussed this the other night.  I refer to the crucial matter of having boots on the ground whereby councillors have the reserve function to put together development plans because they know their areas.  It is from them that the plans emanate.  The purpose of the LRD arrangement is to have a return to the two-stage process.  The primacy of the development plans is restored, and this is also the case in respect of the local area plans and master plans.</p> <p>On consultation, let me refer again to the proposed section 32B(4).  It states: "The planning authority may, prior to the LRD meeting taking place, consult with any person who may, in the opinion of the planning authority, have information that is relevant for the purposes of the LRD meeting in relation to a proposed development."  This is very clear although I understand where Senators want to get to.  I outlined to Senator Higgins the last day my view on the idea of a local authority reaching out beyond the public consultation process and asking a myriad of groups what they think.  We are trying to streamline and improve the planning process while recognising that, in many areas of planning, there are roadblocks that inhibit the development of homes for students and others.  We need to make the system better while restoring local authority responsibility.  I am not accepting either amendment, but I thank the Senators for their contributions.</p></speech>

I will be pushing this to a vote, partly because I have given a commitment to the city and county councils that I will pursue it.  I went through the legislation line by line and thought really hard about this matter.  This is where I stitched it in the provision because, as the Minister has rightly said, it allows the planning authority to engage with a community.  All we are asking for is an explicit reference to elected members of local authorities.  It is very simple.  Instead of using the proposed mechanism, let us put a reference in primary legislation.  Do we believe in the city and county councils?  Do we really believe they have a role to play?  Do we really believe they will not interfere with, or undermine, the system?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Do we really believe they have a role to play?  Do we really believe they will not interfere with or undermine the system?  I believe in them.  More importantly, the AILG and LAMA came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and made a very strong case for this.  They are on the record and on the report for that meeting as having done so.  I understand from talking to them as early as this morning that they were clear.  Their understanding is that the executive took a decision.  They submitted two papers to the committee and I gave a commitment at that committee that I would stand by them and support them.  Ultimately, Members make decisions.  I want to stand by the decision I made to them.  The AILG and LAMA sought this in their submissions.  They are representative bodies of the city and county councils.  It is a reasonable request to allow this additional line including elected local authority members.  I am somewhat surprised that we did not get that from the Minister, but that is his call.  I will push this amendment to a roll call vote.</p></speech>

Planning lists were being issued on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis in certain local authorities.  I respect our councillors, as Senator Boyhan knows.  This Government, since taking office, has done work on councillors' terms and conditions, maternity leave, with the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, me and others, and restoring powers to local government.  We will continue to do that.</p><p>I understand the thrust of the Senators' amendments.  I do not think they are required.  They might in one respect be overly onerous for many in that they apply to every single application that is made.  I have already allowed for the fact that, and made sure that, the planning authority lets every elected member of that local authority be aware of this.  I thank the Senators for tabling their amendments but I will not accept them.</p></speech>

I will be withdrawing amendment No. 11 with the agreement of the House.</p><p>Amendment No. 12 states:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 8, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:  	 <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(2A) The LRD opinion issued by a planning authority under subsection (1) shall be made public when a planning application in respect of the proposed development is made in accordance with section 34.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>I thank the Minister and his officials for the engagement I have had with them.  One issue I had to return to, having thought about it, relates to the independent review body.  I am now satisfied, having had a detailed read of the body's report.  It noted the highly problematic matter of the deficit in community consultation in respect of SHDs.  It stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Although pre-application meetings with both the Planning Authority and the Board may take place over many months prior to a SHD application being lodged, the general public &ndash; and local residents in particular &ndash; have no knowledge about the proposal, and will have only 5 weeks to inform themselves about the application and (if they so wish) prepare a submission to the Board. With larger and more complex SHD applications, this can cause resentment and a perception of being excluded from the process.<br /><br />We consider that the making the Board's 'Opinion' available to the public following the submission of a SHD planning application, together with a copy of the plans and other details discussed at the tripartite consultation, would alert interested members of the public in relation to a prospective application. However, they would need to be informed about the availability of the Opinion, e.g. by means of the Planning Authority&rsquo;s weekly list of applications and decisions [or its website or whatever mechanism a planning authority would use, or may use, in future]. </blockquote> <p>The amendment will give effect to the review body's proposal in the cases of the LRDS.  While it will do little to address the democratic deficit this legislation retains or to remove it, it will ensure the community has the maximum information at its disposal at the point where it has to get to grips with what are very complex issues for many laypersons, such as the application itself and related issues.</p><p>I could go on but I think the Minister has got the gist of what I am seeking.  I can give more detail, depending on his response.  I hope he will accept the amendment.</p></speech>

It will allow for increased community consultation with regard to large-scale residential developments.  It will be a great improvement on what is quite often a deficit in communication with regard to SHDs.  Involving community stakeholders is a must in regard to developments of this size on account of the profound impacts they will have on areas and communities.</p></speech>

Senator Boyhan quoted from the review committee's report, which relates to SHDs, but the SHDs will cease to exist on 17 December.

That is why we are proposing it.  We discussed it on the previous occasion as well.  I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p></speech>

I want the involvement of elected councillors.  I reiterate that what the Government is doing, in fairness with the support of the Opposition heretofore, is restoring planning to the local authorities.  The primacy of the development plan is very important.  I have read into the record the two sections whereby councillors will be directly involved.  Every application lodged under this process will not just be copied to every councillor, but every councillor will be notified as a matter of course and not at the discretion of the local authority.  We want to ensure that while we are doing this, we are streamlining the planning process as well and making it more efficient and effective while giving people a chance to have their say.  The first observation period will be at the stage when an application is lodged, and rightly so.  Councillors will have the ability to make their views known for free at that stage.  Then, should somebody not be happy with the decision, it can go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as was previously the case prior to SHDs for developments of more than 100 units.</p> <p>In this instance, I understand the purpose of both amendments being tabled.  I also discussed this with Senator Fitzpatrick.  We would like to have an opportunity to consider this in a little more detail in advance of the Bill going to the D&aacute;il.  There is something in them, but I do not want to create another step in the planning process.  I thank Senators Wall, Sherlock, Moynihan, Hoey, Fitzpatrick and Davitt for tabling these amendments.  I have had some discussion on them.  We will have a look at this in advance of going to the D&aacute;il and I will reference the Seanad, if that is okay.</p></speech>

If I do not do so now in respect of amendment No. 18, amendment No. 19 will have been discussed.  I will move amendment No. 19, but I will speak to it now.  The amendments are similar in nature and are grouped together.  I was a member of a local authority for 12 and a half years and many Members were members of local authorities for various periods of time.  It is vital that councillors have their say and an involvement, but I take on board that the Minister is going to reflect on this and, hopefully, bring the spirit of this into the legislation when it goes through the Lower House.  I will be happy to move and withdraw the amendment when we reach it.</p></speech>

The amendments are quite similar, but the most important thing is that it clearly states that there will be this for councillors, because they will have to be notified.  That is important, and councillors have been telling us that.  I acknowledge the fact that the Minister will have a look at this and, hopefully, we will have a situation where councillors will have this notification put in place.</p></speech>

It is something that can be done through the introduction of the zoned land tax, land value sharing and other measures that we are bringing forward.  For large-scale developments, I genuinely think setting a 12-month timeframe would be really problematic.  There was a general understanding that good permissions that had been granted could not be activated if this clause was introduced.  I do not mean this in a condescending way.  I know the spirit in which the amendment has been tabled is well meaning.  We all want to make sure that permissions are activated.  Setting an arbitrary 12-month limit would cause a problem.  I have not changed my views since Committee Stage and I cannot accept amendment No. 21.</p></speech>

I am opposing this amendment because it effectively adds an additional level of consultation to the LRD process and what we are doing, effectively, in this legislation is to allow for proper consultation.  Bringing planning back to local authorities means that residents or any interested groups will be able to make their observations at the first stage and will not have to wait until an application goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The current situation partially accounted for why we have seen an increase in judicial reviews, because groups and interested parties felt they did not have a say during the initial stage.  This proposed amendment seeks to add another layer to the consultation process, but we have greatly improved that aspect already in this legislation.  I am, therefore, opposing the amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister is not accepting these amendments, but I appeal to him in this regard.  He said this SHD process was going to end in February, but it is not ending then and will continue into April for the first category of applicants and into June for the second category of applicants.  Neither I nor my party see any justification for giving a period of 16 weeks to those people who have got their pre-planning approval.  We propose to give them eight weeks instead.</p> <p>Regarding the second category, concerning those people putting their applications in now, we believe they should be rolled into the proposed new LRD process and not given access to the SHD process next year.  We must end this thing.  The Minister made a point regarding how we had opposed transitional arrangements in this context, but this is essentially an invitation for people to get their applications in.  The Minister has a terrible habit of saying he is going to do something, and then we get the longest goodbye possible, accompanied with an invitation for people to get their applications in.  We saw that happen with co-living and we see it here again.  Therefore, I am pressing my amendments and I will bring them to full votes, but I appeal to the Minister to accept them.</p></speech>

I welcome the Senators' engagement with this legislation and thank them for it.  I genuinely welcome that Members of all parties and none are supporting this legislation which will bring a significant change to the planning process.  It is required.  I also welcome Senator Warfield and his party coming around to accepting the need for a transitional arrangement, unlike on Second Stage, where they did not believe that transitional arrangements were needed at all.</p> <p>Passing this Bill would see the new LRD process start from 17 December, and that is what we are aiming for.  If applicants have engaged with the additional SHD process, through the formal pre-planning process, then it is not possible to move them out of that process and into another one.  It is not a long goodbye and we are not extending this situation.  It was the same with co-living, by the way, where we had to include screening for a month.  We did what we said we would do with co-living and this Government has ended that concept.  </p> <p>The reality, however, is that we must provide for a transition in this case, and we are doing that.  We have outlined the process and the timelines involved clearly.  Subject to the legislation being passed by the Oireachtas and signed into law, we aim to have the new LRD process commence from 17 December.  Therefore, I think we have moved as quickly as we can.  Most people will understand that applications in the current system must conclude under the planning system and law that pertained when they were submitted.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If we do not do that then we would be open to challenge of all types.

I thank the Senators for retabling the amendment.  I want the permissions to bring about homes for people.  That is what we earnestly want.  It means a big change in the process.  I say genuinely respectfully that this amendment, as written, would be absolutely unworkable.  I envisage the Oireachtas committee having a role in seeking information on what permissions have been granted and activated, but the amendment refers to "within 30 months of the passing of this Act".  The legislation will pass with the Senators' support and will be in effect from 17 December this year.  There is a lead-in period, which we have discussed, but new applications that have not been in the process will start to come in after 17 December.  Even though we are going to have very strict timeframes, we need to get the process up and running.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We will have the pre-application stage, the application stage, the decision stage and the potential to go to the board.  For any applicant to say that he or she will be in a position to outline what is requested here - and I went through this with Senators Higgins and Black on Committee Stage - just would not be possible as outlined.  However, I can see the role of the joint committee and certainly at the local authority that people would be able to request information of others.  We will have a fully transparent process.  We want to make sure we have a process that is streamlined, that will deliver homes for people and that is not going to just deliver enhanced values on paper permissions.  That is what this Government wants to do.  That is why this legislation is so important and why, to be fair, the Seanad has enabled its swift passage and why I introduced it in this House - so we could tease through a lot of these issues.</p><p>Respectfully, I cannot accept amendment No. 29.</p></speech>

I do not really understand why it is not workable.  Is it the timeframe?  Is it the 30 months?  Is there an alternative way that we can ensure we can report to both Houses on this information just in a different way?</p></speech>

The Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, on which I served during the term of the previous Oireachtas, will regularly seek details overall.  We would have seen details on SHD.  Regarding even the division of the four different items, the Senator is being very prescriptive as to what is looked for, and I cannot give a guarantee that we will be able within the first 30 months to have those data.  Of course we will have data, and what we want to see is a throughput of applications that are granted permissions.  We are seeing activation of those permissions.  We can look at what we could do, maybe through the Oireachtas joint committee.  I will have a look at that between now and the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il to see if there is another mechanism we can use.  All legislation is up for review at any stage.  It will be open to Senator Ruane, as a Senator and a legislator, be it D&aacute;il or Seanad legislation, to bring forward amending legislation that would mean that a Minister would have to come to the House if there were elements of the legislation with which she was not happy.  This is a big piece of legislation and a lot of work has gone into it that we know will improve the SHD process, replacing it, taking what was good out of it, including the pre-application process, but then restoring our planning to local government.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for the amendment.  I cannot accept it here today but we will certainly look at elements of it to see whether they are workable.</p></speech>

It is valuable that Members of the Seanad should have the opportunity to express their views on issues concerning vulnerable children and young people in or leaving State care.</p><p>We all share an ambition for children in care to thrive.  This requires all forms of alternative care in Ireland to support and look after children and young people, and for these individuals to have continuous relationships with those involved in their care.  It means that children in care should be supported to express themselves and to be heard, and that a care placement should continue to support the continuity of key relationships in a child's life.  Overall it is important to remember that children are unique when they enter care and they are unique when they leave.</p><p>All children in care will have different and particular needs necessitating individualised care and care planning.  Therefore, I welcome this opportunity to engage with Senators on alternative care services and supports.  I also want to reflect on the considerable progress that Ireland has made in this important area over recent years, some of which I will now mention briefly.  First, the establishment of Tusla in 2014 represented the most comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken in Ireland.  Today, Tusla employs over 4,000 staff and budget 2022 will bring the agency's budget to almost &euro;800 million.  This significant investment underlines this Government's commitment to ensuring that Tusla has the resources to meet its mission of protecting and supporting our most vulnerable children, young people and families.  Undoubtedly, the agency has had challenges but I have real confidence in its senior leadership in implementing reforms across this agency.</p><p>Second, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, which was published and launched in 2014, represented the first overarching national policy framework for children and young people in Ireland.  This landmark document sets out a whole-of-government vision for Ireland to be one of the best small countries in the world in which to grow up, including for those children and young persons in the care of the State.  The Child Care Act 1991 is the statutory framework for child welfare and protection in Ireland.  The legislation places a statutory duty on Tusla to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  It sets the legislative provisions on taking children into care and the responsibilities of the State in that regard, which aim to improve outcomes for looked-after children.  The legislation is underpinned by regulations and national standards set out by HIQA to support the welfare of the child and the quality of his or her care.  New legislative provisions were commenced in 2017, which put on a statutory basis Tusla's responsibilities to provide assistance to eligible individuals over 18 years of age as part of an after-care service.</p><p>Finally, in respect of our international commitments, I am glad to say that Ireland has honoured its commitment, under the European Union relief projects, to receive 36 separated children from refugee camps in Greece.  This commitment was honoured with a backdrop of the pandemic and the considerable logistical and safety considerations that this entailed.  Intense planning preceded the operation in May and was only achievable through the dedicated work of Department officials, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla's social workers and their counterparts in Europe and Athens.  The final 28 young people were brought to Ireland in August and September of this year.  They are being cared for through a number of means, including the innovative F&aacute;ilte Care programme that Tusla created for the fostering of children who came to Ireland as unaccompanied minors.</p><p>While these are considerable milestones, my focus is to continue the positive progress that has been made in alternative care provision through the delivery of a significant reform agenda underpinned by a substantial and high-quality evidence base.  This includes ensuring that legislation relating to children in care is child centred and fit for purpose in a modern Ireland.  In 2017, my Department commenced a process to revise and update the Child Care Act 1991.  This complex work is currently ongoing following a consultation process that began in 2020 and enabled key stakeholders to inform and influence the development of this landmark legislation.  I look forward to bringing a comprehensive set of amendments to this legislation to this House next year.</p><p>The programme for Government contained a commitment to enact a family court Bill.  This would be a key element in the development of a more efficient an user-friendly family court system that puts families at the centre of its activities, provides access to specialist supports, and encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution in family law proceedings.</p><p>As Minister for children and young people, I am committed to the principle that young people should be supported to participate in key conversations or decisions that affect their lives.  The Constitution has explicitly protected this principle since the introduction of Article 42A in 2015.  Therefore, it is imperative that when a child enters a court setting his or her voice or wishes should be heard.  Last month, firm progress in this regard was made when the Cabinet approved the drafting of the new child care (amendment) [guardian <i>ad litem</i>] Bill 2021.  The revised general scheme of this Bill has been published and will come before pre-legislative scrutiny in the coming weeks.  The Bill aims to extend the guardian <i>ad litem</i>or GAL system to benefit the greatest number of children and young people, and to ensure that the best interests of children and young people in childcare proceedings are met.  This ambitious programme of work seeks to improve outcomes for some of the most vulnerable children in the State and their families.</p><p>To conclude my opening remarks here today, I want to update Senators on some of the key ongoing matters of relevance to alternative care.  As the Senators may be aware, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, is currently developing draft overarching national standards for the care and support of children using health and social care services.  I understand that some stakeholders, including foster carers, have expressed concerns regarding these draft standards during the public consultation process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->While I met the IFCA on this issue earlier in the year and have subsequently taken note of its concerns in respect of a number of areas in the draft report, I also recognise need to review the current 2003 foster care standards.  <br/><br/>I have also met a number of other stakeholders through the year regarding the aftercare services provided by Tusla.  Some of these organisations advocated for the changes to the upper threshold of eligibility for aftercare support.  Aftercare remains a relatively new service, being in place on a statutory basis only since 2017.  It is, therefore, prudent to first ensure that this service is fully delivered and is providing measurable and improved outcomes for those transitioning from State care before consideration to extending such services to a larger cohort of care leavers is undertaken.  I continue to examine equalisation between care leavers who are and are not continuing on in higher further education.  My Department is currently progressing an audit of aftercare provision in conjunction with Tusla and this will contribute towards an evidence base for any future decision on aftercare supports.<br/><br/>Finally, I am pleased to announce that tomorrow I will participate in the launch of the ripe for reform report.  This report presents key findings by the Child Care Law Reporting Project, CCLRP, following its analysis of childcare proceedings over the past three years, as commissioned by my Department.  I welcome this valuable report which is timely, considering our ongoing work to ensure that alternative care in Ireland works for the benefit of our most vulnerable children.  We all recognise that the CCLRP is a particularly unique and beneficial way of gathering real-time and long-lasting data on what is happening in child proceedings, in particular as they take place <i>in camera</i>and, therefore, without that, we would not be able to understand trends, patterns and degrees of consistency, or lack thereof, in terms of the approach to child law.<br/><br/>To conclude, I hope today's proceedings in the House will contribute to furthering the goal of a better understanding of the needs of children in care and children leaving care.  I look forward to hearing my Oireachtas colleagues' contributions on this issue.  As I notified Senators earlier, I have to attend a debate in the D&aacute;il this evening.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, will replace me and represent the Government on the conclusion of the debate.  I again thank the House for the opportunity to speak on this issue.  As Senators will be aware, I am happy to engage with all of them on this issue.  I again thank Senator Ruane for seeking this debate and championing this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1659" speakername="R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#MMM00200"><p>I do not envy the Minister his job.  He seems to be grasping a lot of nettles these days.  It is important that the he be brought before the House.  I thank Senator Ruane for discussing this because children are probably the most vulnerable in society and it is good to get an update from the Minister.</p> <p>I thank him for some work he did on extra funding for support for the victims of domestic violence and their children.  Of course, it is never enough and there are issues with accommodation, but the extra funding has definitely helped.  I know from people who work in the voluntary sector providing protection for women who, along with their children, unfortunately, have to deal with domestic violence, that it has been a big help.  It is also great that we have secured funding to help unaccompanied minors access full wraparound services, something that did not exist in the past.  I welcome those initiatives.</p> <p>The waiting time for young people in foster services is something the Minister and Green Party worked hard on to get it into the programme for Government.  It is great that we got it in there and to see it being implemented.  Rather than having children in care leapfrogging a general list, providing services on-site within Tusla will mean that children in urgent need can be catered for immediately.  A cross section of services can be provided to the same child and a more economical service can be provided by the State.  This all makes very good sense.  Could the Minister update the House on progress in this area?  I know it is being done in Dublin North Central and has proved to be very successful.  Given that it is proving to be successful, are there move towards rolling it out nationwide?  This is what we need everywhere in Ireland.  What is the next phase of that great plan?</p> <p>In terms of homelessness, there are issues around Tusla tracking young people.  Children who grew up in State care are vulnerable to becoming homeless as adults.  No one seems to know how common that is because Tusla does not track the figures.  Does the Minister hope to do some work on that?  Can Tusla track the levels of homelessness in young people who leave care?  We need facts if we want to try to solve problems.  It is not good that people who have grown up in care are not tracked in order to determine how they are coping once they have left.</p> <p>The Brothers of Charity often deal with houses for people with special needs, including some minors.  It was brought to my attention by the head of the Brothers of Charity that the organisation is not eligible for any retrofitting or warmer housing scheme grants.  For some reason, the HSE has not included such houses in any scheme.  We need to examine that issue because people who are cared for by the Brothers of Charity also need to be in warm homes.  The Minister might raise that issue with the HSE.  Those houses need to be retrofitted.  I have been to visit a few of them.  I thank him for his great work to date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#MMM00300"><p>I thank the Minister for coming to the House.  Last week, I spoke about some of the horrors in our State care system and the fact that there were 30 deaths last year, seven of which were through suicide.  It makes me very sad to see our young people dying in State care.</p> <p>This is an area with which I am familiar.  I would love to think that everything was all rosy in the garden, but I hate to tell Senators that it is far from it.  There are some excellent social care workers and foster care parents, but we need more.  We need probably twice the number that we have now.  Last year, and probably this year as well, due to Covid, the system was limited in trying to get people to become foster parents and trained in fostering.  Many parents who were on foster care teams were reluctant to take children into care because of Covid.  These children probably ended up with in residential care, possibly in the private sector.  That is a difficulty.  </p> <p>We need to find ways to encourage more parents, single people and those from any demographic to foster a child.  If someone has a home, a bed, is Garda vetted and can provide love and support for a child, that is all a child needs.  I deal with teenagers in particular.  They are probably the most difficult cohort to house because people run a mile from them.  I do not know why, because I find they are probably the most engaging children that people can get inside their door.  They come with challenges, but once they are put on the right path they can bring people great joy.</p> <p>One third of children in Dublin are placed outside their area.  It is a concern that children cannot get a foster care placement in their own areas and continue with their school and the things that feel normal, such as playing in local clubs and so on.  If we could get children placed in their own areas, that would help.</p> <p>I will read a testament from a young person whom I know.  She is 21 and is a full-time student in aftercare services.  She would like to first say that aftercare services have been crucial to her in transitioning to adulthood and she is forever grateful for the support, funding and care that aftercare has provided to her in the past three years.  She said she could not have achieved what she has today without their help.  However, there are in her opinion a number of deficits in the way that aftercare services currently operate.  She said it is important to note she is a full-time student.  It is for that reason that at 21 years of age she is still supported by services.  Remaining in full-time education is a requirement of such services, as Senators may be aware.  She understands the principle is to keep young people in education but, however, this is often to the detriment of those who choose not to pursue education.  Whatever the reason may be, they still need support.  It is also a big fear she has.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She has a degree in law and is currently studying to receive her masters degree.  She is worried about what will have to her when she finishes her masters?  It is a worry for many of her friends who are also in aftercare.  There are many opportunities she wants to pursue after this year but cannot as she does not meet the criteria of full-time education required by these services.  As a result, she is financially constrained.  She cannot pursue opportunities such as internships, volunteering abroad and more.  She understands this may not seem like a serious issue, but she believes this requirement stops young people reaching their full potential and, in the most serious cases, leaves young people homeless and without financial stability in a matter of weeks after turning 18.</p><p>Leading on to her second point, she believes that the cut-off age of 23 is too young and could be extended to meet circumstances in each individual case.  This requirement again means lost opportunity for many young people who are still in need of these vital supports after the age of 23.  She writes that she has struggled badly with her mental health at times but aftercare has provided vital support to her.  She refers to the fear this can be cut off in as little as a year and a half.  Many young people come into care and indeed aftercare with a lot of baggage.  Many have mental health conditions and physical conditions and need continued support.  This need does not go away just because they turn a certain age.  The age of support needs to be reviewed so that the assessment can be made on an individual case basis.</p><p>On the topic of the precarious state of many young people's mental health, another issue that should be flagged is the availability and quality of psychiatric and counselling services that aftercare is in a position to offer a young person.  Aftercare provided this young person with a set of ten sessions of counselling and she is forever grateful for this.  However, it took for her to reach a very dangerous place mentally before she was offered this service.  Now the only support she receives is from a university counsellor.  Many in aftercare cannot afford prices such as &euro;60 or &euro;70 an hour to speak to a counsellor when this is almost half the allowance they receive weekly to support themselves for food, transport and otherwise.  This is the average price of counselling from her own personal experience and may not be accurate in all cases.  She believes the mental health services within aftercare services need to be improved.  Mental health conditions are an unfortunate reality that many young people from care face every day.</p><p>Finally, she says so many times that she is so grateful for the aftercare service and how compassionate those involved have been to her over the years.  She states that many of the issues she has flagged are not something individual aftercare workers have control of or can fix themselves.  She thanks everybody again.</p><p>They are just the issues I would face with a lot of children who are in aftercare who come back to me.  I was in a meeting today with Children in Poverty with a number of colleagues.  They spoke about Tusla.  I asked if any of the parents ever contact the family support services that are available through Tusla.  They said no way, they would run a mile before they picked up the phone and talked to Tusla.  That has to be our go-to for families when they are in trouble.  It really should be.  If families are in trouble, it should be that they pick up the phone and there is somebody there.  That is the Tusla I want, the service I want for the children of this nation.  If children or families are in trouble and can see breakdowns happening, the family support service in Tusla should be there.  Parents are afraid even to touch the agency and are running a mile from it.  That is a red flag and I want the Minister to do something about it.</p><p>The foster care service for the 36 children who are coming in is the right thing to do.  I am always mindful of all those who are suffering in the world and the refugees who need our support.  Is that service long term or short term for those children who are coming into care?  If those kids are in short-term care, we do not want them to be moved around two or three years later.  I would hope they would be in long-term care.</p><p>I am probably taking too long.  On the issue of suitable residential placements, I was talking to Senator Ruane earlier about what they call Lefroy House.  If a child cannot get into emergency services, if I am minding a child through emergency services myself and I cannot take another child, he or she is then put on to Lefroy House.  It is a mix of young teenagers and adults.  Those young teenagers have to be out of there at nine o'clock in the morning.  We need to have suitable emergency places for children.  The Cathaoirleach is looking at me; I am over time.</p></speech>

The Minister would benefit and I know he knows a great amount in this area.  It is important people like the Senator, who have great knowledge, are able to bring those stories to the Minister and say what is working and what is not working.  I call the next speaker, Senator McGreehan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#NNN00300"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  It is a very important issue and Senator Keogan really highlights it.  I always enjoy listening to her on this issue because she teaches us all an awful lot.  I was struck by her commentary last week on the Order of Business in respect of the lives we are losing under State care.  The Minister has a great responsibility.  It is almost relentless.  There are constant issues and for me they almost seem greater than any of us because there are so many barriers and pitfalls to creating a State full of adults and children as we want them to be.  It is all our responsibility to look after the children in the State like they were all our own flesh and blood.  We all have to fight for them.  Senator Keogan is relentless on that.  She is constantly speaking about children in care.  These are our future adults, leaders, business people, and parents.  It is so important we give them every single opportunity to be their best selves.</p> <p>We see time and again, unfortunately, that the State fails very vulnerable children.  The most high-profile recent case was the Grace case.  The system itself was guilty of serious criminal negligence, in my opinion.  Nothing was done, repeatedly.  The poor wee child, whom we call Grace, was systematically abused in foster care.  It is absolutely disgusting that we allowed this to happen.  We are not personally responsible but we are, because this is our country and these are people we pay to look after little children like Grace.  We fail them.  The system itself is necessary for so many reasons but it is so important we put in every single procedure and step along the way.  The Minister rightly said in his speech that the child's voice is the most important.  We all know there is excellent work going on with our foster families.  I know many foster families and they are incredible.  As Senator Keogan said, we just do not have enough of them.  We just do not have enough places.</p> <p>I had to read the Minister's speech a few times as there is an awful lot of information in it.  There is a lot of work going on in the Department.  We have very important targets in our programme for Government, including the commitment to aftercare and transition.  We all know aftercare and transition follow on not only for children in care but also for our disability services.  That transition is very important to highlight.  One thing as sure as God is that we are all going to get older.  All children are going to hit 18, we would hope, and are going to want to reach those milestones.  I see the Department is putting an awful lot of work into aftercare.  There is no limit to the resources that should be put in.  Senator Keogan mentioned that girl who is so grateful for everything.  She should not have to be so grateful because it is our responsibility to look after her.  She has proved herself and has worked so hard, yet she is afraid to leave because she does not have the support.  I am nearly 40 years of age and I cannot manage without the support of my family.  As a country we need to treat ourselves as the family support unit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What came up, and comes up time and time again, was resources, staff, foster care homes, suitable emergency care and the need to transition away from private providers.  That was necessary throughout Covid-19 when a great deal of resources were put into private care.  It was important and necessary then.  We need to get to a point where we do not have to use this.  The inflexibility of the system also came up, and the need to look at the individual's care needs and see what is best, as what is best for Erin might not be best for Mary.  We need to look at the person.  We had an excellent engagement with the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth when that exact same point came up around the lack of individualisation, the lack of looking at the person and the family unit as a whole and considering how best to support that child and support the mother or father to make sure they are not falling into child poverty or fuel poverty.  It is an endless circle where a person steps up and gets a job, and then starts to lose his or her benefits or support package.  There is an endless amount of "do this, but you will be punished over here".  We need to starting looking at the person and stop this siloing of benefits or supports to the family.  Regardless of the structure of the family, be it a foster family, a single-parent family or a grandparent looking after a child, there is a family to be supported with whatever it needs.  </p><p>I welcome the Minister's comment that we can make this country one of the best small countries in which to grow up.  We have to make sure we do not fail any more children.  We must support them.  We should look at their little faces and say each of them will be a bloody great adult when he or she grows up, because he or she is worth it.  Another thing that came up at the committee, exactly as Senator Keogan said, is that people do not trust Tusla.  The families that potentially are in need and could do with extra supports or a bit of advice do not go to Tusla.  They feel Tusla is an agency that will take away the child or make the parents look bad.  We need to transform that.  We need to change that attitude.  We need to make that Tusla is there for the person and not for the system.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for coming here today to take these statements.  I thank Senator Ruane for raising this matter and giving us this opportunity.  There is no doubt that there are exceptional foster families, individuals, couples and family situations that are fantastic.  There are many people who would probably like to be foster carers.  Because I am involved in IVF, surrogacy, fertility and other such groups, fostering comes up in discussions of alternative pathways.  One of the repeated statements I hear - I am probably guilty of holding this myself - is from people who believe they could never be a foster parent because the idea of the child not being theirs would be scary.  This suggests to me that we probably need an information campaign.  It is a repeatedly statement.  I am not alone in that.  It is difficult for people to imagine loving a child, only to see him or her going back to his or her family.  Obviously, a particular mindset is needed, and a particular form of care and love happens, to be able to do that.  We need education programmes to assist people in all the emotional requirements as well as the practical requirements when it comes to fostering.  That would be a big discussion.</p> <p>There is no doubt there are exceptional social workers.  A recent report from Empowering People in Care, EPIC, contained quotes on how amazing social workers were, and the voices of children on how incredible they were.  However, there is a massive turnover in social workers and a lack of consistency and stability when it comes to relationships.  A child who is already vulnerable has an advocate from Tusla and his or her social worker.  When the relationship works, it works really well.  If that advocate changes on a regular basis, it reiterates that undermining of trust and relationships.  I worry about the long-term effects on attachment and stability of relationships in adulthood.  If there is no modelling of consistency, what will flow from that?  Questions such as career pathways come up when we look at the causes of the high rate of turnover.  Are some of the social workers inexperienced?  Should we be doing a greater in-house apprenticeship-type model?  Should we look at how many places there are?  Are there sufficient places?  Where are social workers being poached to or moving to?  Is social work with children a transitional route to better or more secure roles?  We need a review of why people leave and why there is a big turnover in staff.  Is it just that they are overworked, or that there are not enough of them?  If so, do we need to work with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to ensure we have enough places in schools?  Perhaps it goes back to creating an intentional interest at post-primary level to ensure this is a career of choice for those who have an interest and an aptitude.  There is no doubt that we need more social workers.</p> <p>I would like to speak about the process of a child becoming the subject of a care order and going into care.  Family law is not something I ever aspired to work in.  Those who have the patience for it are incredible people.  At an early stage, I found myself wanting to shout at a parent who was really appalling and was allegedly my client.  I decided then that I should never do family law.  I was too opinionated in regard to my clients.  Those who practise family law work in an extraordinarily adversarial environment where people come in to give opinions about a vulnerable mother - in the main - and how she is managing as a parent.  One instance cited to me was a case in which a decision was to be made on whether a child should be taken into care and be made the subject of a care order.  The evidence that was brought before the court was that the mother in the case required too much support.  Fortunately, the solicitor cross-examining had the wit to ask how much support she was provided with.  How much is too much?  The answer was one hour a week, which seems shockingly low.  It seems to me that anyone who considers that to be a lot, and believes that the mother in this case was particularly needy, is working in a sphere very different from the rest of us and how the rest of us would think.</p> <p>When I canvassed for a couple of comments in advance of this evening's debate, one solicitor said to me that there needs to be additional support and that these mothers would not be in the position they are in if they had adequate support.  I think that is a little bit too much, because some of them probably have adequate support.  I think we would all be of the view that the best place for a child is with his or her mother.  At the same time, sometimes mothers need breaks.  It is not always about support, but clearly there is a trend of a lack of support or of inadequate support.  The solicitor to whom I spoke suggested that if the money spent on placements and assessments was spent on supporting families, everybody would be much better off.  Maybe a balance can be struck by making sure more than one hour a week is provided.  In some of the examples, the criteria used when deciding whether parenting is good enough seem to be quite harsh.  There are judgments around floors being sticky.  If they walked into our house at certain times, God bless us, I am not sure I would pass judgment.  It comes back to consistency and stability.  This is the mantra of the Child and Family Agency, which is always concerned with mothers failing to provide consistency and stability.  When we, as a State, adjudicate that it is not in the best interests of children to leave them with their parents and instead put them into a system where they move between different foster families and different social workers, we are failing to provide consistency and stability.  </p></speech>

Strangers are caring for a child and can terminate that placement within 28 days.</p> <p>When we review, and clearly we are in a review phase, we must also review what happened before, what leads to that point where a child comes into care.  Twenty-three years ago a group of us who were new people working in the City of Dublin YMCA came together and had the idea of building supported social housing, a foyer type project where accommodation was provided together with all the support services required for young people coming out of care because they were at a high risk of homelessness.  I find it hard to believe that, 23 years on, nothing has changed very much.  Anytime one is out with the homeless or speaks to people in this area, there is a definite pattern of people having grown up in care.  On 9 November, Ms Kelly Anne Byrne, an ambassador for Focus Ireland, spoke at the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  She was fantastic and spoke of having stability in her home with the help of Focus Ireland but she spoke of having come through care and of not having had that sense of stability or security.  There is certainly a lifelong correlation there and we need to focus on that.  It strikes me that we need a cross-departmental group working on this or perhaps we should reignite the idea of foyer projects and ensure we have all those support services for people coming out of care beyond those who are just in full-time education.  I thank the Acting Chairperson for indulging me.</p></speech>

I thank the Leader of the House for scheduling this debate.  As was mentioned, Senator Ruane requested this debate on the Order of Business.</p> <p>I want to focus my comments in my short contribution on aftercare services.  I do not need to tell anyone in the House that it is a support provided to young people who have been in care for a period of time before their 18th birthday and it is governed by the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2015.  According to a discussion document published in June of this year by Empowering People in Care, EPIC, 2,943 young people were in receipt of aftercare services in quarter 4 of 2020.  For many of those young people, aftercare supports are falling below what is required.  That has been the case for those who have come through aftercare services, and unless the State makes a range of reforms and changes to have a more holistic and person-centred approach, this will continue to be the case for young people who have yet to come through aftercare services.  Whether it is the Department, the Houses of the Oireachtas, Tusla or organisations like EPIC, we should be looking to other jurisdictions and learning from them about how we can improve situations for young people.</p> <p>Here at home we also need better data, which was mentioned by Senator Garvey.  We should know how young people in care are doing when compared with their peers who are not in care or in aftercare services, for example, how young people in care are performing in education.  EPIC has called for better data gathering of children in care, aftercare and beyond.  We need that data and longitudinal studies.</p> <p>I do not need to remind anyone in the House that the State has an incredibly important role in supporting children in care.  We must ensure young people are equipped to prepare to leave care and the structures are in place for them to live life independently.  Housing is a major issue for young people leaving care.  The National Youth Council of Ireland has noted in its pre-budget submissions time and again that there are many reasons young people can experience homelessness.  Issues such as reduced social welfare support, young people being a lower priority on housing waiting lists, unsuitable emergency accommodation and, in this case, inadequate support services, especially for those leaving care, are major contributory factors.  Many young people have difficulty accessing affordable and quality housing in the private rental market or in the social housing sector.</p> <p>I want to cite some of the recommendations for aftercare provision in the EPIC report and I invite the Minister to respond to them.  The report recommends aftercare services should be placed on a statutory footing as a right for every child leaving State care.  The provision of an aftercare plan and, importantly, the implementation of such plans should be enshrined in legislation.  Aftercare supports on a needs assessed basis should be provided up to the age of 26 years.  There should be consistency in the detail of aftercare provision regardless of geography or where somebody lives.</p> <p>Those are some of the issues I would like the Minister to respond to in his concluding remarks.  I apologise for being late in arriving but I read the Minister's opening statement which was provided by his officials.  I thank Senator Ruane for requesting this debate.</p></speech>

I will preface my contribution by saying that although we need to focus on aftercare provision and foster care, we must not lose sight of the reasons people end up in care in the first place and we should always focus on prevention as well as the aftermath of children who have been in care.  Senator Seery Kearney hit the nail on the head in what she said.  If we are going to judge and make assessments of how people parent or what they can or cannot give their children, we want to be 100% sure that when the State steps in to be that other parent, we will increase that child&rsquo;s ability to flourish and have a positive outcome and not decrease his or her capacity.</p></speech>

I have been involved in many cases of advocacy as a community worker, including working with women who had addiction issues, where we sat down and looked at care plans.  Tusla&rsquo;s intervention at the time would have been very heavily focused on a parenting course.  In those situations it was not that the mother needed a parenting course.  It was very much that she was living beyond her means due to the conditions she had, her environment and having perhaps experienced trauma throughout her life.  There were all these other conditions that were a factor.  Obviously, there are cases of neglect or abuse where care intervention will be needed, but there are many cases where judgments are made often on foot of an unconscious bias by social workers who have good intentions but who do not have the lived experience of being in a community or a certain cultural environment that they do not understand.  They make harsh decisions based on an experience they had growing up that they are now not experiencing but which might be quite normal to the rest of us living in those communities in terms of who we are, how we speak or how loudly we do or do not shout.  We should always  ensure prevention in those cases is very much to the fore of these conversations as well.</p> <p>I wish to deal specifically with the policy issue.  Coming into care presents many challenges for children, young people and their families.  The lived reality for these families is something many of us cannot understand because it is so foreign from the lived experiences we know ourselves.  We need to acknowledge this while also working hard to ensure there is greater parity between the lived experiences of all children in Ireland.  While early intervention and family support are critical in this way, sadly, there will always be circumstances where children will need to be cared for out of home.  Therefore, we have a collective responsibility to ensure the State provides the best alternative care possible to these children.</p> <p>The first area is the importance of data collection, which was mentioned, and analysis in respect of children in care and young adults in aftercare services.  We simply do not have access to enough data regarding the unique experiences and outcomes of individuals who are care-experienced.  How can we improve services, policy and legislation if we do not know the full extent of the problems we are trying to solve?  In 2009, the Ryan report called for a longitudinal study to be undertaken on the experiences of young people in care and aftercare.  While data collection has improved in the meantime, we have been waiting too long for action on this recommendation.  I know the Minister is awaiting a report from a working group established to investigate the best way to collect, follow and analyse those data.  I look forward to real progress being made in this area in the new year.</p> <p>The second issue I wish to address is the provision of therapeutic support for children in care.  The reality is that most young people who come into care are likely to require therapeutic intervention, but young people often do not receive the interventions they require in a timely manner and at other times they do not receive them at all.  Social workers, foster carers and parents regularly have to battle to ensure their child can get access to therapeutic support.  That needs to change.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The social work sector should have access to these supports in-house and every young person in the care of the social work area should have the opportunity to avail of them.  Having in-house teams of specialists would ensure continuity of care for children while also allowing social work teams to garner therapeutic insights to inform their work with individual children and families.  A model exists for this in the Dublin north-central social work area where there is an in-house therapeutic hub.  This model should be replicated around the country as a priority.  However, if it is the case that we cannot provide these services in-house in the short to medium term, we should ensure that children in care have designated pathways to access specialist services in their respective local health areas.</p><p>The third issue I wish to bring to the Minister's attention is the need for independent advocacy for parents who are engaged with Tusla.  This is very close to my heart.  I proposed an amendment to the adoption legislation in 2016 in respect of the lack of a dedicated social worker for a parent who has seen his or her child go into care.  That amendment also required Tusla to have to signpost parents in the direction of supports, especially if later in life Tusla is going to seek a High Court judgment to remove the parental right of a parent without consent.  I know that social workers try their best to step into this role, but the dynamic between parents and social workers does not really allow for it.  The system that parents must interact with is very complex, the language they need to decipher is often inaccessible and the relationships they must maintain are atypical and often fraught with tension.  Parents need and deserve access to their own support that can help them to navigate these complexities.  We also must take account of the individual circumstances that contributed to each family coming to the attention of Tusla.  Supporting parents in this way can assist them in making the positive changes required to resume care of their children.  It can also help them to maintain healthy relationships with their children.  We must ensure that in supporting children we do not lose sight of the importance of supporting their families.</p><p>The last issue I wish to address is aftercare, which could be a topic of discussion in its own right.  We all can agree that early adulthood poses many challenges, but consider trying to navigate this critical life stage while unpacking the baggage that comes with being care-experienced.  Aftercare workers provide critical support to young people as they navigate this transitional life stage but, unfortunately, not all care leavers have an individual allocated worker.  While drop-in services are provided for those without an allocated aftercare worker, this cannot replicate the benefits offered by the continuity of a relationship with a supportive adult.  Moreover, the quality of services being provided around the country is inconsistent due to the varying capacities of aftercare teams in different regions.  Advocacy groups for children in care and care leavers, such as Empowering People in Care, EPIC, have called for the age of eligibility for aftercare to increase to 26 years.  In the event that this is not achievable in the short or medium term, I call on the Department at least to consider expanding the age of eligibility to 23 years, irrespective of whether a young person is enrolled in education.  At present, we have a system where young people who are not enrolled in education lose access to their aftercare support at the age of 23 when, in many cases, it is these young people who require the most support.</p><p>As with all forms of housing at present, there is a significant undersupply in aftercare accommodation.  The issue is so pronounced that many care leavers have no choice but to engage with homelessness services to identify suitable accommodation.  While the capital assistance scheme has been a welcome development in recent years, the demand for accommodation in this scheme far exceeds the supply.  A strategy must be developed to address this issue, specifically to ensure that no care leaver finds himself or herself without a stable and secure home.</p><p>Before concluding I wish to express my solidarity with all care-experienced individuals, their families and foster families, and to acknowledge the work of all those dedicated to ensuring that children and young people with experience in care achieve their full potential and lead happy and healthy lives.  Finally, I acknowledge the work of the Department and the work the Minister is already undertaking to address the issues and concerns I have raised.  I know that making improvements for children in care and care leavers is a priority for the Minister and I look forward to working with him to achieve progress in this area.</p></speech>

After listening to the Minister's earlier statement, I wish to highlight two matters.  I am glad he put an emphasis on the uniqueness of every child.  Every child going into the care system is unique, and is unique when he or she leaves.  That must be celebrated and supported.  The Minister also acknowledged that children in care have different and varying needs, necessitating individualised care.  That is massively important in terms of care planning.</p> <p>There were almost 6,000 children in care at the end of 2020, and I assume it is around the same number now.  When talking about children in care it is important to acknowledge and recognise the extra vulnerability they have in their lives and to ensure they are protected and have an equal and fair chance in life.  Some 91% of these children were in foster care and the rest were in residential care or special care placements.  Indeed, I had a young man who is in a special care placement doing work experience with me for a week about two weeks ago.  He is living in Newbridge but going to school in Portumna, travelling up and down every day.  I will not refer to the part of the country but it was an experience to spend a little time with him.</p> <p>What I know about children in care and care leavers is what I learned from somebody I introduced to the Minister of State a number of years ago, Shane Griffin.  I met him in 2014 when I knocked on his door when canvassing in the local elections.  We started a conversation that we continued until his death on New Year's Eve in 2019.  When I knocked on his door that day he spoke to me about having been a child in care and having been in 19 different care placements.  He was very conscious that there was no problem with the homes in which he was placed, but he really needed to be with his mother.  He was taken from his mother when he was seven years old.  We know that every child who goes into care suffers trauma from their earlier years.  There was trauma in his home and he was taken away, as were his siblings, but he needed to be with his mum.  He always felt that if his mum had been given the supports she needed, he could have stayed with her.  Having said that, he also acknowledged that his siblings thrived in foster care homes.  For him, however, he felt that it was very important to talk about that.</p> <p>He became a passionate critic of a childcare system whose social workers were overburdened, placements were frequently breaking down and which lacked aftercare.  He felt the children and their needs and wishes were often ignored, and that traumatised children were further traumatised.  He became a strong advocate for children in care and for those leaving care.  As we know, in the current system young people leave foster parents at 18 years of age.  That is such a young age.  I know many foster parents who would love to be able to give that extra care and support afterwards.</p> <p>I got to know Wayne Dignam of the Care Leavers' Network through Shane.  I organised a briefing one day in the audiovisual room, which was attended by the Minister of State.  That was when we could have briefings.  I am thinking of Wayne today, of Shane's daughter, Hayley Ann, and all the wonderful people I have met who continue to be great advocates, as is the Chair.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Ruane, for ensuring we held this debate.  There is so much more we need to do and say, but I was strongly touched by Shane's story and I wanted to bring it to the House.</p></speech>

I listened to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  I believe that the whole-of-government response is very important.  While the children brief is a senior Ministry the issue of children transcend all Departments.  The thinking needs to be that each Department takes its responsibilities for children in its area seriously.<br/><br/>I commend my colleague Senator Mary Seery Kearney on the phenomenal work she had done over the past 12 to 18 months in this area.  Her own story published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>over the weekend was just brilliant.  We are very lucky to have strong women such as the Minister of State, Senator Seery Kearney and others across the political divide.  These are people who are committed to ensuring that the place of the child is enshrined not just as it is now in our Constitution, but to also ensure that it percolates down through every Department.<br/><br/>We had the referendum where the people decided to enshrine in our Constitution the importance of the child, which was an important expression.  The people voted at that time and made a clear statement that they were enshrining the rights of the child in our Constitution.  They expected their leaders to do what they have to do to ensure every child in the State is protected, supported, nourished and given every opportunity by the State to ensure that they can perform on a level playing pitch and that no child is in any way inferior, and every child is equal and has the opportunity to reach his or her potential.  This is critical.<br/><br/>When we consider the Minister of State's predecessors, the first Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the State was Frances Fitzgerald when she was appointed by former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny ten years ago.  It was not easy at that time because a Cabinet Minister for children was something new in this country.  The work Frances Fitzgerald did in the early days of her Ministry paved the way for significant change.  It would be remiss of us tonight not to recognise the work that she did<br/><br/>The establishment of Tusla was critical.  The issue of children needed its own Department, somewhat distinct from the Department of Health.  While there are many good people in the Department of Health who do great work, it needed its own agency.  For all its faults - and there are many - Tusla certainly is the right model for developing policies to create the type of equal society we all want to see.<br/><br/>However, there are many vulnerable children and many who do not have the opportunities they deserve and should have.  It is a blight on all of our houses in the Oireachtas that children are still vulnerable and in dangerous and difficult situations and that children do not have the types of opportunity they deserve and that our society wants for them.  We hear horror stories, particularly when dealing with children with disabilities who may be non-verbal.  It is a challenging environment, and while 99.9% of the people who care for those children do so in a loving way and ensure they are protected and minded, but, unfortunately, there is another small percentage who do not.  As a society, we need the ambition whereby 100% of our children are safe, and that we as a society know that 100% of our children are safe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.304" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1674" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#RRR00200"><p>It is nice to see Senator Boyhan as the Acting Chairman for this debate.  As many speakers have done, I pay tribute to a number of people in this House who have been very vocal and have worked very hard on the issue of protecting our children properly.  I include our Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, who is very strong in her role with regard to children, and the Minister, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman.</p> <p>As other speakers said, we must ensure all children who are in care are properly looked after.  As stated earlier, 94% of children in general foster care had an allocated social worker, and 91% of children who went to foster care were also looked after.  The figures are pretty high but that is not to deny that children can fall through the system.  Many of them have challenges, no matter how well they are being looked after.  Very few people want to talk about the fact that 49 children and young people died while in care or aftercare between 2010 and 2020.  Seventeen of those deaths were the result of natural causes, but the sadness for me is that the other 32 include 15 young people who died from suicide while in care or aftercare.  These situations can be very challenging.</p> <p>Of the service areas inspected, six areas - Sligo-Leitrim-West Cavan, Cavan-Monaghan, Donegal, Mayo, Cork, and Galway-Roscommon - had ensured that each child in foster care had an allocated social worker, which is very important.  Other counties are a little behind, and I will not go through them now, but it is important that where we are lagging behind in other counties, we ensure that those children have a social worker.  The Childcare (Amendment Act) 2015 placed aftercare services on a strengthened legislative basis, which was important.</p> <p>It is important that we are having this debate.  I believe that everyone is very sincere in what they do, but there is always a challenge for those kids, particularly at Christmas time, which is not far away.  From engaging with some of those children, I am aware that they find Christmas very tough.  I will remember them in a special way and I wish them all well as we approach Christmas.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge Shane Griffin, and I thank Senator Fiona O'Loughlin for mentioning Shane.  It was Shane who informed me the first day ever about what it was like to be a child in care.  He helped me in my previous role as spokesperson on the children's committee.  I would not have come with all of the knowledge and, therefore, I had to reach out to have a better understanding.  I thank many people who informed me but Shane in particular played a huge role.  I thank Senator O'Loughlin for that.</p> <p>Senator Conway used the word "percolates", which is a great word.  The Senator is correct that the voice of the child should percolate through all Departments, regardless of their area of responsibility.</p> <p>I thank Senators for their contributions and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, for his opening statement.  I also acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which always keeps the voices and rights of children front and centre through many different mediums, which is greatly appreciated.  A number of years ago I attended an Empowering People in Care, EPIC, function In Dublin Castle.  I always remember a performance piece at the end were a girl came in and performed a rap.  I cannot remember the name of the lady but she performed a piece around the number 6,144, which was the number of children in care that year.  It was quite an emotional piece to sit through because in her mind, she was a number.  She was one of the number of children who were held in the care of the State.  On that day, that is what outlined for me my role and responsibility as spokesperson for children.  As a collective we are all responsible for children in care and it is our role and responsibility to advocate for the rights of those children in care because we are their voice, throughout our roles, be it in the Seanad, the D&aacute;il or on a committee.  At all times we need to hold everybody to account to ensure that what is in Constitution is protected, and that their voices are protected and heard, and action is taken at all times.  I believe every Senator and Deputy works collectively to ensure that voice and that piece is protected.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Anne Rabbitte:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2436"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2436&amp;amp;pid=AnneRabbitte&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I listened carefully to what was said and am pleased to note the high level of cross-party interest in this important matter.  I will respond to a few of the Senators on the some of the key issues.  On the issue of aftercare services within Tusla, I recognise that a consistent and comprehensive aftercare service will support successful outcomes for young people leaving care who are beginning to embark on independent life from the age of 18.  As such, it is essential the aftercare service reach as many eligible young persons as possible.  The current statutory framework has been in place since 2017 and a review of its operation is timely.  The Department and Tusla are engaging on a gap analysis of the aftercare service, which will give the Government information and evidence relating to the reach of the service and identify any areas of improvement.</p><p>I echo the remarks made earlier by the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, when he noted the statutory framework for the aftercare service is relatively new.  It is essential a review of the current service be undertaken prior to any consideration of changes to the core eligibility threshold.  The priority must be that the most vulnerable will have access to the services they need.  The Childcare (Amendment) Act 2015 places a statutory obligation on Tusla to assess the needs of young people who are eligible for aftercare.  In some instances, young people leaving care may wish to engage in full-time education and training.  Research in this area has shown doing so can improve outcomes in later life.  Tusla seeks, therefore, to reduce any financial barriers these young people may face in embarking on further education or training by assisting with maintenance payments, with supports for education continuing up to the age of 23.</p><p>As the Minister noted, however, care leavers are just as diverse in their requirements as they were when entering State care.  It is not the case that all young persons will want to enter full-time education or training once they have left State care or that they will feel ready to do so at the age of 18.  This is why Tusla allows for a degree of flexibility with regard to the aftercare allowance, which may be paid to eligible care leavers who embark on qualifying education and training at any time before the age of 21.  Like me, Senator Warfield was a member of the previous children's committee and one of main issues that came across at that committee related to the choice young people face at the age of 18.  Not all of them might want to go on to education but those who do need a second chance.  It took my son two terms to decide what course he wanted.  We should not say people have only one chance in the education system.  We should allow everybody the right to fail or make a mistake and have a second chance, and that applies to children in aftercare too.  I believe passionately that when we are examining the review, that should be taken into consideration.  When I talk to foster parents, that is often their fear.  They fear that if the child they care for did not participate in education and wants to change their mind, he or she will not have that option.  That is something we should be very mindful of.</p><p>The aftercare service also supports young adults who are not in education and training in accessing any relevant financial allowances and supports to which they may be entitled.  Access to an aftercare worker is available to those individuals up to 21 years of age as required and there is no age limit on access to Tusla's aftercare drop-in centre.  If the young adult is not progressing to education and there is not the safety net of extending his or her experience with the foster family, it is incumbent on Tusla to ensure there will be access to housing and to wrap-around support.  In some cases young people feel they left home with all their belongings in two black bags, as has been noted at children's committee meetings.  The wrap-around service must, therefore, also mean protection to ensure that when a young person leaves one place of accommodation, the right of access to another place will be looked after and secured.  It is mind-boggling enough for an adult to have to have it all worked out, with all the supports of a family environment, when transitioning into seeking accommodation.  Imagine what it is like and how tormenting it must be for a young person who has been supported by the hands of the State to have to access accommodation with little or no family support.  It must be very challenging and I remind Tusla that this very significant piece has not worked well in the past.</p><p>Aftercare drop-in centres provide essential day-to-day supports to young people leaving care, such as assistance in completing the relevant grant applications and advice on housing entitlements.  Care leavers who are not in education or employment may also be eligible for full jobseeker's allowance instead of the reduced rate of &euro;112 per week ordinarily paid to those under the age of 25.  Securing accommodation can be a concern for young people as they leave care and transition into independent living.  The vast majority leave care at 18 with stable accommodation in place and remain there, living with their former foster carers.  A small cohort, however, of vulnerable care leavers may face an increased risk of homelessness.  Currently, those care leavers who are at risk of homelessness are assisted by Tusla in partnership with various Departments and other State agencies.  This includes finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or facilitated independent living.  Since 2017, care leavers have been included as a separate category for funding under the capital assistance scheme.  It must have been two years ago that on "The Late Late Show", there was a young man who was trying to complete his leaving certificate but his placement had fallen through, and he had to try to access accommodation at the same time as his studies.  He was successful in finding accommodation but it was testing in his leaving certificate year.  Even so, he achieved a very successful leaving certificate.</p><p>Finally, I acknowledge the work of social workers during Covid in supporting young people in care and in providing an agile approach to ensuring everyone got that support during the pandemic.  Our social workers play a phenomenal role and, in many cases, are very challenged and restricted because their caseloads are so high.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has six minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#VVV00300"><p>On behalf of the Minister for Health, I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on this important matter.  At the outset, I acknowledge that waiting times for many hospital procedures and appointments are unacceptably long.  I am acutely aware of the great distress that this causes patients and their families.  I remain committed to working to reduce waiting times for patients and bring them in line with Sl&aacute;intecare targets.  It is of particular regret that children can experience long waiting times, especially for time-sensitive procedures such as scoliosis treatments.  I remain acutely aware of the impact that this has on children and their families.  The priority of the Minister for Health, and that of the Government, is to improve waiting times for all patients accessing hospital treatment.  Reducing paediatric waiting lists for orthopaedic procedures remains a priority within that.</p> <p>Through investment in 2019, Children's Health Ireland achieved the delivery of the target of 382 spinal treatments.  Activity levels were significantly impacted in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Despite these challenges Children's Health Ireland delivered 322 spinal treatments, of which 163 were spinal fusions.  Overall scoliosis activity figures for 2020 were 16% lower than the previous year despite significant social distancing measures, and infection, prevention and control requirements.  By the end of October 2021, 295 spinal surgeries had been carried out, which is a significant increase on the same period last year when 255 spinal surgeries had been carried out.  This activity level was achieved despite the ongoing challenges of Covid-19, and the very serious and significant impact that the cyberattack had on the services of Children's Health Ireland in May.</p> <p>The Department of Health, the HSE and Children's Health Ireland have worked to deliver improved paediatric orthopaedic services and enhanced access to scoliosis services.  In 2018, Children's Health Ireland, previously the Children's Hospital Group, was provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists, including the provision of scoliosis services.  This funding is recurring and has been provided in the base HSE allocation each year since 2018 to fund orthopaedic services.  The additional funding supported the recruitment of approximately 60 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, in 2018 and 2019 to enable the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services.  The posts relate to the multidisciplinary team at diagnosis, pre-assessment, during surgery in theatre and post-operatively.  The posts include a number of grades and specialties, including consultants, registrars, radiographers, clinical nurse managers, staff nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and associated administrative posts.  The most recent appointment was an orthopaedic consultant with a special interest in neuromuscular conditions who started in the Temple Street in September.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Only the post of consultant neurophysiologist remains vacant.  A recruitment campaign commenced in October 2021 and, in the interim, there is a contract with a specialist service provider.</p><p>The orthopaedic implementation group was established in 2018, as was the scoliosis co-design group.  Representatives of Children's Health Ireland, the orthopaedic spinal team and advocacy groups continue to meet as part of the co-design framework on a quarterly basis.  The central aim of the group is to assist in the design of a contemporary values-based and patient-centred approach to service delivery in scoliosis services.  Children's Health Ireland has advised the Department of Health that work with the advocacy groups is under way to strengthen disengagement and to develop more positive communication with the advocacy groups, including the Scoliosis Advocacy Network and patients' families.  Scoliosis activity is just one element of the wider orthopaedic services provided by Children's Health Ireland, accounting for approximately 70% of orthopaedic activity and children with a range of needs rely on the orthopaedic services of Children's Health Ireland, for example, children with spina bifida, hip deformity and other orthopaedic needs.  The complex needs of these children remain at the forefront of service provision.</p><p>Of the children who receive a diagnosis of scoliosis, not all are referred for surgery, with other treatment options in the form of orthotics or spinal bracing also used, as appropriate.  All patients referred to the inpatient waiting list for surgery require a preoperative work-up prior to spinal surgery, including multi-diagnostic investigations and review by a multidisciplinary team.  The plan of care which is implemented for  each patient is tailored to best meet the patient's clinical requirements and the complexity of a child's total medical conditions dictate the level of planning and preoperative work and time needed.</p><p>Children's Health Ireland has developed a new fast-track pathway as part of the outpatient reduction plans and paediatric active clinical triage has been introduced for those waiting for the longest time, 12 months or more, on the paediatric outpatient list.  This has reduced the number of long waiters from 987 to 403 since the start of October 2020.  </p><p>All of these examples highlight the focused work being carried out to improve orthopaedic services for children and the Government remains committed to improving access to these services, particularly for the children awaiting time-sensitive procedures.  I thank the Seanad for this opportunity to update the House on this service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1643" speakername="Lorraine Clifford-Lee" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#WWW00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for outlining those facts and figures.  As he said on several occasions, this is time-sensitive surgery.  Any delay is crucial to the well-being of these children and the outcomes of the surgery.  Everybody here has heard from families in our communities and around the country who are, unfortunately, waiting unacceptable lengths of time for the proper surgery.  On top of dealing with the condition and the challenges the condition presents for very young members of our society and their families, they are dealing with the stress and anxiety of not knowing when they are going to get the appropriate treatment.  Parents can see their children deteriorating before their eyes every day.</p> <p>While there has been an improvement, it is still the position that children and their families must take to the national airwaves to get the treatment to which they are entitled.  That is not acceptable.  It is traumatic, undignified and unnecessary.  Families should not have to go and talk about this very difficult and private health situation on the national airwaves to get a bit of action.  I do not think there is any lack of commitment on behalf of the Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, or the medical professionals.  I and my colleagues have raised this matter within our own parliamentary groups and in this Chamber.  We are constantly told that the delays are not the result of a lack of money and the money is there.  It is obviously a lack of joined-up thinking between the specialists, the Department and the primary carers.</p> <p>I would like to make a suggestion that might improve the situation.  There should be an official within the Department of Health with whom families can link in.  That person should then liaise with all the others involved.  These families are dealing with enough.  It is a busy enough time when someone has young children but if a child has additional and complex health needs, it is a very busy and difficult time.  Those parents do not have time to go chasing up and trying to co-ordinate different medical professions.  They should not have to do that.  It is unacceptable that this extra stress and strain is placed on families who are going through challenging times with their children.  It is undignified that small children must deal with the stress and worry, and take to the national airwaves to get a bit of action.  I do not want to see any more families forced into that situation.</p> <p>I acknowledge a commitment has been made and I trust the Minister of State when he says waiting times have improved.  He also reference he made to different co-ordinations.  I understand we are dealing with a pandemic and the aftermath of a cyberattack.  All of that is immaterial if one has a child with a serious and deteriorating medical condition.  If we cannot pull out the stops, as a developed and wealthy state with modern health facilities, I do not know what we can do.  I hope we will not discuss these figures and beg for action again in the future.  Some of the affected families are listening to this debate and I am sure they do not want to sit there and bang their heads off a brick wall again while they watch their children deteriorate before their eyes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#WWW00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  He has a difficult task because he has come to this Chamber not once but twice to convey I do not know what to this House.  I submitted a Commencement matter relating to scoliosis on 19 October in the hope the Minister would come to the House.  I printed it off earlier because I wanted to read it again.  Of course, the Minister could not come to the House.  He is a busy man, and I appreciate that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, came to the House instead and the same Minister of State is here today.  The transcript from that date reads better than the speech he was given to read into the record today.</p> <p>I welcome the parents and people involved in the Scoliosis Advocacy Network and support group who are tuned in tonight.  Many of us have received emails from them over the past few days.  I wrote to them and told them this debate was going to happen.  I thought the Minister would be here because that was my initial understanding.  I raised the issue with the Minister of State during that Commencement matter on 19 October and told him how disappointed we were.  We did not want a history lesson then and we do not want one now.  I do not mean to be argumentative with him because I have a lot of time for him and respect him greatly.  He is, ultimately, given a briefing note and must come to the House and deliver the message.  We do not want any more history lessons; we want answers.</p> <p>On a recent episode of "Today with Claire Byrne", the co-founder of the Scoliosis Advocacy Network, Ms Claire Cahill, said there had been no engagement with the Minister for Health despite repeated requests.  I raised it as a concern at that time.  The Minister of State is not in a position to tell me now whether the Minister has engaged with that group.  I put on the record of the House what those people had told me.  They said they had difficulty engaging.  I then asked that we would have further meetings and was told by the Department and the officials that it was not possible because the Minister was under pressure.  I also understand that.  However, today was set as the date for an engagement and there was an expectation that the Minister could come to the House.  I understand he cannot be with us, but I would have thought he would have equipped Deputy Feighan or another Minister of State in the Department with an answer. </p> <p>The people want no more history lessons.  They do not want any more hysterics or promises.  They certainly did not find what it helpful that the Taoiseach, when asked about this issue, said that the delays in treatment are not because of the lack of resources but reflect a systemic failure.  What does "systemic failure" mean?  I know what it means.  What is he saying?  If this issue is not about resources but is the result of a systemic failure, how he is going to address the systemic failure?  How are we going to deal with the families?  Their children are in agony.  When I spoke to the Minister of State in October, 172 patients were waiting on the list.  We heard excuses about the cyberattack and Covid-19.  We are talking about paediatrics.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are speaking about the hospitals in Crumlin and on Temple Street.  We are speaking about specialist hospitals doing specialist care with children.  Why are people waiting?  No disrespect to the Minister of State but he has come in here and spoken about what was done in 2018 and 2019 in his speech.  Towards the end of his speech he mentioned the 2018 investment.  For God's sake, I am not interested in what happened in 2018.  I would like to think all of those children have been treated but, as the Minister of State and I know, they have not all been treated.</p><p>What is important today is what the people want.  They want to meet the Minister.  This is the message I want the Minister of State to take back.  I am putting everyone on notice that I will stand here next Tuesday to ask somebody to tell me whether the Minister has agreed to meet them with the date, the venue, the time and what will happen.  People want a timeline for these operations and no more excuses.  What is happening?  They do not want to know what we did in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  They want to know what we will do for these children now in 2021 and 2022.  Let us be upfront with these people and stop making excuses.  One thing these people have is the support of their organisations and their families.  They want to support their children.  More importantly, they have support of the surgeons, the nursing staff, the occupational therapists and all of the rehabilitative staff involved in treating the children.</p><p>These are young children with scoliosis.  Does another mother have to push a pram into RT&Eacute; to go on "Drivetime" or "Prime Time" and pour out her heart, tell her story, bring her child to the front and make an example of him or her to beg this coalition Government of three parties, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, for assistance?  Let us have some humanity for people and their children and give them the treatment they deserve.  The Minister of State was sent in here to read the same old story with a history lesson of what they did, when today there are more than 160 people on the list.  What can the Minister of State say to the parents looking in here?  Do they have to go back on Joe Duffy and other programmes next week?</p><p>I respect the Minister of State.  I know he is supportive.  I know he is a decent man and a decent politician.  He has children.  He knows what we are speaking about.  We all know what we are talking about.  Let us call a spade a spade.  Give these families the support and timelines they need to plan to have essential treatment for their children.  Above all, please go to the Department tomorrow and ask the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, whom I also respect, to shape up and meet the people and tell them the timelines for the treatment of their children.  It is reasonable and it is fair.  This is all I request.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.316" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1644" speakername="Martin Conway" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#XXX00200"><p>It is good to see the Minister of State back in the House.  I know he had a difficult couple of weeks.  He had all our best then and we are genuinely delighted to see him back.  He is a colleague who served with us and who has public service at the forefront of everything he does.  He is here this evening for a difficult debate.  I do not disagree with anything said by Senator Boylan because he is correct.  It should not take a child - not the parents but the child - having to go on the media at budget time to speak about the pain he suffers, how debilitating and difficult it is and how he is constantly in pain.  I heard live the two Ministers the following day responding to it.  They responded in a very humane way and I would expect nothing less from either of them.  We are raising this issue and it is on the agenda because we really need results.  I sincerely hope the young chap in Cork is getting the treatment he should have received long ago.</p> <p>The other 160 children also need to get their treatment without delay, without complication, without difficulty, without having to go public and without having to share their story with others.  We are a society.  We are a First World country.  We are one of the most successful countries in the world.  We do things well here but we are not doing this well and we really need to because it is what our young people deserve.</p> <p>We all know that when interventions are delayed it has an effect, particularly in young people.  I know this from my knowledge of eye difficulties and the challenges young people face.  If their eyes are dealt with very quickly there is some chance they will retain most of their vision, but if a procedure is delayed unnecessarily it will have a profound effect.  It is not rocket science; it is very simple and clear.</p> <p>People have emailed all of us about this and rightly so.  People from Clare, Cork, Tipperary and Kerry have shared their stories with me by email.  I read them all and my heart went out to them.  They are now coming together as a group and they are doing so very successfully as we are here having this debate.  It is no use unless we get a result.  We need a result for these young people.  They deserve it.  Our society deserves to do better.  The "Late Late Toy Show" will be on Friday night, which is great and people will spend time with their children.  This is simple stuff and we need to make sure it happens.  I know of the Minister of State's commitment to it.  I know he will send the message up the line.</p></speech>

I hope he is on a good road to recovery.  All the eloquent speeches in the world are not as good as the words of a mother so I will put on the record of the House an email I received this week.</p> <blockquote> 	I am writing to you as an upset, anxious parent of my child, Callum ... living with scoliosis waiting for spinal rod treatment.<br /><br />The delays in treatment times have now become a children's rights issue that was a problem long before covid and the cyber-attack.  This has made the orthopaedic list worse.  I see Callum deteriorate every day he is left waiting. <br /><br />Callum was born on 19th February 2019.  At around 6 months old we noticed something was not right with his back and our GP referred us to Temple St for assessment (x-ray, MRI).  Mr Connor Green, who recently advocated so passionately for Irish children at the Oireachtas Health Committee, diagnosed Callum who is now nearly 3, with early onset idiopathic scoliosis.  Initial treatment involved casting Callum which we did twice.  However Mr Green had to halt that process and move instead with a plan to do spinal rod surgery.  Callum has been on the waiting list for his first set of rods since February 2021.  His curve back then was around 55 degrees.  We don't know what it is now, only that is worse.  As the curve continues to increase in magnitude, this-limitation in respiratory function will shorten Callum's life period.  We were originally told he would be seen no later than July/August.  It is now November and we still have no date.  The wait is agony as I hope you can imagine.  We live in limbo with constant uncertainty, worry and stress.  Callum is so small.  Every day that passes is a lost opportunity.<br /><br />Children's Health Ireland has submitted plans that require funding from the HSE, to help alleviate the pressure on Temple Street and Crumlin.<br /><br />I would like you to ask Health Minister, Stephen Donnelly [who sadly is not with us, with all due respect to the Minister of State] and Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE if the funding will be approved?  Can they guarantee that this will be approved and when?  Callum like many more children need help now and this desperate crisis resolved sooner not later.  We need you to continue to ask these questions from those that hold the key to the funding.<br /><br />Callum does not have time on his side.  Growth is not his friend.  We have some of the very best surgeons in the world, PLEASE let them do their job before they go elsewhere to do it. </blockquote></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#XXX00400"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  We are constantly standing up here to speak about cherishing all of the children equally.  This is a classic case where we are failing to do so as a country.  In October, 170 children were on a waiting list for scoliosis surgery.  None of the explanations give much solace to a parent such as the one quoted by Senator Seery Kearney.  It is really frustrating for us but it is 1 million times worse for a family that has no control over the situation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Such families would do it themselves if they could but they are reliant on the State for this type of surgery.  I believe that both the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and the Minister for Health want to do their very best but, as many have outlined, it is beyond time for action.  I have heard some of the explanations involving Covid and the cyberattack, but this has been ongoing for years.  People have been saying for years that they are waiting.  What really hit home for me is that growth is not these children's friend.  That is what makes this different, what makes the waiting lists for scoliosis surgery different from those for other types of surgery and what makes this so urgent.  I know that &euro;250 million was put into the budget for 2022 to deal with waiting lists, and that was really welcome, but it seems to me that there are a number of problems here.  One is the shortage of consultants and nurses, another is that the facilities and infrastructure are not up to scratch and the third is beds.</p><p>As for consultants and nurses, there are no orthopaedic surgeons all along the west coast of Ireland.  That has to be addressed first.  It just shows that there are facilities that could open their doors for this kind of surgery but just cannot at the moment because they are not getting the support.  This issue has been before the Joint Committee on Health, and Connor Green spoke eloquently about it and outlined the real, heartbreaking stories of families.  I will not repeat those stories here.  They have been outlined by previous Senators and I am sure they will be again.  I know that the Minister of State hears them because we have all been hearing similar stories for many years.</p><p>This debate is really welcome because it is the right thing to do to bring this topic to every single forum we can in order to address it.  I commend Senator Boyhan, who I know brings up this issue frequently and who had asked for the debate, and thank the people from all parties who have engaged in this conversation, put down parliamentary questions and Commencement matters and brought the matter to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  I absolutely concur with some of my colleagues that now is the time for action and that we have to see the delivery of services as soon as possible.  I completely understand that in every single area there are waiting lists, but I ask the Minister of State to remember the point about why this one is so important, that is, because it is to do with growth and children's development.  That is why it is critical.</p></speech>

I think this is the first opportunity I have had to engage with the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, since he took up his appointment, so I welcome the opportunity to do that and welcome him back to the Seanad.</p><p>I will begin like Senator Seery Kearney.  Joanne Rodgers's email will form an awful lot of my remarks because they are impactful.  While probably a lot of what I will say has been said by Senator Seery Kearney, it will not do any harm to reassert her words and, through Joanne's words, the lived experience of so many families.  I am very conscious of that.  I am very conscious that when Jim from my office asked Joanne whether she would mind if we shared her story, it is not just their story alone and that, as other colleagues have said, this is the experience, unfortunately, of so many others.</p><p>Callum Rodgers is nearly three years old.  He was born on 19 February 2019, and at around six months his parents noticed that something was not right with his back.  He was referred to Temple Street Hospital.  There, Mr. Connor Green diagnosed Callum with early onset idiopathic scoliosis.  Callum was initially placed in a cast on two occasions, but the doctor moved speedily to carry out spinal rod surgery.  Callum has been on the waiting list for his first set of rods since February 2021.  Then the curve in the child's back was about 55&deg;.  The family do not know what it is today but they do know that it is worse.  Callum's mother, Joanne, sent an email describing her son's worsening condition.  She said:</p> <blockquote> 	As the curve continues to increase in magnitude, ... [it] will shorten Callum's life period.  We were originally told he would be seen no later than July/August.  It is now November and we still have no date.  The wait is agony as I hope you can imagine.  We live in limbo with constant uncertainty, worry and stress.  Callum is so small.  Every day that passes is a lost opportunity.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Callum does not have time on his side.  Growth is not his friend.  We have some of the very best surgeons in the world.  PLEASE let them do their job before they ... [move] elsewhere to do it. </blockquote> <p>Ms Rodgers's emotional email is about her son but she also makes it clear in the email that he is not alone.  She says, &quot;Callum like many more children needs help now.&quot;  There are nearly 44,000 children with orthopaedic conditions such as scoliosis, spina bifida, cerebral palsy and hip and limb deformities.  Callum's mother specifically appeals to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and Paul Reid, the CEO of the HSE, for funding for Temple Street Hospital, where Callum is being treated.  Nearly five years on from the Ombudsman for Children's highly critical report on failures to treat scoliosis in a timely fashion, these professionals on the front line are still saying there are deficiencies in specialist staffing levels, access to and the number of surgical theatres and a lack of safely staffed paediatric critical care and high-dependency beds.</p><p>When Callum's doctor, Mr. Green, attended the Joint Committee on Health a few weeks ago, his remarks were hard-hitting and alarming.  He described a dysfunctional system, inadequate to the task and in a chaotic state, which is &quot;failing our children&quot;.  He rejected claims that this was so because of the pandemic or the cyberattack because the shortcomings were there before both, although the pandemic and the cyberattack have made a bad situation worse.  It is quite clear from what we are being told that not enough has been done in the past four or five years to boost capacity in paediatric orthopaedics for the treatment of scoliosis, spina bifida and other conditions.  Children like Callum and many more are being left in pain, waiting too long for treatment and up against cancelled procedures because of a lack of reserved beds.  Long waits and cancellations, along with the conditions themselves, have a real psychological toll on the children affected and, of course, their families.  Mr. Green said we need to resource our ICU staffing better, we need to ring-fence an intensive care bed before elective surgery and we need to support our intensivists and recruit more of them in order to look after patients afterwards.  He also urged the Government to be honest with the families of children facing scoliosis and other orthopaedic problems and not to mislead them that the prospects of improving the system can be done by next year.  The families are carrying enough emotional pressure and stress without false hope being added.  Mr. Green said he fights one day at a time and tries to get to Friday.</p><p>I urge the Minister of State and, through him, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, to listen to Callum Rodgers's mother and other families like hers, to listen to Mr. Green and other professionals like him, to collaborate with them and implement a credible plan for the more than 44,000 children and their families and to end the widespread uncertainty and worry by resourcing the health service and the professionals to do the job we all know they are not only keen to do but more than capable of doing.</p><p>As other colleagues have said, we need no more retrospective statements.  We need a timeline outlined.  We need the Minister for Health to meet with the families and listen directly to their concerns.  As has been said, and as I am sure all colleagues across the House will agree, we just need to help these children.  I do not want to play an emotional card.  The Minister of State has a job of work to do in his Department, and I appreciate it is not an easy one, but there are children suffering out there and we are being told that constantly.  Their stories are being shared.  We know historically the damage it does when we let generations of children suffer.  I would have thought that as a society we have woken up to the trauma and the harm that does transgenerationally.  While I appreciate entirely that these are different circumstances, the fundamental issue remains the same.  There are people out there who are in need of urgent help and who are worthy of our help and, because of that, we really need to do more to act now.</p></speech>

I compliment all the people who have sent us emails highlighting their experiences and what their children are going through.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Maria Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2465"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2465&amp;amp;pid=MariaByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are all here as legislators but, at the end of the day, children and their futures are really important to all of us.  Scoliosis and other orthopaedic problems can have an awful impact on children as they grow up.</p><p>In 2013 or 2014, a number of people I know personally were impacted by scoliosis.  At the time, when I engaged with the surgeon and the various healthcare staff, it was not even about funding.  Rather, it was that theatres were not available and that was a big issue.  My understanding is that is what the problems relate to now.  At that time, the Minister of the day engaged with surgeons, lobbying groups and parents on behalf of children and provided funding to other hospitals in order that minor surgeries that needed to be carried out could be transferred to them, which freed up time for these surgeries to be carried out.  I recall the case of a girl who was about 13 years of age.  She was undergoing a growth spurt and her height grew but her body did not grow with it, and that was the problem.  She was told that if the issue was let go much longer, she could end up needing to use a wheelchair.  Her condition was very serious.  She underwent surgery in Crumlin hospital, however, because people with less urgent needs had been moved to other hospitals to free up theatres.  Perhaps this is something the Minister of State could propose to the Minister for Health for consideration.  I am sure theatres are available in different hospitals.  I am not suggesting sickness is ever minor but sometimes certain surgeries can be carried out in other hospitals.  My understanding is that surgery for scoliosis requires certain machinery, so it cannot be carried out in every theatre.</p><p>This is a serious issue affecting many children throughout the country and, as Senator Pauline O'Reilly said, nobody on the western seaboard is dealing with this.  Children from the west, the mid-west and the south have to travel to Dublin for surgery, so spreading out the treatment should be considered.  Moreover, there is a shortage of specialised surgeons and nurses to support that and it needs to be seriously examined.  We cannot afford to allow children at that age to be left with debilitating conditions.  Some of them end up needing to use a wheelchair.  Having read some of the stories, I know the real-life experiences can be harrowing, not only for the children but for their families as well.</p><p>I acknowledge the Minister of State's commitment and know he will do his best, but he might consider some of the proposals I have outlined to reduce the waiting lists.</p></speech>

I will be brief, given much has been said.  The fact is we are again talking about this issue in the House but we should not be.  We should not have to stand here, time and again, on behalf of families and make phone calls on their behalf.  As Senator Maria Byrne noted, their children are becoming disabled because of a failure of the State and the HSE to do their duty and undertake these critical operations.  This has been going on for so long.  There are many different reasons, excuses and problems.  The HSE, the doctors and the medical staff know what the problems are.  They have come to the table with many remedies and actions - far more than any of us in this Chamber or the Department of Health.  If the resources are provided, we can get the operations done, save these wee children's lives and improve the quality of life for them and their families.  It is as simple as that.</p> <p>It is outrageous that, time and again, we discuss in one of the Houses or at committee meetings the issue of failing our children.  Our previous debate this evening related to children in care.  At the Joint Committee on Disability Matters, we have discussed the State's failure in regard to children&rsquo;s assessments of need and access to therapy.  Again and again, the most vulnerable, that is, the people who cannot shout out, rely on the State to provide care and it is not providing it.</p> <p>I accept the Minister of State is not the line Minister for this.  I will raise this issue at my parliamentary party meeting as well because this has gone beyond statements.  We need actions.</p></speech>

The Government remains committed to improving access to all types of healthcare, both in the community and in primary care settings, as well as in the acute hospital sector.  Improving paediatric orthopaedic services remains a priority within the wider reform and improvement of healthcare services.  As noted during the debate, it is critical that paediatric orthopaedic services be provided with the levels of capacity and staffing needed not only to improve waiting times but to address the backlog in demand.  Senator Clifford-Lee stated there should be someone in the Department of Health who liaises with families.  That is an interesting and innovative idea I will convey to the Minister-----</p></speech>

The strategic alliance between CHI and Cappagh orthopaedic hospital is considered a key to CHI being able to address the current challenges to access elective and age-specific orthopaedic care.  CHI has advised the Department of Health that the HSE has agreed to the proposals to recruit additional paediatric theatre nurses and additional support.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan proposed arranging a meeting with the Minister and indicated he wants to hear timelines for treatment at that meeting.  I will convey both those to requests to the Minister.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile made a similar point.</p> <p>I welcome the expansion of paediatric orthopaedic services this year at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital and the appointment of a paediatric clinical director to provide clinical governance to this service.  This strategic alliance will be of great benefit in the interim as CHI prepares to move to the new children&rsquo;s hospital.  CHI has informed the Department of Health that in 2022, it plans to undertake 196 day cases, 540 inpatient appointments and 1,200 outpatient appointments at Cappagh orthopaedic hospital.</p> <p>Senator Conway articulated the difficulties of children having to appear in the media and stated he wants to get results in respect of treatment for young people, something with which I very much concur.</p> <p>Cappagh orthopaedic hospital is not the only additional resource being used to improve access to paediatric orthopaedics.  The HSE has a procurement framework in place seeking additional private sector capacity, including for patients with scoliosis.  It should be noted, however, that scoliosis procedures require detailed pre-operative, multidisciplinary planning to meet the needs of the patient.  The complexity of scoliosis surgery and the specific medical staffing and infrastructural needs for such procedures mean outsourcing to private hospitals is not often a suitable alternative.  In addition, private hospitals with a facility to treat patients are limited.  For these reasons, it is of central importance that CHI and the HSE continue to invest in additional capacity and staffing for orthopaedic services.  I look forward to the benefits the opening of the new children's hospital will bring to orthopaedic services and wider paediatric services.</p> <p>Senator Seery Kearney outlined the case of Callum Rodgers, his difficulties and the fact he was due to be seen in July or August but still has not got a date.  Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile mentioned his case too.  I will raise it with the Minister.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As has been said, Callum does not have time.  I hope we can get more urgency in respect of this matter.  We have tried to investigate what is happening there.</p><p>In terms of accessing other forms of additional capacity, Children's Health Ireland has advised the Department that recent experience has demonstrated that previous strategies that looked at outsourcing spinal patients to external providers in the UK and Europe have not been overly successful.  This is primarily because spinal patients often require additional follow-up and the management of post-operative complications on return to Ireland.  Such issues are also now compounded for patients by the need to travel overseas, especially during Covid-19.  As a result, it is imperative that we continue to seek solutions within the current health system to provide the activity and services needed to reduce orthopaedic waiting times.</p><p>Senator Marie Byrne mentioned that there should be funding for other hospitals to free up theatres.  Hopefully, we can work on that.  Senator McGreehan said that the HSE needs to do its duty and get these appointments done.</p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly mentioned that surgeries need to be spread out because there are no surgeons in the west, the mid-west or the south west.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p><p>Any plans to improve waiting times are reliant on good-quality, accessible and transparent data.  Improving the waiting times that children experience is just one element of a wider plan to reform and improve acute hospital waiting lists.</p><p>To support the work of the task force, &euro;350 million has been committed to improving waiting times in 2022.  The latter includes &euro;200 million in additional funding for the HSE.  In addition, there is funding of &euro;150 million for the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p><p>I would like to conclude by reaffirming the Government's commitment to improving the waiting times that children and all other patients experience when accessing hospital appointments and procedures.  Through continued investment and detailed and strategic planning, we will continue to dedicate time and resources in order that patients will not be left waiting on lists, but, rather, will be provided with their procedures in a clinically suitable timeframe and in line with the targets provided for in Sl&aacute;intecare.</p></speech>

I broadly welcome the concept of this legislation, especially the acknowledgement that using the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, as the benchmark is now appropriate and that a new benchmark for increases in rents within rent pressure zones must be put in place, which, as is set out in the Bill, is 2%.</p><p>Amendment No. 1 seeks to introduce a rent freeze for a period of 36 months before a landlord would be subject to a rent cap of 2%, as set out in the Bill.  For many months, the need for a rent freeze has been the repeated refrain by my colleague, Senator Moynihan.  Recently, rents nationally have increased by 6.7%.  Non-compliance with the rent caps within a number of the rent pressure zones has given rise to rent increases in excess of the 4% limit.  Looking at average rents in Dublin in the area in which I and other Members, including Senator Fitzpatrick,  are based, there are rents in excess of &euro;2,000 per tenancy.  We know of families and individuals who pay in excess of 40% of their net income on very standard or even worse than standard living accommodation or living conditions within private rented accommodation.  The time has come for a radical measure to be introduced.  A rent freeze cannot be the only solution and must be part of a number of measures currently taken.</p><p>A great deal has been said about the need for supply.  We in the Labour Party have echoed that.  However, within the constituency of Dublin Central, which I know best, we have a degree of supply because there are approximately 4,500 build-to-rent student accommodation and co-living units that are either going through the planning system or under construction, relative to about 2,500 conventional apartments.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Supply is not necessarily an issue in some of the areas in which Senators are based; the issue is the type of supply and its affordability for those who desperately need affordable and sustainable rental accommodation in this city.</p><p>Amendment No. 2 effectively sets out that any rent increase should be confined to 2%.  Some landlords attempted to impose cumulative increases this year as a result of the rent freeze last year.  I have been contacted by tenants regarding a proposed 8% increase in their rent.  Landlords are effectively able to claim that they should increase rents on the basis of last year and this year.  Of course, 8% is an enormous figure.  The increase possible under a 2% annual rent increase would, obviously, be less, but if there has not been a rent revision for several years, that cumulative percentage increase can be significant.  We are clearly calling for 2% to be the maximum that can be sought in any rent increase, rather than the entitlement of a landlord on an annual basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#EEEE00200"><p>I refer to amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  Essentially, they propose that rent increases should be zero.  Renters cannot take any more.  Senator Sherlock mentioned the darker and more dysfunctional parts of the rental market, but even if a landlord is sticking to the rules, renters have had five years of 4% rent increases.  It is not difficult to do the maths - five multiplied by four is 20, so if a landlord has applied the 4% increase each year, the tenants have had a 20% rent increase within the law.  We know the reality for many renters is that rents have gone way beyond that because the landlord broke the rules or the tenant was too nervous to raise an issue or was moving into a new property.  There have been five years of 4% rent increases.</p> <p>The ship has sailed on any pretence that rent caps in rent pressure zones are effective in halting rising rents. They are not effective in that regard.  Even if they were working, renters cannot take any more than the 20% that has been legally allowable.  An increase of 20% in five years is too much.  As for the 2% cap on rent increases, we in Sinn F&eacute;in believe that, just like the 4% cap, it will not work.  It is too difficult to police and there are too many loopholes.  As a policy, the rent pressure zone system does not work.  It is broken and needs to be scrapped.  Sinn F&eacute;in will forward an increasing number of amendments on later Stages of the Bill to deal with those problems.  A total ban of rent increases across the State is the only way to stop rents rising any further for all new and existing tenancies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#EEEE00300"><p>As regards the contribution of Senator Sherlock, if there was a cumulative rent increase of 4% and 4%, that was illegal and not permitted under the legislation the Government brought forward earlier in the year.  If a landlord has been in breach of that legislation, that should be reported to the RTB, which the Government is financing with additional resources of up to &euro;21 million for next year.  We need to see more enforcement in respect of landlords who are breaking the rules.  That is 100% certain and I make no bones about it or apology for stating it.</p> <p>However, the issue I have in respect of the amendments proposing a rent freeze outright is that it sounds fantastic in theory and in a sound bite that will go out on social media, the radio or the newspapers but, in reality, every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  As I stated on Second Stage, we do not have to look too far from where we are today to enlighten ourselves in that regard.  The left-wing government in Berlin stated that it would freeze rents for five years to solve the rental crisis there.  Eighteen months later, the supreme court struck that measure down as unconstitutional.  There are tenants in Berlin who now have to pay back money to landlords.  The most important result of the measure is that within 12 months there was a 50% reduction in the number of rental properties available in Berlin.  That was fantastic for those in a rental property, but it was catastrophic for those seeking one.</p> <p>The last thing we need in a constrained rental market is to reduce supply even further.  It sounds fantastic in theory and everyone acknowledges that rents are too high, but we also have to be practical and weigh up the pros and cons of legislation.  That is the different between being in government and being in opposition.  In government, everything has to be weighted up and decisions made that strike a balance for tenants and landlord.  That is why we are trying to increase supply.  While there may not be a supply issue in Senator Sherlock's constituency, there is certainly such an issue in the vast majority of the country.  That is why we are rolling out cost rental, which will compete with the private rental market and drive down rents even further.  It is not that Fine Gael or I do not want to see a reduction in rents, but we have to look at the evidence from another EU country in respect of the results of a rent freeze and apply it in the same context here to determine the effect a rent freeze would have in an already constrained market.  The 2% cap in terms of the harmonised index of consumer prices, or lower, as the case may be at a point in time, is a fair balance in this respect.  For that reason, I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

We appreciate his time, as well as the effort that he and the Department have put into trying to tackle the crisis that is affecting far too many people who are renting their homes not just in Dublin, but all over Ireland.  All Members know that rents have become unaffordable.  It is for that reason that this new Government has legislated no less than five times since coming into office to try to tackle the rental unaffordability crisis that is affecting far too many working people and other citizens.</p> <p>Housing poverty has a corrosive effect on society.  It deprives people of the opportunity to go to school or work and get on with their lives.  This is important legislation and I and the Fianna F&aacute;il group will support it.  I urge the Opposition to act responsibly when it comes to this legislation and debate.  I know the debate is to adjourn at 10 p.m. but the House is scheduled to deal with it again later in the week.  This is important legislation for people who are renting today or are dependent on the rental market.  It is reckless and irresponsible to speak about introducing things that are not legally possible and that will only make a bad situation worse for renters.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Cummins spoke about the rent freeze that was attempted in Berlin.  That had a disruptive effect.  Not only did it significantly reduce the amount of rental property that was available, it compounded the situation for people who were renting by leaving them in limbo with two types of contracts.  There were shadow contracts and shadow leases and an overhanging burden of rent on renters, and they did not know when it would be demanded and collected.  It did not apply to properties that were built after 2014, and there were a raft of other exemptions.  Ultimately, it was found to be illegal.  I heard the spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in, not Senator Warfield, deny on national radio that he ever called for a rent freeze and then, in the same breath, not only demand a rent freeze but also a reduction in existing rents.  If he and Sinn F&eacute;in want to communalise all private property in this country, they must come clean and say it.  They need to tell the public what they are proposing.  Most important, they must tell the renters of Ireland what they are proposing.  They have to accept that this legislation will put caps on rent on the Statute Book.  It will provide renters with certainty in terms of the duration of their tenancies and give them extra protections.</p><p>However, this is not the only action the Government is taking.  In Housing for All and the other initiatives that have been taken, there is &euro;20 billion in capital.  Sinn F&eacute;in called for us to increase capital spending and we are increasing it.  Affordable cost rental has been spoken about for decades.  We are delivering it, despite the objections from the Opposition and the legal challenges.  Even last night, Sinn F&eacute;in voted against 850 public homes on public land in this city, where it talks about the unaffordability of housing.  It continues to oppose.  We can spend all tonight and later this week debating it, but Sinn F&eacute;in should be honest with the people outside this House, who desperately need a solution to the rental crisis in which they are trapped, and support this legislation.  It should support it to give people certainty and tenancies of indefinite duration and to put caps on the rent.  The reality is it will take time to build the 300,000 new homes and the affordable cost rental homes, but they will be built and delivered despite its opposition.  I ask that party to be constructive in the debate tonight and during the rest of the week.</p></speech>

Besides the difficulties with a blanket ban on rent increases, which I will address presently, the amendment as drafted would have significant unintended consequences.  As provided for in this amendment, the setting of a rent under the tenancy of a dwelling in a rent pressure zone at any time after the commencement of section 3 may not occur in the period of three years from the commencement of that section.  On the face of it, this means rent settings cannot legally take place for three years, even where a new tenancy commences in respect of a rental property.  While freezing rents for existing tenancies, this amendment would also stop new tenancies being agreed for existing rental properties.</p><p>Now, more than ever, we need investment in the sector and people must be free to move within the rental sector as their needs change over time.  The proposed imposition of a three-year rent freeze has been debated numerous times in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  As has been said previously, a blanket ban on rent increases in all likelihood would face significant legal challenge.  It would also severely impact investment in the supply of rental accommodation in the medium to longer term, and I am sure Senators would agree this would be an unwelcome and unintended consequence of this measure.</p><p>While affordability remains an issue, the introduction of rent pressure zones in 2016 and their subsequent enhancement in 2019, in July this year and as proposed in this Bill, have played and will play a key part in moderating rent increases.  Rent pressure zones were a considered measure that would balance the needs of tenants with the legal rights of landlords and the imperative to ensure rental housing supply was not adversely affected.  The current rent pressure zone arrangements, under which annual rent increases are prohibited from exceeding general inflation as recorded by the harmonised index of consumer prices, were introduced as a balanced set of arrangements which recognise the need to incentivise in situations of high and significant increases in rents while at the same time taking account of constitutional property rights and the need to avoid disincentivising the provision of rental properties.</p><p>When introducing these measures the Minister was very clear about the need to monitor inflation carefully.  At the time, the harmonised index of consumer prices inflation averaged 0.73% per annum over the previous three years but had risen to 1.6% per annum in the year ending June 2021.  The Minister needed to revise the rent pressure zone rent control relatively quickly in July on the basis that it could be independently verified.  Given the continuing rise in the harmonised index of consumer prices inflation up to 5.1% per annum in October, this Bill proposes to introduce a cap of 2% per annum <i>pro rata </i>to any rent inflation in a rent pressure zone to ensure effective rent controls are legally in force when the general inflation rate is too high and over 2% per annum.</p><p>I cannot accept amendment No. 2 which proposes to remove a reference to &ldquo;relevant percentage&rdquo; as defined in section 3 and replace it with a flat 2%.  This would, in effect, cap any rent increase at 2% regardless of the time elapsed since the previous rent setting under the tenancy.  The definition of &ldquo;relevant percentage&rdquo; in the Bill permits a 2% per annum rent increase since the previous rent setting whether the setting occurred under the current tenancy or under the previous tenancy.  The aim of the definition is to avoid incentivising a landlord to routinely increase in a rent pressure zone, RPZ, annually.  The Residential Tenancies Acts generally provide that a rent review in an RPZ cannot occur any more frequently than once per year.  The definition would allow for existing tenants to enjoy occupation of their home under tenancy without annual rent increases should the landlord so wish.</p><p>The landlord could forgo annual rent increases for the existing tenants in the knowledge that he or she could legally increase a rent by 2% per annum<i>pro rata</i>when annual replacement tenancy is agreed.  For example, if a landlord had set the rent at &euro;1,000 for the existing tenant and did not review the rent during a three-year tenancy, he or she could legally set a new rent of &euro;1,060 if lower than the harmonised index of consumer prices inflation for the subsequent tenant.  We do not want to incentivise annual rent reviews in rent pressure zones for existing tenants.  We do not want to impede a landlord from charging a reasonable rent for the dwelling based on the time elapsed since the previous rent setting and taking into account the time value of money and costs in maintaining and providing rental accommodation.  Some 86% of landlords own one or two properties.  We must encourage landlords to provide much-needed accommodation in the private rented sector.  This amendment would unfairly penalise good landlords and drive away investment from the sector.</p><p>I cannot accept amendments Nos. 3 and 4.  I appreciate that they propose, in effect, to reduce the quantum of any rent increases that may lawfully be imposed in a rent pressure zone.  However, as with amendment No. 1, the proposed amendments would effectively freeze rents at their current levels.  Any proposed measure that impacts on private property rights requires detailed consideration and scrutiny, having regard to the provisions of Article 43 of the Constitution and the associated legal complexities.  On Second Stage, the Minister explained that this Bill will cap any rent increase in a rent pressure zone at 2% per annum <i>pro rata</i>.  This measure has the approval of the Attorney General, and the Government is confident it is fair to both tenants and landlords and will have a desired impact in the rental sector.  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 introduced the rent predictability measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising fast.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The proposed rent increase cap of 2% per annum <i>pro rata</i>in rent pressure zones, if lower than the HICP or inflation, in the Bill has regard to the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords.  It takes account of local rental market factors providing certainty to tenants and landlords with regard to medium-term rent levels.<br/><br/>Throughout this pandemic we have asked landlords to show forbearance towards their tenants where they may struggle financially with some requiring State support.  In order to better enforce rent pressure zone legislation, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 provided the Residential Tenancies Board with enhanced powers and resources to carry out investigations and sanction landlords, if required, for any contravention of a rent increase in a restricted rent pressure zone.  The maximum sanction is &euro;30,000.  Alternatively, a tenant may wish to refer a dispute for resolution to the board so a lawful rent can be enforced and damages of up to &euro;20,000 can be awarded to the tenant.  The Department, the Housing Agency and the Residential Tenancies Board keeps the operation of the rental market under constant review.  It is important to have transparency in the system, with fair rent and certainty for tenants and landlords alike.</p></speech>

The Minister was here for many hours of constructive debate during which we proposed ideas.  I would like that atmosphere in the Chamber tonight, and that is how I intend to proceed.</p> <p>I have been asked to outline Sinn F&eacute;in's policy for renters.  I have dedicated a Private Members' business slot to it so I probably should not have to do so, but we would put one month's rent back in the pocket of every renter in the State up to the value of &euro;1,500 through a refundable tax credit and seek to stop any future rent increases.  Our motion at the time was and our policy is to have a three-year ban on rent increases at the current level for existing tenancies and at the RTB rent index level for new and future tenancies.  The latter are determined by the size, type and location of the dwelling.</p> <p>I have listened to criticism of Sinn F&eacute;in's housing spokesperson in the D&aacute;il.  I am surprised that criticism has been allowed to stand in view of the fact that he is not here.  I appreciate that the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on housing was not here when we had a good debate on Second Stage.  There was a good reason that the spokesperson was not here, but a reading of the transcript would have showed that we were constructive in our opposition.</p> <p>I am not going to describe the situation in Berlin because I am not an expert on the housing market in Germany.  Many of my friends live there because this city is not a good place for many young people, particularly in the context of the rental market.  I know many creative young people who could be contributing to our culture but live their lives in Berlin instead so they will know that housing market well.</p></speech>

It is probably convenient not to have information on the Berlin situation because the fact of the matter is that the decisions that were made by the left-wing Berlin Government resulted in a more than 50% reduction in the number of rental properties.  While it is convenient not to know anything about it, those are the facts and nobody can dispute them.  We have to base what happens in Ireland on the evidence that presents itself.  Where best to look, only at our near neighbours in Germany.</p></speech>

There are other measures that can be taken in this Bill to bring about a greater balance in the power and control between landlords and tenants.  That is reflected in a number of our amendments, particularly in amendment No. 5.  In the event where there is a dispute about the grounds for a rent increase, there should be a ground whereby the tenant can bring his or her dispute to the Residential Tenancies Board.  As my colleague Senator Moynihan and I see it, there are very narrow grounds upon which a tenant can bring a dispute to the board.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to look at that and broaden it.  We need to allow greater recourse to the RTB for tenants and, in this particular instance, where there is a dispute about the nature of a rent increase.  I look for the support of the Minister of State on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1669" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#MMMM00200"><p>What I want to say about this Bill is that I do not agree with the substance of it at all, that it is a fundamental mistake, that it is going in the wrong direction and that it will eventually, over time, reduce the amount of residential accommodation available for tenants in this country.</p> <p>I do not agree with the new concept of tenancies of indefinite duration.  What we are effectively doing is saying that landlords cannot, in any circumstance, recover possession of a property except on one of the limited grounds which exist at the moment for the curtailment of a section 4 tenancy.  I do not believe it is in the interests of the rental sector generally that the establishment of a six-month tenancy should effectively, from now on, allow a tenant to stay in a property forever, subject to the landlord not being able to comply with one or other of the nominated grounds for termination.  For instance, to say that a landlord can always obtain vacant possession when selling a premises, one has to bear in mind that in this day and age that is quite likely to give rise to significant capital gains tax.  I do not think private landlords will come into the market at all as a result of this Bill.  It is foolish and shortsighted.</p> <p>I want to put on the record of the House that I speak as somebody who was brought up in a rent controlled house on Leeson St.  Eventually, my parents succeeded to my grandparents' tenancy in that house.  For a house which was on about a fifth of acre on Upper Leeson St., with its own drive 60 or 80 yards long, they paid &pound;120 a year in rent to landlords who had effectively lost control of the property completely.  The landlords were liable for external repairs.  My parents were in a position whereby they were living in a house for which they were paying well below the market rent.  Some of those who owned the house, who were relatives by descent, lived in New Zealand.  I will not mention who they are, but they found themselves with an interest in very valuable land which was effectively out of their control.  That situation would not exist under this Bill, but the amendment proposes to, yet again, take away from a landlord the right to estimate the rent he or she thinks is appropriate, having refurbished the premises substantially, and instead hand it over to somebody else to decide the value of the rent to be paid thereafter.  This is all one-way traffic.  It will all end up with a hugely diminished private rental sector.  </p> <p>Maybe the big American corporations that are building new apartments will think this is nothing to do with them, and maybe they are right.  I am talking about people who have one house, apartment or piece of land anywhere in the country and, for whatever reason, have let it out.  We are now proposing to tell them that they cannot agree with a tenant that he or she will only be there for eight years.  The agreement has to state that the tenant will only be there for eight years if the landlord wants to have the property back for specified statutory purposes, such as sale, refurbishment, to give the property to a member of the family or whatever.  In the Bill, references to family do not include nieces or nephews.  All we are talking about is immediate members of the family.  </p> <p>What amuses me is that nobody has spoken up for the other side in this debate.  I see where the Senator is coming from with her amendment.  All of this is going to kill off an entire sector.  It will expropriate an entire class of landlords.  Whether it is the Minister's amendment to section 5 or this amendment, I want to put on the record of the House that I know I am in what is perhaps a minority of one, but I think this Bill is a disastrous mistake.  In five or ten years' time, we will wonder how we ever created this situation.</p> <p>I remind the Minister of State's Department of one thing.  In 2009, the charity Threshold persuaded the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who succeeded me in Dublin South-East, John Gormley, to introduce regulations which ended the possibility of leaving a house in bedsits.  He introduced a regulation under the Housing Act which made it impossible or unlawful to let rooms in a house unless they had their own bathroom and kitchen.  Precisely why that should have been done when house sharing is permissible, as long as everybody is a tenant of the whole house, I do not know, but the result was that between 10,000 and 20,000 people on the lowest end of the private rental ladder, such as students, elderly people, single people and people who were separated lost their homes because of a well-intentioned change.  Most of the houses on the road in Ranelagh where I live were in bedsits.  They were all cleared out to become trophy homes for the rich and wealthy.  Some of them now have huge price tags.  A new development on the road will cost &euro;2.5 million, a road which was, I can tell the House, most unfashionable when I went to live there.  </p> <p>All I am saying is that laws can be introduced which we think are great and are giving tenants all of the rights, but we must look around corners in the housing market.  I believe that what we are doing in this Bill is a big mistake.  That this is being done on foot of an agreed programme between the Government parties does not interest me in the slightest.  In five or ten years' time, when the market diminishes and disappears, it will be realised that we switched the balance in favour of tenants too much and away from the landlords.  Ordinary landlords who were letting houses and all the rest lost too many rights and fled the market.  That is what is going to happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-11-23a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021112300002#MMMM00300"><p>I thank Senators for their contributions.  I cannot accept amendment No. 5 as we deem it unnecessary.  Section 19(5), which is referred to in the amendment, provides for limited exemptions for RPZ rent control, including where a substantial change in the nature of accommodation provided for under the tenancy occurs.  Section 76 of the Residential Tenancies Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that either or both of the parties to an existing or terminated tenancy of a dwelling may, individually or jointly, as appropriate, refer to the board for resolution any matter relating to the tenancy in respect of which there is a dispute between them.  Section 78 provides for a non-exhaustive list of particular matters that may be referred to the board for dispute resolution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This section specifically provides that without prejudice to the generality of section 76, the matters in respect of which disputes and, where appropriate, complaints may be referred to the board for resolution include a time at which a review for rent, as referred to in Part 3, should take place or the amount of rent that should be determined on foot of that review.  The requirements for the rent control exemption to apply in this respect are fair and reasonable, given that we want to encourage new investment in the private rental sector.  Satisfying the requirements for a substantial change in the nature of accommodation provided under the tenancy will constitute a significant investment on the part of the landlord and an exemption from rent control in respect of the first setting after which the works are warranted.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.</p><p>Senator McDowell made a timely contribution.  Through the first four amendments, I have referenced the fine balance we are trying to achieve in the landlord and tenant relationship.  I have clearly outlined that 86% of tenancies are in homes owned by landlords with either one or two properties.  Such landlords are leaving the market in large numbers.  That is an issue of which the Government must take cognisance.  We obviously need to ensure that investment in that marketplace is incentivised.  We also must consider society at large.  It is a fine balance.  In the economic cycle we find ourselves, if I were to look for a rental accommodation in my own town of Mullingar, I would be unable to find one.  The harmonisation index shows almost a double-digit increase, quarter-on-quarter.  We are at a difficult point until supply catches up to meet demand.  The laws of economics in any marketplace dictate that when demand significantly outstrips supply, prices go up.  We are working hard to provide an adequate supply and meet the Economic and Social Research Institute targets but until that happens, it will be difficult to ensure that rent prices are stable.  That is what this legislation is doing.  It is a reaction to ensure that the market does not leave vulnerable citizens behind which, unfortunately, has happened too often.  We must work hard to ensure that.  </p><p>I heard the Senator's points.  I note that some political parties in this House, notwithstanding the legislation that is proposed here and the arguments and amendments involved, are proposing enormous charges on those one-property and two-property landlords.  They have suggested additional taxation of more than &euro;500 for additional properties.  That is not reflective of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il or where this Government is coming from.  It ignores the backdrop to the circumstances in which we are operating.  We are hearing extreme voices in this debate.  On balance, this legislation is proportionate for the point of time we are in.  It is a response that I consider reasonable, on balance.</p><p>I worked in practice as a chartered accountant for more than a decade, looking at the rental return for small landlords.  It is a difficult space for landlords and the figures back that up.  It is difficult to balance the rights of landlords and the rights of vulnerable citizens.  This legislation is a reasonable response.</p></speech>

I fully understand there is a housing shortage at the moment.  I fully understand that people are being gouged for rent.  I understand all of that.  However, the amendment the Minister of State is proposing to section 5, which I realise I am being slightly disorderly in referring to, is a permanent change to our law.  It is not something which will disappear when supply increases, or whatever.  It is a permanent change to our law to the effect that all tenancies, once they have gone past six months, become tenancies of indefinite duration, terminable only in certain circumstances.  That is the point I am making.  The Senators' amendment is clearly to deal with temporary situations.  If the Minister of State told me that this was all temporary, I would have a different view of it, but it is permanent.</p> <p>Going back to what I mentioned about my own family upbringing, we were paid large sums of money to get out of that house.  I am just saying that.  In the end, somebody bought out the poor people who had got nothing by way of rent for years and the site was redeveloped for another purpose.  My father, for the first time in his life, had some money in his hands because he was bought out as a tenant.  I am just making that point.  That legislation was brought in because of a jump in rents during the First World War.  That is the point I am making.  If a permanent change is made to the law because of a temporary situation, what the Minister of State has said about people leaving the market is going to come true.  I wish him every luck in making more housing available and I admire what he and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, are doing to get more housing built now.  However, those landlords who may leave the market are not looking two or three years down the line.  Someone who is deciding to quit the market now is looking five or ten years down the line.

The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 24BA:  	&ldquo;<b>24BB</b>. With effect from the date section 10 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 comes into operation and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 24A, orders under  section 24A(5) shall be deemed to have been made in respect of the administrative areas of every housing authority in the State which on that date are not, or are not deemed to be, rent pressure zones; accordingly, each of those areas is deemed to be a rent pressure zone from that date for a period of 3 years.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>I am struck by the contribution of Senator McDowell.  I know he has left the House now but it will be on the record.  There is a point to be made about the future of renting in this country.  Right across this Chamber, there is a desire to ensure it is a sustainable way of life for people because that is the future for many people in this country.  We must not treat renting as a transient existence.  It can be a sustainable, permanent solution for certain persons who will never be able to afford to buy a house.  We are putting forward these amendments to ensure there is fairness for renters on a permanent basis into the future.</p><p>I heard Senator McDowell say that if some of the amendments were temporary measures, they may be justified.  It is important that the tide is turned.  We must not treat tenants as a temporary phenomenon who will only be renting for a few years.  The reality is that renting will be part and parcel of life for young people and older people.  In particular, an increasing number of those facing into retirement are now renting and have no prospect of buying anytime soon.  It is vital that we get the protections for renters right.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 intends for the whole country to be declared a rent pressure zone.  As I understand it, there are two criteria to designate an area as a rent pressure zone.  Those are that there needs to have been an increase in rent of 7% in four of the past six quarters and the rent in a particular area must also be above the national average rent.  I have a fundamental difficulty with the second criterion.  The national average rent is, of course, driven by the main urban centres.  A massive increase in the cost of rent in Leitrim, Longford, Clare or a very rural area in Cork is no less important than a significant increase in the main urban areas.  It is in the context of that criterion that there are, according to survey data collected by Daft.ie and the Residential Tenancies Board, double-digit rent increases in the likes of Leitrim, Kilkenny, Clare, Roscommon and other counties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The question has to be asked as to why the whole country has not been designated a rent pressure zone.  I think it was September 2020 when an area was last added to the list.  There are very serious questions to be asked now as to why no other area has been added.  We want to hear the plans the Government does have to add additional areas.  We believe, based on the evidence that is in front of us, that this rental crisis is not confined to the main urban areas but is happening across the country.  We hear stories from some very rural areas about massive demand for places to rent.  It is a good thing in some ways.  People are leaving the main urban areas and going back to the areas where they grew up because they are able to work from home.  That is a good thing.  The downside is that some people are no longer able to afford living in the city and are being forced to relocate.  Nonetheless, there is rent pressure in areas where previously we would not have expected it.  There is a very strong argument to be made that the whole country needs to be made a rent pressure zone.</p></speech>

They acknowledge that limits on rent inflation need to be imposed across the State.  They recognise that where rent pressure zones are already established, rent increase limits are not being adequately enforced.  They say that while expanding rent pressure zones is a positive suggestion, they want adequate enforcement of rent caps where they are already imposed and adequate scrutiny of the enforcement mechanism.  Senators Ruane and Black will table amendments on Report Stage.  They regret that they could not be here tonight.</p></speech>

Having regard to the constitutionality of protected property rights of landlords, including the right to receive an income from their property, a blanket extension of the rent protection zone rent predictability measure to rental properties across the country could be regarded as an unjust interference with those rights as it places a legislative limit on the rental income without adequate or proportionate justification, that is, the interference is disproportionate to the objective sought to be achieved.  For an area to be designated a rent pressure zone it must satisfy the following criteria:  The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the past six quarters.  The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the relevant average rent comparator under the Acts.  The RTB rent index report provides a summary of data used as the criteria for designating rent pressure zones in respect of all local electoral areas in the country.  The Housing Agency continually monitors the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.  The proposal to deem the entire country as a rent pressure zone is not considered to be warranted or legally justified.  The proposed amendment is highly likely to be subject to a constitutional challenge in the courts and accordingly I will be unable to accept it.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 are consequential technical amendments to refer in section (5)(2) to the new section 5(4) and section 6 of the Bill.</p> <p>Amendment No. 12 to section 5 of the Bill as published provides for tenancies of unlimited duration.  Section 5(3)(a) provides that a landlord with an existing Part 4 tenancy or further Part 4 tenancy may notify his or her tenant using a form to be specified by the RTB of his or her consent to that tenancy continuing in existence for a period of unlimited duration from the date of such notice.  The proposed revised text of paragraph (a) provides greater clarity and where a landlord consents to a tenancy continuing in existence for a period of unlimited duration, that tenancy cannot be terminated by the landlord under section 34(b) and it will not roll into a further Part 4 tenancy as before.  A tenancy of unlimited duration can be terminated by a landlord on one or more of the grounds contained in the table to section 34.  This amendment also clarifies that where a landlord grants his or her consent in writing, the tenancy continues in existence for a period of unlimited duration and section 6 of this Bill shall apply to such a tenancy.  Accordingly, the duration of any tenancy of unlimited duration and the duration of any further Part 4 tenancy that precedes it shall count for the purposes of calculating a termination notice period to be given to a tenant under section 66 of the principal Act.</p> <p>Amendment No. 13 provides for a new subsection (4) into section 5.  The amendment, if passed, will clarify that where there is an existing tenancy in place before the commencement of section 5 and if, at the end of its six-year duration, no valid notice has been served in line within paragraph (a), grounds for termination by a landlord or (b), termination of Part 4 or further Part 4, of section 34, or section 36, termination by a tenant, then that tenancy shall continue in existence for an unlimited duration.  If this amendment is passed, the current section 5(4) will be renumbered to become 5(5).</p> <p>On opposition amendment No. 9, while recognising the absolute genuine intent behind this amendment, I am unable to accept it.  If passed, this amendment would cause all existing tenancies to be of unlimited duration from enactment.  As the Minister outlined on Second Stage, section 5 amends Part 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which pertains to security of tenure, to provide for enhanced tenancy protections on the basis that after six months' duration, a Part 4 tenancy is established for an unlimited duration and not subject to expiry at the end of the six-year term.  Should a landlord exercise his or her right to terminate the tenancy, as currently provided for under section 34(b) of the principal Act, it is legally required that the provision shall apply prospectively in respect of tenancies commencing six or more months after the passing of this Bill.  The intention is to enhance security of tenure for tenants and to simplify the operation of the Act of 2004.</p> <p>In addition, where any existing six-year Part 4 tenancy is renewed, rather than commencing a Part 4 tenancy, it will become a tenancy of unlimited duration.  Existing tenants may also seek the consent of their landlord to have their tenancy treated as a tenancy of unlimited duration.  However, the landlord will not be compelled to grant his or her consent and where consent is not granted, the existing protections of the Act will apply.  The aim is to transition to tenancies of unlimited duration while respecting the landlord's constitutionally protected right under section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021.  Only new tenancies commencing six or more months after the passing of this Bill must be on the basis of an unlimited duration but naturally over time all Part 4 tenancies will be of unlimited duration.  As existing Part 4 or further Part 4 tenancies terminate or expire over time or are renewed, it will involve the creation of a new tenancy of unlimited duration in respect of that dwelling should it remain in the rental sector.  For this reason, I am unable to accept the amendment.  The lead-in of six months is legally required prior to the provision coming into operation.  This measure is required to respect the constitutionally protected property rights of landlords.</p></speech>

While a landlord has a very legitimate right to renovate a dwelling, I have seen many questionable examples of people being made to vacate, effectively being evicted, from a rental property for very minor works.  In that context, we need to raise the bar with regard to the grounds on which families, couples and individuals can be evicted or given notice to vacate a tenancy.  In that respect, the amendment will provide that rather than stating, &quot;in a way which requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose&quot;, the wording will be, &quot;no reasonable measures can be taken to maintain the dwelling fit for human habitation during the refurbishment or renovation&quot;.  Effectively, it will have to be deemed impossible to live in the dwelling while the renovations are being made.</p><p>This is a reasonable amendment, again in the spirit of ensuring there are greater protections for renters.  It will mean it may be in only legitimate cases where there is substantial renovation that tenants may be asked to leave or be evicted from the property.  We seek Senators' support in that regard.</p></speech>

An outright ban on the sale of rental properties as a ground for tenancy termination would deter investment in the sector.  It has been recognised the termination of tenancies for the purposes of the grounds listed in the table in section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021, inclusive, including where a property is to be sold, is a legitimate use of the legal provisions designed to underpin the constitutional property rights of landlords.  Nothing in the Residential Tenancies Act prohibits a landlord from selling a property with the tenant <i>in situ </i>or selling with vacant possession.  The commercial reality is there is generally a lower market value with tenants <i>in situ</i>.  I think the Senator will accept the landlord owns the property.  A total of 70% of landlords own just one property, as I outlined, 86% own just one or two properties and the vast majority operate on a small scale.</p><p>The Residential Tenancies Act 2019 implemented a number of amendments to the termination provisions of sections 34 and 35 of the principal Act of 2004 to make it more difficult to falsely cite or rely on any of the grounds for termination in the table in section 34.  Such invalid citation is now dealt with as improper conduct by a landlord for the purposes of Part 7A of the Residential Tenancies Act, with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, empowered to sanction such conduct.  Where a former tenant provides his or her contact details for such purposes, a landlord is required to offer a former tenant a reletting of the rental dwelling where, for example, a sale does not conclude within nine months of the termination, where the landlord or family member moves out of the rental dwelling within 12 months of the termination or where necessary substantial refurbishment or renovation has concluded.  If the landlord does not offer a relet in such circumstances, he or she will be liable to a sanction of up to &euro;30,000.  The RTB has been resourced to carry out this function.</p><p>Landlords need to be in a position to manage their property to suit their financial needs as their life circumstances change.  Covid-19 will have badly affected some landlords and financial pressures may force a landlord to sell a rental property.  The law should not reduce the sale proceeds to landlords by removing their right to terminate a tenancy.  While it may be the case the termination of a tenancy can lead to homelessness if the tenant is unable to source alternative accommodation, it would not be appropriate to prevent a landlord from making a rental dwelling available for occupation by himself, herself or a family member.</p><p>The proposed amendment to remove the landlord's constitutionally protected right to terminate a tenancy and occupy his or her own property dwelling cannot be accepted.  The Constitution recognises the strong sense of family that exists in Ireland and when it comes to providing a home for a family member in favour of a stranger, I believe an Irish citizen will, innately, come down on the side of blood being thicker than water.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peter Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2457"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2457&amp;amp;pid=PeterBurke&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=11&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to respect the Constitution and it is reasonable to expect that many landlords with one or two properties might need to provide a home for a relative at some stage.  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 significantly strengthened the protections around the grounds of termination of a tenancy, particularly regarding paragraph 5.  Where the landlord intends to substantially refurbish or renovate a rental dwelling in a way that requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose, the notice of termination must contain or be accompanied in writing by a statement specifying the nature of intended works.  In the case where planning permission has to be obtained, a copy of the planning permission is attached, or that planning permission is not required, specifying the name of the contractor, if any, employed to carry out the intended works, and the dates on which the intended works are to be carried out, and the proposed duration of the period in which the works are to be carried out, the landlord is required to offer the tenant a tenancy of a dwelling if the contact details requirement is complied with, and that the dwelling becomes available for reletting by reason of the completion of the works or of refurbishment or renovation.
