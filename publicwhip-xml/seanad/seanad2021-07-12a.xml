    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#A00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to come into the Seanad this morning.  Education is of critical importance to children and young people but education is about more than just schooling, as many perceive it to mean.  Education is a foundation for healthy development throughout one's lifespan.  It means the freedom to think, create, play and imagine.  It is learning about difference and diversity, and recognising the value of the contribution made by each and everybody.</p> <p>For many children, however, school can be difficult.  That is especially true for children with special educational needs and disabilities, for whom education poses all sorts of additional challenges.  On occasion, school can be so difficult for young people who require additional support that a school can struggle to appropriately meet their needs.  In certain instances, this can lead to breakdown in school placements, leaving vulnerable children with additional needs without an educational placement.</p> <p>I want to be clear that I am not singling out our teachers, special needs assistants and learning support teachers for criticism.  I am attempting to highlight the fact that some of our schools do not currently have enough resources to meet the needs of each individual child or young person in Ireland.  We often hear disability rights organisations and activists speak of people being disabled by their environment.  That is also true of children with special educational needs and disability in our educational settings.</p> <p>In 2018, Deputy Thomas Byrne sought data from the Department of Education regarding the number of children with special educational needs and disability who had been subject to the section 29 procedure under the Education Act which allows for a parent or guardian to appeal a school's refusal to enroll a child in an educational placement.  The data demonstrated that children with special educational needs and disability are disproportionately represented within the appeals process.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ultimately, this suggests that children with special educational needs and disabilities are disproportionately refused enrolments in schools and are subsequently expelled from schools in equally disproportionate numbers.  What remains unclear, however, is the precise number of children with special educational needs and disabilities who have suffered a breakdown in their school placement, whether temporary or permanent.  </p><p>Additionally, I am seeking clarity regarding the investigation processes into the breakdown of educational placement for children with special educational needs by the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department or by the National Council for Special Education.  I suspect the Minister of State may say there is a complaints process for schools which any family can use to make any complaint.  This roughly goes that any such complaint can be raised with the teacher, the principal, the board and the Ombudsman.  The Education Welfare Act creates section 29 procedures, etc., for suspensions and expulsions and there is forthcoming legislation in terms of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill.  Complaints procedures for schools give schools too much power.  The schools control the pace of the processes which can take, at times, two full years to work through.  As well as this boards do not have the adequate skills to meet the needs of special educational needs and disabilities students which they consistently demonstrate by allowing reduced timetables to persist and by refusing to open autism classes.  </p><p>Furthermore, when a placement breaks down, the Ombudsman is seriously constrained because if the complaint becomes a legal one, his process has to stop and sometimes the courts will not allow the raising of an issue which the Ombudsman may have addressed.  The biggest problem here is that it allows the child&rsquo;s rights to be severely impacted before the State does anything.  There is no proactive measure to stop discrimination or to uphold the Equal Status Act and the State is behaving negligently as a result.</p><p>Will the Minister of State recognise that it is morally unacceptable that what is on the Statute Book allows the same policy document which deals with a student who is bullying or harassing another student or teacher&rsquo;s code of behaviour to also use the same process to deal with a student with additional needs who is not capable of being responsible for a melt-down which he or she cannot control or who sometimes cannot communicate using words?  Despite the lack of statistics surrounding special educational needs and disabilities' students who were subjected to section 29 of the Education Welfare Act, it is clear that the Act as it stands is not fit for purpose.</p><p>I am calling on the Minister of State to provide us with the figures for the number of special educational needs and disabilities children who have experienced a breakdown in their school placement, either temporary or permanent, and that her Department begin the process of reviewing the Education Welfare Act in order to ensure that those children and families who go through the State system are owed the highest duty of care and are placed at the heart of the Act.  I therefore urge the Minister of State to work compassionately, understandingly and exclusively with special educational needs and disabilities' children and their families to find out what they require in order for their needs to be met.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#B00200"><p>It is my belief that children with special educational needs should receive their education in placements which are appropriate to their needs alongside their peers, wherever possible unless such an approach would be inconsistent with the best interests of the individual child, or other children in the school.  This approach is consistent with the provisions of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act 2004.  My Department's policy, therefore, is to provide for the inclusive education of children with special educational needs in mainstream schools.  The majority of children with special needs attend mainstream education with additional supports.</p> <p>In circumstances where children have more complex special educational needs requirements, then a special school or special class places should be provided.  The policy of the Department, to touch on the question of resources which was mentioned by the Senator, is to continue to prioritise investment in special education.  This year &euro;2 billion is to be spent on special education.  When one is talking about a figure, one needs to be able to demonstrate where that money goes.  This year we have 13,600 special education teachers in the special education system, which is a 40% increase since 2011.  We also have 18,000 special needs assistants, which is a 70% increase since 2011.  Considerable work has also been undertaken this year to plan and provide for specialist places.  We are also opening two new special school and 269 new special classes this year.</p> <p>The National Council Special Education, NCSE, has primary responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide.  It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  The NCSE seeks to ensure that schools in an area can cater for all children who have been identified as having special education needs, including those children the Senator has specifically asked me about in respect of the breakdown of school placements or of those that are at risk.  When the NCSE becomes aware of a school placement which is at risk, it will engage with the family and the school to agree a plan to support the placement.  This plan may involve training and support being provided for the schools from NCSE staff.</p> <p>It may also involves the NCSE engaging with the HSE and with the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in order to establish what other supports or guidance may be provided to a school in order to support that child because the joint approach spoken about by the Senator is very important.  In some circumstances, the NCSE may also arrange for additional supports and resources such as assistive technology, or additional special needs assistance support.  Additional training programmes or guidance may also be provided for the school.</p> <p>It is important also to point out, and I am not saying the Senator is saying this, that transfer between settings should not be considered or categorised as a placement breakdown because often there can be a child in mainstream who is moved to a special class or school and this is not a placement breakdown but it may be simply in the best interests of the child to move to that particular environment.</p> <p>There is also the home tuition grant, which the Senator would also be aware of, which provides 20 hours of home tuition per week as an interim measure.</p> <p>On section 29, it allows for appeals against the decision of a board of management of a school to suspend or permanently exclude a student.  Where a parent feels that a school has unfairly suspended or expelled a child from school, then an appeal mechanism is provided for.  Everything that is possible should be done to ensure that placements for children with special education needs do not break down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#B00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response.  There are parts of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act that have not been commenced but there are also parts that need to be amended.</p> <p>I obviously agree that the transfer from one school to another at the request of the parties does not fall into the idea of a breakdown.  I refer to schools specifically set up for children with special needs who are then expelled because of their actual disability or special need for which they were admitted, for example, where a melt-down is being reframed as violent or as being an assault, when the entire reason they are in that special school and for the existence of that special school is because of those very behavioural issues.  It makes no sense that we have a special school that cannot deal adequately with breakdowns or meltdowns of children.  This is especially the case when it comes to the section 29 piece which relates to a completely different comparison.  </p> <p>I remember when working in the homeless sector a person was presenting with extreme mental health issues.  Having raised these issues in the interview process and admitting to them, the person was excluded from the hostel because they displayed these mental health issues.  I wondered was that not why the homeless services existed there in the first place.</p> <p>I want to make the point strongly that when we reach the point where section 29 has to be used or there has to be an appeal, we should not be allowed to expel children for displaying the actual disability or special need for which they were enrolled in the school in the first place.</p></speech>

I reiterate something which she will be well aware of which is that the communication between schools and the Department of Education, and more particularly the NCSE, will be crucial to ensuring that the child is in the right place.  No expulsion or suspension should be unwarranted.  It is important to say that there is that appeal mechanism available.</p> <p>From the data I have, there was only one expulsion case in 2021, by way of judicial review.  That option is always available for parents to avail of where they need it.  The Department is satisfied that there are enough resources in place to provide that all children are provided with an appropriate education.  It is my job to ensure that is done and that no stone is left unturned in getting children the wraparound supports they require in the various placements they may find themselves in.</p></speech>

Some schools already do modules on road safety during transition year and this has proven very successful.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has designed a very impressive module which is available to schools but, unfortunately, there has been a very low uptake.</p><p>I wish to bring the House's attention to certain aspects of the module which comes under the heading of personal achievement and local and global citizenship.  The unit builds on existing curriculum links in junior cycle civic, social and political education, CSPE, and social, personal and health education, SPHE, through its emphasis on the values and skills that underpin responsible decision-making and in respect for the rights and safety of others.  The unit was designed by teachers and includes a wide range of methodologies and activities.  The programme is fully resourced with a step-by-step set of lesson plans and worksheets.  Each lesson is clearly structured and includes a teacher note, worksheets and class activities.  An interactive DVD also provides support and includes class activities, crash reconstructions and real-life stories.  The unit also includes project work and input from agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the emergency services and those with responsibility for the national car test, NCT, which adds greatly to the effectiveness of the programme.  It delivers an important message that all students need to hear.</p><p>The transition unit is supported by digital resources including access to international websites on road safety issues and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, website.  The module develops and reinforces research, field work and project skills acquired at junior cycle, Streetwise road safety links, with the promotion of positive attitudes and behaviours associated with CSPE and SPHE, and links with ICT for research and project presentation.  It links with the leaving certificate physics motion and English media reporting of news and the role of advertising in promoting road safety.  The module has an introduction to road safety, what it means to the trainee, whose business is road safety.  It deals with pedestrians and cyclists.  It goes into safety precautions, seat belt wearing, child restraints, loose objects in cars and air bags.  It is quite a comprehensive module and its aims are to enable students to explore their own attitudes and behaviour in respect of road safety, promote visual literacy, enable students explore their own attitudes and behaviour in the context of road safety and increase road safety awareness among the wider school community.  It also seeks to identify the key causes of road accidents in Ireland explain the factors that contribute to road safety, identify the role of different stakeholders who have a remit for road safety, work collaboratively towards an agreed set of goals through a group project, practice basic first aid skills and so on.  Furthermore, it helps student successfully complete the driver theory test which is very important and something we are having difficulties with now.  This is a very important subject that should be mainstreamed in second-level schools and other areas of education, adult and otherwise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#C00200"><p>I wish to confirm that there are curriculum supports educating young people about road safety from a young age.  The Garda schools programme, at both primary and post-primary level includes modules on road safety and on cycle safety.  The aim of this programme is to engage with young people in order to enhance their appreciation of the need to be caring, law-abiding citizens and to increase awareness of their personal safety . The programme also seeks to improve awareness of road safety and to reduce injuries and fatalities.  My Department has engaged with colleagues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that this programme contains strong links to the curriculum at primary and post primary level.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned SPHE at primary level, which offers particular opportunities, in an age-appropriate manner, to foster the personal development, health and well-being of individual children.  One of the three strands within SPHE is "Myself" which includes units on safety and protection.  Through the SPHE curriculum children learn to identify situations and places that may threaten personal safety, identify people who are responsible for safety in the community and learn and practice safety strategies for crossing the road, using the bus or being a pedestrian, develop and practice strategies for keeping safe when travelling, such as being familiar with the rules for travelling in car or bus or on a bicycle.</p> <p>The NCCA is in the process of reviewing and redeveloping the primary school curriculum, including SPHE and well-being.  Phase 1 of consultation on the draft framework closed in December 2020, with phase 2, focusing on learners, teachers, school leaders and parents, due take place in September.</p> <p>At junior cycle, SPHE has a specific personal safety strand  which provides a mechanism through which road safety issues can be best dealt with in an age-appropriate way.  At transition year, which is currently taken by 70% of students, there is an optional road safety programme which has been developed by the RSA in collaboration with the Department, the NCCA and the development service for teachers.</p> <p>While there are no plans to introduce mandatory driver education classes at post-primary level, it is important to point out that basic tuition to lay a foundation in driver education features on many school curricula already.  The optional RSA programme for transition year is available in 24-hour or 45-hour units and features inputs from various agencies, which the Senator mentioned, such as the ambulance service, the fire service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as providing for visiting speakers, trips out of school, projects and case studies.  It also introduction to road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and motorists, and covers such issues as seat belts and airbags, driver fatigue, drink- and drug-driving, enforcement, basic first aid at road crashes, emergency services and rehabilitation.  The programme is also supported by digital resources, which the Senator also mentioned, including DVD support and access to international websites that deal with road safety.  Relevant driver theory test learning is included at the end of each module.  The programme does not include driving lessons.  The latter would probably not be appropriate for young people that age.</p></speech>

While I appreciate that driver theory testing is the responsibility of the RSA, there is a role for the Department and for second level schools in preparing young people for the driver theory test.  I would go further and say that secondary schools should be designated centres to undertake the theory test under the supervision of the RSA.  If that was in operation in our schools we would not have tens of thousands of mainly young people waiting to do a theory test before they can sit one of their 12 driving lessons.  It would be beneficial to make road safety a compulsory subject at second level.</p></speech>

She is welcome to the House and I am delighted that she has taken the time to speak to us.</p> <p>St. Mary's Boys' National School is a national school on Grotto Avenue in Booterstown.  There are about 300 boys in the school and it has demonstrated extraordinary inclusivity in regard to special educational needs, particularly autism.  While many schools in the area cannot accommodate children with autism, St. Mary's has gone to great lengths - I pay tribute to Mr. Noel Scully and his team at the school - to include and accommodate those students and to allow them to continue to attend in an inclusive and full way that is not possible in other schools.  Unfortunately, however, there is great demand in the area for autism services and autism inclusion facilities.  Autism affects boys to a much greater extent than girls, by a factor of four.  It is understandable, therefore, that there is much greater demand than there might be in a girls' school or even in a mixed school.  There is significant demand and the Minister of State is aware of that too.</p> <p>What is significant about the project is that there is very strong support in both the school and wider community and in the local parish for a solution that will facilitate the autism services unit, ASU, and there is a ready-made solution that will work.  Located immediately next to St. Mary's Boys' National School is the Booterstown parish hall, at the end of Grotto Avenue where the school is located, facing Rock Road with a side entrance that the students have to pass on their way to and from school.  It is an adjacent building owned by the Catholic parish of Booterstown.  Fr. Gerry Kane has been in touch with the school and is supportive of this and the building is available.  We - the students, parents and community - want the Department to purchase that building and to provide it to St. Mary's Boys' National School as a facility and location for an ASU for those who need it.  There is room in that building to meet the existing demand.</p> <p>The beauty of this project is that everybody is for it, as I think the Minister of State is too.  The Department sees the reasonable nature of what has been proposed.  It is a building right next to the school that is available and I understand the parish is willing to part with it to facilitate the ASU for St. Mary's Boys' National School.  The question is whether we can do this in short order.  The building is available now and will not interfere with, for example, adjacent community facilities there.  With the goodwill of the school community, the local community and, one hopes, the Department, there is a ready-made solution to deal with this issue, which exists throughout the area.  I do not believe there is an ASU anywhere in the area from Booterstown to Leopardstown.  There is one in Monkstown but there is a serious dearth of facilities for young boys, in particular, in this area.  St. Mary's Boys' National School has come forward with a ready-made solution that will be easy to effect.  All it requires is a budgetary box-ticking from the Department.  I hope that when the Minister of State responds, she will be able to tell us that progress is being made.  Parents are frustrated that the matter has been in progress for a long time and want to know when this can happen.  It is ready made and requires just a budgetary allocation from the Department to make it happen and create a solution, for both the Department and the school community in Booterstown.</p></speech>

One step I want to take in my position as the first Minister of State with responsibility for special education is to ensure we provide special class places and special school places for all children with additional needs, whether in south Dublin, south Cork or wherever it is in the country.  That is something I am determined to do.  To that end, in the budget last year, I secured &euro;2 billion for special education for that very purpose, among other needs, for special education teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and other matters.</p><p>As the Senator will be acutely aware, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, works, through its special educational needs organisers, SENOs, very closely with schools and parents to ensure we can provide all these class places.  We use a five-year forecasting model, which has recently been enhanced, to determine the capacity of those schools and places throughout the country.  We are aware that issues have arisen in recent years regarding a shortage of suitable school places in certain pockets of the country, driven primarily by the significant increase in the number of children with additional needs and in demand.  I heard what the Senator said about boys in the context of autism, but there has also been exponential growth in the incidence of girls with autism too, and there are a number of reasons for that.  Perhaps the enhanced method of diagnosis has resulted in that.  It is important there is suitable school accommodation for all children and, through that more enhanced national and local-level planning, it is my objective that all special education places can come on stream in a timely manner.</p><p>Turning specifically to St. Mary's Boys' National School in Booterstown, I note that a Zoom meeting will be held on the matter tomorrow evening.  The Department and the NCSE are grateful to schools that continue to respond positively in terms of trying to provide that education but we accept that there are circumstances in which there simply is not sufficient capacity, particularly in urban areas where there is high density and schools simply do not have room.  I can confirm the Department has been in contact with the parish in regard to the potential acquisition of the Booterstown parish hall and the Senator and I are <i>ad idem</i>on that.  It is something I very much agree with.  Evaluation of the hall has been received and assessed by Department officials and the Department is negotiating with the owners for the potential acquisition of the site.  The Senator will appreciate that due to commercial sensitivities, it is not possible to provide further information at this time.  Nevertheless, the acquisition is a priority for the Department and my officials will keep the patron informed of any key developments regarding the acquisition.  The site's acquisition is, obviously, complex and subject to the success of the negotiation and the conveyancing processes, and I would not like to say anything that would in any way jeopardise the outcome of that.  In those circumstances, it is not possible to give a definitive timeframe but I am hopeful there will be a speedy conclusion and resolution.  It is very important for the parents and the children with additional needs that we expedite this.</p></speech>

The site acquisition must be thoroughly interrogated by the Department.</p> <p>I appreciate the Senator&rsquo;s kind comments about my work.  We have had a 286% increase in special class places over the past decade and there are 2,118 special classes this year, providing places to 12,700 children with additional needs.  I would like to see this unit up and running at St. Mary&rsquo;s Boys National School before September, but we have to let the negotiations take place and the Department to acquire the site and work with the school as closely as possible.

Since the opening of phase 1 in 2010 by the then Minister for Transport, Mr. Noel Dempsey, the completion of the line from Dunboyne to Navan has fallen off the agenda, including the national development plan, NDP.  However, there is reason to have great optimism at this very moment because we have the coming together of the review of the NDP and, critically, the review by the National Transport Authority, NTA, of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  Key to the NTA review is the fact that the Navan element was analysed on an evidence basis.  This is important if it is to become part of the NDP.  I am hopeful that, when presented to the Minister, the NTA's review of its many projects will be favourable and that we will then see him ensuring that this project is included in the plan, but time is key because the two reviews are beginning to align at this very moment.</p> <p>We need a firm financial commitment towards the expediting of this infrastructure.  When I raised this issue with the Minister in the Chamber, he spoke of the need for positive statements from Meath County Council as the lead planning authority.  From a strategic planning point of view, the council's work to demonstrate the population growth in the urban centre of Navan and along the designated route has been exemplary.  It has been the essence of good planning in terms of creating centralised growth centres with good public transport hubs to provide people with easy access to their work or education in Dublin city centre.</p> <p>I am sure the Minister of State will refer to the Department's need to decarbonise and the sustainable mobility of people.  In July 2017, its economic and financial evaluation unit published a report that estimated the cost of aggravated congestion across Ireland's transport system and how it would grow without intervention in the coming decades.  Its analysis suggested that the cost of time lost due to aggravated congestion in the base year of 2012 was nearly &euro;500 million and predicted an increase to &euro;2 billion by 2033.  That is happening in County Meath right now.  Ours is the only county in the greater Dublin area without rail connectivity to its capital town.  What has been missing over the past decade has been the political will to make this happen.</p> <p>When the report lands on the Minister's desk, I am confident that the scoring matrix used by the NTA that would be required to recommend the line to Navan will stack up because of the critical analysis of population growth undertaken by Meath County Council.  However, this Commencement matter is not just about the analytics; it is also about the human side.  Significant research was done through interviewing people.  Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes was engaged to conduct field research on more than 3,000 citizens and a further online poll of 8,000 citizens.  Their testimonies about the detrimental effects on their family lives were harrowing.</p> <p>I hope that the Minister of State will make a positive statement about ensuring this line is be included in the NDP review.</p></speech>

Under the review of the NDP, the Department is examining its investment plans in light of the programme for Government.  The plan is based around outcomes.  The Senator is correct, in that I will refer to the sustainable mobility of 1 million people.  That is what we are discussing in the national development plan as opposed to specific projects.  The Department's submission to the review examines the plan at a policy level and identifies revised strategic priorities instead of entering into a discussion of particular projects.  However, I will discuss Navan in a moment.  A draft national investment framework for transport in Ireland will underpin the Department's submission.  It has four priorities: decarbonisation; protection and renewal; enhanced regional accessibility; and the sustainable mobility of people and goods in urban areas.</p> <p>The issue of a rail connection to Navan is being re-examined as part of the NTA's review of the 20-year transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The NTA is required to review and update the strategy every six years.  That review is well under way.  Initial public consultation has taken place and I am sure the Senator made a submission to it.  The NTA has engaged external expertise to re-examine the feasibility of a Navan rail line.  This assessment will be inputted into the overall review.  The next step is a second round of public consultation on the draft revised strategy, which is expected to take place in the autumn.  The Senator will be able to make a submission at that point as well.</p> <p>I acknowledge what he said about an evidence-based scenario, a score-based metric and the fact that Navan is the only area without rail connectivity.  I will pass his remarks on to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton.  The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 requires the preparation of a transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The current strategy was published in 2016 and extends to 2035.  The Act requires the strategy to be reviewed every six years.  In line with this statutory framework, the NTA's transport strategy for the greater Dublin area is under review.  The first stage of the consultation on the initial issues paper ended in January.  In late 2020, the NTA appointed technical consultants to develop an assessment study incorporating a comprehensive analysis of the business case for a potential extension of the existing rail line from the M3 parkway close to Dunboyne to Navan.  The outcome of the assessment is intended to inform an update of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned Meath County Council.  I understand the NTA is working closely with the council on undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the benefits of the project, encapsulating economic, environmental and societal benefits.  A multi-criterion analysis of options in accordance with a common appraisal framework for transport projects and programmes is also due to commence shortly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->An appraisal framework for transport projects and programmes is also due to commence shortly.

It is disrespectful to me, this House, the issue and the people of Meath.</p> <p>I was specific in my Commencement matter.  It related to something that is happening this week.  The Minister of State said that no doubt I contributed to the public consultation.  I did and I am blue in the face contributing to public consultations.

I thank him for his work to date.</p> <blockquote> 	When I spoke at Tiglin, I suggested that nobody can accept that the tokenistic &lsquo;small print&rsquo; warnings and invitations to be &lsquo;responsible&rsquo; are in any way in proportion to the possible damage being inflicted by the lure of sports gambling ads.  There are serious questions, ones that are surely in the public interest to have answered, as to how such a high degree of saturation of the media landscape by sports betting advertisements has arisen, when the evidence of the damage being inflicted is so obvious and should be a concern to us all. </blockquote> <p>Those are the words of our President.  It is the second time in the past two weeks he has raised what he describes as the dangerous gambling advertisements which, he has said, are causing damage to families and individuals.</p><p>Our President is once again speaking for so many of us in this country.  Since introducing into the Seanad the Labour Party Gambling (Prohibition of Advertising) Bill 2021 and beginning a conversation about the number of gambling ads, I have been inundated with calls and emails from people all over the country who want to talk about their experiences or simply want to be able to watch their favourite sport without having to wade through advertisement after advertisement encouraging them to gamble.  That is what is happening, as I am sure the Minister of State has noticed.  In a recent online survey we carried out, 80% of respondents stated they have noticed an increase in gambling ads throughout their media.</p><p>Next Thursday, 5 July, will be the eighth anniversary of the Gambling Control Bill 2013.  I note from recent press releases and the Minister of State's words when he last visited this House that he intends bringing a gambling control Bill through the Oireachtas by the end of the year.  I respectfully state on behalf of so many that we cannot wait that long to ban gambling advertisements.</p><p>Estimates are that Ireland spends &euro;9.8 billion per year, marking it as out as the world's seventh biggest spender on gambling per head.  The industry needs urgent regulation due to the large increases in those reporting gambling addiction problems and those suffering in silence, afraid to reach out for help or, more worryingly, thinking they can gamble their way out of their problems.  One of the most worrying results in the Labour Party survey was that almost 65% said they were more inclined to gamble after seeing these ads.  That figure will please the gambling companies but should set off alarm bells for our public health system.  From the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland to gambling addiction support advocates such as Oisin McConville, Niall McNamee and Davy Glennon and now our President, there has been a consistent recent message: we must get rid of the number of gambling ads in this country.  A survey carried out by <i>thejournal.ie</i>over the weekend had more than 88% of respondents supporting a ban on gambling ads on TV.  Action must be taken.</p><p>I have spoken to many citizens who have lost so much as a result of gambling from loving partnerships to family homes to jobs.  It is important to remind ourselves that those most affected by the tsunami of gambling ads are real people who initially gamble for fun or take up one of the many offers from gambling companies to open a new account and, unfortunately, cannot control their habit.  This highly addictive behaviour takes over and, in many cases, ruins their lives.  We need to do more for the estimated 40,000 people in this country who have developed a gambling addiction and for those who may add to that figure because of the continuous and unrelenting advertising they face daily.</p><p>What disturbs me most is that there is no watershed on gambling in this country.  Our children and young adults are being exposed to a highly addictive behaviour.  We have many stories of children as young as six, especially when they were being homeschooled, asking parents what these ads were about.  The normalisation of sporting gambling continues apace by the marketing departments of the gambling companies and we must break that association.  We need to enact the Gambling (Prohibition of Advertising) Bill 2021.  We have to stop the bombardment of gambling advertisements.  The time for talking has long passed.  We have had eight years of that.</p></speech>

I have had the pleasure of dealing with her in here over the past year on justice issues.  She is a huge loss to the Seanad given her forensic analysis of justice legislation and ability to improve the legislation we have introduced.  I look forward to engaging with her in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>I thank Senator Wall for raising this important issue.  He has made this a hugely important matter for himself since he came into the Seanad and is committed to seeking gambling reform. </p> <p>The programme for Government gives a clear commitment to comprehensively reform the licensing and regulation of gambling activities. That reform will establish a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being.  It is important to understand that this regulator will not only regulate the industry in general terms, but will have a public health remit as the primary focus in every decision or recommendation he or she makes.  </p> <p>When I was appointed last September, I had listened to proposals and promises around reforming gambling for 20 years.  As far back as 2007, the appointment of a gambling regulator was an issue in the general election.  It has not happened.  I set out last September clear timelines and milestones to get this done comprehensively and we are on schedule for that.  We will publish a new scheme in September and have a CEO-designate, in effect a regulator, appointed by the end of this year.  There is a clear path towards the regulator being operational in early 2023. </p> <p>The legislation will empower the independent gambling regulator to develop regulations, codes of conduct and codes of practice on various issues relating to gambling, including advertising.  I expect a particular focus from the regulator on appropriate standards for advertising and customer protection by gambling operators.  These codes will be part of a range of conditions that the operators will need to adhere to and to enjoy the benefits of.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The regulator will have the power to impose fines where codes of conducts and regulations are not being complied with and to remove a licence or block the various sites if in breach of the regulations and the guidelines.  When appointed, the regular will be powerful and will be backed up with supports of comprehensive legislation.  </p><p>As the Senator will be aware, under existing law, licensed gambling operators are entitled to advertise their products and currently advertising does not come with the remit of the Department of Justice but the intention is to bring gambling advertising under the remit of the Department and the regulator.  Currently, it comes under the remit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  The general regulation of advertising in the media is, as I say, currently a matter for the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland under the remit of the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications.  There are no specific statutory requirements in regard to gambling activities, but all advertisements must meet the basic requirements of being truthful and to not mislead any potential customer.  How the new gambling operator might operate specific advertising regulations for the gambling industry will be informed by the report of the interdepartmental working group on the future of licensing and regulation of gambling approved by the Government on 20 March 2019.  The report noted that there are various issues involved in developing an effective approach to advertising on gambling products.  There are challenges around banning advertising on gambling.  A ban is certainly on the table but given much of the horse racing and other sports televised during daytime or at the weekend comes from other countries, finding a way to effectively ban advertising will be challenging.  I am conscious of what the UK is doing in terms of a review, including in regard to sports sponsorship.  </p><p>In developing the new legislation, my objective is to provide enhanced consumer protection for players and to limit harmful effects on young people and those susceptible to addiction.  We must ensure that gambling will be safe, fair and crime-free.  The legislation will be comprehensive.  The regulator will be powerful and advertising will be a central plank in all of that work.</p></speech>

The Labour Party is very proud of her.  I have no doubt that she will be a loss to the Seanad but a great asset in the D&aacute;il when she takes up her seat.</p><p>On gambling, I welcome that the Minister of State said the gambling regulator will have a public health remit because it is public health that is most affected by the outcomes of gambling.  I know he is very aware of that.  We need to look at what is happening in the public health area.  The Minister of State mentioned timelines.  I ask him to confirm in his response that a regulator will be in place by the end of the year.  It is important there is someone <i>in situ</i>.  Previous reports mentioned 2022 and 2023.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm when the regulator will be place.</p><p>I agree there will be challenges but we need to meet them face-on.  The saturation and tokenistic approaches of gambling companies need to end.  I am sure the Minister of State is as passionate about that as I am.  We have to be passionate for those affected most.</p></speech>

The CEO-designate will be the gambling regulator and he or she will be appointed by the end of this year.  The new scheme will be published in September.  The regulator is expected to have up to 100 employees to support him or her and to implement the legislation.  The legislation is making its way through the Houses.  We want the regulator in place so that the necessary regulations to underpin that legislation can be developed.  Following enactment of the legislation, the regulator will be up and running, fully staffed and with all the powers he or she feels are necessary.  The regulations can be signed off within a matter of weeks such that we will not find ourselves in the situation whereby the legislation is enacted but we are waiting a number of years for regulations.  The public health remit of the gambling regulator is critical.  It will inform every decision to be made by the regulator.  There will be a social fund as well.  The gambling industry that is benefiting currently from certain practices from which people are suffering will now pay into a social fund that will pay for education, research and, critically, treatment.  Those who are benefitting will pay as well for the supports that are necessary.</p></speech>

The INMO figures for this morning show that there are 24 patients on trolleys in the hospital.  This day last week, there were 30 patients on trolleys.  I am sure the Minister of State will agree that as I have stated previously even one patient on a trolley in an emergency department for a significant period is one too many.  I acknowledge and commend the front-line staff who are working in these difficult circumstances in overcrowded emergency departments, particularly in UHG</p> <p>Enabling works on construction of a temporary extension to the emergency department at the hospital have commenced and are due to be completed in early 2022.  This will provide additional accommodation, including segregated waiting and treatment areas, isolation rooms, additional resuscitation spaces and support accommodation to take account of new requirements to treat Covid-19 patients.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify if a timeline has been set in respect of the lodgment of a planning application for the new emergency department and maternity and paediatric facilities at UHG.  Has Saolta given a timeline for this project?  Why are we still waiting?  Is the project being stalled purposely or is genuine progress being made?  Is the design 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99% complete?  Is Saolta ready to sign-off on this project?  Is it awaiting national estates to give it the go ahead?  Is it waiting for Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approval?</p> <p>I have been through the history of this project previously.  As far back as 2015, the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, said that the emergency department at UHG was not fit for purpose.  We have had ministerial visits to Galway, where we have been told that planning permission would be lodged prior to Christmas 2018.  The specifications may have changed to a degree since then in the fit-out of the building, but I do not see the rationale for the planning permission not having been lodged.  Where is the design at?  Is it nearly complete and ready to go?  What is the stumbling block?  If I raise this issue with the Minister of State again in September, will progress have been made?  Will the planning permission be lodged before the end of this year?  Is there any certainty or a definitive timeline on this hugely important project for an emergency department and maternity and paediatric facilities for UHG?</p> <p>We have heard all the talk of major plans elsewhere in Galway in Merlin Park yet a project that has stood up to the options appraisal carried out by Saolta with the consent of the Department has indicated that the existing site at UHG is the preferred site for an emergency department.  This has been in every national plan for God knows how many years, yet no planning permission has yet been lodged.  I have said previously, and I reiterate today, nothing can be built without valid planning permission and valid planning permission cannot be obtained without first lodging an application.  I hope the Minister of State can shed some light on where this project is at.</p></speech>

This project is part of a larger development incorporating maternity and paediatric services and is included in the HSE capital programme for 2021.</p> <p>Approval has been granted to complete a temporary extension to the emergency department to provide additional accommodation, in the first instance related to Covid requirements.  The temporary ED project and associated works will also serve as an enabling works projects for the proposed permanent emergency department as it will help to free up the site required for the proposed new block.  As rightly stated by the Senator, the accommodation includes segregated waiting and treatment areas, isolation rooms, additional resuscitation spaces, additional support accommodation to take account of new requirements to treat Covid-19 patients and improved infection control and prevention requirements for emergency departments.  An external works in support of this temporary accommodation includes enabling works by way of roads and car parks reconfiguration, utilities and drainage diversions all to the east of the main block of UHG.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Frankie Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The temporary emergency department extension building will be a single storey with a rooftop plant room and will be connected to the main hospital block at the existing emergency department entrance.  Site works have been under way for some time and it is expected the project will be completed by quarter 2 of 2022.</p><p>The main emergency department women's and children's development at University Hospital Galway is a complex project and is in the early stages of design progression.  The project is of significant scale and must progress through the stages outlined in the public spending code.  The full accommodation scope for the entire development has now been agreed following an internal HSE review and it is now proposed to progress the full block as one single project.  The proposed project will accommodate a new permanent emergency department, including clinical areas, ancillary support services and acute surgical and medical assessment units.  It will also accommodate the labour and delivery unit, operating theatres, a maternity day assessment unit and foetal assessment unit.  Other proposed facilities will include a neonatal unit, ante-natal and post-natal inpatient departments, a paediatric day ward and an inpatient ward.</p><p>The Senator asked for a definitive timeline on this project but no date has been set yet for the planning application for the main building, as the project is still proceeding through the stages of the public spending code.  There are several enabling works projects to be completed on site before the main building can go ahead.  The design team has had preplanning meetings with the local authority on various elements of enabling works.  Site enabling works will be ongoing in preparation for the main emergency department-women and children's block development, including further road and services realignment.  All capital development proposals must progress through a number of approval stages in line with the public spending code.  The delivery of capital projects is a dynamic process and is subject to the successful completion of the various approval stages, which can impact on the timeline for delivery.   The Senator asked if the design was 70%, 80% or 90% complete but I am not in a position to state that. </p></speech>

It is depressing to see written down again that the project is in the early stages of design progression, considering we were told the planning application would be lodged before Christmas 2018, then it was to be February 2019, then May 2019 and then 2019.  It is now July 2021 and the project is not progressing and there is no indication of when it will be progressing.  I could not be confident from the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply that a planning application would be ready this year.  I hope I am proven wrong.  I will certainly keep the pressure on the Minister of State and I ask him to keep pressure on his line Minister.  This is an extremely important project.  There is commitment to it but we need to get the planning application lodged, construction started and the project built.</p></speech>

It is no harm to keep the pressure on and I thank him for doing that.  As he will be aware, the project, which is part of a larger development incorporating the maternity and paediatric services, is included in the HSE capital plan for 2021.  I will convey the Senator's frustration and concern to the Minister.  Unfortunately, there is no date yet set for the planning application for the main building.

I wish to address the failure of the Government to address the pay restoration issue for employees in health and social care sector who are employed by community and voluntary organisations.  What has transpired during the past two years represents a blatant disregard for fairness and equality of treatment.  To illustrate my point I will use an example of Clarecare, a professional social enterprise with charitable status providing a range of services to individuals and families in County Clare for the past 50 years.  It has a workforce of approximately 420.  Its services include family support services, elderly care services, counselling and addiction therapy in a residential facility.  It has a wonderful ethos and staff who are truly amazing.  They provide an enormous service to citizens across the county. They are highly treasured and really professional.  They do an enormously good job.</p> <p>Until 2014, the HSE provided all the funding to Clarecare, particularly for funding towards family support services as well as the elderly care services under what is known as a section 39 agreement.  In April 2010 during the economic crash, the HSE reduced funding to Clarecare and other organisations for salaries to the tune of 4%.  That had to be passed on by Clarecare to all staff.  When Tusla was established in 2014 the funding of the family support services provided to Clarecare was transferred from the HSE to Tusla and since then that funding has been provided to the Clarecare under what is known as a section 56 service level agreement.    </p> <p>In January of this year, the HSE began pay restoration to those contracted under a section 39 agreement.  However, as I understand it, no such restoration has been promised or provided to those under a section 56 agreement.  In practical terms, we have a team of workers who are contracted by the State through Clarecare to provide health and social care services in County Clare.  A pay cut was enforced on all of them in 2010.  Pay restoration was recommenced in January of this year but only some of the workers qualify.  That begs the obvious question: why?  They have been told if the HSE is providing the funding they will get their pay restoration but for those who were funded by the HSE when the pay cuts were introduced in 2010 and since 2014 have been funded by Tusla, it is tough luck, they do not get restoration.  That does not seem fair to me and it certainly is not seen as fair by the workers on the ground.  Neither is seen as fair by the people who they work with, assist and help on a daily basis.  In truth, as far as all those people are concerned, they are doing the same work they did when their funding came through the HSE stream, albeit their funding is now coming through a different route.  They find it hard to understand why they are not getting pay restoration.  The reality is it is State and taxpayer-funded.  The fact that it is a section 39 or a section 56 service level agreement should not matter to the people on the ground.</p> <p>I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s views on this matter.  It is blatant discrimination for a group of people who were treated in a fair and equitable way up to a certain point to now discover because their funding was transferred to a different Department they do not qualify for pay restoration of pay in terms of the pay cut they took in unison with everybody else at the time.  I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s deliberations on that.</p></speech>

As he said, section 39 of the Health Act 2004 relates to funding of bodies by the HSE and section 56 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 relates to funding by Tusla.  When the Senator raised this issue with the Minister for Health, he acknowledged it would be inappropriate for him to comment in respect of the operation of section 56 as matters funded under it relate to Tusla and fall within the remit of my Department.</p> <p>As Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I highly value the work undertaken by the community and voluntary sector which provide services funded by Tusla under section 56 of the 2013 Act.  I am very conscious and appreciative of the impact these organisations and their staff have on improving outcomes for children, young people and families all over Ireland.</p> <p>The Minister for Health has advised me that under section 39 of the Health Act 2004, the HSE provides financial assistance to organisations by means of a grant.  Section 39 legally underpins the provision of services similar or supplementary to a service the HSE may provide.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I understand that pay restoration was secured under a Workplace Relations Commission agreement between the Department of Health and the HSE on the one hand, and the unions representing the workers of section 39 organisations on the other.  The section 39 organisations to which the agreement applied included those with service arrangements in place in 2013 which were still in place in 2019 and that received in excess of an agreed, specified amount from the HSE, which I understand was &euro;250,000 per year.  This was achieved through an agreed process on a phased basis.</p><p>Since the establishment of Tusla in 2014, the agency has funded many organisations, mostly in the community and voluntary sector, to deliver services on its behalf under sections 56 to 59 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  These commissioned services fulfil Tusla's statutory responsibilities and deliver on the agency's strategic objectives.  Such organisations are important partners in the work of the agency and I value the unique position many of them are in that enable them to deliver services which can respond quickly to the needs of children and families in their local communities.  I acknowledge that some of these organisations were funded by the HSE under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 prior to the establishment of Tusla in 2014.  However, section 56(14) of the Act is clear that "an arrangement under this section shall not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the Agency on the other".   Therefore, these organisations operate independently of Tusla and are responsible for the recruitment of their employees and for the terms and conditions under which they are employed.  Tusla is not the employer of the staff of such organisations and the remuneration of these staff is a matter for their own employers.</p><p>While Tusla is not the employer of the staff in organisations funded by section 56, the agency has raised the issue of the sustainability of the vital services provided by these organisations with me in the last year.  They are a part of the essential infrastructure of services and supports we have in place for children and their families.  At my most recent quarterly meeting with the board of Tusla, the chairman and I spoke about our intention to pursue additional resources for the sector as part of the Estimates process in 2022.   I assure the Senator, therefore, that I am committed to working with my colleagues in Government, and especially the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, Tusla and other service delivery partners to address the sustainability of these services and ensure that we meet the needs of children, young people and their families across Ireland.  I will be giving this issue my full consideration in the upcoming Estimates process.</p></speech>

I am conscious that departmental speak has always surrounded section 39 workers.  I refer to their employment being the responsibility of the local voluntary organisations and, as such, no relationship existing between the State agency and the local organisations other than the provision of funding.  However, the reality back in 2010 was that the State required these organisations to cut salaries by 4% by reducing the funding provided.  It is all well documented.  The State knows full well what the different grades and rates of pay are and funding is provided <i>pro rata</i>in that regard, on the basis of whole-time equivalents, etc.</p><p>Notwithstanding the lack of a direct contractual arrangement, therefore, it is important that there is a recognition that, in essence, the State is funding these individuals.  It should not matter whether there is a section 39 or a section 56 service level agreement in place.  These people are owed that money.  If we are to stand for anything in this House and across the public service, it must be based on fairness.  The situation as it is now in this regard is not fair, cannot be justified and must be addressed.  In real terms, it must be addressed in this round of budgeting.  Like the Minister, I will also take up this issue with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that, in so far as it is possible, we right the wrong perpetrated in respect of these people.</p></speech>

They provide vital services to children, to families and to young people.  I share Senator Dooley's concerns about the sustainability of those organisations and that is why this year I asked Tusla to examine what additional resources it could provide for these organisations on a once-off basis.  As the Senator is probably aware, Tusla was able to provide an additional &euro;7 million in funding last month for the section 56 organisations.  A once-off 5% increase in funding was provided to these organisations, which amounted to &euro;6.2 million.  Additional funding, beyond that 5%, was given to certain organisations where there were particular sustainability issues.  We were also able to provide an additional &euro;4.7 million in the budget to the domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services around the country.</p> <p>My firm commitment is to continue to strengthen the infrastructure in place to support the protection, welfare and well-being of children, families and the wider community.  We will work closely with Tusla and colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that the agency and the services it funds receive adequate levels of funding in the year to come.  I will also be meeting with Clarecare in the next two weeks about a separate issue, but I am sure that will give me the opportunity to perhaps discuss this issue and to recognise the wider work of that organisation, as the Senator stated.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the enormous success of the vaccination programme to date.  We are jabbing more arms in Ireland now for the size of our population than anywhere else in the world.  Everybody involved in that operation deserves our thanks and congratulations on that achievement.</p> <p>The Minister of State will be aware that the European Medicines Agency has approved four vaccines.  However, I am raising the question of Irish citizens outside the European Union who may have received a non-EMA-approved vaccine.  This includes people who may have received the Sinovac or Sinopharm vaccines, as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine developed in India.  This is particularly a problem for Irish citizens working, generally as teachers, engineers or other professionals, in the Middle East and other parts of the world.  Those people&rsquo;s employers arranged for them to get these vaccines very early during the global vaccination process and this situation now represents a difficulty for those people in returning home because Ireland only recognises the EMA-approved vaccines.</p> <p>This situation will also present a challenge to the roll-out of the digital Covid-19 certificates.  The EU is operating on the basis that only vaccines that have been approved by the EMA can be used for certificates.  It is up to each of the individual countries in the EU or the European Economic Area, EEA, however, to determine who may enter each respective state.  The difficulty which arises then is a discrepancy between the criteria in different European countries.  Spain, for example, will accept all EMA-approved vaccines and those approved by the World Health Organization to meet the criteria for entry, which gives a total of eight vaccines overall.  Greece and Estonia, then, will accept the vaccines which are recognised in the country of departure.  Therefore, if somebody is leaving Dubai to travel to Greece, for instance, and he or she has been vaccinated with a vaccine recognised in Dubai, the Greek authorities will accept that as meeting their requirements for entry.  In Iceland, the authorities will allow entry to someone who has been vaccinated with AstraZeneca in South Korea, as well as with the Sinovac vaccine.  A similar situation exists in Cyprus and Hungary, because those countries have also administered other vaccines.  In Slovenia, meanwhile, people will be permitted to enter once 21 days have elapsed, regardless of the vaccine received.  </p> <p>Across Europe, then, there is a divergence in the approaches which will be taken.  Our concern regarding this matter is obviously for those Irish citizens seeking to return home, especially if they have spent much of the time during the Covid-19 pandemic away from Ireland but have now received a non-EMA-approved vaccine.  We need clarity regarding what is going to happen concerning this situation, depending on how long it may take for the EMA to recognise those other vaccines.  I also raise this matter in the context of a concern regarding international students coming to Ireland in the autumn.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a crucial issue for our higher education institutions and it is welcome that we will see on-campus activity resume in the autumn.

Public health requirements have been put in place for travellers arriving to Ireland from overseas in order to protect against the introduction of new cases of Covid-19 and newly developing variants across the world.  Based on knowledge to date, the safest way to reopen society, including to international travel, is to continue to control disease incidence through a range of public health measures which are continuously reviewed, along with progressing the national vaccination programme to ensure as many people as possible within the population are protected through immunisation.</p> <p>Under the current measures, travellers to Ireland who are fully vaccinated with European Medicines Agency approved vaccines are exempt from hotel quarantine but are still required to show a negative pre-departure RT-PCR test and to complete a period of self-quarantine at home.  The accepted Covid-19 vaccines have received market authorisation from the EMA and, therefore, comply with all the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy set out in the EU pharmaceutical legislation.  Authorised vaccines are also subject to ongoing monitoring in Ireland by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.</p> <p>The Government has announced that new travel policies will be introduced from 19 July, subject to the prevailing public health situation.  While it is not intended to depart from recognition of EMA approved vaccinations, the measures that apply following travel overseas will be revised and the new travel measures will be publicised in advance of 19 July.</p> <p>The Senator has raised some issues on which I have received correspondence and which I have passed up the line.  In Spain, all eight EMA and WHO vaccines are recognised, as is the case in Greece and Estonia.  They are able to bring back from Dubai people who have received vaccinations other than those approved by the EMA.  We are conscious of these issues and they are being examined in the Department.  I have no answer for the Senator today but it is appreciated that it is an issue that, hopefully, can be addressed.</p></speech>

There is an urgency to addressing this matter.  We are speaking about potentially thousands of Irish citizens who, in good faith, took the vaccine their company or the country where they were working offered them.  They received it and they want to be fully vaccinated.  They want to follow the rules but they also want to be able to come home.  It would be very unfair to force them into mandatory hotel quarantining.  They may have received a WHO approved vaccine that has not yet been approved by the EMA.  They are willing to take a PCR test.  We have to create circumstances in which we can allow Irish people to come home.  In advance of the autumn, we have to provide clarity for international students who are going to come here.  It is an essential part of the higher education experience that we have international students in Ireland.  I appreciate what the Minister is saying but with the digital Covid certificate coming into operation from next week, there is an urgency to this issue.</p></speech>

Measures introduced in response to the risks posed by Covid-19 are in place to protect the progress we are making in suppressing transmission rates at home while the national vaccination programme progresses.  Important developments are under way as we transition to a new travel policy.  Ireland has begun to issue EU digital green certificates to vaccinated persons.  In the coming weeks, the passenger locator form will be overhauled to provide for smoother boarding and checking of documents.  From 19 July, quarantine requirements will be lifted for many travellers.  Continuous consideration is being given by the Government to policy on international travel to ensure we strike the right balance between containment of the risks and facilitating safe international travel.</p> <p>I thank the Senator for his remarks regarding the vaccination progress.  It is very good to see we are probably top in the EU for vaccinations to date.  I thank all of the front-line staff and everybody who has made this possible.</p></speech>

Housing is very complex and we deal with it daily in this House and in the D&aacute;il.  A particular cohort of people have been forgotten about.  I have raised this matter previously with the Minister but I want to have time devoted to it.  The cohort in question is the tenants of approved housing bodies, colloquially known as co-operative schemes.  A very good scheme was introduced approximately 25 years ago, whereby tenants who were on a housing list and qualified for social housing could come together, have input into the design of the housing scheme and fittings and be part of a co-operative to build their own scheme of houses.  At the time, it was a visionary approach and I thank the civic and community leaders involved who ensured it happened.</p> <p>In County Kildare we have 18 such schemes and they have housed 300 people.  The tenants have been paying 18% of their gross income throughout the period in question.  Many of them have children who are contributing.  The loans, which were capital loans given by the Government through the local authorities, are almost paid off.  I will give the example of Fen Grove in Newbridge, which has 18 houses.  The loans will be fully paid in 2025.  However, the tenants cannot buy their own homes.  When people got together to plan for the future and plan the houses, a commitment was made that tenants would have an opportunity to buy their homes, as is the case in the local authority housing scheme.  I have seen minutes of meetings of the Fen Grove housing co-operative in 1993 that clearly state tenants would be able to buy out their homes.  As I mentioned, there are various housing schemes in Kildare, which fall under eight different organisations, some of which have responsibility for a number of schemes.</p> <p>There has been poor corporate governance, which has been documented.  This is completely wrong.  The oversight has been incorrect.  The key issue I want to speak about, and that I want the Minister of State to bring back to the Minister and Ministers of State with responsibility for housing, is the fact that people should be able to buy out their own homes.  These residents entered an agreement with their housing associations in good faith.  They held up their end of the bargain and are now being left out to dry.  This debacle has tied these families to a life of renting.  At present, they have no option of owning their own homes.  Many will not qualify for a mortgage now due to their age.  Many have retired.  These residents chose Fen Grove precisely so they would have an option to own their own home.  At that time, homes were out of reach to them.  They have built their lives and reared their families in these homes on the understanding that eventually they would have the option to own them.  For the tables to be turned on them 25 years later is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

Approved housing bodies, AHBs, are independent, not-for-profit organisations and they are also known as housing associations of voluntary co-operative housing.  It is important to be clear that AHBs are independent organisations and must operate in accordance with their own memorandum and articles of association.  They are governed by their own board of directors and most are registered charities.</p> <p>Under section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, housing authorities may provide assistance to such bodies for revision and management of housing for people with a housing need.  Accordingly, AHBs are key partners of local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage across the broad spectrum of housing delivery.  AHBs are funded for delivery of housing units and related services by the Department through local authorities which have an administrative and oversight role under the relevant social housing funding schemes.  If an AHB is in receipt of funding under such a scheme for the provision of social housing, it must comply with the terms and conditions of that scheme.  The oversight of this rests with the local authority in whose functional area the scheme is located.</p> <p>Under such schemes, the AHB is required to make the property available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.  On expiry of the mortgage period and subject to compliance with the terms of the funding agreement, the AHB becomes the owner of the property.  </p> <p>In accordance with departmental guidance, local authorities are requested to notify the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government on release of all mortgage charges to AHBs within their area.  Should an AHB decide to sell a property that has been purchased using Exchequer funding, they must do so in accordance with any conditions attaching to the funding of that property.  The funding implications relating to such a sale may vary depending on the funding mechanism under which the property was acquired.  If a property is owned outright by an AHB and is not subject to public funding, the AHB may choose to sell that property, once this is allowed for in its constitution.  AHBs must have as their primary objectives the relief of housing needs and the provision and management of housing included within their memorandum and articles of association or registered rules, as the case may be.  The vast majority of AHBs are registered charities and, as such, must also comply with the provisions of the Charities Acts relating to the sale of charitable assets.</p> <p>It is important to be clear that the tenant (incremental) purchase scheme for local authority owned dwelling does not extend to AHB properties and it is not open to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to direct AHBs in this regard.</p> <p>I heard the Senator's concerns regarding the minutes of the 1993 local authority meetings and will bring them to the Minister.</p></speech>

The families and individuals I am talking about are being sent from pillar to post.  They are not being given adequate responses from anyone.  They are not being shown the respect they deserve.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has been in contact with residents and told them that the decision to sell homes to residents is one for individual housing associations.  The individual housing associations say it is not up to them.  It is clear that mechanisms should be put in place to fulfil the promise that housing associations can actually make that decision.  The residents need to have a clear direction on how they can purchase houses under approved housing schemes and under what criteria that can happen.  From what the Minister of State said, I gather that approved housing bodies can make that decision but I assume the Department has some role relating to the criteria and we need to work on that.</p> <p>I will briefly raise another issue.  Some tenants are being moved from permanent homes to leased homes without security of tenure although they remain members of a particular AHB.  I thank the Minister of State for his answer.  He has provided some clarity.  I look forward to continuing to work with the Department, the council and the residents.</p></speech>

I cannot speak on behalf of any individual AHB but I must reiterate that the sale of property by an AHB to a tenant is a matter for the particular AHB.  Should an AHB choose to sell these properties, it must ensure it complies with its own constitution and governing rules having regard to its primary objectives.  The AHB must also comply with the provisions of the relevant legislation relating to the sale of charitable assets in accordance with any guidance issued by the Charities Regulator.  That is an important point to be clear on.  I will, of course, convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p></speech>

This arises from a number of concerns relating to the Department and the navy.  I thank Mr. Darragh Duncan, a UCD student working as an intern in my office, who has done considerable research on the issue.  There are clearly many conflicting issues around these matters.  I will take the Minister of State through some of those issues chronologically.  On 15 February 2021, <i>The Irish Times</i>referred to a recent European Commission inquiry into Ireland's fisheries protection capabilities, deeming them unsatisfactory.  That finding relates to this Commencement matter.</p><p>On 4 June 2021, <i>The Irish Times</i>reported that Ireland has had to outsource fisheries patrols to other EU vessels to control our fisheries.  That is a challenge in itself.  On 6 April 2021, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>reported that the Naval Service's plans to acquire a new flagship MRV at a reputed cost of &euro;200 million had gone to tender.  Further commentary has reported that the tender process is not going ahead.  The 2015 White Paper on Defence stated that such a vessel was required.  That vessel would need to be flexible and adaptive.  It would need to be able to carry freight and to be capable of a wide range of maritime tasks, both at home and abroad.  At this point, I acknowledge the amazing humanitarian work our Naval Service has carried out in the Mediterranean.  That was important.  </p><p>There are concerns around the issue of the European Commission's inquiry into Ireland's fisheries protection capabilities.  We should be concerned about that.  We must also address the issues of cost and morale within the Naval Service.  I am reliably informed that membership is now below 1,000.  It is, fact, approximately 900, when the Naval Service normally comprises the recommended level of approximately 1,200 members.  Without being negative, there are concerns about the morale of our navy.  There is a need to support it in terms of the infrastructure, machinery and expertise that are required.</p><p>There were suggestions that this MRV would be used as a hospital ship, would be capable of carrying troops and helicopters and would be amphibious, in addition to catering for airborne landings.  It would be a multifaceted, mutifunctional, expensive and essential military resource.  It is needed to provide humanitarian support and emergency services in Ireland.  There are concerns here.  I am asking that we have the necessary ships and specialist equipment, and the motivated staff to address issues around fisheries protection, which are critically important.  We also need to find out where we are on this project.  Is it on course as the draft tender documents set out?  It is important infrastructure that is needed.  It would give the Naval Service a boost and a sense that we are all on the one page.  It is important that we have absolute clarity about where we are on this important project.</p></speech>

The Irish economic zone currently extends to 132,000 square miles.  This area is approximately five times the size of Ireland, and amounts to approximately 16% of all EU waters.<br/><br/>The Naval Service currently has a nine-ship fleet with two of those ships, the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne</i>and <i>L&Eacute; Orla</i>, in operational reserve.  The Government has acknowledged the recruitment and retention issues that are currently impacting on Naval Service operations and the availability of operational ships and also the impact on fishery patrol days, which is a situation that is being managed carefully.  The Minister's focus is on returning the Naval Service to its full capacity.<br/><br/>The White Paper on Defence sets out an ambitious programme of capital investment in the Naval Service, including the mid-life refit and upgrade of the P50 class of vessels, the <i>L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>and <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>, as well as the replacement of the flagship Naval Service vessel, the <i>L&Eacute; Eithne</i>, with a multirole vessel, and, subsequently, the <i>L&Eacute; Ciara</i>and <i>L&Eacute; Orla</i>.  The P50 mid-life upgrade programme is well under way, with the recent return to operations of the <i>L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>and work is commencing on the <i>L&Eacute; Niamh </i>project.<br/><br/>The multirole vessel project is an important developmental project and indicative of the Government's commitment to ongoing investment and development of defence capabilities.  The project is included in the national development plan as a major capital project and is an important element of the defence equipment development plan.  A joint civil-military project team has been appointed to manage this project.  Work to date has focused on the pretender concept of operations stage and preparing a detailed specification of capability requirements for a tender competition.  In addition, a competition is under way to appoint a marine adviser to support the procurement of a multirole vessel.  This process should be finalised within the coming weeks.  It is the intention that the new vessel will be able to contribute across a number of defence roles, with a design specification capable of providing a flexible and adaptive capacity for a wide range of tasks, both at home and overseas.  It is planned that it will be enabled for helicopter operations and will have a freight-carrying capacity.<br/><br/>It is intended to hold a public tender competition in due course to cover the supply of the multirole vessel, subject to availability of funding within the overall defence capital funding envelope.  As this project is at pretender stage, the Senator will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to comment further on the design and capabilities of the ship.<br/><br/>With regard to the European Commission's assessment that Ireland's fisheries protection capabilities are &quot;unsatisfactory&quot;, while it is acknowledged that there is room for improvement in respect of Ireland's sea fisheries protection, the Minister is satisfied that the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and Naval Service continue to actively engage with the Commission and EU partners on matters related to the Common Fisheries Policy.  During 2020, the Naval Service carried out 781 fishery patrol days.  Up to 31 May 2021, the Naval Service had carried out 338 fishery patrol days.</p></speech>

He refers to the European Commission's audit and subsequent administration inquiry, which identified there were severe and significant weakness in the Irish control system.  This is a Minister who is prepared to face up to the problems and challenges and to seek to address them.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for the very comprehensive reply in which he has addressed a number of issues relating to the humanitarian work of the Naval Service, which is critically important.  In the remaining time, I thank the Naval Service and the Minister for the work that has been done in the Mediterranean in the past and I hope it will be done again in the future.  It is important that we are involved and support this service, which is critically important, both for fisheries and for the forces themselves.</p></speech>

The Minister's focus is on returning the Naval Service to its full capacity.  The acquisition of modern new vessels, combined with an ongoing maintenance regime for all vessels within the fleet and the continuous process of refurbishment, refit and repair will ensure that the operational capabilities of the Naval Service, as the State's principal sea-going agency, are maintained to the greatest extent.  Projects for the replacement of other vessels will be considered over the lifetime of the White Paper in the context of overall capability development and funding along with the overall equipment planning process.</p> <p>In addition, it should be noted that the programme for Government contains a commitment to an independent commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the Defence Forces.  The commission commenced its work in December 2020 and is due to report in December 2021.  As part of its terms of reference, the commission is looking at the structure and size of the Defence Forces, encompassing military capability structuring and staffing.</p></speech>

The storming of the Bastille marked the beginning of the revolution which overthrew the French monarchy and created a republic under the guiding principles of <i>libert&eacute;</i>, <i>&eacute;galit&eacute;</i>and <i>fraternit&eacute;</i>.  The process was slow and imperfect.  It sparked an undying desire for freedom all over the world, including within these shores.  It is well known that young Irish men and women were inspired by the values of the French Republic to pursue our own quest for freedom and independence.  Indeed, Ireland's national flag is based on the French tricolour.</p><p>France supported Ireland's aspiration for independence in the 17th and 18th centuries.  In 1798, the first Irish Republic was proclaimed by Wolfe Tone and supported by General Humbert.  Ireland and the world were transformed by the developments in France 232 years ago.  We owe our French friends an enormous debt of gratitude for having blazed the trail for democracy and freedom that hundreds of millions of people enjoy today.  On their national day, I wish our nearest EU neighbour, France, its ambassador, His Excellency Vincent Gu&eacute;rend, all French people throughout the world, and particularly the 30,000 living here in Ireland, a very happy Bastille Day.  <i>Vive la France</i>, <i>vive l'Irlande et vive la R&eacute;publique.</i></p><p>We also congratulate Italy on winning the European championships yesterday.</p></speech>

We all know, from working alongside her in here, that she is one of the most authentic women and politicians in Irish life.  We would like to send her a message of congratulations and sincerest warm wishes from all of us.</p> <p>I would also like to congratulate our other colleagues in the House and, indeed, the candidates from all of our parties, who contested the election.  Some might see defeat as being something that is hard to sit on one's shoulders, but if we do not encounter defeats, we do not know how to learn by them.  If we do not learn, we do not grow.

Many of our young students and, indeed, their families and the colleges they hope to attend, will be hoping that the traditional third level college experience of so many students down through the years will return.  Hopefully, our young leaving certificate students who wish to go to college this year will experience that.</p> <p>With that in mind, I welcome the news that the Government is introducing a pilot rapid testing project across four colleges, Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, University College Cork and NUI Galway.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The project is called UniCoV and it will conduct a large-scale analysis of testing technologies for use in surveillance of Covid-19 and prevention in higher educational settings.  These will include rapid antigen testing, saliva-based polymerase chain reaction, PCR, testing and waste water surveillance.  The findings from this will, hopefully, inform the authorities as how best to ensure that colleges remain open and what to do in the event of an outbreak.  It is hoped that more than 8,000 students and indeed staff members will participate in this experiment and I encourage many staff and students to participate so that campus life remain open in a safe way.  We all know that it is the best way to learn and it is better for the mental health of students that they are able to participate in on-campus learning as opposed to what they have been doing for the past year to 18 months.</p><p>Second, I join the Leader in congratulating our former colleague, Deputy Ivana Bacik on her great success in the Dublin Bay South by-election.  It has been very hard-earned.  Deputy Bacik has worked hard over the years and I understand that this is her fourth attempt to get elected to the Lower House.  This shows that her hard work has eventually paid off and I am delighted for her.  Apart from the fact that she is an astute and able politician, she is also quite simply a very decent human being.  I, for one, am delighted for her and I join with the Leader also in congratulating all those who put their names forward.  It is a very brave thing to do.  The lack of electoral success is never a reflection on a person&rsquo;s ability as an individual and that is an important point to make.</p><p>When talking about hard work and sticking to the pace for many years, I wish Councillor Ian McGarvey from Ramelton and in County Donegal a very happy birthday this week.  He reaches the young age of 91 and continues to serve as an active member of Donegal County Council.  He was first elected to the council at the age of 73 and became mayor and cathaoirleach of Donegal at the age of 82 and he has run in four general elections.  I am delighted that he is going as hearty and strong as ever.  I congratulate him for all his hard work and dedication to the good people of his electoral area of Letterkenny and Milford and I wish him and his good wife, Marjorie, continued good health.  I would be grateful if the Leader, when writing a wee note to Deputy Bacik, might also write a note to Ian and his wife wishing them all continued good health and success.</p></speech>

Persistence does, I hope, pay off and it is a message for all of us.</p> <p>Today is 12 July and I wish the people on our island to have a happy and safe celebration of this day.  It is an important day for the community.  Last year celebrations were cancelled because the Covid-19 and this was respected and I hope that they proceed safely.  </p> <p>This weekend showed us that while progress is being made in some respects with a DUP city mayor attending our National Day of Commemoration, the First Minister and deputy First Minister attended a commemoration of the Battle of the Somme and many bonfires went off at the weekend without controversy, we still have a long way to go.  We also saw the burning of Irish flags and other Irish or Catholic symbols and images of people who support the protocol over the weekend.  That is not a celebration of culture.  It is very disappointing for those people who respect different cultures.  Many people on this island work hard to do that in an inclusive way and that behaviour should be condemned without any excuses.</p> <p>The other issue I raise that relates to northerners is parity of vaccines.  I am glad that fully vaccinated northerners may not be left in the cold when it comes to indoor dining.  There is still confusion over the digital Covid-19 certificate.  The North has its own vaccine passport and there is a question regarding how this will be aligned.  From 19 July, Ireland will broadly align itself with the EU approach to non-essential travel into the EU from third countries and unless there is an emergency brake applied, no testing and quarantine will be necessary. However, there is still confusion for people, in particular, who live and work in the South and who got their vaccines in the North.  They may have lived in the South for decades and they live cross-Border lives, as we want them to.  Some are employed in this building.  They may or may not carry Irish passports and that should not matter.  They need clarity and reassurance at the moment and specific communications because they still want to see their loved ones and families in the EU.  In many cases, their housemates, co-workers, the people they dine with, their travel buddies and even their families may have the digital Covid-19 certificate.  It is good to see the recognition of vaccines for indoor dining but we should aim for parity of vaccines on our wee island.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

"Parity of vaccines" is certainly a new term on me.  I also join the Senator in wishing those celebrating 12 July in Northern Ireland a very safe day and, hopefully, it will pass off peacefully.  I also join with her on the issue of the bonfires.  I have attended bonfires in Northern Ireland with members of the Ulster Unionist Party and I join with her and with members of the Ulster Unionist Party who pointed out that the burning flags and of election posters of candidates is not a part of their culture and of what they wish to celebrate or mark.</p> <p>I call now on Senator Boyhan to speak.</p></speech>

What a wonderful achievement for a wonderful person and politician.  I said to her here last week, when she was sitting next to me and pushing her 12 or 13 amendments to the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill, most of which were not accepted by the Government, that this will no doubt be her last piece of important legislation in this House.  Everyone wished her well and believed that this was her time and that she deserved to be recognised by the electorate.  She achieved a resounding success and was the victor on the occasion of that by-election.  I also join colleagues in congratulating all the other candidates to put themselves forward.  I know some of them well and it takes courage to put one&rsquo;s name on the ballot.  It also takes courage to counteract scrutiny of a by-election.  It is a very tough election for anyone who has ever stood in a by-election.  Politicians had to put up with a lot of personal attacks and abuse in the campaign.  It should be condemned and is unacceptable, but to be fair to the candidates, they handled it remarkably well.  They will have another day and I have no doubt that we will see many of them in Leinster House in the future.  That is the great thing about politics.</p><p>I also join in congratulating Independent Councillor Ian McGarvey a very happy 91st birthday.  What a wonderful man.  If we learn anything about politics, and we all talk about bringing new people into politics, but let us also help to support the retention of those already there.  Ageism is well alive in politics.  A teacher said to me the other day that she had just retired at 66 years of age and she is an active member of the INTO.  She asked if I thought she had a place or role in local government.  I said that of course she had.  She has vast experience and I told her to put her name forward.  We should always remember that older people also have a place in politics.</p><p>I wish to dwell on two issues and one is more power to local government.  There is a particularly good article for those who may not have seen it in the <i>Irish Independent</i>by our Minister of State with responsibility for local government, Deputy Peter Burke.  I recommend that all Members read it and they will see for themselves why I think it is so good.  I thank and acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s now final commitment that we are going to have an end to the strategic housing development policy, which did not work.  Everybody said that it would not work.  It was a disaster, however it was approached.  The price is that the citizens had to pay and to go to the courts to vindicate their rights of engagement and, in most cases, they were successful.  That was the wake-up call for the Government but I want to acknowledge that it happened.</p><p>Finally, we will take the Land Development Agency Bill later.  I acknowledge the difficulties that the Leader has with her agenda but 135 minutes is tight for this important legislation.  I accept and acknowledge that she has a tight schedule between now and the end of this week, which I will go along with.  I ask Members who have city and county councillors in their parties to please support and in some way contribute to the debate on section 183 disposals.  It is of great significance for their members and for everyone else in this House as to their political affiliations.  I hope that we can stand in solidarity with one another today and send a clear message that we are not going to take the power of section 183 disposals in respect of land for the Land Development Agency away from our city and county councillors.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have the power.

What a wonderful addition to the D&aacute;il she will be.</p> <p>Irish agriculture must change.  The change required to put it on course is transformational and the 2020s must be the decade that starts that substantial directional change.  The last major food systems shift was in the post-war decades.  The misnamed green revolution, fuelled by fossil fuels, led us along the path of abundance and growth, but at an enormous cost to our environment.  The next major food systems shift is now and it must be one during which the environment stops paying a heavy price.</p> <p>Agricultural policy, like food production, must be rooted in the soil.  I have visited many farmers over the course of the past year or so.  Some see the value in the soil and farm it to protect its biology and function.  Others see it merely as a medium to feed in order to grow a crop.  Soil is more than just a growing medium.  It is something living and breathing.  It can store carbon and it hosts a quarter of our biodiversity, or it should do if it is treated right.  We have, sadly, become addicted to feeding our soil with artificial fertilisers.  Those fertilisers are finite if they are mined or produced with fossil fuels.  If we are to fix things, we must do more than just cut back.  We must wean ourselves off these synthetic inputs and embrace the new agricultural revolution that is now upon us.  We in Ireland have a choice.  We can either lead and capitalise economically and environmentally on that leadership or we can sit and wait, pay huge fines and spend the next decade catching up, licking our wounds and regretting that we did not act sooner because that is what will happen.</p> <p>Our farming system is hooked on synthetic nitrogen and it is time we started the detox.  This will open the door to a whole new world of sustainable farming practices which we, as policymakers, must nurture and support, and legislate for if needs be.  I am not talking about everyone going organic.  While I believe organic farming is a vital component in our fight against climate change and for biodiversity, that is not what I am talking about now.  I am talking about the mainstream, the farmers our citizens will almost wholly rely on to meet our climate and biodiversity targets.  Luckily for us, the vast majority of those farmers are already extensive.  They do not place an undue burden on their lands or on our shared environment.  However, those who do that will have to change and play a significant role in shaping our future.</p> <p>We are all in this together and no one is entitled to a free pass.  It is time to design and deliver for a future that in which our land is released from the tyrannic grip of fossil fuels and finite minerals, where our food systems truly work in harmony with nature and we mimic ecology in everything we do.  The time has come for us to build a truly sustainable food system, one which is diverse and has plants and animals working together to sustain life.  Irish agriculture needs systemic change to set it on a secure path to resilience and as we seek to get farming back working with nature, we all need to remember that ecology does not do fossil fuels.</p></speech>

Let me join with others in congratulating our now former colleague, Deputy Ivana Bacik, on a tremendous result in the election on Friday.  As others have said, she has been a wonderful colleague over the years.  All of us wish her well and know that she will do well in the Lower House.  I wish her well.</p> <p>Congratulations to Italy on a wonderful climax to the football tournament yesterday.  Commiserations to our neighbours in England and solidarity to those poor players who have suffered racist abuse as a result of their penalty misses.  It is appalling.</p></speech>

It was a wonderful tournament and we all wish everyone well at the end of it.</p> <p>I will raise an issue that I bring up from time to time, a matter on which I always ask for a debate but that has not happened yet.  That matter is the continuing use by US troops of Shannon Airport.  I was at a well-attended protest yesterday.  We need to reflect on where we are in terms of Shannon Airport and its use by the US military.  Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, it is estimated that 5 million deaths have occurred, including the death of 1 million children.  We are, unfortunately, culpable because we continue to facilitate the movement of US military through Shannon.  Some 17,000 troops have already moved through Shannon this year.  We continue to allow planes sending troops to war zones to land.  Mid-air refuelling aircraft help the planes that are bombing to refuel so that they can continue to bomb, as they did last month in Syria and Iraq.  </p> <p>I would like a debate on the issue and again ask the Leader to organise one.  It is frustrating to hear people rightly speaking about human rights but determined to ignore what has been happening in Shannon for far too long.  I am proud to believe we should be a neutral country but we are not neutral in practice.</p> <p>In a similar vein, I again bring up the issue of the TRIPS waiver because for the life of me I cannot understand the Government's stance on this issue.  People are dying.  As I said last week, and as emerged at the recent G7 conference, the people in Cornwall who are vaccinated outnumber the people vaccinated in the 24 poorest countries in Africa.  For reasons I do not understand, our Government is refusing to support the call for a TRIPS waiver.  There will be a crucial meeting of the World Trade Organization on 27 July.  It is crucial that Ireland stands up for the people of the world.  It is, frankly, immoral and indefensible to continue to hide behind big pharma and not be strong on this issue.  I call on the Leader not on a party political basis but on the basis of what we should all be able to agree on in this Chamber.  I call on the Government to stand firm with the people of the world by calling for the waiver of intellectual property rights because as all of us will agree, no one is safe until everyone is safe.</p></speech>

I know she would be very touched by all the kind words and messages from Senators from across the Chamber on Friday, over the weekend and today.  It is, of course, an enormous privilege for her to have been elected as a Deputy for Dublin Bay South.  It is also a privilege for the Labour Party.</p> <p>Deputy Bacik leaves behind the Seanad which she dearly loved and of which she was extremely proud to be a Member for 14 years as a representative of the Trinity constituency.  There are a number of other examples, but Deputy Bacik is a fantastic example of what is possible in the Seanad in terms of the legislation she has brought forward over the years.  There is a degree of sadness on her part that she is leaving the Seanad behind.  The four Labour Party Senators remaining are a little sad that we are losing her because she was a fantastic leader for us.  She has also been an inspiration for us in the Labour Party over many years.  As my colleague, Senator Moynihan, said, Deputy Bacik represents the best of us.  The best is yet to come.</p> <p>I wish to raise the issue of the 24 drugs and alcohol task forces in the country.  The heart of their work is about bringing together statutory agencies, local drugs projects and community representatives.  We know that if we are to tackle drugs, it must not be treated only as a medical or health issue.  It also touches on housing, economics, mental health and communities.  It alarms me that the Department of Health, on 24 June, took the unprecedented step of suspending the north inner city drugs and alcohol task force.  There are serious questions about that move.  It is unprecedented in the 25 years of task forces.  We are not clear as to the legal basis of the Department's move to suspend the task force.  We do not know why the Department did it.  If it was so concerned about governance issues, as the Department set out in its letter of 24 July to members of the task force, why did it and the HSE sign off on a service level agreement in the spring of this year knowing what they knew about the process of appointing a chair of the task force?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Many people might say there is no smoke without fire.  At the heart of this issue is the independence of the chair, which is not about whether a person is a member of an organisation or is funded by the task force or will be impartial in the role.  It is about how active they will be and what kind of advocacy they will bring about in that role.  That is at the heart of this matter.  I know I am out of time but I am going to write to the Minister about this.  This is not just about the north inner city task force.  This is about all the drugs task forces across the country. for which there are implications.</p></speech>

Of course, French was the second language used in the First D&aacute;il after Irish when the Declaration of Independence was read out in French by George Gavan Duffy.  <i>Bonne f&ecirc;te nationale ce mercredi &agrave; tous</i>.</p><p>I also echo colleagues in their congratulations to Deputy Bacik, who is a committed parliamentarian and legislator.  Everyone was very happy to see her election and wish her well.  I have known her for a long time as somebody who is passionate about education and access.  She is also somebody who will respect a person's point of view even if she disagrees with him or her.  She always deals with the issue.  She will be a loss to this House but a gain to the other House.  I wish all the candidates the best.  It takes courage to stand in a by-election.  I have a little bit of knowledge of that.  Well done to anyone who puts his or her name on a ballot paper.</p><p>I also commend the Garda and request that a letter of thanks goes to Sergeant Hugh Shovlin and his colleagues at Donnybrook Garda station for the abuse they had to suffer at the count.  Unfortunately, we have seen members of the Garda subjected to all sorts of abuse simply for trying to protect our democracy.  The garda&iacute; behaved appropriately on Friday but we should acknowledge the role they had.</p><p>I wish to refer, though, to the next upcoming election, which is the question of the directly elected mayor for Limerick city.  I have long taken the view that the Custom House in Ireland is the greatest barrier to local government and real local governance in this country.  On the basis of the recommendations we are seeing appear with regard to the powers that are going to the directly elected mayor, I am really disappointed.  I believe we will continue to see local administration.  I favour directly elected mayors.  We need to be ambitious.  I would like to see it expanded around the country but the legislation that appears to be coming forward is extremely disappointing.  It will not give real powers to the directly elected mayor.  I would appreciate it were the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to assure us this will not be the case.</p></speech>

She will be a huge asset to the Lower House but absolutely will be a loss to this House.  Her contribution to politics will continue, however.</p> <p>This is the final Order of Business on which we will speak before the summer recess.  I will take this opportunity to thank the staff of the House, Mr. Martin Groves, Ms Bridget Doody and all the team for their courtesy.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader and wish them a very enjoyable summer.  It is a well-earned break.  As a result of Covid-19, we have obviously been working unusual patterns, to say the least.</p> <p>Speaking of the summer, one issue I raised previously in this House and wish to raise again is that of water safety at secondary level.  We have seen an increased numbers of people swimming in the sea.  As we all know, swimming in the sea is completely different to swimming in a pool because of the cold temperatures, different wave currents and challenges the sea brings.  Water safety training should be compulsory at secondary level.  A verifiable water safety module is needed in which every young person should engage and get a certificate and acknowledgement.  Sea currents and the dangers of swimming in the sea are very much apparent and well-documented.  I offer my sympathies to the young man in County Clare who lost his life last week.  He was a qualified lifeguard, which just shows us the challenges the sea presents.  I, therefore, ask for a debate in the autumn on water safety at secondary level and built into that needs to be a respect for lifeguards and the instructions they dispatch.  Too often, we see those instructions are ignored.  It is, therefore, something we can and should work on.  I look forward to that debate in the autumn.</p></speech>

I had marked her to be the winner from very early on.  It was definitely a woman's seat to win this time around.</p><p>This will be a standout week in national politics and we in this House have a very important role.  Last night, I received an email from independent Councillor Gillian Toole in Ratoath, who also a pharmacist.  Permit me to read from that email:</p> <blockquote> 	I find today [to be a] a bittersweet day - the Centenary of the signing of the Truce which ended the War of Independence - and the eve of the day on which you will vote upon emergency legislation, to facilitate the introduction of Vaccine-testing Passports for non-essential services such as indoor dining &amp;amp; attending public houses and thereafter music, arts &amp;amp; entertainment. <br /><br />You CANNOT create a two-tier society based on a person's private medical information.<br /><br />I am extremely concerned at the lack of consideration by the Government of several issues including the scientific case ... ethical &amp;amp; discrimination issues, data privacy &amp;amp; security.<br /><br />The introduction of such a system conflicts with several key fundamental rights enshrined in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann ...<br /><br />The introduction of a vaccine-testing status certification will not serve any of our Citizens well.  Based on my personal experience as a Community Pharmacist, I have urged you to ensure that front-line Health Services were improved &amp;amp; ICU bed numbers increased on a permanent basis, coupled with certified Antigen testing. <br /><br />None of this is happening - WHY? <br /><br />What have you DONE to request this action, much of which is the foundation of the Sl&aacute;intecare model of Irish healthcare? <br /><br />It is too easy to proceed with the divisive action planned for this coming week when you could &amp;amp; should &quot;build back a better&quot; health service.<br /><br />Suffice to say, given the incessant focus on vaccination &amp;amp; disregard for Antigen-testing &amp;amp; the General Register Office 5 year death-rate figures ... one would think that the share price of vaccine-manufacturers is the only goal!<br /><br />We have to live with this virus &amp;amp; any others on the horizon; we have to provide a health service for ALL our citizens ... &amp;amp; we must do this in an INCLUSIVE environment, not a discriminatory one.<br /><br />I trust you to make the right &amp;amp; truthful choice in the coming days. </blockquote> <p>I thank Councillor Toole for that contribution this morning.  We really have important choices to make in the interest of all our citizens.</p></speech>

This is an issue and a problem for society.  There are no borders when it comes to social media, and in particular platforms like Twitter and Facebook, as we saw in February of this year when a teenager in County Kerry racially abused former England star Ian Wright.  He was very lucky to escape conviction on that occasion.  That was followed by a great tournament, which was sullied last night by that incident with the English players, the storming of Wembley Stadium by ticketless fans, the trashing of the area outside, the booing of the Italian national anthem and a worrying undercurrent.  Some expressed wonder that it was great to have fans back in the stadium.  Perhaps it was not.</p> <p>That issue of the racial abuse of sports players also happens in this country, however.  We have seen instances where young black men playing GAA and soccer have also been the subject of online abuse, and indeed, abuse in the stands.  The point is that in the context of the online safety and media regulation Bill, which is currently at pre-legislative scrutiny stage at committee in these Houses, it is essential that we tackle it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When the representatives from Twitter and Facebook were before the committee, they gave plaudits to us and used fanciful language, but tackling this issue must be done and it must be done collaboratively across many governments.  It will not just happen through our own, but we can take a very powerful step in the autumn in these Houses by sending out a statement that it is not acceptable in Ireland and that we will deal with it through the online media Bill and stop the hate that happens to so many of our sporting stars.  We stand in solidarity with those three young Englishmen today, because it affects all our sports stars.</p></speech>

She will be an asset to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and a loss to the Seanad.  I also wish to compliment our candidate, Councillor James Geoghegan, a fantastic candidate who ran a great campaign.  To paraphrase Arnold Schwarzenegger, he will be back.</p> <p>I would like to get an update on the provision of a new school for Me&aacute;n Scoil Mhuire in Longford.  It has been an ongoing issue for a substantial length of time.  The school has 600 pupils, an ageing building and no play area for the students.</p> <p>I disagree with Senator Keogan.  I firmly believe we must get our hospitality industry fully reopened.  I support the proposals that will be brought to the House.  We have to get our hospitality, restaurants and pubs open.  They have been closed for too long so I will fully support anything that can help that.</p> <p>Drivers licences is another issue that has been pertinent over the last 12 months.  There are three separate companies dealing with driver licences - the driver test, the theory test and applications for renewal of licences.  It is turning into a mess, to be honest, for many young people.  It has to be examined.  When the tender was issued for the driver licence applications centres, it was sent out in such a way that even the local post office could not apply for it.  We set up 60 new offices, many of them located in the upstairs or corners of buildings that are inaccessible to elderly people.  I ask that this be looked at again.</p> <p>Finally, I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your courtesy over the last 12 months.  I also thank Mr. Martin Groves, Ms Bridget Doody and the staff of the Seanad.  It is truly an honour to be here and it is made much easier by the way the Seanad has been run by you and them.  I also thank the Leader for her work over the last 12 months.</p></speech>

I got to know her in 2016 when I became a Member of this House and she has been a pleasure to work with.  She is always very kind to new Members and is a terrific role model for women of all parties and none who wish to enter politics, so I wish to put my congratulations on the record.</p> <p>Today, I will raise the issue of cancer care.  Unfortunately, Covid-19 has impacted severely on cancer diagnosis and treatment, with many people getting delayed diagnosis of new and returning cancers due to delayed or cancelled scans during the pandemic.  It is absolutely horrendous for the patients and their families when this happens.  We know that cancer care has been one of the major casualties of the pandemic.  There was a massive diversion of resources from cancer care and other healthcare to Covid-19.  This was the right thing to do and thanks to the stellar work of many medical professionals a massive number of lives were saved, although many lives have been lost.</p> <p>I wish to raise two issues confronting people, and their families, who are facing cancer treatments.  The first is inpatient charges.  People are charged &euro;80 per hospital visit for chemotherapy and the like.  This is capped at ten visits, so the maximum somebody will pay is &euro;800 per year.  However, &euro;800 per year for somebody who may not be working or who has no massive means is a huge financial burden.  It is quite shocking.  The inpatient cost must be capped.  It affects not just people going in for cancer treatment but also people getting any treatment in hospital.  Nobody would deny reaching out to cancer patients and, perhaps, reviewing the payment they have to make.</p> <p>The second issue is the hospital car parking charges.  I know the Government is looking at capping them and giving some concessions in public hospitals for people with cancer, but this should be considered immediately and introduced as soon as possible.  Perhaps the Leader will raise that issue.</p></speech>

In some instances, there are no fire retardant measures at all.  I am in constant contact with homeowners who have been obliged to pay exorbitant fees to rectify the substandard fire safety provisions in their complexes and who are also paying mortgages for homes they believed to be safe.  A defects working group was established under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but for some weeks now there have been rising tensions between departmental officials and the members of the working group regarding setting the terms of reference.  I have listened to parents talk about their fears at night when they are putting their children to bed.  They are afraid about whether they will get out if there is a fire and whether they are safe.</p> <p>Homeowners are completely innocent in this situation.  I believe there has been almost criminal behaviour on the part of builders who have knowingly cut corners.  There also was a failure in enforcement of building regulations and standards.  The Minister must intervene with the working group to ensure that the terms of reference that are established address the needs of homeowners.  The redress must have a retrospective element.  If one is a professional landlord, one can write off the cost of remediation against tax, whereas homeowners who are paying mortgages are unable to do that.  We have to address that in this year's budget.  We also must create a register of builders who have allowed this situation to occur and block them from bidding and tendering for work in the State, paid for the State, until such time as they have addressed the outstanding defects.  They cannot walk away and pretend they have clean hands.  So far, nobody has died, but it will be too late after a fire and deaths occur to address this situation.  We need action on it now.</p></speech>

She has been an enormous inspiration to me and throughout the student movement.  It is wonderful to have had somebody with such tenacity and commitment in this House and now to see her represent us in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>I wish to discuss the fact that July is Disability Pride Month.  The month originated in the USA and has spread globally.  The annual event seeks to shine a light on physical, learning and hidden disabilities and mental health conditions.  It is used to talk about disability as an identity, a community and a culture, and a positive pride for disabled people.  It is a reminder that there is no single way for being disabled to look.  There are many ways that disabled people live, whether it is physical, mental or intellectual disability.  Disability is a diverse identity that intersects with race, sexuality, gender, sex, religion and much more.  The month is important for many reasons.  We can all agree that our world is not designed and built for disabled people.  We do not have universal design embedded into our structures.  We do not have universally designed learning and mainstreaming in our further and higher education system.  Considering that 15% of the worldwide population is disabled, it is astonishing that there is still such an egregious divide in our society.  For example, in DART stations disabled people have to ask permission to use the lifts.  Disabled people have to book accessible buses or ramps up to 48 hours before travelling.  There are disabled people who are not legally allowed to make their own decisions, and there are disabled people who are locked out of education in Ireland due to either physical constraints or an affordability issue such as putting their social welfare supports at risk.  We should be angry at how disabled people are treated under our watch.</p> <p>I ask all Members of the House to engage with the spirit of Disability Pride Month.  As legislators, we must challenge systemic ableism and the discrimination disabled people face.  We can do this by ensuring we have laws and policies that tackle systemic ableism, but we also have to do it ourselves in our own lives with closed captioning, alt tech and subtitling.  I remind Members that disabled people are not a problem to be overcome.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Annie Hoey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AnnieHoey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The problem is the system and oppression that we, as legislators, stand over and which we have to correct.

There has been a fantastic show of solidarity in this House in paying tribute to such a wonderful colleague.  I was lucky to have served with Deputy Bacik here since 2016.  As Senator Ardagh said, Deputy Bacik was a role model for me prior to entering politics.  She bravely stood up for women when it was not popular and suffered electoral defeat after electoral defeat but was true to herself and her core belief system.  That paid dividends in the end.  I could not be happier for my Labour colleagues across the House and for the Deputy.  These days have to be savoured because they are a long time coming.  I was lucky to work with her on the cross-party group and in the justice role I served in prior to this term.</p> <p>I also pay tribute to Senator Boylan, who also contested this election, and to all who put their names forward, including Councillor Deirdre Conroy for the Fianna F&aacute;il Party.  To put your name forward is always a brave thing to do and to do it in a by-election is extra brave so I commend them.  There was always going to be only one winner of the by-election but democracy dictates we have several people contesting it.  They have all played an active role in the democratic process and are to be commended.</p> <p>One of the most striking things about this by-election was the number of women contesting it.  I was around the constituency for the past month and to see so many female faces looking out from posters was inspirational to me and, I am sure, to all the young women and girls in the constituency and beyond who saw it.  Hopefully, it will encourage more women and young girls to start thinking about a career in politics.  From whatever background and whatever your political persuasion, there is a place for you and your voice.</p> <p>We will have the by-election to fill the place on the Trinity College Dublin panel shortly.  I encourage women to start thinking about putting their names forward and I appeal to the Trinity electors to vote for women and give us another woman in this House.  We do not want to be down numbers.  The D&aacute;il is gaining a female; we do not want to lose one.  Vote for women.  We need more women.</p></speech>

I was lucky to be here with her last week for the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill.  She participated in that and had done so much to get it over the line.  It was fitting that her last contribution was during that debate.  I am sad not to see her here today but we will see her in the corridors soon and she will be in this Chamber before too long.  I too pay tribute to everyone who put their names forward.  A by-election is first past the post and it is difficult for people to put themselves forward but if you do not put yourself forward for the first time, there will never be a second.  Deputy Bacik shows that continuing to put yourself forward pays off in the end.</p><p>Today, an event from two years ago came up on my Facebook feed.  It was an event on zero waste where people came in to us and helped support each other in finding other uses and a practical way of contributing to a circular economy.  One thing that has gone under the radar a little is that last weekend the single-use plastics directive was signed into law here.  The regulations were signed by the Minister at the weekend.  People may not that realise 70% of plastic waste in the marine environment comes from ten products.  Most of those are now banned in Ireland, which is momentous for our ocean life and goes to show the importance of being part of the European Union and engaging in that debate.</p><p><i>Bonne f&ecirc;te nationale &agrave; La France.

Representing one's country at any level, especially in the Olympic Games, is an incredible honour.  My interest is in athletics and we have a strong athletics team.  I pay tribute to every person who has given blood, sweat and tears to get on to the Irish Olympic team.  I look forward to cheering them on and seeing them do the work and compete to the best of their ability.</p></speech>

It was the unveiling of the Proclamation stone and was a wonderful outdoor event at the courthouse in Castlerea.  I spoke to the fact that yesterday was 100 years since we signed a truce to end the War of Independence and Ireland started to forge its own path.  It was a special occasion and involved everybody and everything.  There was a vintage care rally with cars from that period, including Kitty Kiernan's car.  She was Michael Collins's partner.  Ford Model Ts and other 1920s cars were there and it brought one back in time.  The Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, presided at the event and had a tour around Roscommon in some of those vintage vehicles.</p><p>Given the day that is in it, I am thinking of the businesses that have invested in outdoors dining.  I acknowledge the many businesses that have made a huge outlay and investment.  There are funds there to support them through F&aacute;ilte Ireland and that is open until September.  It is important that we support as much as we can shopping local in our towns and villages.  Recently, <i>ShopBallinasloe.ie</i>won an award for being one of the most innovative groups.  They opened a platform and over 50 businesses in Ballinasloe signed up for the online platform during lockdown.  Businesses are slowly opening up properly but I encourage people to support shopping local.</p><p>I welcome what Senator McGreehan said on the Olympic Games and I congratulate two women from Roscommon, Aoife O'Rourke and Richael Timothy, who are going forward for the Olympics and Paralympics.  I wish them the best.  There are flags flying all around Roscommon and Galway for them.</p><p><i>F&eacute;licititions pour la f&ecirc;te nationale.  C&rsquo;est super d&rsquo;entendre un peu de Fran&ccedil;ais dans le Seanad</i>.</p><p>For our lovely Italians, it was a wonderful celebration yesterday.  I am sure they are celebrating a lot.</p></speech>

He has been married to Marjorie for 67 years.  She has been a stalwart of his election campaigns.  When someone gets elected at 73, it puts it in perspective for us who would be thinking we should be retiring at 73.  When someone becomes chair of the council at 82, they are putting in a long haul.  I wish him a happy birthday as probably the oldest representative at local level since the foundation of the State.  He is still hale and hearty and doing all the work.  He will, no doubt, be at meetings all day today.</p></speech>

It is incredible to think Councillor McGarvey has had such a successful career in what we would consider the autumn of his life.  He is obviously still raring to go and I will send a letter to him on all our behalf today wishing him a happy birthday and continued success.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Dolan talked about the hospitality industry.  Senator Keogan raised some of the concerns that have been shared with her.  The difficulty is that nobody would willingly try to do something that would discriminate against some of the people who are not yet vaccinated but in the absence of any other choices, I am not sure what else we can do other than keep the entire hospitality and tourism sector closed, which is not palatable to any of us.  While people will find bits of the legislation that will be published this afternoon difficult, and I am sure we will all express our concerns about it, I have not heard any other suggestions from any party or Independents about what we would do differently other than just open everything up and have a free-for-all.  That is not something that society is ready for and it would not be wise.  I am mindful that I have not seen the legislation yet.  A large element of the legislation will refer to the future use of antigen testing in Ireland.  Senator Gallagher opened the Order of Business by talking about the pilot project that has successfully been under way for a number of weeks in our university sector.  Some 8,000 staff and students have undergone multiple tests weekly.  The outcome of that will be available to us soon.  Some of us have been talking about it for months.  I am sick listening to myself talking about antigen testing.  It will be more widely used in society as we move into the phase of living with Covid as opposed to trying to deal with some of the horrendous issues that we have been dealing with in the past year.  I thank Senator Dolan for raising the matter.</p><p>Senator McGreehan has asked me to write a letter to Team Ireland, which I will.  We have been spoiled for choice with sports in the past couple of weeks, between tennis, Formula 1, the Tour de France and the football.  It is good to have something to look forward to.  I will do that soon on behalf of all of us.</p><p>Senator O'Reilly talked about the single-use plastics ban, which probably has gone unnoticed in the past week.  We were all busy doing other stuff.  It is welcome and will certainly have an impact on our lives.</p><p>Senator Clifford-Lee, along with all our other colleagues, commended Deputy Ivana Bacik on her superb win at the weekend.  The fact that we need more women is as obvious as the nose on all of our faces.  It is something that we all have to be part of.</p><p>Senator Hoey talked about Disability Pride Month.  It is unfortunate that we have to have special days and events to talk about the impact of the decisions that we make on people with disabilities but it is welcome that we will shine a light on it this July.  I concur with the Senator and ask everybody else to do the same.  We can talk about the difficulties that people face and the invisible challenges that they have every day.  It is important to keep it on the agenda.</p><p>Senator Seery Kearney talked about the terms of reference with regard to the fire safety standard and defects group that has been working on in recent months.  I read with interest this morning that we are at an impasse because the obvious solution for the people on the working group is for the State to provide a fund to make sure that we can compensate those homeowners who, as the Senator rightly says, through no fault of their own find themselves in terrifying situations.  This is not the first time and it will not be the last.  The State needs to be the first port of call for fixing the issue but those people who were responsible for building defective homes that did not meet the standards and regulations that existed at the time need to be made culpable.  While they may have closed their companies so that they cannot be pursued financially, it needs to be ensured that they never build anything else in this country or any other European country again.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the State is unfortunately the last port of call in these cases.  These houses need to be fixed and that is the end of it.</p><p>Senator Ardagh talked about cancer care.  I was mindful, when Paul Reid was doing an interview on Saturday, that we need to get our hospitals back to a scenario where they are dealing with the normal health challenges that people have.  That is why we can never have a lockdown again.  It is empowering to hear that he is of that mindset.  He talked about the further, wider use of antigen testing in our screening process in future.</p><p>Senator Carrigy talked about hospitality and the serious issue of the 18-month backlog with regard to driver's licences.  The Minister said that he has taken on 40 new driving instructors but an 18-month waiting list is unacceptable.  We will have to think outside the box and come up with something different.</p><p>Senator Cassells talked about the online safety and media regulation Bill and the three young men who are only at the start of their professional career and are already legends for what they have done not just on the pitch but, more significantly for most of them, off the pitch.  I thought it was abhorrent for a Conservative MP to state in her WhatsApp group with other Conservative MPs that maybe one of them would be more mindful if he spent more time concentrating on football than on feeding hungry children.  My retort to her is that maybe if she was doing her job, he would not have to spend so much time feeding the hungry children of England.  It is despicable.  <i>Bravo</i>, Rashford.  What he has done in the past year will leave a legacy for generations to come.  A goal that he missed last night will be forgotten in a couple of weeks because I am sure that he will go on to have a successful football career, as will the other two young men.  The online safety and media regulation Bill is something that we need to grab by the scruff of its neck to make sure that our media companies take responsibility.</p><p>This is not to make this about me but I reported a gentleman who called me the C-word, the c-u-n-t word on Saturday, just for pig iron because it happens quite often.  If I was to do it all the time, I would be blue in the face.  I got a lovely response back from Twitter that he has not broken any of its rules.  If he has not broken the rules, then the rules need to be changed.  It is not acceptable that we have such a level of discourse on what we now all take for granted as a daily part of Irish and international life.  We need to take the online safety and media regulation Bill, grab it by the scruff of the neck, and make sure that these people are culpable.  Society is changing.  We sometimes make excuses for the kind of behaviour that happens on social media and state that it is not the kind of behaviour that happens in real life.  These are real people, not pretend people.  I know there are accounts with numbers in the names and such but they are still people.  It is not acceptable and we have to take responsibility for making these changes and to make them quickly.</p><p>Senator Conway asked for a debate on water safety.  I will try to do it as soon as we come back in September.  The suggestion that he made that we should have it as part of a curriculum in second level schools is one that we should champion.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne talked about protecting democracy.  I have not seen what he has seen with regard to the powers for our directly elected mayor in Limerick, which will be the first, but I would be concerned if what he suggests will happen is true.  I will talk to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, and come back to the Senator.</p><p>Senator Marie Sherlock talked about the drug and alcohol task forces and the independence of the chair.  If she sends the letter, I would be happy to support her.  The point of having these is to represent the challenges faced in communities.  They are not to be talking shops that are to be managed and controlled by vested interests that want an outcome.  They have to have at their heart the people living with these challenges to know what kind of a society they live in and life they have.  I would be happy to do anything that I can to help the Senator.  She can let me know.</p><p>Senator Paul Gavan asked for a debate on US troops using Shannon Airport again.  In case he thinks I do not ask, I ask for them and I facilitate any debates that I can.  The ones that do not make the cut are not necessarily down to me but I will certainly make that request again.</p><p>The Senator also raised the TRIPS waiver.  I do not understand the logic behind it other than that we seem to be protecting the profits of big pharmaceutical companies.  There was a report from the World Health Organization on Saturday that only 25% of the world's population is vaccinated.  Here we are thinking that we are deadly in Ireland, with nearly 70% of people having had their first dose and 50% having had their second dose.  If the whole world is not vaccinated, then we will be in a repeating cycle.  It does not make sense to me.  I do not know how I can help the Senator other than to try to have a debate on that when we come back in September, which I can try to organise.</p><p>Senator Boyhan talked about the Land Development Agency.  He is right.  He has been saying for months that there have been significant challenges and that all of the legal challenges that people have taken have ultimately been successful, which tells us that there is something wrong with the process.  We look forward to the new solutions from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.</p><p>Senator Higgins talked about wishing people well on 12 July, which of course we all do.  It is a celebration for that community and the people who live on that part of our island.  I do not understand people burning flags to assert their own culture and causing offence to people of a different culture who live on the same island.  Having a shared island means that we should have respect for each other, even if we do not necessarily agree.  I concur with everything the Senator said.</p><p>Senator Gallagher started the day talking about UniCoV.  We all look forward to the results of that pilot because it will be instrumental in helping Professor Mary Horgan, who was recently appointed to the new antigen task force, to ensure that we all live more safely by using all the screening tools that are available to us as part of social life.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for a genuine alternative to examinership for small and micro companies.  It gives these companies the same access to corporate rescue as larger companies, thus providing them with a genuine opportunity to restructure their debts and continue trading.</p> <p>In light of the economic impacts of the pandemic, the Government made a commitment to review the Companies Act to simplify and improve examinership laws for the small business sector.  The Bill is a key commitment in the programme for Government and for me and is the culmination of a significant body of work by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, and nearly a year's work by my officials and me, including significant consultation with business and industry representatives, with the support of Members of the Oireachtas.  I thank the members of the Oireachtas committee in particular for facilitating the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.  It demonstrated that, when we work together, we can achieve real progress.</p> <p>The Bill delivers a new corporate rescue framework designed specifically for small and micro companies, which are key to our country&rsquo;s economic success and recovery.  The framework is an alternative to examinership that is more cost efficient and capable of conclusion within a shorter period.  As our country emerges from the pandemic, the Bill will ensure that the necessary legal framework is in place to help viable small and microbusinesses stay in business.  Delivering the Bill is reflective of the Government's continued commitment, as well as my own, to our small company sector and the jobs it provides.  Where this sector and the companies that will be able to qualify for the process are concerned, it is worth noting that we are discussing 98% of companies, which support 780,000 workers.  It is a substantial component of our economy.  While I am hopeful that pressure on small businesses is beginning to ease with the gradual reopening of the economy, I recognise that many of these companies, while viable, will nevertheless continue to experience difficulties as we emerge from the crisis.  In that context, the Bill is essential to provide these companies, where necessary, with a clearly defined and accessible rescue process that will give them the breathing room they need to get back on their feet.</p> <p>The Bill's key feature is a novel process that reduces court involvement as far as possible with a view to speeding up the rescue process and reducing the associated costs.  The small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, is initiated by the directors of the company concerned and can proceed without significant court involvement if the company&rsquo;s creditors are positively disposed towards the rescue plan.  The process is capable of conclusion within a shorter timeframe than examinership.  Currently, examinership can run for up to 150 days.  The new process seeks to arrive at a conclusion within 70 days, although this can be suspended where applications to court are required to allow the court the necessary time and flexibility to deal with the matters raised.</p> <p>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 contains the Short Title, commencement provisions and interpretation.</p> <p>Part 2 inserts a new Part 10A into the Companies Act 2014 providing for the SCARP.  This Part, which is divided into 12 chapters, details the legal framework for qualifying for, initiating and the subsequent operation and conclusion of the rescue process.</p> <p>Chapter 1 defines relevant terms specific to the newly inserted Part 10A for the purposes of the operation of the rescue process for small and micro companies.</p> <p>Chapter 2 sets out the requirements that an eligible company must meet to avail of a rescue plan.  It provides that the process adviser, who is a qualified insolvency practitioner, must determine whether the company concerned has a reasonable prospect of survival.  The chapter outlines various criteria that the process adviser may have regard to when making his or her determination on the company&rsquo;s viability.</p> <p>Chapter 3 provides for the appointment of the process adviser by a resolution of the company directors.  The rescue process is commenced by a resolution rather than by an application to court.  The chapter goes on to set out the process adviser&rsquo;s various duties, for example, to keep the original determination as to the viability of the company under constant review and to give notice of his or her appointment to the Companies Registration Office, the relevant court and Iris Oifigi&uacute;il and on the company&rsquo;s website.   It also obliges the process adviser to give notice to employees, creditors and other stakeholders so that they are afforded an opportunity to disclose any fact they consider material to the process.  In this regard, all relevant parties are involved from early on in the process.</p> <p>Chapter 4 provides for the rescue plan process.  It allows for repudiation of contracts where the process adviser considers it necessary for the survival of the company as a going concern.  Repudiation allows the company, subject to court approval where appropriate, to accept or reject formally certain uncompleted contracts to which it is party.  Any party to a contract that suffers loss or damage because it is repudiated becomes an unsecured creditor for the amount of loss or damage.  The Bill provides for repudiation to be dealt with in two ways, those being, by application to court or through an out-of-court process led by the process adviser, who will engage and negotiate with the relevant party.</p> <p>Under chapter 5, the process adviser is required to call a meeting of all creditors and members to present the rescue plan.  The rescue plan is binding without court approval provided at least one impaired class of creditors votes in favour of the plan and no creditor raises an objection to the plan within a 21-day cooling off period.  A rescue plan shall be deemed to have been accepted by a class of creditors when 60% in number representing the majority in value of the claims in that class vote in favour of the rescue plan.</p> <p>Under chapter 6, creditors have the right to object to the rescue plan.  Where that happens, the courts will have a role in adjudicating the matter, as is currently the case with examinership.</p> <p>Chapter 7 provides for the treatment of liabilities of third parties for debts of a company using the rescue process and chapter 8 provides for the conclusion of the rescue process.</p> <p>Chapter 9 incorporates safeguards for creditors such as various enforcement provisions in respect of failure by company directors and process advisers to comply with filing, notice and information obligations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There are also safeguards against, and penalties for, irresponsible and dishonest director behaviour.

These are discrete amendments, which will improve the flow of information to employees as creditors during a liquidation and provide for a dedicated position for employees on the committee of inspection, a committee which may be elected to oversee the liquidation.  Finally, it provides for the application of the temporary amendments made by the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Act 2020 to provide for meetings under the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP, to be held virtually during the Covid-19 period.  I look forward to engagement with Senators.</p></speech>

I welcome this legislation, which is much needed and will play an important role in giving smaller companies an opportunity to survive as we emerge from this pandemic.  We must ensure businesses have an opportunity to recover from the pandemic and that their long-term viability is not impacted by short-term issues caused by a crisis not of their making.  There is so much focus on larger companies and foreign direct investment, which are of course important.  However, we must always remember that small and medium enterprises, SMEs, the length and breadth of this country are the heartbeat of the Irish economy and that small and micro companies represent 98%, as the Minister of State alluded to, of all companies in Ireland.</p> <p>Currently, at least five court applications are required to comply with the processes in an examinership.  This, obviously, adds significant legal expenses to the process of getting court protection and makes it an unviable option for most small and micro companies because of the costs and timeframe involved, about which I will go into further detail.  Allowing small companies with short-term issues to go through an administrative rescue process without the costs and challenges that are part of examinership will give them the best possible opportunity to trade their way back to solvency, which most of them will do.  It is something that has been raised as a key need by business representatives with every Senator I am sure over the past 12 months.  The commitment to providing SMEs with the most effective supports possible in the programme for Government meant it was essential this was addressed.  I am pleased to see Government maintaining that commitment. </p> <p>Certainly, in my heartland of Galway city, many smaller companies are facing challenges as we emerge from Covid in terms of short-term finance despite unprecedented Government supports, which I acknowledge.  This scheme will be of assistance to many, thereby protecting employment and providing companies with the opportunity to emerge from Covid.  The fact that there is also a shorter timeframe is essential for this process.  That it can conclude within a ten-week period, rather than the 150 days which examinership can take, is also very important and welcome.  The shorter timeframe is essential.</p> <p>The legislation will assist companies that support in excess of 800,000 jobs in this country, that employ fewer than 50 people and have a turnover of less than &euro;12 million per annum.  These companies need help now and we must support them.  The unprecedented supports the Government has put in place have been of great assistance.  I speak to business owners in Galway city and county, and in the west, who acknowledge that.  While they are very thankful for the wage subsidy, the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the array of supports that have been given, we all realise these will eventually need to be tapered off.  The ability of companies to restructure with minimal cost and red tape will make a very positive difference to them.  The proposal has already received broad support, in principle, from stakeholders, certainly from people who have engaged with me.  It must also be recognised that it has been supported, in the main, by Members in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>I know the Minister of State has a very busy schedule and I am not sure if he will come before Seanad &Eacute;ireann again this week.  If he does, that is okay, but I wish him and Aideen Ginnell, who are getting married this Thursday, well, and a long and happy life together.  I have no doubt that Aideen will need great patience, which I am sure the lady has.  She will need to have it as she knows the time constraints.  I understand the restrictions are testing for all couples throughout the country.  As wedding numbers are limited to 50, and Robert is from a family of 12, I do not understand how they managed it, but they are where they are.  I take the opportunity, as I have no doubt the Leas-Chathaoirleach will, to wish Robert and Aideen the very best for this Thursday. </p></speech>

I hope everything goes well on Thursday.  I have no doubt that it will.</p> <p>I support this Bill.  The proposals contained in it stem from a 2020 Company Law Review Group report, but I recall there were calls for legislation along these lines during the 2009-10 period when so many companies were failing for so many reasons, which we remember.  I am not sure why this did not happen at the time although I presume it may have been because, at that time, the creditors of those failing businesses were the major banks which were themselves failing and were even banjaxed.  It probably made little sense to change the law at the time since it would have been of little practical assistance to anybody.  It is prudent and welcome that it is being done now.</p> <p>However, it again shows the reactive nature of policymaking in this country.  Just as the examinership process was introduced in a hurry in 1990 to save the Goodman beef empire from the consequences of its over-reliance on exports to Iraq, the proposals before us are a last-minute reaction to the problems faced by small business as we come out of almost 18 months of Covid cold storage.  In particular, small businesses will have to face up to Revenue liabilities, which have been warehoused and put on ice during the Covid crisis.  It should not have taken this looming problem to spur the Government or the Oireachtas into action.  When it comes to the concerns of small businesses we should be thinking ahead more than we do, particularly when it comes to assisting those who are in difficulty through no fault of their own and providing them with a means to get back into health in a way that does not penalise anyone unduly.</p> <p>The examinership process introduced in 1990 has been of great use since then in giving companies the breathing space to engage with creditors and formulate plans to rescue their businesses which may be in difficultly.  However, clearly, it is not an effective process in all cases and is much less likely to be effective for, or appeal to, small and micro companies or to family businesses in particular.  While the process is straightforward in theory, in practice it can be cumbersome, costly and, indeed, intimidating for directors and shareholders.  Five separate court applications are necessary, from start to finish.  This involves legal costs of course, but also other costs such as seeking reports from an independent expert and so on.</p> <p>The Bill dubs this new rescue process the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP.  The SCARP process can be commenced by a resolution of the directors and does not need the permission of a court.  In the round, this removal of the court element requirement from a large number of company rescues will reduce the costs on businesses and the overall burden on directors, shareholders and creditors alike.</p> <p>The timeframe of the process will also be much quicker, thankfully.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Examinerships run for up to five months, which is a very unsatisfactory length of time for any small business to be put through the wringer.  Under the SCARP, a scheme of arrangement will be drawn up within two months.</p><p>It is important that any new system not unfairly prejudice creditors of a business going through the SCARP.  We have to remember that, in most cases, these creditors are themselves small businesses and may face their own pressures.  The Bill contains good protections in this regard.  The golden rule under the existing examinership regime is that, under a rescue scheme, creditors cannot be left any worse off than they would have been had the company been wound up through a liquidation.  That rule is replicated in the Bill before us.</p><p>While the process is taken out of court to a large extent, creditors can object to the SCARP and insist on court approval first.  That would deter against any attempt or possibility that the process would be used to evade or stymie creditors.  If a business is in genuine difficulty, it will be in the interest of creditors to see this resolved, to see the business stabilised and to have the outstanding debts paid, so it is unlikely to be seeking court approval willy-nilly.  This is important.  The safeguards against dishonest or irresponsible conduct by company officers or practices such as reckless trading are to be welcomed.</p><p>Sadly, it seems to me, and no doubt to others, that there will inevitably be a significant rise in business failures in 2021 and 2022.  Most of these will have been unavoidable.  However, some will have been as a direct result of policy choices made by the Government.  The greatest example, of course, concerns the pub, restaurant and hospitality sector, whose full reopening has been delayed by the Government recently, meaning the vast majority will have lost out on a summer season, which they will desperately have needed.  I am aware of the good intentions behind the policy but I worry about whether the right call was made.  I fear that when we look back at the decision to delay reopening in the cold light of day, the cost of it will be seen to have far outweighed the benefits, particularly given the advances we have made regarding vaccinations.</p><p>While the businesses have been kept on life support, there is a danger that they will be brought back to earth with a bang once the supports end.  For that reason, we should do everything we can to assist them to rebuild for the future.</p></speech>

I hope he has a successful week.  Covid might be the reason we want to get this legislation across the line for the summer but it has been a while in the making.  It has been examined by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, and that has involved analysis by practitioners, businesses, unions and academics.  Prior to that, there was public consultation.  The legislation fills a gap in our examinership laws.  It is tailored to meet the needs of small and micro businesses, enabling those that are viable but vulnerable to restructure their debts and, hopefully, keep trading.  There is no better time to do that.</p> <p>Through a mix of grants, loans, tax warehousing and waivers, the Government has supported businesses as much as possible in the Covid crisis.  The Government has been responsive to our calls when we have identified gaps in supports, be they for the self-employed, small businesses or those availing of the Covid restrictions support scheme.  Many a support has come online over the past year.  Despite those supports, some companies still find themselves struggling.  Of the businesses that commenced an insolvency process last year, only 5% went through for examinership.  Under the proposed new mechanism, small firms facing insolvency will be able to cut debt with support from a majority of creditors without the high costs and will be able to do so in a shorter period.</p> <p>The amending legislation today represents a commitment made by the Government to look beyond practical supports and review the Companies Act and regulatory framework to simplify and improve our examinership laws, specifically for the small business sector, and to try to ensure those businesses that can survive will do so, not just during the pandemic but beyond. </p> <p>There are two key areas in the delivery of this new corporate framework, that is, cost and time.  The international framework for examinership is overseen in the courts.  This is expensive and prohibitive for small, struggling companies.  It is not realistic for a small company to engage in this way so we have to address the barriers so it can access protection and support and retain the jobs we desperately need.  This Bill would oversee a process that would reduce the involvement of the courts as much as possible and speed up the rescue process.</p> <p>The aim is to reduce the examinership timeframe from 150 days to 70 days, although there is flexibility to accommodate the courts.  The cost could be lowered from between &euro;80,000 and &euro;100,000 to between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000.  The SCARP is initiated, importantly, by the directors of the small and micro businesses and can commence and proceed without significant involvement of the courts.  It is commenced by resolution of the directors rather than an application to the court, and is overseen by a process adviser.  While taking into account the vulnerability of the business in receivership, it must also be fair to the creditors who, as my colleague Senator Mullen said, are often small businesses themselves.  Creditors will be able to vote in favour of the proposal as long as no creditor raises an objection to the plan within 21 days following the vote.  Small companies have to be competitive and agile in respect of how they react to the reality of business, and the proposed framework complements that.  Ultimately, the process has to be more successful than the liquidation process or it will not work.</p> <p>I would like clarification on virtual annual general meetings.  Is it just for companies going through the process or is it in general?  Small companies, in particular, need to be productive.  It has been recognised that this is the area we need to work on.  Virtual annual general meetings can facilitate a more efficient way of working.  We should consider this if it is not included.</p> <p>SMEs are often referred to as the backbone of the Irish economy.  It is only right, therefore, that they would have equitable access to rescue processes.  Our small business sector represents our neighbours, partners, brothers and sisters and, in my case, the parents of our children's friends.  There are 800,000 employees in the sector, and 78% of the companies operate in areas that are hit especially hard by the pandemic, such as leisure, tourism and hospitality.  Let us get through this pandemic and leave our company law in a better place than we found it.</p></speech>

I welcome this Bill, or these amendments to an existing Act.  The legislation is great.  As a coalition Government, we agreed we would introduce it under the programme for Government.  A year on, we are delivering on that, which is really positive.  Now, as we hope for some sort of post-pandemic Ireland, is an important time to do this.</p> <p>The main objective of the Bill is to provide for a stand-alone rescue framework to help small businesses of up to 50 employees to remain in business during periods of temporary difficulty.  On Senator Mullen's question as to why we did not do this sooner, nobody saw the pandemic coming.  Considering we are still in it, it is not bad that, a year on, we are delivering on that.  Small and micro enterprises comprise 98% of all Irish firms.  I have spoken about SMEs in Ireland but we do not really appreciate the number of jobs and the amount of money they generate.  When thinking about that, we should always bear in mind whether it is a small or micro company that we are supporting.  Wherever possible, we always should support them.  As the preceding Senator said, 800,000 people are employed in the sector.  Many businesses in the sector have been damaged by what has happened in the pandemic.  Retail, tourism, the arts, hospitality and the service industry, which are really strongly represented in my county, Clare, have been affected.  We have all seen at first hand the challenges small businesses have faced.  This Bill is so important because it will hopefully help them find a rescue plan that will cost them less, keep more of them afloat and make it easier on them rather than having them get caught up in courts.  We are all aware of how complicated and costly courts can be.  This Bill is an important amendment to the 2014 legislation.</p> <p>Chambers Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and ISME were all involved in the consultation on this Bill so it is not as if we just tore into it.  There was really good consultation with many people.  It is on listening to those in the sector we are trying to save that we come up with proper solutions, which is what this Bill is doing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I only became the spokesperson for enterprise, trade and employment one year ago but in that year I have been combing through everything that has been happening in government to see what it has been doing for that sector.  It has been really impressive to see the amount of supports, grants, advice and mentoring that has come through every sector and especially for small businesses through the local enterprise offices.  It is a real sign we value that sector of society so much in that so much has gone into that sector in the past year.</p><p>I have had businesses complain they cannot keep up with all the supports and they are so busy working, they have not got time to find them all.  To that end, I have put together a PDF document of every single support available to small and microbusinesses in Ireland, with live links.  I will give it to every Senator here in order that we can share it with all the small businesses.  Anybody who runs a small business will tell you he or she does not have the time to be looking things up.  I find departmental websites quite daunting to navigate at times.  It is good we get that Bill and the information out there on all the supports we have put in place for small businesses.  There are some really good ones.</p><p>I have seen businesses that were never online before coming online and businesses that never use social media or PR tools really upping their game.  People are discovering small businesses that may have been there for years.  Thanks, in some kind of twisted, positive way to the pandemic, they have a presence they never had before.  People are discovering businesses in their areas that they now support.  That is thanks, in no small way, to the supports we have brought to date.  This is another stepping stone in hoping we can try to keep as many small businesses going and not just surviving, but thriving again, post pandemic.</p></speech>

There is more or less unified agreement that there has long been a need for the examinership-lite model and that is what the small company administrative rescue process Bill attempts to deliver.  There are many welcome aspects of the Bill, which outlines the small company administrative rescue process.  However, the success or failure of the process will boil down to two things, namely, speed and cost.</p> <p>The new process must not only be cheaper than the current administrative process, which is estimated to cost an average of between &euro;80,000 and &euro;120,000, but also needs to be quicker.  It is hoped the new process will reduce the costs to between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000, which is extremely welcome.  Any reduction in costs will be welcome if we can achieve it.  However, these costs are only estimates and my concern is that in practice, they could end up being much higher.</p> <p>As for the length of time the new process will take, it is estimated there may be little reduction in the length of time it takes to conclude the new small company administrative rescue process in comparison with normal administration.  As outlined in the legislation, the process could take up to 49 days to produce a rescue plan and it could take even longer to implement it thereafter.  At its core, this legislation is about saving companies and, ultimately, saving jobs.  Therefore, I feel there needs to be further provision for workers.  </p> <p>It is important that a rescue plan for an eligible company does not include a reduction in the number of employees unless this has been done by agreement with employees and their recognised trade union or representative body, save in the case of a voluntary redundancy process.  Any rescue plan should make provision to ensure collective agreements can be and are honoured regardless of what happens to the company into the future.</p> <p>While this legislation may not get the same coverage as other legislation because it is relevant only to small and micro companies, it is important to remember that these companies provide employment to 788,000 workers in this State.  This is significant legislation which, it is to be hoped, will have a wide-ranging and positive impact.  The reality is that the pandemic has taken a significant toll on the economy in general, but especially on small and micro companies.</p> <p>Once Covid-19 restrictions ease this summer and Government support and creditor forbearance reduces, it is clear that a cost-effective restructuring process will be required.  Numerous companies with sound business models incur significant debts for many reasons.  This new process must put those businesses and their workers front and centre and ensure this new process is cheaper and quicker.</p> <p>We are discussing liquidations.  I need to mention the Minister of State has a report on his desk, the Duffy Cahill report, for many years now.  Provision must be made to look after workers in a liquidation scenario.  We have had Clerys, Debenhams and TalkTalk closures and a list of other examples.  We have seen closures in Limerick at Debenhams and a recent announcement of the Gap store closing in Limerick in September, with the loss of 26 jobs.</p> <p>Every time this happens, we say we cannot allow it to happen again.  I urge the Minister of State to act on the recommendations and select whatever is the preferred option and to talk to the Opposition. We will not do anything other than try to be constructive and get this done.  We need to ensure workers are not left high and dry by the process because that will not do anyone any favours.  This process will benefit companies and its ultimate objective is to save the businesses and jobs.</p> <p>There is another body of work to be done to ensure those jobs are decent jobs.  That is the work of the trade union movement, working co-operatively with progressive parties like Sinn F&eacute;in to ensure we can make work better.  We need to recognise that while we have legislation to help save businesses, we also need legislation that protects workers in a liquidation because very often they are left aside.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that on Sunday the Lilywhites will come between the celebrations but that is the way it has to be.  There is no doubt the aims of this Bill can be considered reasonable.  The objective is to put in place a small companies administrative rescue process, SCARP, to effectively reduce the number of companies that go into liquidation and instead give them access to an affordable rescue plan.  There can be no doubt but that in a Covid-19 Ireland, many companies are struggling and, unfortunately, are struggling to survive.  Every effort must always be made to ensure companies, under the pressure of Covid-19-related debts and commitments, have a choice to avail of the new SCARP provided for in this Bill, rather than liquidation.</p> <p>In the D&aacute;il, our enterprise spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised a number of concerns and issues with the Bill, which I would like to raise once again with the Minister of State.  The first is the speed at which the Bill has been brought forward.  This Bill is more than 60 pages long and is set to become the bedrock of legislation in this area for the considerable future, if passed.  In his contribution in the D&aacute;il, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in posed a question as to the compliance of this Bill with European Directive No. 2019/1023.</p> <p>Directive No. 2019/1023 is, as we know, an alternative to liquidation for companies of all sizes in all European countries, which will reduce the current level of liquidations.  This offers the same function as it is hoped will this Bill.  We are told the Government has asked for a derogation until 2024 for the implementation of this directive, yet we have before us the ideal opportunity to implement legislation that would comply.  It would seem the question remains as to why the Government will not make this legislation compliant and I ask the Minister of State to address this important point.  As was said in the D&aacute;il last week, surely it would be far safer and more effective to make this Bill before us now compliant, rather than try to make amendments at some future date.</p> <p>Given the recent events throughout various sectors of Irish industry, which have already been referenced by colleagues, I have to raise my concern as to how this Bill, if passed, will treat workers.  My colleague submitted a number of amendments that were not accepted in our attempt to address what we see as some flaws in this legislation.  Those concerns remain and given the time afforded to this Bill, those concerns remain for the workers.</p> <p>As mentioned in the D&aacute;il, the legislation, unlike similar legislation in New Zealand, does not offer enough protection for workers.  This Bill does not offer the protection, unlike that passed in New Zealand in which workers are excluded as a protected class of creditor.  Under section 558N, any equality claim should be excluded from the court's power to stay proceedings and under section 558L unpaid awards to workers should be excluded from write-down without the need for a worker to actively assert that right as a creditor.</p> <p>There must be a fear for some sectors of Irish industry in which workers are unrepresented by a union that workers' rights, without the explicit protection of a unique class of creditor, could be subject to some exploitation.  There may be a situation in which workers' terms and conditions could be attacked or undermined as part of the offence of owners' contracts, as was threatened in a recent dispute.  I want to raise again the time afforded to the Bill.  We obviously accept the situation we are in, especially those businesses, as I have already outlined, but speed can often lead to more problems than anticipated and we hope this is not the case.</p> <p>As we said in the D&aacute;il, we wish we could give unqualified support for the Bill.  There can be no doubt cheaper and easier access to a rescue plan would always be preferable to liquidation but in light of the issues I have once again raised with the Minister of State, we worry there may be flaws and it may be the workers who will end up being exploited most if these flaws are not addressed.  I thank the Minister of State once again for joining us today and look forward to his replies.</p></speech>

I come from a small business background and I am aware of the plight of small businesses, especially in times of Covid.  We are starting to come out the other side.  I have been working with many small businesses that are either feeling the pinch or have found recovery hard.  The Bill comes at an opportune time, and the fact that we are updating the 2014 legislation is most welcome.  Some 778,000 workers are employed by small companies.  I know that we have to protect employees but unless we can protect the companies they are working for, they will not have any companies to be employed by.  That is something we have to keep in mind.</p><p>Many small businesses, especially across the hospitality and service sectors, have really felt the pain.  As has been mentioned, while there has been a delay to the opening up and expansion of the hospitality sector, many businesses have not been able to open because they did not have outside facilities.  I welcome the fact that Cabinet is looking at opening up these businesses.  The fact that 17 companies made submissions to this shows that there was a real interest in it.  I know that key stakeholders engaged with it as well.  The fact that small businesses have an equal footing with some of the larger companies is to be welcomed.  The period of examinership has been reduced from 150 days down to 70 days and the costs are being kept down as maybe the cases are not appearing in court.  Some of the financial institutions have not been good in working with small businesses and that is what I am finding from listening to them.  This Bill will strengthen the foothold of small businesses.  Senator Gavan referred to Debenhams and Gap in Limerick.  Both of those businesses closed and many employees were hit by that.  While I know that Debenhams is a bigger company and it has a bigger sister company, Gap in Limerick had fewer than 25 employees.  It ended up being closed down and the staff did not get a lot out of it.</p><p>The rescue plan has been put in place and it should be binding on all members and creditors where it is approved by 60% in number of one class of impaired creditors representing a majority in value of the claim.  This is referred to as a cross-class cramdown.  The process does not require an application to the court in circumstances where no creditors object to the plan.  These are most welcome because any of the small businesses I have been talking to are really appreciative that these changes are being brought in.  I want to wish the legislation all the best because it is good that small businesses are being helped along the way.  I compliment the Minister of State and the T&aacute;naiste on all the work they have done on this and for seeing any problems that small businesses are facing.  I wish the legislation safe passage.</p></speech>

According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, there are nearly 1 million people employed by SMEs in this country.  According to the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank, a quarter of these SMEs could be vulnerable to liquidation.  Employment and livelihoods are at risk and the small company administrative rescue process could be vital in saving many of them.  It is important to make one thing clear: the Bill before us does not solve this issue.  In some instances, the rescue process will only kick the problems that SMEs face further down the road.  With continuing lockdowns, mass uncertainty and no clear policy or guidelines coming from the Government, however, the Bill is vital.  According to a regulatory impact analysis that we received in respect of this Bill, the World Bank is clear on one thing: there is no consensus on an optimal insolvency model specifically suitable for SMEs.  Our insolvency rates are low but according to further World Bank commentary, it took 13 quarters from the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 before OECD countries reached a peak of insolvent liquidations.  On foot of that, it is prudent to establish an efficient insolvency regime in this country because the worst is yet to come for SMEs and their employees.</p> <p>While the Bill may be necessary in light of the state in which SMEs find themselves, the question must be asked as to whether we are looking at a real solution or if we are continuing to patch up a problem that we have created.  The problem is lockdown - the State's intervention in the normal operation of our economy - and the continued uncertainty, with no co-ordination and unfair treatment of businesses.  Some 78% of SMEs operate in sectors that are moderately or highly affected by the pandemic.  These are the sectors which the Government and NPHET called non-essential.  I would like to remind everyone that there is no form of employment or business that is non-essential.  There is a complete lack of respect from this Government and public health toward SMEs.  While this Bill would help viable companies survive, it would not help all the companies affected by the Government's policy these past 18 months to survive.  It is too little, too late.</p> <p>There are zombie companies operating in Ireland.  These are companies that are not viable, that cannot service their debt in a growth economy and that the rescue process will not save.  However, we will pump them with support under the false illusion that an end is in sight.  These companies are already dead; we are just keeping them alive with life support.  This is a positive end for some but many will not survive.  Where is the end?  Where is the plan?</p> <p>We are considering this Bill and the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill today, both of which are designed to help business as we emerge from the pandemic.  Are we emerging from it?  We select dates for reopening and then we change them.  There is no clear plan or goal and, in the meantime, we are passing legislation that is designed to keep the show on the road.  The show is over for many companies.  Even if it is not over and even if the rescue process will help them survive, the headache, heartache and hurt that the rescue process will cause for creditors and business owners is nothing to be commending.  The companies Bill is necessary and the rescue process is more accessible to SMEs than examinership is but at the end of the day, we have failed businesses in this country.  This process will save some businesses and it will not save many which, if we had treated them as essential and important, and as they deserved to be treated, would not require the rescue process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1689" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#DD00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  As he embarks on another collaboration this week, I wish him and Aideen the best of good health and happiness in the times ahead.</p> <p>The Bill is extremely welcome.  As the Minister of State indicated, the purpose of it is to save companies and protect jobs, which is hugely important.  Kildare County Council, together with the local enterprise office, LEO, and County Kildare Chamber, published its economic strategy last week for attracting new investment and sustaining industry and enterprise and ensuring long-term sustainable goals.  When we look at the statistics in that strategy, we can see that small businesses make up 92% of the active businesses in Kildare.  That is incredible.  Some 92% of the rates we receive in Kildare are from the type of business the Minister of State is looking to support.  While Kildare has the second highest level of foreign direct investment in the country, the fact is that 92% of our small, family run and local businesses will be helped by this is noteworthy.</p> <p>While our rescue framework of examinership is internationally recognised and successful in its own right, the associated costs mean that it may well be beyond the reach of small enterprises and microbusinesses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This Bill ensures that there is an alternative framework.  Speed is the essence in this process to reduce bureaucracy for small businesses.  From talking to small businesses in Kildare I am aware that is one of the biggest problems they have.  I welcome the work done by Senator Garvey in producing a document so that we have all the information.  I often get calls from people who raise the myriad administration and paperwork to add to the hard work people put in every hour that they can to keep their businesses sustainable and afloat.  The form-filling and applications add to the plethora of work involved.  For that reason, the Bill is very welcome.</p><p>Companies right across the country continue to feel the negative impacts of the pandemic on the normal operation of business.  It has been most difficult for people.  However, we have also seen the flexibility of small businesses who have looked around and become creative in terms of what they can do.  Evidence from the 2008 recession highlighted that small business creation was the key driver in the recovery of the economy and in creating the majority of new jobs following the recession.  Therefore, while revenue has fallen for a large proportion of SMEs since the onset of Covid, exploiting new opportunities has been and will be a key focus.</p><p>The report of the SME task force highlighted the importance of entrepreneurial spirit to Irish society, not just in economic and employment terms but in creating a resilient, innovative community force.  Local businesses are our local champions.  They make a hugely important contribution to developing a resilient society.  I listened recently to a podcast by David McWilliams in which he spoke about the importance of developing an entrepreneurial spirit in young people at school.  That has led to success in countries such as Germany.  We tend to emphasise service-driven jobs more, but by putting measures such as this in place, the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is advancing and making more attractive the opportunity for people to be entrepreneurial.  Covid and Brexit together have highlighted vulnerabilities in the small business sector, but the opportunity is also there to show how quickly it has been to adapt and show resilience and flexibility.  Among the key measures the State must take is to accelerate high-speed broadband, develop remote working hubs and bring in measures such as the Bill before us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#EE00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, to the House.  I also welcome the Bill, which represents a lifeline for small and medium-sized businesses and gives them the opportunity to restructure their debts and allow them to continue trading.</p> <p>Throughout Covid, the Government has introduced numerous schemes to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, which have been very successful, but a lot of business owners were under severe pressure with regard to the liquidity and sustainability of their business.  This was particularly felt among the small and micro companies who employ more than 750,000 people in sectors such as retail, service and the hospitality industry, industries which have been severely affected by Covid-19 over the past 15 months.</p> <p>It is hoped to reduce the cost of the rescue process to between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000.  However, this can still be prohibitive to some small companies.  I hope that some mechanism can be put in place to deal with this issue.</p> <p>A number of factors continue to cause concern for small business.  One of those is public liability, where a high percentage of businesses still have high premiums despite being closed, and a large number are now receiving significant premium increases despite a reduction in claims.  I welcome the work done by the Government in recent times, but the fact is we have an insufficient number of underwriters in this country for public liability insurance.  We must ensure the viability of small and micro businesses post-Government supports, so it is necessary that we tackle this issue immediately.</p> <p>The second factor is high rents.  The Small Firms Association has pointed out that the greatest risk of insolvency comes from overseas contracts, in particular leases with rents exceeding current market rents.  Post-Covid, some categories of rent may fall, as less fortunate businesses close, which would mean new entrants would have a distinct advantage, as well as large companies that can avail of examinership.  Most, but not all, landlords will reduce rent to market levels.  We need a mechanism to allow businesses to exit unaffordable rent that may be above market levels.</p> <p>I also want to mention the numerous schemes that have been expanded in recent years, which I welcome, from paternity leave to sick leave, the increase in the minimum wage and increased regulations.  Business owners would love to implement all these schemes, but for a significant number it may make their business non-viable.  We must discuss these extra costs and also what is being proposed in terms of future taxes on employers.</p> <p>It is also important that we protect the small and micro firms who may be creditors of a business that enters this process.  It is key that the rescue plan satisfies the test on ensuring the best interests of the creditor, which must provide the creditor with a better financial outcome than if the company in question were liquidated while also ensuring its viability into the future.</p> <p>Ultimately, this legislation is about saving companies and saving jobs while also looking after workers' rights.  It has never been more important for local people to support local industries and the local hospitality sector.  I am working on a project with Longford Chamber of Commerce and Industry, traders' groups around the county and the county tourism committee to develop a Longford voucher card.  We are trying to get all businesses in Longford involved in it.  We hope that all companies will purchase gift cards and that when they are purchasing gifts for Christmas, they will purchase a Longford card that must be spent in Longford.  That will keep the money within the county.</p> <p>I welcome the announcement by the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, this morning on the 60 jobs to be provided by the Ardonagh Group in Mullingar.  I look forward to more such announcements in future over his term in the Department.  I hope a few jobs will come across the county boundary into my county of Longford, where he has done a lot of work since he was elected to the D&aacute;il in 2011.</p> <p>I extend my best wishes to the Minister of State and to Aideen.  I was unaware that his wedding was coming up this week until it was mentioned.  I wish him well and good health to both of them in the future.</p></speech>

I took note of them all.</p> <p>I thank everybody for their good wishes.  I will pass them on to Aideen later.  I am not sure she would have expected her name to be bandied about in the Seanad today but that is the price one pays for being married to a politician.  She will welcome the good wishes, but I am not sure she will welcome her name being mentioned in the Seanad.  I thank all for their good wishes, which I appreciate.</p> <p>I also thank Senators for the positive commentary on the Bill before us today.  Many speakers rightly pointed to the significance of the SME sector to the economy.  Depending on the report one reads, the number of people directly employed in the sector ranges from 800,000 to 1 million people.  It is crucially important to the economy.  That is the reason I prioritised this piece of legislation when I was appointed Minister of State.  That is also the reason it was a priority in the programme for Government.  Some have asked why it did not come in years ago and why it has taken so long, while others have asked why it is being rushed.</p> <p>The Company Law Review Group initially examined the matter.  That body has the necessary expertise from a legal perspective in insolvency and company law, but there is also representation from the trade unions who ensure employees have a voice in the negotiations.  We conducted public consultations and we received approximately 20 substantive submissions on the matter.  The process was also aided by the good work of my officials and the Office of the Attorney General.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Robert Troy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2305"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2305&amp;amp;pid=RobertTroy&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I again thank the Oireachtas committee for waiving pre-legislative scrutiny to ensure this Bill came before the Oireachtas before the summer recess.  It is so important that this Bill is enacted because we are talking about ensuring that viable businesses have the opportunity to restructure in a cost-efficient and timely way.  It is about protecting viable businesses and giving them the opportunity to restructure in a cost-efficient and timely way.  While the existing examinership process is internationally recognised as a very good one, the cost of it is prohibitive for many of our smaller businesses.  This will no longer be the case.</p><p>I take issue with one point mentioned, which was that businesses were not supported but were neglected and thrown to the winds by the Government.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Government did not take decisions to bring in restrictions lightly.  It took decisions to bring in restrictions based on public health advice to protect the public health of our citizens.  In doing so, a range of supports were put in place, such as the CRISS, the restart and the restart grant plus schemes and the wage subsidy.  In July of this year, various bodies representing industry requested that certainty be given to those schemes and that is what has happened.</p><p>We now want to ensure that we come out of that.  It is true that we were unable to meet a deadline, or an aspirational date, given a number of weeks ago.  However, in the last two weeks, representatives of the hospitality industry, whether they were vintners, publicans, hoteliers or restaurateurs, worked collectively with Government and officials, for which I compliment them, to bring about a workable solution to ensure that as many people as possible can go in to premises and these businesses can reopen in a safe environment.  That goes to show the determination on this side of the House to protect public health and to also ensure that we protect jobs and businesses.  That is the sole aim of this legislation.</p><p>A number of queries were raised.  Senator Mullen mentioned the protection of creditors because some creditors are themselves small businesses.  There is a provision within the legislation that if a creditor is unhappy with a decision he or she can appeal it in the courts, so creditors are protected.  </p><p>Senator Currie mentioned virtual AGMs.  These are a temporary measure brought in as part of the Covid Bill in 2021, which has been extended to the end of this year.  SCARP will also benefit from that Bill until the end of this year.  At this time, a decision has not been taken to make virtual AGMs permanent because there are questions about whether shareholders are afforded the same adequate scrutiny they receive at a physical shareholders' AGM.  Virtual AGMs have been extended on a temporary basis until the end of the year while further analysis is conducted.  They are there until the end of the year, but we will have to make a decision on whether to further extend them before the end of this year.  </p><p>I compliment Senator Garvey on the work she is doing.  In our Department, we are working with an SME task force to ensure there is a one-stop portal where businesses can go in future to ensure they are acutely aware of all the supports that are available.  The Senator is right in stating that there are many supports out there.  Some supports have even helped people to diversify into new areas and businesses.  I was surprised and struck by how many businesses took an opportunity from the challenge.  Some businesses have done better in the past 18 months and more luck to them. </p><p>Senator Gavan mentioned timeframes.  The 49-day timeframe was deemed to be fair since adequate notice periods have to be given to creditors and the process adviser must be given adequate time to do his or her work and bring forward a restructuring plan.  If there is no need to go to court, 49 days is the outer time limit.  If things are not complicated, there is nothing to say that the process cannot be concluded within a shorter timeframe.  </p><p>Senators Gavan and Wall raised the issue of employees as creditors.  Under the SCARP process, employees have the same protections they have under the examinership process.  There is no difference or dilution of employees' rights in this process as is the case in the examinership process.  Both Senators also raised, as did Senator Byrne, the issue of collective redundancies.  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy English, and I have been working on this issue for the last 12 months.  I acknowledge the contribution of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which has been working with us.  We published a plan of action on collective redundancies in June of this year.  Some of the suggestions in that plan have been included in this Bill but the key element of the splitting of company assets is under review at the moment by the CLRG.  It is envisaged they will report back to us in the autumn of this year.  It is my firm intention that the recommendations that emanate from the CLRG will be implemented in a timely fashion.  </p><p>Senator Carrigy acknowledged the announcement today of 60 jobs in Mullingar.  It is a very positive development and it goes to show that there is an emphasis on ensuring investment in the regions.  The regions benefit from these types of job announcements because they offer a whole suite of incentives for businesses.  Mullingar is a good place in which to work and live, with many amenities, and it also has all the necessary infrastructure that is present in any other part of Ireland.  It is a very welcome development in Mullingar.  I assure Senator Carrigy that the Industrial Development Agency, IDA, plan launched in January of this year placed a major emphasis on ensuring that 50% of all new IDA investments under the lifetime of its 2021-24 plan will be concentrated on the regions.  We are determined, as a new Government, to ensure balanced regional development.  I assure the Senator that Longford is foremost in my mind, as it is in his.  I have no doubt we will also have good news for Longford in the not-too-distant future.  If we in the Department can be of any assistance in rolling out his scheme, which is a very good scheme and I wish him luck with it, we will be only too happy to help.  </p><p>I again thank Senators for their contributions today and for contributing so positively to the scheme.  This scheme will make a real difference to our small and medium-sized enterprises that are viable but, because of the hugely challenging trading environment they have had to endure over the past 18 months, need an opportunity to restructure.  This Bill will give them the opportunity to come out from under a shroud of debt, to restart, save their businesses and, just as importantly, save jobs that are reliant on those businesses.  I understand we are bringing the remaining Stages of this Bill through the Seanad tomorrow so, hopefully, we will be able to conclude it in advance of the summer recess.</p></speech>

This legislation will give effect to some of the decisions announced on 1 June as part of the Government's economic plan, which sets out a new phase of supports for this next stage of recovery as businesses reopen.  This Bill is relatively short but it provides certainty to businesses as public health restrictions are eased and allows them to plan ahead as they reopen and resume normal activity.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners and the staff who operated the various schemes, including the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, that provided much needed support to businesses in a very responsive way.</p> <p>The Bill is relatively short and contains 16 sections.  In the time available to me, I will run through some of the detail of the main sections of the Bill.  In brief, the first 12 sections deal with the various business supports and the later sections deal with amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 and the financial resolution passed by the D&aacute;il on 19 May. </p> <p>Section 2 provides for the extension of the employment wage subsidy scheme to 31 December 2021 and the retention of the current enhanced subsidy rates until 30 September 2021.  The EWSS is a central pillar of our response to this pandemic, supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping to maintain the link between employers and employees.  As of 8 July 2021, direct subsidy payments of over &euro;3.8 billion have been made with an additional &euro;627 million given in PRSI relief to over 50,500 employers in respect of over 609,700 workers.</p> <p>Sections 3 and 4 make a number of changes in respect of the Covid restrictions support scheme, including the extension of the scheme to September 2021.  In addition, section 4 provides for enhanced restart week payments under the scheme for businesses reopening after a period of restrictions.  The section also provides for a double week payment of the CRSS from the week commencing 5 July for a period of two weeks, subject to the statutory cap of &euro;5,000 per week.  I remain convinced that this scheme has achieved its objective of providing targeted support to businesses that were forced to close or restrict access to their premises on foot of public health restrictions.  As of 8 July, there are 22,800 businesses with 26,800 premises registered with Revenue for the CRSS.  Some &euro;647 million has been claimed by businesses under the scheme, with almost 12,000 premises claiming restart payments as the economy has begun to reopen. </p> <p>Section 5 provides for the business resumption support scheme, BRSS, which is a new support for businesses that were significantly impacted throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  To qualify under the scheme, a business must be able to demonstrate that its turnover during the defined specified period of 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 will be no more than 25% of its turnover in 2019.  Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim for a payment calculated on the basis of three weeks at 10% of the first &euro;20,000 weekly turnover, and 5% thereafter, based on average turnover for 2019-----</p></speech>

I knew I brought them over.  I am sorry about that.  I appreciate the Senator's intervention.  It is important that people have a copy of the script.  Qualifying businesses will be able to make a claim for a payment calculated on the basis of three weeks at 10% of the first &euro;20,000 weekly turnover, and 5% thereafter, based on average turnover for 2019, and will be subject to a maximum payment of &euro;15,000.</p> <p>This new scheme is designed to support some of the businesses worst affected by the pandemic, especially those that continue to be significantly impacted even after the easing of public health restrictions.  Anchors necessarily included in the CRSS, such as the requirement to have a fixed business premises and that access to this premises was restricted or prohibited, are not included in the BRSS.  That is very important issue that many raised with regard to businesses that were impacted but which did not have a business premises which was restricted during the course of the pandemic.  That will help many wholesalers and so on who do not have a premises people come to.  Therefore, businesses such as taxi drivers and musicians who meet the eligibility criteria will receive this payment.  In addition, the scheme will be open to certain sectors which did not qualify for CRSS because of specific tax treatments, such as charities and sporting bodies.  It is intended that the registration for the BRSS will open in September.</p> <p>Section 6 provides that the reduced rate of VAT of 9% applying on a temporary basis to hospitality and tourism related goods and services will be extended until 31 August 2022.  That represents quite an extension at this stage.  The next sections of the Bill, sections 7 to 12, deal with tax debt warehousing.  The period where liabilities arising can be warehoused will be extended to the end of 2021 for all eligible taxpayers, with an interest free period during 2022.  Overpayments of the EWSS will also be included in the scheme.  Debt warehousing has provided more than 86,000 individual businesses with vital liquidity support.  At the end of June, some &euro;2.4 billion of tax debt had been warehoused.  The main components were VAT at &euro;1.3 billion and employer PAYE at &euro;1.1 billion.  </p> <p>I will now talk about the 10% rate of stamp duty charge which was introduced through a financial resolution on 19 May 2021.  The Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 was amended by the insertion of a new section 31E titled "Stamp duty on certain acquisitions of residential property".<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The purpose of this new stamp duty is to provide a significant disincentive to the practice of multiple purchases by institutional investors of large parts or, indeed, of whole housing estates before they reach the market, thus denying first-time buyers the opportunity to purchase a home.  It does this by imposing a 10% charge where ten or more liable residential units are required in any 12-month period.  However, apartments are exempt from this charge, as are houses purchased by local authorities and approved housing bodies.  There is a requirement to put this resolution on a permanent statutory footing within four months of commencement.  I am doing this through section 13 of this Bill.  Senators should note that aside from a number of technical amendments, this section reflects what is contained in the financial resolution.</p><p>In addition to the above, I bring Senators&rsquo; attention to two significant changes being made in relation to the stamp duty exemption in the Bill.  First, section 14 provides for an exemption from the 10% stamp duty rate for private sector participants in the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  That scheme provides for an approved housing body or, since 2018, a private company, to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage from a lender if it enables the householder to remain in their home as a social housing tenant.  While approved housing bodies were exempt from the 10% rate under the terms of the financial resolution, the private company aspect was not.  Section 14 corrects that. </p><p>Second, section 15 was introduced to this Bill by way of a D&aacute;il Committee Stage amendment.  It provides that where a residential unit that is subject to the new rate of stamp duty is acquired and then within 24 months is leased to a local authority for social housing purposes, the stamp duty paid over and above the pre-existing rates that apply to acquisitions of residential property will be refunded.   This provision, contained in both sections 14 and 15, was introduced on the advice of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien.</p><p>In conclusion, the Government has kept its promise that there will be no cliff-edge supports to businesses.  It is extending and enhancing the supports to businesses as they reopen.  The new business resumption support scheme will provide additional support to businesses that have been worst affected by the restrictions imposed due to the pandemic.  The EWSS and CRSS will be extended.  The tax debt warehousing scheme will be extended to the end of this year, with no interest charged throughout 2022.  In addition, the Bill places the financial resolution agreed in the D&aacute;il on 19 May 2021 on a permanent legislative footing and addresses certain other aspects of stamp duty from multiple purchases of houses.  I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#NN00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Fleming, to the House to talk about this important Bill.  First, we have seen an unprecedented level of support by the State for businesses since March 2020 and throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has not just been for businesses, of course, but also for employees, for the protection of jobs and for the links between employees and employers.  This has been important to sustain businesses throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>Unfortunately, when this started, nobody realised the length of time that it would involve.  Thankfully, changes were made within the European Union fiscal rules to allow for sufficient borrowing to support businesses.  Those supports have been directed to keep jobs and businesses afloat, and to provide the various range of supports including the pandemic unemployment payment.  I welcome this Bill, which allows for the continuation of various supports, including the EWSS, the CRSS and new schemes, such as the new business resumption support scheme.  All of these schemes constitute an unprecedented level of support.</p> <p>The debt warehousing initiative is important for business and corporations to provide financial security, as well as certainty for when they have to pay debts.  It provides that certainty for businesses.  A fixed date will provide clarity and certainty to businesses in relation to their tax liabilities for the remainder of 2021.  In 2019, the VAT rate was reduced to 9% for a number of years for the hospitality sector to try to kick-start that sector in difficult economic times and to create jobs in tourism and in all areas of the hospitality and tourism sector.  That rate was increased a number of years ago and reduced again as a response to the pandemic and its threat to jobs within the hospitality and tourism sector.  They have gone through a difficult period over the last 14 to 15 months.  This measure provides certainty out to 31 August 2022.</p> <p>The stamp duty issue hit the headlines a number of weeks ago, particularly in relation to an estate in Kildare.  The Government acted quickly to respond to that by making changes to the rate of stamp duty applying to certain acquisitions of ten or more residential properties.  It was important to provide certainty on this because it was a great concern to many would-be first-time buyers to see properties and whole estates being snapped up by institutional investors.  Therefore, I welcome the change that was made at that time and has now been put into legislation.  There has been some confusion in the last couple of weeks about the coming change with regard to the 2,400 homes that are being leased back to the State.  There will still be calls for clarity to ensure it relates to those with pre-existing arrangements that were made prior to the changes being implemented on 19 May 2021.  This is an important area because we need homes.  We certainly do not need disincentives to the provision of homes, whether they are social homes, affordable homes or anything like that.  At the same time, we need to ensure this is not a sweetheart deal but is there to ensure those homes are being provided for genuine people who are on the housing list and are living in this country.  I know that the Minister of State has given some clarity on that.  I am sure it could be debated further on Committee Stage or Report Stage.  I thank the Minister of State for being here today to discuss this important legislation.</p></speech>

I spoke before on the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021.  I welcome all the things the Minister of State has done to date, but I have some concerns.</p><p>KPMG has issued an informative report on the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2021, calling it &ldquo;an important step in providing clarity and support for businesses as they reopen and resume normal trading following Covid-19 restrictions&rdquo;.  I agree that businesses require clarity.  I agree that businesses require further supports.  I agree that this is what the Bill aims to achieve.  However, I do not agree that we are working towards reopening and resuming trade for business in this country.  I do not agree that more money equates to more clarity or support.  I do not agree with all aspects of this Bill.  For example, I do not agree with the fact that the Government refuses to rectify and continues to cover up the economic mess that Covid-19 restrictions have caused.</p><p>It is necessary to extend supports because we continue to leave enterprise in this country in complete darkness.  Over the last 18 months, businesses in the service industry have not known when they can open, or how long they can remain open for.  Extending supports will keep them floating in the uncertainty this Government has created.  However, extending supports is not a fix.  Support is not indefinite.  Financial supports use taxpayers&rsquo; money to mask the problems that the Government will not face.</p><p>We are facing problems.  Per head of population, Ireland is set to have the highest debt in Europe this year.  According to officials in the Department of Finance, it will be one of the highest <i>per capita</i>debts in the world.  This debt is not forecast to fall, but to rise.  We are &euro;20,000 above the EU average.  We will be even more above this average unless we take action.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What does action mean?  Action does not mean more financial supports.  Action does not mean waiting to see.  Action means opening up.   Action means getting business back.  Action means changing course because the one we are on is clearly not working.  If the Government refuses to take action, this Bill is necessary.  We cannot let businesses suffer at the hands of Government-imposed restrictions on their trade.</p><p>There is a provision in this Bill that cannot be supported in or out of lockdown, namely, section 15.  Section 15 allows vulture funds to profit from their bulk-purchasing of housing in this country.  For how long have we spent telling the Government that this is wrong?  For how long have we discussed vulture funds and cuckoo funds?  For how long are we going to have to talk about them still?  The Minister for Finance placed a 10% stamp duty on bulk purchases a short while ago.  He claimed this would be a "deterrent" to developers who buy up all residential property in the country.  Now, going back on its assurances, the Government has devised section 15.  Section 15 states that if the houses that vulture funds snap up are leased back to the local authority, the stamp duty is dropped.  The vulture funds profit.  The housing crisis continues.</p><p>We adopt short-term solutions in this country.  I have said before that this Bill masks one problem, the troubling economic situation we are ignoring, and it creates another, an opportunity for vulture funds to profit.   This is not a viable way to legislate.  Businesses need our support, but support involves more than money.  Support is action, and that support does not involve giving vulture funds a free pass.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#OO00200"><p>Little did we know in March 2020 that we would still be dealing with a pandemic in July 2021.  It must be acknowledged that, without the support of the Government, most businesses would have collapsed.  We must also acknowledge how the Government reacted when it came across things that were not working out or did not quite fit specific sectors.  It rearranged supports to suit them.  I would not be in business today without the support.  The employment wage subsidy scheme has been a godsend to the industry, and the Covid restrictions support scheme has been vital for us in staying afloat.</p> <p>This Bill is introducing another support for businesses that were left out of the loop.  It shows that the Government is willing to listen and determine how it can support business.  The business resumption support scheme is new, and that has to be recognised.</p> <p>The VAT reduction for my industry has been vital.  I have always said openly, including here, that this was all about trying to get the margin to a level that allowed businesses to pay their bills.  The reduction of 4.5% is critical in this regard.</p> <p>I would like to see the warehousing scheme tweaked a little further.  The Minister of State cannot extend it until 2023 or 2024.  Warehousing is a great concept and the scheme is great.  It is a winner for everybody.  It does not cost the State any money but provides a huge amount of working capital credit and cash liquidity for businesses on the ground.  I recognise the amendments that have been made regarding the scheme.</p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to focus on section 15, which has already been referred to and which is the sole section the Opposition has jumped on for the past week.  It covers the 10% stamp duty rebate on long-term leasing.  It must be acknowledged that the Government acknowledges this is not the best way to do business but it is a way of dealing with housing and delivering homes in the short term.  While we try to turn the vehicle in a different direction, it is delivering homes.  It is delivering homes today.  Members of the Opposition, when on the radio, keep mentioning vulture funds, cuckoo funds and investment funds but never say where the houses are going.  They never talk about the people who are getting them.  They never say the houses are for social housing.  They are for people with complex needs, including people who have been on the social housing list for seven, eight, nine or ten years.  I wonder whether the very same politicians would not send out a letter congratulating an applicant on getting a house under the scheme.  Would they recommend that the applicant not accept a house under the scheme because of the 10% stamp duty rebate?  Would they advise the applicant not to take the house because they do not agree with the scheme?  We will not hear them saying that because they will not say it.  They will send out a letter saying they are glad to assist the applicant in securing a 25-year lease on a home.  They will not mention the stamp duty refund.</p> <p>This comes with a little frustration over what happened in Wicklow last week.  With all due respect to Senator Gavan, I am not referring to him directly, but his party has to be called out on its hypocrisy.  Wicklow has 4,500 families on the housing list.  Bray, whose land is so scarce, proposed a scheme for social housing on public land but the Sinn F&eacute;in councillors decided they did not want that.  The party's members have to stop talking from both sides of their mouths.  If Sinn F&eacute;in is not supportive of this scheme, it should not send out a letter saying it is glad to have worked on an applicant's behalf and delighted to have secured him or her a home.  Rather, it should say the home should be returned to the State because there is a 10% tax rebate.  The hypocrisy of the Opposition needs to be called out at this stage.</p> <p>Most of the points have been raised.  As a businessperson who has employed many people and who has been able to keep many of them in employment because of the EWSS, I thank the Minister of State.  I thank him for his continuous, active response to circumstances on the ground and his support.</p></speech>

It is good to see him back in the House.</p> <p>Let us remember that behind every business, there is a family.  Behind every business, there are several workers.  The Government has stepped up to the plate when it comes to supporting workers.  I fundamentally believe this Bill is what we have all been calling for, that is, a measure to make sure we do not have a cliff edge for businesses, families and workers.  That is what this Bill is all about.  The Minister of State said it is a small Bill but it is so far-reaching.  There are so many schemes under it.  We should remember how much has already been invested in some of the schemes.  Some &euro;4.2 billion has already been spent by the State on the EWSS.</p> <p>People have been worrying about whether they will be taken off the larger schemes we have been talking about in September.  This Bill states the period will be extended until December, or that the Minister will have the ability to do that.</p> <p>Another couple of points in the Bill are welcome.  The Minister of State has alluded to them.  One relates to non-rateable businesses.  Those operating businesses from their homes or vehicles will also be taken into account.  That means we have been listening.  Last September, in the presence of the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I believe, I asked that a reduction of the VAT rate for the tourism sector be considered.  Despite everything else the Government was trying to do, it was just not doing enough for tourism and hospitality.  The Department is now extending the rate reduction.  All of these measures are incredibly welcome, and they are all contained within this Bill.  Let us celebrate that.  It is a good day for businesses across the State.  We are supporting a large number of SMEs in this country.</p> <p>I would like to refer to the housing issue.  I hope every party agrees that long-term leasing arrangements for local authorities are poor value for money.  Nobody wants them.  Everybody wants local authorities to have their own homes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill predominantly allow us to build houses on public land and for the State to own those.</p><p>We have a cost-rental provision for the first time, for which the Green Party has been calling for decades.  That is all part of the housing strategy.  I would love that 10% to be extended to those who are leasing to local authorities.  I take on the board the senior Minister's previous comments that 2,400 families require these homes.  We have to find an arrangement for that.  Some 10,000 people are in emergency accommodation, nearly 2,500 of whom are children.  We are in a state of emergency and we have to use everything we can.  I hope that in the housing for all strategy, we can finally deal with these issues in a way that is sustainable in the long term, that we can see the State owning and not selling off its houses, which it did in the past, and that this Government finally tackles this problem.  We have had record funding for housing under this Government.  I appreciate people's frustration in that they cannot see the homes now, although, as Senator Casey pointed out, local authorities are attempting to deliver if councillors will facilitate that.  It is frustrating when we call to people's doors, as we have all done in the past month, to hear people ask where the homes are.  Delivering these homes takes time.  The combined effect of these measures is what delivers those homes.  I want what is in housing for all to be put in place, which will ensure we have a sustainable model.  Some temporary measures are required as well as all those measures we have put in place under the Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill.  Those are what will deliver for people.  The Minister of State does not have responsibility for housing but the Government, as a whole, must tackle the issue of vacancy, particularly for rural communities.  There are vacant homes and they need to be brought back into use.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, we have been very constructive in supporting these financial provisions Acts regarding the pandemic but we will not be supporting this one because of the outrageous clauses that reward cuckoo funds and vulture funds with sweetheart tax deals.  That is exactly what they are.  Interestingly, the history of these ridiculous schemes where instead of buying and building houses local councils lease houses from investment funds was started by Fianna F&aacute;il in 2009 along with the Green Party.  For the dozens of people who might be watching these proceedings at home, effectively, I am saying we pour millions into investment funds in terms of rents at the end of which the council owns nothing.  We are literally pouring money into a black hole.  To be clear, it appears to be Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  It is interesting to note there is not a cigarette paper&rsquo;s worth of difference between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, which possibly explains the result we had last Friday in the by-election.</p> <p>I want to be clear on this.  With this amendment, the Minister brazenly gives investment funds a tax break when they snap up homes from under the noses of struggling home buyers if they lease them to local authorities, with the latter and taxpayers picking up the Bill and paying their rent to the investment funds for 25 years.  The funds do not pay a cent in corporation tax on the rent that is paid them.  The tax arrangements have been facilitated by the Government, including by the Minister for Finance.  You literally could not make this up.  Not only will the legislation allow funds to continue to push struggling home buyers out of the markets, but it will also deliver poor value for money for the taxpayer.  This is not only the view of Sinn F&eacute;in; it is also the view of officials in the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department.  Not only are investment funds outbidding prospective home buyers, but they are also outbidding approved housing bodies by as much as &euro;80,000 per unit.  They can do so because the Government has introduced sweetheart tax deals that allow them that type of firepower.  It is doubling down on those with today&rsquo;s sneaky slotting of this provision into this particular Covid Bill.</p> <p>Let us remember that only a few weeks ago, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;Let this go out loud and clear no county council should be engaging in a long term lease with these institutional investors&rdquo;.  He said that on 4 May, but in classic Fianna F&aacute;il style it is a case of this Government saying one thing and doing the opposite.  Our Seanad colleague, Senator Fitzpatrick of Fianna F&aacute;il, said &ldquo;I specifically call on the Minister for Finance to end tax incentives for investment funds to facilitate the wholesale purchase of first-time buyers&rsquo; homes.  Yet, how will she vote today?  It is quite outrageous.  With this latest tax wheeze, increasing amounts of social housing will be in the hands of cuckoo funds, which pay no taxes to the State but will be in receipt of taxpayers&rsquo; money each year in the form of rent received.  What we are seeing is the marketisation of social housing.  That is what it is about.  It is about another form of privatising housing and the State walking away from it.  It is outrageous.  It is a loophole deal that the Sicilian Mafia would be proud to deliver and it is courtesy of this Fine Gael-Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government.</p> <p>The T&aacute;naiste justified this scam by saying they had consulted the builders and they told the Government this tax, ridiculously small as it is, would not be a good idea.  Of course, they said that.  They are getting money from these investment funds.  What would we expect them to say?  There is a simple answer to this and I will put it to the Minister of State.  There is a false choice that if we do not give these tax incentives people will miss out on homes.  Of course, we should be building our own housing and excluding these entities but, if in the short term we have to source some housing from private developers as a stopgap, we should purchase it directly from the developers, not lease it from an intermediary, namely, a cuckoo fund or vulture fund.  That is incredibly bad value for money.  I am genuinely shocked because the Taoiseach said one thing a matter of weeks ago and now the Minister is doing the exact opposite.  It is nothing less than a sweetheart deal for investment funds.  It is in that great Fianna F&aacute;il tradition, in particular, of cuddling up to these people.</p> <p>I heard Senator Casey&rsquo;s speech last Friday and would remind the Minister of State of two things.  The first is that Fianna F&aacute;il had a hell of a role in creating this crisis.  It propped up a disastrous Fine Gael Government for four years.  The second is this Government will not solve the housing crisis.  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has said the Government is only spending half of what is required to solve the housing crisis.  Let us be clear on this.  The Government is not delivering for the people and by its own sums, as set out by the ESRI, there is no prospect of delivery.  It is failing on housing again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#PP00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House.  We all need to recognise the necessity for the extensions contained within the Bill as they relate to the EWSS and the CRSS.  In that context, we would have been minded to support the Bill were it not for section 13 and the railroading of section 14 into the Bill, which means we cannot support it.  Before I deal with those sections I want to refer to the extension of the EWSS and the CRSS.  For many months we have raised the pointed exclusion of non-rateable businesses from the Government's enterprise supports.  The business resumption support scheme is welcome in that regard.  It strikes me as unfair that we have provisions for another round of funding for the restart grant yet under the business resumption support scheme it is an advance on the trading expenses and there is a difference for non-rateable businesses, particularly for those businesses that are struggling most.  Arts enterprises, events businesses and many others are non-rateable.  The Government can go further than it has with the business restrictions support scheme.  I ask it to extend the restart grant to the non-rateable businesses.</p> <p>The other striking element in the Bill is lack of medium-term thinking.  In some sectors there will not be any springing back to normal when they fully reopen.  Other than the VAT rate being extended into next year, we do not have targeted supports to maintain employment in some of the firms in the events, leisure arts, retail and other sectors.  I am reminded that last December, when the hospitality sector was fully open other than the pubs in Dublin, we still had an unemployment rate of 53%.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Just under 100,000 people aged between 15 and 24 years were unemployed.  There was no springing back to normal for that age cohort, a large proportion of who are employed in the hospitality sector.  It is disappointing that we have seen no effort made towards a short-time working scheme within those sectors, some of which will not survive.  Some will but they will need a great deal of additional support because it is not only the pandemic but also Brexit that is a great challenge.</p><p>The Labour Party's main objection to the Bill relates to stamp duty changes.  I am conscious that the Affordable Housing Bill and the Land Development Agency Bill will be discussed here this evening.  I understand the intent behind both, notwithstanding my huge reservations and concerns about the mechanisms employed in both of those Bills.  However, I can tell the Minister that what is contained in section 13 of this Bill and the exemption of apartments will have a devastating impact on the area I know best, Dublin's north side, on the prospect of conventional apartments or houses ever being built.  With the stamp duty changes, there is a double incentive for developers to never build conventional apartments or house.  There is no incentive to build a house because of the stamp duty changes.  With the build-to-rent model, why would people ever build a conventional apartment when they can get away with a smaller floor area, less storage provisions and a lower construction standard?  Another issue in Dublin is that it is only developers with deep pockets who can afford to buy land in the city.  Section 14 is the other really egregious part of the Bill because of its exemptions for those who will lease residential housing to local authorities on a long-term basis.   We have to ask about the direction this Government is going.  There has almost been a doubling of reliance by local authorities and housing bodies on leasing between 2017 and 2020.  </p><p>Senator Casey asked about the impact on individuals.  I speak as someone who, as a new councillor, voted for O'Devaney Gardens, and hated doing so, because it was already in the works for many years, and as a person who has had to tell people about the housing assistance payment, and hated doing so because of its less secure tenure.  We have an opportunity to get this Bill right but the Government is walking away from that.  It is walking away from the chance to ensure that we deliver housing directly, that we do not let places like the north side of Dublin, or, indeed, the south side, be left out to dry and have no conventional apartments or housing built over the coming years.  It is a real disgrace that the Government is allowing these sections into the Bill.</p></speech>

The raft of legislation before the House today is to support businesses.  That is what this Bill is about.  It is about supporting small and micro companies and medium-size companies.  It is incredible.  Previously, there was legislation about the Government providing more accessible and cost-efficient ways to help rescue companies and restructure them as needed, especially when going through difficult trading periods.  It is crucial that we highlight the three things mentioned by the Minister.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, which the Minister mentioned in his opening remarks, has supported over 50,000 employers, with 600,000 people having received support from the scheme which was brought in by this Government to support employees during the lockdown and the crisis last year.</p> <p>I also welcomed the restart week.  That is between 2 June and 31 December, which equals three weeks at double rate of pay.  That is very welcome.  I am thinking in particular of micro enterprises, which have between three and nine employees.  That is over 90% of businesses in Ireland.  These are the ones that need our support and are going through a huge crisis.  They could include the construction sector or subcontractors, and shops in our local towns and villages, particularly in the areas I come from in Roscommon and Galway, where it is crucial.  Some of these micro enterprises have been shown to have the highest level of ambition in the west.  They target themselves and see themselves as exporting abroad as well as operating in Ireland.  These supports are crucial to keeping these businesses going.  More than one third of our micro enterprises are female-led.  </p> <p>The extension of the 9% VAT rate until 31 August is crucial for hospitality and tourism.  We are trying to support a safe and sustainable reopening in the coming months, so that is very welcome.  The debate so far has focused on one section of the Bill.  It has prompted many different opinions.  It is crucial that we get housing built.  Look at all the local authorities.  Housing is in such demand.  There is no housing in my area and local authorities have none.  How will we ensure that social, public housing is available for local authorities?  We need action and we need to get moving.  That is what this Government is about.  That is the budget that we put in place this year and in coming years to get social housing done as quick as possible.  If certain parties are voting against housing, how will that support us in delivering what we need for this country now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#QQ00400"><p>I welcome this Bill in that it gives businesses and particularly small and family-owned firms, some clarity in relation to the reopening post-Covid.  Earlier this afternoon I welcomed the introduction of the Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Bill, and this Bill provides some welcome supports which will hopefully help to minimise the number of businesses that are threatened with failure over the coming months and years.  However, I do worry that the sheer scale of the challenges facing the economy over the next 18 months are being underestimated.  We have been borrowing the equivalent of &euro;1.5 billion per month throughout the crisis to pay for the various supports which are in place.  This has acted as an economic comfort-blanket of sorts, but it has also acted as a comfort blanket to the Government and the political system.  There will eventually come a point where this cannot continue, and I worry that the political and economic awakenings will be very rude indeed, and that we are not preparing ourselves sufficiently for that.</p> <p>Clearly, as we recover, small enterprises, particularly those in hospitality and tourism, have to be our focus, because they are areas of huge potential job creation.  The Bill extends the Covid restrictions support scheme until September, and the employment wage subsidy scheme until the end of the year.  I welcome this, but again I do worry about what will happen when these schemes come to an end.  We need to be careful that this will not be like hitting a brick wall for some businesses.  Businesses need to be eased back to normality, with supports being tapered to the greatest extent possible.</p> <p>I particularly welcome the idea of the business resumption support scheme, which will allow businesses in effect to claim an advance tax credit of up to &euro;15,000 to deal with reopening expenses.  This is exactly the kind of cushion we need to be putting in place to ensure soft landings and that there will be no cliff-edge when other supports are ended.  </p> <p>The warehousing of tax liabilities will be extended by the Bill, continuing until the end of 2021.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As I said earlier this afternoon on the Companies (Rescue Process for Small and Micro Companies) Bill, this only puts off the evil day for a significant number of companies.  Eventually, these will need to confront their existing tax liabilities and we need to consider whether we are doing enough to ensure small businesses will not be pushed to the brink of danger by having to do so.</p><p>The continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate in hospitality is to be supported.  The decision to increase that rate back to 13.5% in late 2018 was ridiculous and something that I opposed at the time.  It was a simple revenue grab.  It was an increase in stealth taxes to fund runaway Government spending in a range of areas and fill out the coffers ahead of a looming general election.  Increasing taxes on a sector that supports so many jobs and where prices paid by consumers are so competitive was a strange move.  The spectre of Fine Gael, a party that professes to support small enterprises, presiding over and defending increased taxes on a sector almost entirely made up of such businesses, seems strange.  Sadly, it took the onset of the Covid-19 crisis to convince the party of the errors of its ways.  The 9% rate will allow the hospitality sector to be more competitive on prices or to retain more of its takings, so that is clearly the right thing to do.  The rate should be retained long after the crisis has passed.</p><p>I listened carefully to Senator Sherlock, as always.  I always think that her contributions are thoughtful.  I do not like to see any situation where people take advantage of the housing crisis and economic situation to create a future for homeowners that involves them having poorer facilities than what they deserve and I worry about that.</p><p>The 10% rate of stamp duty for vulture funds and the Bill's provisions for this apply to funds that will buy up multiple units in new developments, with an exemption for those units which are leased back to local authorities.  This proposal was in the news last week and led to much of the usual sloganeering.  I wonder why it caused such a stir.  The reality is that we have a serious housing shortage.  I agree that local authorities need to build more houses themselves but that will take time.  It makes sense in the short term to incentivise the leasing of properties to local authorities at fair rates.  It is not a long-term solution but it is not one that we should turn our nose up for ideological or populist reasons.  I am not suggesting that those are the reasons of any particular reason.  I am not convinced by the reasons put forward to oppose that measure.  It seems that it is a small price to pay if it increases the number of units available to the councils in the short term.</p></speech>

We have seen payouts come down by 50%, which will surely lead to a situation where people's premiums come down.  I know he will keep a watchful eye on that.  Over recent years, we have all seen issues, especially in the area of leisure and amenity, where children's playgrounds and play areas had huge insurance bills.  We look forward to this changing.  I ask the Minister of State and all of those involved in insurance to make sure that happens.</p> <p>This legislation is welcome.  It is a key part of the economic recovery plan to support businesses as public health restrictions are eased.  As I mentioned in another debate, when research was done into the 2008 recession, small businesses were the key to revitalising and recovering our economy.  We have to do everything that we can to help to support them.  In my county, Kildare, 92% of our business world is in the SME sector.  Some 92% of the rates in Kildare are paid by businesses that have a workforce of under ten, which is quite surprising considering that the north of the county is lucky enough to have such companies as Intel and Hewlett-Packard.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the businesses we are talking about, many of which are family-owned, are the backbone of our economy.  They have been hit especially badly by Covid and this feels like a time warp.  This time last year, we were here to try to ensure that everything was in place to reopen in September, then it was Christmas, then Easter, and now we are here, hoping that we will have that opening on 19 July on a gradual basis and that things will be normal enough in September.  We have a good vaccination uptake rate, which will certainly help us.</p> <p>I know that what the Minister of State has contained in this measure acknowledges the frail nature of businesses and firms in certain sectors as they emerge from the impact of the public health restrictions.  The Bill aims to ensure that such firms can continue to benefit from the EWSS and are not precluded from availing of it because business picks up in quarter 3, which is important.  The extension and enhancement of the Covid restrictions support scheme has given a lifeline to businesses and companies over the past few months.  That gives certainty to businesses, so it is welcome.  I also welcome the new business support scheme.  That is for businesses with reduced turnover as a result of public health restrictions.  That will be implemented in September.  As well as continuing with some of the proven mechanisms that have helped to keep our businesses alive, being able to add additional months is important.  The extension of the reduced rate of VAT of 9% until 31 August is key.</p> <p>The announcement that the reopening of indoor dining was not proceeding as planned on 5 July led to significant disappointment from those in the sector and those who were hoping to avail of it.  It was a difficult call for Government.  We are now close to seeing the implementation of a system to verify vaccination or immunity, so businesses which remain closed or are significantly restricted by public health restrictions can make a claim for additional support under the CRSS for a further two weeks from 5 July.  This amendment of the scheme to allow for an extra two weeks recognises the difficulties that places are in.  This is good legislation, which can be extended if needed.  We hope that it will not.  I wish businesses well in the weeks and months ahead as we start reopening society.</p></speech>

Senator Mullen's contribution is one that we have a debate on in this House, to address the future of how we will pay.  Some live in the land of milk and honey and therein lies part of our difficulty.  Others of us live in the land of realism and recognise that we have rightly spent and borrowed billions of euro to support SMEs and workers.  I would love to have an ideological question addressed by Members opposite, in particular, who will go to social media platforms with clips of all of us which they will use erroneously to further their own aims.  That is a disgrace.  No Government has ever had to face the pandemic that we have had.  That is why it is important that we recognise the importance of a focus on small and medium enterprises which, as Senator O'Loughlin said, are at the heart of how our society and economy develops.  These are entrepreneurs who we know in our own communities.</p> <p>I welcome this debate and the fact that today, as announced by IDA Ireland, foreign direct investment is close to pre-pandemic levels.  That is a vote of confidence in our country, our people, and our goods, services and products.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Today, the Government announced a new pathways to work strategy to bring 75,000 people back into the workforce again.  That is positive.</p><p>Senator Mullen is no longer here but I remind him that we are the pro-enterprise, pro-jobs party.  We are the party that believes in rewarding work, enterprise and equality of opportunity.  In the past 15 or 16 months we have taken decisions to underpin support to our businesses and those who work in our economy and our country.</p><p>I will comment on our reimagined cities and towns.  We have seen, for example, 17 streets pedestrianised in the city of Cork, where I am.  It gives us a new type of city.  It is the biggest ever investment under the urban regeneration and development fund in Cork city.  I invite the Minister of State and the Ministers, Deputies Paschal Donohoe and Michael McGrath, to visit parts of Cork city where we can be imaginative in incentivising developers, local authority and private citizens including those on the social housing list to buy, rent and do up old properties so we have regeneration, re-gentrification and re-living in our cities and towns.</p><p>We must ensure we do not go back to the old ways.  It is not the Minister of State's Department and it is slightly askew from this debate but Senator Casey will agree, I hope, that it is critical we do not miss the deadline for the Covid digital certification.  Our tourism and hospitality sector require and deserve our Government to be ready.  </p><p>I will yield my time to Senator Cummins but I remind Senator Mullen, who is back, that the Fianna F&aacute;il Party is the pro-jobs, pro-small and medium enterprise party and nobody else will ever assume that mantle and deliver like we have done and will continue to do.</p></speech>

I echo much of what Senator Mullen said.  We are in a housing crisis and, in such a crisis, one must use every tool at one's disposal to tackle the problem.  My party and the Government is all about delivery over ideology.  We believe we can deliver houses by any mechanism possible, be that councils, approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency, public-private partnerships, private builders or leases.</p> <p>I guarantee Senator Gavan that any individual or family that has got a leased property in recent years is not getting hung up on the ideological debate about this.  They are happy to be out of hotel or emergency accommodation.  That is what the Government is doing in delivering units for families and individuals to live in.  Leases have a part to play in that.</p> <p>I will leave some important facts on the record of the House.  I invite the media to scrutinise the Sinn F&eacute;in policy on housing.  It promises to deliver 100,000 social and affordable units over a 15-year period.  On page 5 of that document, it states that, in the period 2016 to 2021, Sinn F&eacute;in would deliver 36,500 social and affordable homes.  According to the CSO, this Government has delivered 39,524 houses in the past four years, without taking account of the 2021 figures.  Some of those are leases, but Senator Gavan should ask any of the individuals or families in those homes and no longer in hotel accommodation whether they care for the ideological debate in this Chamber. </p></speech>

There will be an opportunity to go into detail on the Bill on a section by section basis when it is examined on Committee Stage tomorrow morning.  The Bill gives effect to some of the decisions announced on 1 June as part of the Government's economic plan, which sets out a new phase of supports for this next stage of recovery as businesses reopen.  Many speakers acknowledged the scale and speed of the Government's response with various schemes which have been practical and helped many businesses and individuals.</p> <p>It extends the EWSS to 31 December 2021 and provides for the retention of the current enhanced subsidy rates until 30 September 2021.  It extends the CRSS and provides for additional payments on reopening.  It provides for a new business resumption support scheme.  This new scheme is designed to support some of the worst affected businesses in the pandemic, especially those that continue to be significantly impacted even after the easing of public health restrictions.  It provides that the reduced rate of VAT of 9% applying on a temporary basis to hospitality and tourism-related goods and services will be extended until 31 August 2022.  It provides for the extension of tax debt warehousing, with debts now warehoused throughout 2021, remaining interest free throughout 2022 and with a reduced interest rate of 3% starting in 2023 until the debt is paid. </p> <p>Finally, it provides for a new stamp duty rate which will be a significant disincentive to the practice of multiple purchase by institutional investors of large parts of or whole housing estates before they reach the market, thus denying first-time buyers an opportunity to purchase a home.  It does this by imposing the 10% charge where ten or more liable residential units are acquired in a 12-month period.  The Minister made it clear when the financial resolution was passed by the D&aacute;il on 19 May that he would place the resolution on a permanent statutory footing in the next number of weeks and this Bill will achieve that.  Multiple purchases of houses by local authorities, affordable housing bodies, and the Housing Agency are exempt from the 10% charge, as are private sector participants in the mortgage-to-rent area.</p> <p>The Government has decided that apartments are also exempt from the 10% rate.  Otherwise, there would be a significant risk that developers would exit from the apartment building market, as such projects would no longer be viable and an important element of our future housing strategy would be lost.  A person who has paid stamp duty at the 10% rate on the acquisition of a residential unit will be able to claim a refund of part of the stamp duty paid if and when the residential unit is leased to a local authority or an approved housing body for social housing purposes.  It is very specific to such cases.  I hope, given this situation where we need many housing units for so many people on waiting lists, that people will not object to the principle that the stamp duty be refunded in those cases.  Otherwise, who will pay for it?  It will be the local authorities in increased rents.  Where does that money come from?  The taxpayer.  It is important to stress that.</p> <p>This will address the concern that the charging of additional stamp duty on the acquisition of such residential units will act as a disincentive to persons who might have been planning to acquire multiple units for onward leasing to a local authority or an approved housing body and thereby reduce the supply of social housing.  It is important to make the move at this stage rather than coming back in six or 12 months time to find this has been a cause of problem and delay.  The people opposite will be the first to say we should have foreseen this.  We are foreseeing it now, preventing the issue becoming a problem before it arises, dealing with it up front on a proactive basis to make sure it does not become an issue.</p> <p>Assertions that the exemption provided in this Bill for the acquisition of houses that are then leased to local authorities for social housing purposes was somehow underhandedly inserted at the last minute do no stand up to scrutiny when examined against the facts of the situation.  The financial resolution when introduced on 19 May was an emergency measure to address the immediate issue of the multiple purchase of homes by institutional investors.  There was limited time available for drafting the measure.  Therefore, it focused on addressing the basic requirements only.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, in doing this the Minister was always aware that he could broaden the scope of the exemption, if he thought it necessary when putting the financial resolution on a permanent basis.  In this regard, he stated in the House on 19 May: "Other social or affordable housing arrangements will be considered as part of the legislation which will be brought before the Houses in the next few months to permanently underpin this resolution."  That statement was a very clear signal that, aside from the existing local authority and approved housing body exemptions, other social and affordable housing exemptions were being considered.  That was flagged and stated in public, but because of the emergency nature of measures - we all remember how quickly we had the debate - the full details could not be worked out at very short notice.  However, there was a clear signal that it was on its way.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, introduced the Bill to the D&aacute;il on Second Stage on 1 July, he announced the Minister for Finance's intention, which was: "on the advice of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to facilitate an exemption from the 10% stamp duty charge in circumstances where houses are bought by investors for leasing to local authorities".  Therefore the path was laid for this leasing measure on 19 May when the Minister indicated that other social and affordable housing exemptions were being examined.  At the first available opportunity, the Minister of State subsequently confirmed that it would be introduced as a Committee Stage amendment.  Therefore, I do not accept that anything inappropriate or untoward has taken place, since standard due process has been followed in relation to the introduction of this measure.  I look forward to further examination of the Bill on Committee Stage tomorrow.</p><p>The Government has responded to the impact of the pandemic with a broad range of supports across a range of Departments, which have made a real difference to people's lives throughout the country.  The economic summer statement is due shortly, which will outline and deal with the requests people made about the long-term debt cost to the Exchequer.  As we have shown, when it is necessary in these emergency situations to run a deficit, we will do so, and as soon as is practicable and appropriate we will move back to a balanced budget.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.202" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#WW00400"><p>I am pleased to introduce the Bill for the consideration of the House.  I propose, first, to summarise the background and context of the Bill, the basic aim of which is to ensure the matters of immediate concern identified by the Supreme Court in its majority decision in the Zalewski case are immediately remedied in statute.  I will then describe the purpose and reasoning behind each section of the Bill.</p> <p>On 6 April this year, the majority judgment of the Supreme Court in the Zalewski case overturned the judgment of the High Court, which had found that the Workplace Relations Commission&rsquo;s, WRC, adjudication service was not administering justice within the meaning of Article 34 of the Constitution.  The seven judges of the Supreme Court agreed the WRC&rsquo;s adjudication service is the administration of justice, traditionally a matter exclusively for the courts.  However, the majority decision saved the 2015 Act from being constitutionally repugnant because it found the administration of justice was limited and, therefore, permissible under Article 37.  The limited nature is due to the fact the WRC deals with workplaces, has statutory limits on the awards it can make, enforcement of its decisions is required through the courts, its decisions are subject to an appeal, and the decisions and procedures of the adjudication services are subject to a judicial review before the High Court.  </p> <p>In issuing this decision the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the validity of certain sections of the 2015 Act and section 8 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, as amended.  However, separately, the Supreme Court also determined two aspects of the 2015 Act are, in fact, incompatible with the Constitution.  First, the court found the practice of holding all hearings in private, as provided under section 41(13), is not an acceptable feature of the administration of justice and, therefore, not compatible with the Constitution.  Justice must be done in public and while there are situations where privacy is warranted, a blanket approach of hearing matters in private is not an acceptable feature of the administration of justice.  This requirement to administer justice in public will also have an impact on the routine anonymisation of parties under section 41(14) of the 2015 Act.  The second procedural weakness the court held was the absence of a statutory provision for the administration of an oath, and any possibility of punishment for perjury, is inconsistent with the Constitution.</p> <p>While not subject to an express declaration of unconstitutionality by the Supreme Court, the majority decision noted and expressed concern about the statutory drafting concerning the removal of an adjudication officer.  This provision is now remedied in section 3 of the Bill before the House through the provision of a constitutionally robust and fair removal procedure, should the requirement ever arise.</p> <p>Similarly, while the fact that the 2015 Act provides for the enforcement of decisions to be a matter for the District Court, the Supreme Court found the provision to be lacking in fairness.  The fact that the enforcement of adjudication decisions is a matter for the District Court is an integral aspect of the limited nature of the WRC&rsquo;s adjudication service.  This, in turn, is crucial in ensuring the commission&rsquo;s adjudication service is permissible under Article 37 of the Constitution.  Accordingly, the provision has been remedied in this draft Bill to ensure employers&rsquo; have a right to be notified and heard.</p> <p>Finally, the Supreme Court&rsquo;s finding that the functions being performed by the WRC adjudication and the Labour Court are functions of a judicial nature involving the administration of justice under the Constitution, warrants the inclusion of an express statutory guarantee that the membership of the Labour Court shall be independent in the performance of their functions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This will require amendments to the Industrial Relations Acts, 1946 and 1969.<br/><br/>As the declarations of the court have immediate effect, the WRC's adjudication service has been restricted in the matters that it can dispose of until these amendments are made to the 2015 Act, the Equal Status Act 2000, the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Protection of Employment (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 and the Redundancy Payments Act 1967.  These separate Acts contain stand-alone provisions relating to proceedings before the director general or adjudication officer.  We have to make changes to them.<br/><br/>My officials have successfully concluded a consultation with the Data Protection Commissioner, in accordance with section 84(12) of the Data Protection Act.  This consultation was required as aspects of the Bill involve the processing of personal information.<br/><br/>I am also grateful that the genuine urgency to address this Bill was recognised on a cross-party basis by the members of the joint Oireachtas committee who agreed to waive the requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill.  I would like place on the record my appreciation for the collegial and productive engagements both I and my officials have had with the members of the joint committee.  It is something that we can also benefit from in the future.  <br/><br/>It should also be noted that the decisions of the Supreme Court provide for certain matters that will require policy and possible legislative attention at a later stage.  These matters relate to the independence of the decision makers and necessity to ensure that persons carrying out these functions have the appropriate skills and capabilities.  Consideration will need to be given to the potential impact that the court&rsquo;s judgment may have on other quasi-judicial bodies administering permissible justice.  That is why, once the legislation has been commenced, my Department will convene an internal review group consisting of officials with policy responsibility of the various bodes and agencies that may now find themselves administering justice to consider the rulings in full and to analyse its impact on their functions.  In doing so, it will engage with the Office of the Attorney General and other Departments with oversight of similar bodies.  If any issues are raised, we can discuss them with the members of the committee.  The most urgent part of the legislation is what we had to get done, if at all possible, this week.<br/><br/>I will now outline the principal provisions.  Section 1 contains definitions.  Section 2 is a technical amendment required to facilitate the introduction of amendments in section 41 of the Workplace Relations Act concerning the offence of perjury.  Section 3 contains an amendment to section 40 of the 2015 Act.  The purpose of the amendment to is to provide for a fair procedure for the revocation of an adjudicator's warrant.<br/><br/>Section 4 contains an amendment of section 41 of the 2015 Act.  In respect of the provision in section 41(13), which currently provides that: &quot;Proceedings under this section before an adjudication officer shall be conducted otherwise than in public&quot;, the court held, at paragraph 148, that it was appropriate to declare subsection 13 repugnant to the Constitution, and that the effect of this is that &quot;the prohibition on public hearings is removed, and proceedings may, but not must, be heard in public.&quot;  The proposed amendment provides the either party can make an application to the adjudicator, but also provides the adjudicator with discretion to enquire into the matter on his or her own motion and subsequently to direct that either the whole or part of the relevant proceedings can take place otherwise than in public, where this would be desirable in light of the nature or circumstances of the specific case.  The default position in respect of such proceedings is that they will be held in public.  That is an issue of particular concern, so I want to be very clear that either party can make the case to have proceedings held in private if they believe that it is justifiable, but the adjudication officer can also make his or her own decision in that respect.  Therefore, it is open to either party.  <br/><br/>In respect of the proposed substitution of section 41(14), while the judgment of the court did not address the issue of automatic anonymisation, which is currently provided for in the subsection, it is the Department's view, supported by legal advice, that maintaining a policy of anonymisation of all published decisions is contrary to the requirement that justice be administered in public.  Section 41(14)(b) provides an adjudication officer with the<i>vires</i>to direct the commission, if he or she is satisfied that the special circumstance of the particular case so requires, not to name parties in the published decision.<br/><br/>A further constitutional issue was identified by the court in respect of the absence of any provision relating to the administration of oaths or an associated penalty for perjury.  The amendment to section 41(12) introduces the statutory power for the administration of oaths or affirmations, and to provide for a criminal offence of wilfully and corruptly providing false evidence under oath or while subject to such an affirmation.  This provision is aligned with section 12 of the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Bill 2018, enacted on 21 June this year.<br/><br/>Section 5 provides for an amendment of section 43 of the Act of 2015.  The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen the rights of employers in matters relating to the enforcement of decisions of adjudication officers in the District Court. <br/><br/>Section 6 provides for an amendment to section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  The purpose of these amendments is to provide for the statutory independence of the chairperson and ordinary members of the Labour Court.A further amendment to section 21 of the 1946 Act has been provided to align the offence that is provided for in the Criminal Justice (Perjury and Related Offences) Act 2021.<br/><br/>Section 7 provides for an amendment of section 39 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 concerning proceedings in public and the administration of an oath or affirmation.<br/><br/>Section 8 provides for an amendment of section 4 of the Industrial Relations Act 1969.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide for the statutory independence in the performance of the functions of the deputy chairs of the Labour Court. <br/><br/>Section 9 provides for an amendment of section 8 of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 concerning proceedings in public and the administration of an oath or affirmation.  The offence of perjury is also provided for.<br/><br/>Section 10 provides for an amendment of section 9 of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 concerning proceedings in public, anonymisation and the administration of an oath or affirmation.  The offence of perjury is also provided for.  To align this Act with the WRC Act, a regulation-making power has been inserted, empowering the Minister to make provision in respect of any matter relating to the presentation, referral or hearing of a complaint under section 9 of the 1984 Act, as he or she considers appropriate.<br/><br/>Section 11 provides for the amendment of section 79 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 concerning proceedings in public and the administration of an oath or affirmation.  The offence of perjury is also provided for.<br/><br/>Section 12 provides for the amendment of section 25 of the Equal Status Act 2000 concerning proceedings in public and the administration of an oath or affirmation.  The offence of perjury is also provided for.<br/><br/>Section 13 provides for statutory review of certain sections of the legislation.  The review is to take place no later than 12 months after the Bill has been commenced.  That provision has been made in conjunction with the recommendation of the committee members.  We are conscious that this legislation has been rushed through and we had to skip pre-legislative scrutiny.  Therefore, it is important that we commit, in the Bill, to undertaking a review within 12 months of its commencement.  We are happy to do that and to engage with all the relevant stakeholders and Members as we do so.<br/><br/>Section 14 introduces a Short Title and provides for commencement.<br/><br/>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

I support the Bill.  It includes necessary procedural amendments to ensure the WRC adjudication service will continue in its role to protect the rights of employees and employers.  I commend the Minister of State on his swiftness in dealing with the matter and the cross-party support it has garnered.</p><p>The Bill amends the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 in response to the judgment of the Supreme Court.  We have extensive employment and equality rights.  It is essential that the WRC functions in line with the Constitution and that its work is not compromised.</p><p>On 6 April 2021, the landmark Supreme Court judgment in Zalewski <i>v.</i>An Adjudication Officer, WRC and Others, upheld the constitutional validity of the WRC and ruled that the WRC process was a constitutional administration of justice in the State within the meaning of article 37 of the Constitution, but declared that certain aspects of the WRC procedures under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 were incompatible with the Constitution.  While the WRC was ruled as being constitutionally valid, certain aspects of its procedures were not.  That is being rectified through the Bill.</p><p>The implications of the decision mean that the holding of all hearings in private, as provided under section 41(13), is not an acceptable feature of the administration of justice.  Hearings must now be held in public except in certain circumstances.  Up until the decision was taken, all hearings were conducted in private, no evidence was given under oath and names were usually anonymised.  Second, the decision means that the absence of the provision for the administration of an oath, or any possibility of punishment for giving false evidence, is also inconsistent with the Constitution.  The adjudication officer should be able to require that certain evidence must be given on oath.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These amendments seek to bring the Workplace Relations Commission in line with the administration of justice permissible under the Constitution.  Proceedings were far less formal than they will be now.  While the pros and cons of this have been discussed to a certain degree and, I imagine, will be discussed more today, overall I believe the change is positive.  The integrity of the judicial process is the most important factor.  Organisations mindful of corporate reputations will be sensitive to having dirty laundry aired in public and being open to scrutiny by media.  Employees will be wary of their professional reputations.  It might set a standard for cases that go to the level of adjudication.  We might see an increase in mediation and that could be positive, although both parties have to agree to mediation.  Some of the articles I have read said that resources will have to be monitored by the WRC in that regard.</p><p>There will always be employees who are wary about escalating workplace relations cases.  I have seen myself how they do not want publicity or attention.  They do not want compensation.  They simply want issues to be resolved.  We will have to ensure we have space for them and that we respond to their needs.</p><p>The change in respect of oaths can only bring more integrity to the process.  Again, that is a positive move.</p><p>In general, we need to bring the work of the WRC in line with the Constitution as part of the judicial process.  I support the Bill and I look forward to hearing the views of my colleagues.</p></speech>

Like most Members I welcome the legislation.  It will ensure proceedings and investigations before adjudication officers of the Workplace Relations Commission comply with constitutional requirements associated with the administration of justice and that hearings before the adjudication officers can resume in full.</p> <p>The Workplace Relations Commission is a vital resource for workers and we must ensure it remains so.  From my experience in Galway, the majority of the time employees do not want the intrusion.  Senator Currie alluded to this.  Yet, it is still a major support.</p> <p>The Supreme Court has identified areas that fall short of proper administration of the permissible justice and this legislation is required to address that issue.  The first point is that holding all cases entirely in private is inconsistent with the overall administration of justice.  The Supreme Court was highly critical of the fact no provision was made in the statutory framework for the adjudication service.  The service provides for the administration of an oath or affirmation and an associated penalty for a person who may wilfully give false evidence or mislead an officer.  Naturally, there may be a material dispute of the facts.</p> <p>As Members are aware, there is a backlog of more than 300 cases due to the second issue identified.  It is important we resolve both areas identified by the Supreme Court so that we can have a fit-for-purpose Workplace Relations Commission.  It is vital the commission does the job it is supposed to do.  It is welcome the Workplace Relations Commission had continued to schedule cases.  I hope the backlog that has built up will be addressed in the short term.</p> <p>It was vital and important the Government moved swiftly to ensure the commission continued to function after the Supreme Court ruling last April, and it is welcome it has done so.  We need to keep this reviewed.  I see how it works in practice, especially in terms of all cases no longer being held entirely in private.</p> <p>Under the legislation, the officer whom the complaint or dispute is being referred to may use his or her discretion to direct that either the whole or part of the relevant proceedings can take place otherwise than in public where it is desirable in light of the nature of circumstances of the case or in the interests of justice.  The default position in respect of such proceedings is that they would be held in public.  The legislation provides broad guidance on the nature of the considerations that the officers should advert to in determining whether a private hearing would be desirable but the guidance does not set out specifically confined terms to provide the person dealing with the case with no discretion.  There is limited discretion.</p> <p>It is essential both employees and employers retain confidence in the Workplace Relations Commission.  We will need to see how this works in practice and potentially make adjustments if needed.  The Minister of State has alluded to this.  This clearly needed to be addressed following the view of the Supreme Court.</p></speech>

This was not in the programme for Government but we are doing it anyway because it has to be done.  My thanks to the Minister of State for his swift action on this.</p> <p>The Bill is intended to resolve issues raised by Mr. Zalewski, who took a court case.  We have to thank him for highlighting this anomaly in the legislation.  It is good he has brought us to this today.  It is good we are open to listening to people who stand up for their rights and highlight issues.  It shows the Government is willing to take them on board.  The court found that certain provisions in two Acts were incompatible with the Constitution as they required relevant Workplace Relations Commission proceedings to be conducted in private.  The court further found that the lack of provision for the administration of oaths or affirmations was inconsistent with the Constitution.</p> <p>The Bill is largely technical.  The main elements provide that Workplace Relations Commission proceedings will happen in public with some exceptions, that evidence may be given under oath and that there is a penalty for providing false information under oath, which is also important.</p> <p>Another issue the Bill addresses is the provision of a proper system for the removal of an adjudication officer.  Currently, this power rests solely with the Minister and this may undermine the independence of the adjudication officer.  It provides for an extra statement on the independence of Labour Court members, and it provides for the strengthening of the rights of employers in the enforcement of decisions of an adjudication officer in the District Court.</p> <p>I will keep it short.  It is fairly straightforward.  It has to be done.  My thanks to the Minister of State for the time and energy he has put into making this happen.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in is pleased to be able to support this Bill.  We have a couple of concerns we might deal with on Committee Stage, but it is important legislation.</p> <p>We understand the issues that arose for the WRC following the Zalewski case and the subsequent Supreme Court judgment are serious and require swift rectification.  A remedy for the issues outlined by the Supreme Court is necessary to ensure the proper administration and working of the WRC.  The core issues the legislation seeks to address are ensuring the administration of justice is capable of being conducted in public and the provision of statutory authority to administer oaths and affirmations in circumstances where there is a material dispute of fact.  Ancillary to this is addressing an express concern of the Supreme Court with regard to the removal of an adjudication officer.</p> <p>The sections stipulating that proceedings be conducted in public unless the adjudication officer, on his or her own motion or upon application by or on behalf of a party to the proceedings, determines that due to the existence of special circumstances the proceeding should be conducted otherwise than in public are important.  However, I can foresee a problem.  If one party to a case requests that proceedings be otherwise than in public, it might cause an issue.  Cases are taken by employees and naturally many will want the hearings to be held in private because of concern that a public hearing would damage future employment opportunities and the likelihood of getting promotions.</p> <p>I am keen to mention the important work carried out by the WRC despite being underfunded and under-resourced.  The Workplace Relations Commission does fantastic work on behalf of workers across the State.  In spite of the challenges posed by the pandemic, the WRC carried out 7,687 inspections in 2020 and managed to recover almost &euro;1.7 million in unpaid wages for workers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Data recently revealed in response to a parliamentary question outlined that since 2011, the WRC has recovered almost &euro;18 million in withheld wages for workers.  This proves the worth of the WRC and makes a very compelling case for the further funding of this particular institution.  Further data also revealed the scale and number of breaches of employment law detected by WRC investigations since 2015.  In those six years the WRC has detected breaches in employment law in more than one third of all investigations.  Of the number of cases investigated, breaches were found by employers for non-payment of the minimum wage, employment permits, protection of young persons, annual leave, public holiday breaches and unpaid wages, to name just a few.  Sectors such as food and drink, retail and wholesale, hair and beauty, and construction have seen consistent breaches of employment law in recent years.</p><p>The scale and nature of these breaches reveal the dark underbelly of the Irish economy which must be stamped out.  The idea that there are only a few select bad apples breaching employment rights and workers' rights has been blown apart by the data.  We can see that it is not just a tiny minority and that there are in fact breaches right across the board.  It is not every employer and not even the majority of employers, but it is a significant number of employers and they must be dealt with.</p><p>In six short years, more than a third of employers investigated by the WRC have been found to be in breach of employment law.  Added to all of this is the fact that the WRC is underfunded and understaffed to quite a shocking extent.  We must remember that the commission has only 53 inspectors carrying out this work despite being authorised to recruit 90 inspectors back in 2006.  In other words, it has just over half of the staff that it should have.  These 90 staff members should be the floor - not what we aspire to but the absolute minimum given that there are more people in work now than there were in 2006 when that agreement was reached.  I would be interested if the Minister of State could comment on that in his response and how quickly that deficit might be closed out.</p><p>When people feel that they are in a vulnerable situation, they probably have to wait for six months or longer to get into the WRC.  That is just not acceptable or good enough but it has always been the way, certainly going back to my ten years in SIPTU.  All the while these workers are probably continuing to work in the place where the issue has arisen.  Added to that is the fear that they will be exposed.</p><p>We need to give careful consideration to how we can ensure workers can have the confidence to take a case to the WRC and also have the capacity to maintain their anonymity and not suffer from any potential backlash.  I look forward to this Bill progressing and working with the Minister of State on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.211" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1683" speakername="Marie Sherlock" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#ZZ00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House.  We in the Labour Party are also pleased to be supporting this Bill.  I thank the Minister of State for engaging with the members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment and providing us with a briefing on the Bill a number of weeks ago.</p> <p>We have seen two very serious challenges to workers&rsquo; rights infrastructure in the State this year, the first of which was the prospective finding of unconstitutionality in the workings of the WRC in the Zalewski case.  Thankfully, that was not the eventual finding but a prospective one.  Second, there was the challenge to the sectoral wage bargaining provisions under the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.  Fortunately, in ruling on the constitutionality of both cases, the Supreme Court has found that although they are imperfect in their current form, sectoral wage bargaining is constitutional and the work of the WRC and the administration officers is constitutional, albeit that changes are required.</p> <p>The backlog has been mentioned by Senator Crowe and others.  We know that there has been an enormous backlog since 6 April due to the fact that where evidence is contested, cases need to be adjourned.  There is a complete urgency to this Bill, which is why we are pleased to facilitate its urgent passage through the Houses.</p> <p>This Bill is very important in ensuring a sound constitutional basis for adjudication officers to issue decisions.  In that context, section 4 provides for proceedings to be held by default in public, the administration of an oath or affirmation and the revoking of the appointment of an adjudication officer on the grounds of misconduct and other grounds.  We would hope that this latter provision might never have to be used but it is nonetheless important in ensuring public confidence in those who use the WRC, both employers and workers, workers' representatives and trade unions.</p> <p>I raise a concern, which has been raised by others, as regards the implementation of section 4.  I understand this is about that balancing of rights and protections, including the right for justice to be administered in public but also the need for the protection of individuals because, clearly, we do not want to deter workers from taking cases.  I appreciate that this section gives discretion to an adjudication officer to determine the exceptional circumstances in which a hearing is not held in public.  Nonetheless, I worry that this is not strong enough.  I believe a mechanism needs to be in place whereby an appeal can be made to the director of the WRC for the case to be heard in private.</p> <p>The other side of this is the need for balance from an awareness and educational perspective.  Other Senators, including Senator Currie, have referred to employers and workers being deterred from bringing forward cases that are not without good grounds.  Employers know that they could be potentially subjected to publicity if they act incorrectly.  There is that balance.</p> <p>As someone who worked for SIPTU for many years, like Senator Gavan, and as someone who testified as an expert witness for SIPTU in many Labour Court cases where I had to take an oath, I understand the need for the oath.  It is an uncomfortable experience but it is important nonetheless.  I understand that the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department is working hard to get that affirmation and oath as seamless as possible.</p> <p>Finally, I pay tribute to the work of the WRC and, indeed, of the Labour Court, which is also included within this Bill.  These are State institutions of great importance and are located outside of the normal judicial system but are intended to ensure a more accessible, less legalistic and more encouraging environment for workers in need of adjudication in a workplace equality claim.  The WRC, of course, does a great deal more than that in respect of conciliation and mediation, but we are dealing with a particular context today.</p> <p>Senator Gavan is completely correct in that there is a resources and staffing issue here.  He has set out very eloquently the very significant shortfall at the moment but there is also an issue here where we are about to see the very welcome broadening of workers&rsquo; rights, hopefully and belatedly, with the provision of a right to paid sick leave by the end of the year.  I know that there has also been a vague promise on the right to disconnect.  We can have all the laws in the world but we need to have proper enforcement procedures and inspections.  </p> <p>I also want to hear from the Minister of State on his plans and those of the Department and the Government to expand the inspectorate and the enforcement mechanisms within the WRC.</p></speech>

He is always very welcome.</p> <p>The WRC and the Labour Court are to be fully commended.  They are fantastic bodies and under their previous guises as the Labour Relations Commission have done a great job and are certainly there as the barrier towards stopping poor employment practices and outing the abuse of employees.  I welcome the decision of the Supreme Court and our quick response to it.  This emboldens, widens the scope of and strengthens the powers of the WRC.  The fact that evidence will now need to be given on oath and heard in public will do an even greater service to the operations of the WRC.</p> <p>It has been said - I have often quoted it in submissions over the years and it has been said in the High Court - that next to losing one's liberty the worst thing that can happen to one is to lose one's job because of all of the financial consequences that flow from and are dependent on our income.  The idea now is that once somebody attends before the WRC and has to go through the unfair dismissals procedure, evidence needs to be on oath and in public.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My experience of it, from both an employer's and an employee's point of view, suggests that the same repeat offenders of employers are there again and again.  There are some big names that should just have bunk beds in the corner, as I have said before in the Chamber, because they are repeatedly in there.  There is never a day when one goes there that the same name is not on the screen.  That pattern and ability to report and name names will be a very important feature.  In my view, it is regrettable that it was not included from the very beginning when the Workplace Relations Commission Act 2015 was introduced.<br/><br/>From an employee's point of view, I can understand the sensitivities and the nervousness.  I have sat beside people, in both instructed and <i>pro bono</i>cases, and I appreciate the fear of the process.  Employment law can be underestimated as to how complex at times it can be.  While the WRC is meant to be accessible, it requires legal assistance or experienced union personnel, and I have been there as both over the years.  There can be sensitive content on the part of the employee and, therefore, being able to make a submission to have the matter anonymised or in private will be important.  It is important also that the adjudicator can operate in his or her own regard.<br/><br/>There are solicitors practising in the country who submit vexatious, spurious claims and throw the sink at it on behalf of a person making a rather vague claim.  In one instance, I was briefed for 147 claims.  Timesheets and everything else could be produced, but it was vexatious.  There are repeat offenders among legal practitioners as well who are guilty of that, and this may expose them too.<br/><br/>One feature that needs to be addressed relates to the lack of a pre-determination of a <i>prima facie </i>case and the lack of having preliminary matters dealt with before hearing the matter in full.  That lends itself to clogging up the system.  People can sit there and argue a preliminary matter that there is no jurisdiction, and then still have to go through the case just in case it is found that there is jurisdiction.  Something along the lines of the Master's court for the High Court, or the county registrar for the Circuit Court, could be put in place and unclog the system in order that there would be a better system for adjudicating whether a case should go to hearing.  Not everything should go to hearing, given that some cases either should not be defended because they are so blatant and they should go to hearing, while some cases do not even reach the bar of <i>prima facie</i>.<br/><br/>The removal of adjudicators is, I hope, very rare.  I have had the experience of the other side handing a birthday card to the adjudicator.  Fortunately, I was robust enough to argue it, but if that person had been there on his or her own, without counsel or a representative, he or she would not necessarily have known to handle such a matter.  It is to be applauded that there is this mechanism for complaint and transparency.<br/><br/>I commend the legislation.</p></speech>

The Bill is important and urgent, in light of the decision of the Supreme Court of April last regarding the Zalewski case.  It is important that when a constitutional question mark is placed over the State's system for resolving workplace disputes, it has to be resolved.</p> <p>The Bill will give clarity to our legal system for dealing with workplace disputes.  Above all in law, we need clarity and consistency, as well as transparency.  The remedies provided for in the Bill relate to the necessity to ensure that administration of justice is capable of being conducted in public, which is very important.  This requirement to administer justice in public addresses the transparency issue but will also have an impact on other legislation.  We need a constitutionally robust and fair procedure, and the Supreme Court found that the current provision was lacking in fairness.  Accordingly, while we have to reflect, respect and protect workers' rights, it is important that there be a provision, which has been included as a remedy, to ensure an employer's right to be notified and heard.  That is the key element of this legislation.</p> <p>As a party, we will support the Bill to ensure that the proceedings or the investigations before the adjudication officers of the Workplace Relations Commission will comply with the constitutional requirements associated with the administration of justice, and that hearings before adjudication officers can resume in full.  There is an urgent necessity to address certain matters, as was highlighted in the Supreme Court decision in April.  The Bill adheres strictly to the areas expressly identified by the Supreme Court in that we are falling short of the proper administration of permissible justice.</p> <p>At the moment, all matters before the adjudication service are held entirely in private, and this has been found to be inconsistent with what is known as the administration of justice.  While the Supreme Court did not suggest that everything and anything must be done in public, some consideration must be given to those matters.  The second issue, namely, that adjudication cannot continue or be effectively concluded until this provision has been introduced in law, stemmed from the fact that the Supreme Court was critical of the lack of provision in the statutory framework for the adjudication service, which provides for the administration of an oath or affirmation and an associated penalty who may wilfully give false evidence or mislead an adjudication officer.</p></speech>

Much of what I had intended to say has been said, but I welcome the Bill and the fact that it will strengthen the Workplace Relations Commission and deliver more transparency to the eligibility of adjudication officers, particularly through the amendment of section 40 of the 2015 Act.  I welcome the amendment to section 40(c) of that Act, which will now state:</p> <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(d) if the adjudication officer concerned&mdash;  	(i) is convicted on indictment of an offence,<br /><br />(ii) is convicted of an offence involving fraud or dishonesty,<br /><br />(iii) has a declaration made against him or her under section 819 of the Companies Act 2014 or is deemed to be subject to such a declaration by virtue of Chapter 5 of Part 14 of that Act, or<br /><br />(iv) is subject to, or is deemed to be subject to, a disqualification order within the meaning of Chapter 4 of Part 14 of the Companies Act 2014 whether by virtue of that Chapter or of any other provision of that Act.&rdquo;,  </blockquote> <p>The amendment zones in on cases where the integrity of the selection and eligibility process for an adjudication officer is compromised by any form of fraud.  It is important for transparency.  While the Bill is technical and I understand the reason it was brought about, arising from the Supreme Court decision, I pay tribute to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court because they do an awful lot of fine work.  It is about protecting the rights of the employee as well.  I welcome the Bill and the amendment I highlighted, and compliment the Minister of State on his work to date in respect of it.</p></speech>

We will be back in the House on Thursday or Friday to deal with any amendments they might wish to put forward.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some amendments were put forward in the other House.  We dealt with them, went through them and explained the rationale behind them.  Hopefully, we can do the same and reach agreement in this House and progress the legislation quickly.</p><p>Again, I thank all Senators for their contributions.  I think everybody welcomed the publication of the Bill, which is a positive thing.  This reflects our debate in the other House.  I know people still have concerns on some aspects.  It is important we respect the decisions of the Supreme Court and implement the changes, so that the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, can get on with its work.  We compliment the work of the WRC and recognise the great work it is doing.  Generally, it moves cases through quite swiftly.  We want to respond to that and enable it to continue to do that work quickly.</p><p>As I said earlier, the purpose of the Bill is to ensure we deal with the matters of immediate concern identified by the Supreme Court in the case.  It is important that this was a majority decision.  There is the case we are trying to remedy as quickly as we can.  Senator Crowe and others mentioned the delays and backlogs in cases that might come about because of that.  I want to be clear that the WRC is continuing to schedule cases.  I am informed that of the 1,601 hearings scheduled from the 6 April 2021 to 22 June 2021, only 27 were adjourned.  That is the most recent data, although I am conscious that we are now in July.  Senators Crowe and Sherlock were concerned about this.  However, 27 were adjourned, due to the adjudication officers' concluding that adjournment was necessary to facilitate a note or an affirmation to be administered.  That is why this legislation it is important.  </p><p>There are a range of outcomes that may arise when hearings are scheduled.  These are: that they will be postponed prior to the meeting; that the hearing can be completed; or that issues case managed to reduce the matter to be dealt with if adjourned.  They may be part-heard, requiring them to reschedule later.  They may also settle prior to, or during, the hearing.  Some Senators asked if a case had already started whether parties could go back to mediation if they wanted to.  The answer is that they can.  Not everybody wants to his or her case heard in public and might prefer to go back to mediation. </p><p>The issue of privacy, as well as of public and private, has been raised as a concern.  I agree with Senator Seery-Kearney that is important we have justice administered in public.  There are clear mechanisms for people who have concerns with that, and who, for various reasons, want to have the case held in private.  Both parties or a single party can apply to do so.  The adjudicator can decide to administer the justice in private if needs be.  We have a review in 12 months' time to allay concerns around that.</p><p>There will be regulations and guidelines to inform that practice and to make sure that it is administered and used properly.  I would be happy to engage with Members, like we did before with the committee, around the regulation and the guidelines before we fully sign off on them.  I am open to doing that with Members who want to involve themselves in that process, because we are determined to do this right, and with the approval of Members.  I am happy to do that and to share the regulations with Members.  I am confident that it is about bringing transparency to all of the decisions of the WRC.  It welcomes that, as would most people.</p><p>I do not agree that this would deter employees bringing cases forward.  People should recognise that in this country we are entitled to have our rights vindicated.  We should have no fears in doing that.  On previous days, there was commentary that this would prevent that.  It should not and will not.  We do not want to encourage this in any shape or form.  Any decent employer will not hold it against a potential employee who took a case to the WRC to vindicate his or her rights under our employment law.  We are proud of our legislation in this country.  People should feel free to be able to use it and should not be deterred from going to the courts or the WRC.  Hopefully, we can work with Members to give people assurances and the confidence they need.  The WRC can do its job well, either in public or private.  That is what we are trying to do.</p><p>Senator O'Loughlin raised the issue of the offence of perjury.  All fraudulent claims should be prevented because people&rsquo;s reputations are affected on all sides of this.  That is why perjury is included in the amendments.  It should strengthen the case with the WRC in terms of justice.</p><p>I have dealt with private hearings and with most of these things I was asked about.  A few Senators raised the work the WRC does and whether it has enough people to do it.  They quoted the number of inspectors.  At this stage, the WRC's budget is approximately &euro;15 million.  It has been that amount for the last number of years and it will remain at that.  We engage with the chair of the WRC and its team to ensure it has enough resources to carry out its work.  Of course, it is extremely busy.  We are in the process of recruiting new inspectors to back up its service.  At the moment, there are approximately 53 WRC inspectors, 48 of whom are at executive officer, EO, level, while five are at higher executive officer, HEO, level.  We are engaging in the process to bring in new people.  We recognise there needs to be an increase in its staff levels.  I am happy to work with the WRC directly on that in the years ahead.  Part of my job as, Minister of State with responsibility for it, is to secure extra money for it.  I am glad we are doing that.  We will continue to do that.</p><p>There is also training for the WRC inspectors and we will do that as well.  A decision made in 2006 about the number being 90 is often referred to.  To be clear, many changes and reforms have happened since that point.  That year predates the WRC being set up.  Five bodies were brought together to create the WRC.  We made these changes nine or ten years later.  In 2015, we brought in a new law.  Therefore, I do not think 2006 is the best point of reference.  The agreement was made with the unions in 2006, prior to what happened in this country in 2007, 2008, and 2009.  There were many changes on the way, and not just in terms of what happened financially to the country, but in how the WRC was set up and how it was run.  The bodies have changed.  While I accept we need to strengthen numbers, I do not necessarily think 90 is the right number to get to.  However, we will work with the WRC to make sure we are at the appropriate level.  That is what I am doing under the direction and guidance of the T&aacute;naiste.</p><p>I hope I have covered all the questions that were raised.  I look forward to being here again during the week to complete the legislation, if we can.</p></speech>

In accordance with Standing Order 148, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question, "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.  This is looked upon as the report of the D&aacute;il amendments to the Seanad.  For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments.  The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments.  I have circulated the proposed groupings to the House.  A Senator may contribute once on each grouping.  The only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

As the Chair has outlined, I am just reporting on amendments made in the D&aacute;il.  Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 relate to section 6 of the Bill, which allows local authorities to enter arrangements with specific bodies for the provision of affordable homes.  I previously accepted a Seanad amendment to subsection 6(4) to refer to the long-term sustainability of diverse communities, including the intergenerational sustainability of urban communities.  The Government amendment &mdash; No. 3 &mdash; to section 6(4), as passed by the Seanad, removes the word &quot;undue&quot; and the amended provision will read:</p> <blockquote> 	In performing its functions under <i>subsection (1)</i>, a housing authority shall have regard to the need to&mdash;   	(a) counteract segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds, and support the long-term sustainability of diverse communities, including the inter-generational sustainability of urban communities.    </blockquote> <p>These amendments had their genesis in the Seanad, whose views we took on board and brought to the D&aacute;il.  I am satisfied the provision adequately captures the requirement on housing authorities to consider the need to support diverse and sustainable communities.</p><p>On amendments Nos. 1 and 2, I previously accepted a Sinn F&eacute;in amendment in the Seanad to allow housing authorities to enter arrangements with co-operatives, community housing trusts and other not-for-profit bodies to make dwellings available for affordable dwelling purchase arrangements.  This added such bodies to approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency and public&ndash;private partnerships.  While the principle of this Opposition amendment has been accepted, it was made clear that it would need to be refined and reviewed to ensure it was legally sound.  Having done that, I tabled an amendment in the D&aacute;il to replace the provision with &quot;arrangements with a community-led housing organisation, a housing cooperative or a community land trust&quot;.  I also proposed the inclusion of a new subsection (3) in the section, which allows the Minister to prescribe &quot;minimum requirements in relation to governance, previous experience, financial management and financial reporting&quot; to be met by such organisations, housing co-operatives or community land trusts.</p><p>These revised provisions have been drafted after consideration by my officials and in consultation with the Housing Agency and the Attorney General's office.  I am satisfied that the amended provisions will be fit for purpose.  They are significant.  In fairness, there has been a broad welcome from the community housing sector.  I believe this is the first time in legislation that it has been specifically referred to. That, in itself, is important.  It shows we have genuinely taken on board the debates in the Seanad and the Opposition amendments.  I brought the proposals to the D&aacute;il and am now reporting to the Seanad that they have been taken on board.  That concludes my comments on Government amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3.</p></speech>

I acknowledge Senator Warfield, who tabled the initial amendment.  In acknowledging that there was broad acceptance from the entire House, it is important to note that we particularly wanted to include the sector in question in the legislation.  It is appropriate that the Minister has added the additional mechanisms on "minimum requirements in relation to governance, previous experience, financial management" because, ultimately, when it comes to the approved housing bodies, the councils and community trusts, all the transactions are on the State's balance sheet as a result of the decision made by EUROSTAT several years ago to reclassify approved housing bodies.  We have to be prudent in every measure we pass in this House but the development is welcome.  It ties in with what we are trying to achieve, which is to ramp up the production of affordable units by any mechanism possible.</p></speech>

I thank him for his explanation and rationale.  I will not delay because we have a lot of work ahead of us.  I wish the Minister well and thank him for his work.  In particular, I thank his staff, who have supported him in this long, drawn-out process.  We have had a lot of engagement so it is now time to roll out the show.  The Minister has a lot of work to do on his own policies and plans regarding housing.  I wish him well.</p></speech>

As he said, these amendments were really initiated in the Seanad.  I understand that wording may need to be changed to get the meaning across and to be legally sound.  Everybody recognises that.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1 is core to Green Party values.  My colleague Deputy Duffy was keen to have it inserted.  I thank the Minister for taking it on board.  He has also taken on board views of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p> <p>I have spoken here before about the importance of sustainable communities.  It is not just about housing; it is also about homes.  It matters who is living in those homes when it comes to building up an entire community.  We need to ensure intergenerational sustainability because it is important that children meet older generations and that we all learn from one another.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pauline O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=PaulineOreilly&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is about diverse backgrounds but also different age groups.  City centres have been hollowed out.  This Bill acknowledges that the Government is building sustainable communities in our cities and towns to ensure it is not a flash in the pan.  These are well-thought-out policies.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward the changes but also the amount of work he has done.  We have been in government a year. Look at what has been achieved in housing.  Several Bills have gone through this week on housing.  Nothing is a quick fix but this will give people a lot of solace.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.237" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#FFF00500"><p>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 relate to consequential amendments.  Amendment No. 4 deletes the previous section 26.  Section 26 contained three amendments to Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  My amendments Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, insert a new Part 6 into the Bill containing a number of amendments to Part V of the 2000 Act.   As such, the three amendments that were in section 26 have been moved to the new Part 6.</p> <p>On amendment No. 5, section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 is the general provision listing the various types of housing services with which local authorities may be engaged in providing.  It was considered that the provision of cost rental housing could be read into section 10 of the 2009 Act, since section 10(a)(ii) refers to the provision of &ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo;.  However, to avoid any ambiguity and after consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, amendment No. 5 was added as a consequential on Part 3 of this Bill introducing cost rental housing as a new form of tenure because the involvement of local authorities in the provision of this type of housing is envisaged.  Accordingly, this drafting amendment will insert into section 10 of the 2009 Housing Act a new paragraph (e) referencing cost rental dwellings as an additional type of housing service that a local authority may provide.  This will provide a clear statutory basis for local authorities engaging in the provision of cost rental housing.</p> <p>While it is a technical amendment, it is very significant.  The Bill means there will be a national cost rental scheme for the first time which will initially be rolled out through our partners in the approved housing bodies.  Last week I had the pleasure of opening the first 25 homes, which tenants will occupy in around four weeks.  It has moved very quickly.  This amendment also ensures that as a housing tenure, cost rental is seen as one that can be provided through a local authority.  In the very near future, they will have a role in delivering cost rental.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1647" speakername="John Cummins" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#FFF00600"><p>The Minister rightly points out that, though technical, it is a very significant amendment to allow the cost rental sector to be accessed by local authorities.  I have spoken to him before about an idea I put to him on the use of the repair and lease scheme and how it could be combined with the cost rental scheme.  On the double, it would remove dereliction from our cities, towns and villages and provide them not only as social homes but provide an option whereby they would also be provided as cost rental.  We do not want to have just one tenure of social housing.  We are now able to provide cost rental homes and get the mix of all incomes into the city centres.  The amendment is very welcome and I compliment the Minister on it.</p></speech>

People should be clear on the importance of cost rental and how we are pioneering something new for Ireland that has been done very well elsewhere.  I commend Deputies Matthews and Duffy on their work on this.  It is important to see when a smaller party can make a good contribution that can be listened to and taken on board.  We appreciate the Minister's work on this.  Social housing is a certain type of housing.  Cost rental will also be available to people who do not qualify for social housing.  It is a whole new ball game in some ways.  It will not be rented at a profit.  It is a non-profit way of renting houses.  The rent is priced based on the cost of building the house only.  It does not set out to make any profit and does not take the cost of the site into account.  It is good for the local authorities.  They will be well capable of doing this.  It is more of the Government's commitment to public housing on public property and I thank the Minister for the work he has done to date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#FFF00800"><p>This sounds like a technical amendment, which sounds boring, irrelevant and maybe unimportant, but it is critically important to the work the Minister and the Government are doing around changing housing policy.  Affordable cost rental is a brand new model of housing in Ireland that will provide both affordability and security of tenure for renters.  That is critically important and nowhere more so than here in Dublin where many people do not qualify for social housing because their income is just above the social housing income threshold but they cannot afford to live and to pay rent.  The introduction for the first time in the State's history of affordable cost rental housing, not only in Dublin but nationally, is very welcome.</p> <p>It is an issue I and my former colleagues on Dublin City Council championed two years ago.  The Minister will be familiar with O'Devaney Gardens, which is in my local area and which has the capacity to deliver more than 1,000 homes.  That is a site where we, as councillors tried to amend the proposal for the site to ensure there would be a minimum 80% social and affordable on the site, including 30% affordable cost rental.  We were challenged by the Opposition.  In fact, we were threatened by legal action by the Opposition.  I very much appreciate that the Minister is taking the action to legislate for affordable cost rental.  It has been spoken about for a very long time by many politicians but the Minister and this Government is implementing it and will make it available throughout the country.  I accept others, such as sustainable or ethical investment funds, will be in a position to provide affordable cost rental.  They are important but our local authorities are closest to our local communities.  In undertaking their housing needs assessments, they will now be able to include affordable cost rental in those.  I welcome this development.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for all the work he and his officials have done.  I urge him to use his position at Cabinet to influence the Ministers for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and others to ensure the local authorities are funded because we need to scale this up greatly.  As the Minister said, 25 affordable cost rental homes were made available last week and there were more than 500 applications.  That validates the Minister's action to change the provision of housing in the country, but it also sends a strong message to all of us that we need to scale it up massively.  I am sure that is what the Minister plans to do in Housing for All and I wish him well in his work.</p></speech>

Cost rental is incredibly important.  Like Senator Fitzpatrick, I also want to see it scaled up massively.  This is a start.  We wanted proof of concept and that is why the first 25 units were so important.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.244" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#GGG00300"><p>The amendments concern cost-rental provisions.  Amendment No. 6 will insert language to illustrate matters that, under section 33, the Minister may prescribe as mandatory terms in every cost-rental tenancy agreement.  As with social housing, it will not be the Minister who is the landlord for cost rental.  However, the power to prescribe mandatory terms in tenancy agreements will allow the Minister to ensure there are common standards throughout the sector.  It is our intention that there will be only one cost-rental sector in Ireland, subject to the same regulation irrespective of who the landlord is.</p> <p>It was always intended that these mandatory terms would cover key points such as the setting and review of rent and security of tenure in line with provisions in the Bill.  It is prudent, however, to make this explicit and to provide that the Minister may prescribe other incidental matters, that is, the little details that need to be concluded for cost rental to become a working reality.  We will have, by the time this legislation has passed, a national cost-rental scheme and will publish the regulations and criteria for eligibility in the coming weeks, both for this and the affordable purchase scheme.</p> <p>Amendment No. 7 clarifies a point concerning limited rent increases under the cost-rental model.  A tenant will make his or her first monthly rent payment at the new, higher rate at least 28 days after receipt of a valid rent review notice, rather than the date on which it was issued.  A tenant will, therefore, have at least four weeks in which to make, for example, arrangements with a bank to alter a standing order.  The notice will run, as is most prudent, from when the tenant has received the notice document.  Even though a monthly rent payment will fall within the four-week notice period, tenants will not have to pay the new, higher rent rate.  They can pay at the old rate and settle the small difference with the landlord at any time during the following three months.  While this may differ from the rent review system in the private rented sector, this should not be surprising.  We should think of cost rental as a new system with its own processes and timetables, and this amendment will make the process run much more smoothly for tenant and landlord alike.</p></speech>

I have received many queries about the cost-rental units that the Minister launched last week in Fingal and the &euro;53,000 figure, which I understand is the net figure as opposed to gross.  It is important that this be clarified and he might do so.  In the context of ramping up the cost-rental equity loan that was launched to deliver those aid schemes this year, it is important that we also examine other schemes that were not successful, apart from the other eight.  I have spoken about this previously.  There are two in my county, Waterford, that are on the ground, building and delivering units as we speak.  They are able to come in under the cost-rental system and provide homes this year, and the developers certainly want to play their part with the AHBs in doing that.  Anything that can be done to speed up that process for a second tranche of applicants who were not successful in the first tranche, to get them out and to deliver more homes this calendar year, will be welcome.</p></speech>

As I said when I was talking about affordable cost rental, the two benefits it will bring to renters are security of tenure and affordability.  In order for that to be delivered to every renter in an affordable cost rental, it has to be uniform and standardised and there cannot be local vagaries and variations.  This is all about trying to improve the security of people's tenure in their own home.  It is a brand new scheme and a new way of providing homes in our country.  Those two elements, namely, security of tenure and affordability, being standardised throughout the system on a uniformed basis, is critical.  It builds on the work the Government has done in improving and enhancing protections for renters, the continuation of the RPZs and the capping of rent increases at inflation, which has been welcomed by renters.  It gives them certainty and should certainly improve affordability.  I urge the Minister, when the Bill and the regulations have passed, to have his Department conduct a wider information campaign.  There is an awful lot of interest but, as Senator Cummins said, there are questions.  It would be beneficial, therefore, if the Department were to undertake an information campaign.</p></speech>

When local authorities take over houses from private landlords under the HAP scheme, the standard is often a C3 building energy rating, BER.  If the landlord does not live in the house, it may kind of be left up to the tenant to deal with that standard.  With the cost-rental model, we should look at best practice regarding BERs in order that tenants will not have significant outgoings to heat their houses.  If we are building new houses, they should all have air-to-water or fossil-fuel-free systems since we are now in 2021 and that is the way forward.</p></speech>

As I raised previously in the House, I would like to see tenancies in perpetuity as a matter of course, but that has not been included in the Bill, to the best of my knowledge.  The Minister envisages dealing with that through regulations.  I would like to hear some commentary from him on that.  We have to accept we are living longer, for one, and we do not want somebody to go into a cost-rental unit aged 20 and, in line with a previous amendment, have to leave aged 60.  We want to ensure they will have that security of tenure, particularly in those older years when we do not want anybody to be worrying.  In the case of someone who has died, for instance, what kind of succession path is there in regard to the property?</p></speech>

As we explained in the D&aacute;il, the reason for having regulations for cost rental and affordable purchase is they will be easier to change as opposed to primary legislation.  I envisage there will be changes as we roll out the scheme and as we see how it works.  We will go on a net-income basis, which will be sufficiently high to take in low- and medium-income families and individuals, the cohorts we are targeting.  That is why there is no distinction between and an individual and a family.</p> <p>We are in July, and we should expect to have them published by mid-August, given that the first tenants coming in through the first few schemes will operate under those regulations.  They will be published and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are still doing a little work on them, but when they are complete, it might be useful in September to discuss them when we come back to the Houses.  They will mean it will be more flexible for us.  Some issues have been flagged and Senator Cummins, for example, mentioned his county in the context of median prices and so on.  These are new schemes and there are some aspects we will need to work through as we embed them, which is why regulations are the more appropriate way forward, as opposed to having an arbitrary cap on salary or net income.  We will work that through.</p> <p>On the other point, I envisage that cost-rental homes will certainly be new homes.  They will be nearly zero energy buildings, NZEB, top-rated homes.  Any of the ones I have visited have been built to the best standards.  This is a new form of housing tenure.  I am excited about it because of the capacity and the interest in it from both the Government, which is supporting it, and ethical pension funds such as those in operation in Vienna, for argument's sake, where they are involved in delivery.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I also expect the Land Development Agency to deliver a significant level of cost-rental homes.  I believe that the capacity that we have and the potential in this area is vast.  We could be looking back on this period when we established this in legislation, in three, four or five years' time, when we have hundreds of thousands of cost-rental tenancies in every part of the country.  I want to see a good regional spread of such housing.  </p><p>In response to Senator Cummins, as we move the cost-rental equity loan, CREL, scheme forward, we will review it.  There were eight sites selected in the first tranche of funding.  With the affordable housing fund and CREL scheme open, we can look at schemes again as they go forward.  I am particularly anxious about near-time delivery.  I want to see people in these homes as quickly as possible.  I want to see homes being delivered now.  That is why the Affordable Housing Bill in general will also allow for mixed tenure turnkey housing.  There will be affordable, social and cost-rental housing all in the one development.  It will really broaden the opportunities for the delivery of homes for the real people who matter, who are stuck in unaffordable rental traps, living at home with their folks into their 30s and 40s, and who either want to buy or rent at an affordable rate.</p></speech>

During the Second Stage debate, I flagged that these amendments, whose purpose is to expand the use of Part V in accordance with the programme for Government commitment, would be added to the Bill, to include the provision of affordable housing on top of the protection of the 10% social housing, during its passage through the D&aacute;il.</p><p>The changes we are making to Part V entail a number of amendments to sections 93 to 97, inclusive, of the 2000 Act.  These have all been included in a new Part 6 within the Bill, with a separate section in the Affordable Housing Bill for each of those sections in the planning Act 2000.  Consequently, the three Part V amendments already included in section 26 of the published Bill have been moved to the new Part 6, and what was section 26, has been deleted.</p><p>The effect of the substantive amendments to sections 93 to 97, inclusive, of the 2000 Act will be to implement the programme for Government commitment in relation to <font color="#2F2F2F">expanding Part V to encompass affordable purchase and cost-rental units, and introducing affordable homes requirements to Part V.</font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">  </font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">It is particularly pleasing for me.  I was involved in the negotiations and putting together the programme for Government.  It is pleasing that in respect of housing, we are seeing a lot of what we said we would do as a Government in the programme for Government coming to fruition.  I particularly want to thank my own team within the Department and also the Attorney General and his staff for their work on it.  </font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The provisions </font>amend the Part V requirement to a mandatory 20% in all cases, for social and affordable requirements.  Colleagues will recall that that was changed a number of years ago.  They were different times and such a change was fine then.  Now it is time to change it back and ensure that we are protecting the 10% social housing and adding the 10% affordable housing.  The provisions remove the link to a specified percentage need in the housing strategy reflected in the development plan objectives, require a minimum social housing contribution of 10% and include cost rental housing within the housing need for estimation in the housing strategy and for provision using the Part V requirement in appropriate cases.  That means that the 10% social housing in private can be varied.  That can be done, but within that, cost-rental and affordable purchase housing can also be provided.  The provisions also apply a transitional five-year provision for land purchased between 1 September 2015 and 31 July 2021, during which time the requirement will continue to be at 10% with all to be applied to social housing provision and revert back to an exempted development size of fewer than five dwellings from the current figure of fewer than 10.  The provisions apply the Part V contribution to developments granted planning permission on land not zoned residential as a material contravention of the development plan and provide for the estimation of social, affordable and cost rental need breakdown by the chief executive during the period until the next housing strategy subsequent to the changes being made.  It is significant that within the housing need demands assessment, the local authorities will provide an estimation of the social, affordable and, indeed, cost-rental housing need.  In addition, the opportunity was also taken to make some technical amendments to Part V that apply the site purchase and lease options and the house purchase price calculation provisions to approved housing bodies as well as to local authorities, remove the unnecessary eight-week time limit on the ability to refer disputes to arbitration, update some references to subsequently amended statutory provisions and correct an anomaly in the exemption certificate provision.  </p><p>The main effect of the changes is that a mandatory 20% Part V requirement focuses on capturing the full amount of the planning gain for the State on every applicable site, in every local authority area, by breaking the link between the Part V requirement on each site and the social and affordable requirements of the local authority, as set out in its housing strategy.  Under these changes to Part V, if a local authority does not require 20% of properties in a permitted development for social or affordable housing, it can take the lower number of properties it does require and apply the balance of the equivalent net monetary value as a discount on the cost of those units.  That is a significant change.  In the very unlikely event of a planning permission for a housing development at a location where there is no requirement for any type of social, affordable purchase or cost rental housing, the Part V requirement can be satisfied by a transfer of land or the transfer of houses elsewhere in the local authority area.  If the former is the case, the local authority can use the land for another of its functions or sell it on the open market and apply the proceeds to its housing functions.  If the latter is the case, the cost of the acquisition of units elsewhere in the area will be reduced by the net monetary value of 20% of the land.  In this way, once these changes take effect, the State will capture 20% of the planning gain from every applicable housing development.  That is a very significant change.</p></speech>

It was well flagged in the Minister's Second Stage speech here that it was going to be brought forward as an amendment in the D&aacute;il.  I have a slight concern that it may increase the price of houses in the remaining 80% of the development, but I accept that it is one of the quickest mechanisms for the delivery of affordable housing by attaching a 10% affordable housing requirement within a development in addition to the 10% social housing requirement.  The fact that it also includes the cost rental is a welcome move.  Perhaps the Minister could offer some assurances that the scenario outlined, whereby there is not a demand for that 20%, will not arise particularly often.  I cannot really see that happening.  There is such a demand out there in terms of both social and affordable housing.  Perhaps the Minister could comment on that issue briefly.</p> <p>I welcome the move.  I think it is going to have a big impact in terms of affordable housing provision.  I ask the Minister to comment on when it will come into force.  Will it come into force when the Bill is signed into law by the President or when the Government issues a commencement notice subsequent to that?  When will new planning applications be subject to this additional 10% requirement?</p></speech>

We opposed the removal of affordable housing from Part V when it occurred.  We are delighted to see that this legislation is going to ensure that in every new development there will be a minimum of 10% social housing and with a potential of up to another 10% affordable housing.  It is critically important to support would-be homeowners in securing their home, a home that they can own outright over time, but purchase at an affordable rate.  It is appropriate that the Government, on behalf of the State, is supporting would-be homeowners and people on modest incomes who have been priced out of the market and who desperately want to own and purchase their own home.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Fitzpatrick:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MaryFitzpatrick&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is appropriate that the Government, on behalf of the State, supports would-be homeowners, including people who are on modest incomes who have been priced out of the market and desperately want to purchase their own home.

A transition period is allowed for someone who has purchased already.  There is a period of five years when the 10% will apply but there is an activation measure where if it is not developed, an additional 10% will apply to the land.  For any new land purchase after the commencement order is signed, where someone lodges a planning application later this year, for example, there will be a requirement of 10% social housing and 10% affordable housing.  Existing permissions were granted on the basis of the legislation that was in place at that stage.  This change applies to future permissions.  It will ensure that we will have affordable housing as well as the social units across the country, wherever housing is developed.  I have been at pains to say that we support people in the honest, just and noble aspiration that they have to own their own home.  This will help.  It is another measure on top of the shared equity scheme and affordable housing directly built by local authorities.  This is Part V housing, which ensures that the private sector also delivers affordable homes as well as social housing.</p></speech>

It suggests it would be advisable if the commencement of the Act were not sooner than the publication of the final report of the commission of investigation into the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The Minister will be aware that, in 2017, the Government set up an investigation into NAMA, particularly Project Eagle and the associated portfolio.  The reason this is relevant is that I believe we have a record in this State of having an agency set up at a slight arm's remove from the State to which the State has given immense power.  NAMA was given access to an extraordinarily large portfolio of properties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was regrettable that more of those properties designated to NAMA were not directed towards addressing our housing crisis.  In fact, there is a strong record of NAMA selling many of its portfolio properties in bulk to investment firms.  That is the basis of the current investigation into Project Eagle.  The report on that, which has been postponed a number of times, is due in September this year.  Given that the report is due in September, it would seem advisable to wait until it is published before we commence another very large agency, which will also have extraordinary powers and access to a large portfolio of properties, so we can ensure that if there were structural or systemic problems or faults within the operation of NAMA, we can learn from them, apply them and ensure the same or similar mistakes are not made in respect of the land development agency, LDA.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The Senator has explained her position and why she believes it is appropriate.  I oppose it on the basis that the LDA is entirely separate to NAMA.  We have spent a lot of time on this.  The LDA exists, and has existed for a number of years now, but it does not have legislation to underpin it.  We need to get the LDA set up on a primary legislative footing so we can actually capitalise it, allow it to get on with delivering homes for people on State-owned land and put that land to productive use on behalf of our people.  The objective is to enable the LDA to undertake strategic land assembly and to effectively use lands for the public good for the provision of social and affordable housing, initially on the nine sites it has but on more sites after that.</p> <p>The independent commission of investigation into NAMA relates, as the Senator said, to Project Eagle, which was around the sale of its Northern Ireland portfolio.  There is zero link between the LDA and the investigation into NAMA.  While I accept the reason the Senator believes it is of importance, I cannot accept an amendment that will effectively delay the formal establishment on a legislative footing of the LDA on the basis of waiting for a report about an agency that has nothing to do with the LDA.  It is absolutely possible, and I do not have this information, that the commission of investigation could seek an extension to its timeline, as it is able to do, beyond the current deadline of September 2021.  If I were to accept the amendment and the commission were to be extended further, where would we go with the LDA?  Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

That is one of the concerns because everybody wants to see a sea change in the relationship between the State and investors, including speculative property dynamics.  It is a concern to many people that many of those whose risk-taking drove the State into great risk and debt and, indeed, into the crash in 2008, seem to have emerged very successfully from it, while in many cases the public has lost out in terms of opportunities.  There is a concern and a hunger for transparency around NAMA.  I was hoping my amendment might have the double benefit of encouraging the final publication of that report on NAMA, which is very overdue, as well as, crucially, giving us the learning from it.</p> <p>I will not speak further because others will come to it, but many of the concerns about the suite of measures being put forward at the moment are about the fact that there is still a relationship with investment funds and speculative dynamics.  That is why we need to be extra careful to structure this as well as possible.  I understand the Minister cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The piece that is certainly up front is the discussion on social, affordable and cost-rental housing, but the concern is that, as the Bill is currently constructed, there is a lot of provision for all kinds of other uses for the land, including commercial housing.  Many of the points relating to amendment No. 18, and I recognise that others, such as amendment No. 19, address a similar point, is that the functioning and clear remit of this Bill should be to address the crisis in social, affordable and cost-rental housing.  We should not have a land development agency that is simply seeking to intervene, and play a role, in a private housing market or which is inviting a private housing market to play a key role in relation to it.  The attempts to narrow the function and purpose of this Bill are the concern.</p><p>The earlier amendments specifically address that issue because the key purposes and functions of the Bill only refer to housing and do not specify public housing.  The Bill refers to housing and the inclusion of affordable and social housing.  Of course, there is also a very big difference between affordable and social housing.  Affordable housing, for example, might only be public for a very few moments and then you have a direct purchase arrangement so, ultimately, it is on its journey to leaving the State.  Cost rental, as set up under the Affordable Housing Bill, unfortunately allows firms to build cost-rental housing and, potentially, reclaim the properties as assets at the end of a period of time.  That is some of the concern we have.</p><p>This amendment copper-fastens that the public good should be the core and, indeed, only focus of this Bill, and should be the test against which the powers, functions and actions of the LDA are set.  Others have similar amendments.</p></speech>

I am speaking to amendment No. 19.  All 14 of the amendments I will be dealing with, which I will not go into now, are not mine but are the work of the Association of Irish Local Government.  They are the result of engagement with the joint Oireachtas committee by members of the association, which represents all parties in this House.  It is the work of members of the association.  I acknowledge their enormous work and thank them and their executive for the amount of work they did in preparing these amendments.  I have only undertaken to be a conduit for these amendments, but I happen to believe in them too.  They are very important amendments.  I will be pretty tight in my contributions today because I am very conscious of the time we have allotted to discuss this important legislation.</p> <p>The rationale for amendment No. 19, which proposes to delete line 18 on page 9 and replace it with "so far as is necessary for the provision of social, affordable and cost rental housing and to achieve the purposes specified in this section", is to seek to restrict the LDA's ability to engage in commercial activities.  While some involvement in the market can be beneficial in order to generate funding, it must be the case that these funds are funnelled straight back into the housing supply and the agency does not function as a revenue-generating project for the Exchequer.  To this end, the agency's involvement in commercial activities must be in keeping with its mandate, which is, as the Minister knows, to provide social and affordable cost-rental housing.</p></speech>

The Affordable Housing Bill just went through the House.  Members will know that we accepted some Opposition amendments when we could.  We are always open to doing that but these amendments seek to amend section 2 of the Bill, which provides for the purpose of the Bill by inserting a reference to public, social and affordable housing.  I am opposing these amendments because there is already a reference to affordable and social housing in this section, as there is in multiple sections throughout the Bill.  This is about the activation of idle, State-owned land, on many sites all of us are aware of, to deliver social and affordable housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is what we want to do.</p><p>These amendments - I say this respectfully - do not add anything further to the section and only seek to rephrase what is already in the Bill.  The purpose of the Bill, as Senators will know, is to establish the LDA and make appropriate arrangements for the utilisation of public land for housing.  That is it, simply - that is what it is.  We have the first nine sites and many more are to come.  The Bill is seeking to increase the supply of housing, especially affordable and social housing, by ensuring that public land not being utilised or being under-utilised is made available for housing.  We have made significant changes right through the Bill to further reinforce that and to ensure we have the agency in a position whereby it will be able to break ground this year on its first project and deliver cost-rental affordable and social homes.  This is exciting but we should be doing more.  That is why we need this Bill through.  We have covered amendments Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, 8, 12, 18 and 19.  I cannot accept any of them.</p></speech>

Local authorities have the responsibility of developing Traveller accommodation and a Traveller accommodation strategy.  It is important that the LDA will be cognisant of the responsibility it has to the Travelling community in the development of public land.</p> <p>One thing that arises is that local authorities do not spend their budgets when it comes to the provision of Traveller accommodation.  The Minister knows about this because it comes up at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community when we are discussing accommodation.  In many circumstances local authority members refuse to vote for Traveller accommodation or through other means oppose it or use value for money arguments for certain sites.  We saw a local election candidate who is now a Minister do this when it came to the provision of Traveller accommodation for people who had been made homeless as a result of the Carrickmines fire.  The attitude is prevalent in Irish society.  We have the opportunity with the LDA Bill to address this.  An agency that is developing public land for housing needs to include the Traveller accommodation strategy in its work.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.  This could be helpful in terms of developing Traveller accommodation.  Some local authorities have frustrated that process over the years.</p></speech>

For too long we have seen Traveller accommodation not being delivered or delivered on unsuitable land.  Sometimes it has been left to the end of allocation when almost every other purpose has been looked at before the land is allocated to Traveller accommodation.  This is completely unacceptable.  All of the things we look for in every community, including connectivity, good sanitation, access to amenities and access to education are crucial for the Traveller community.  In anything that addresses public housing on a large scale it is important that there would be such a consideration.  It may well be that the LDA can add value and look to co-operation between areas in that regard.</p> <p>I support the amendment.  If the amendment is accepted, that is great.  If not, I may return with another amendment on Report Stage.</p> <p>I wish to point out there are intersections between those in the Travelling community and those who have disabilities.  Another thing that I will be talking about is appropriate accommodation for persons with disabilities within any large-scale master planning.  We should recognise there may be overlap in those areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#OOO01300"><p>We have made some changes already.  This came up on Committee Stage at the joint committee and there was a good discussion around it.  I brought in an amendment on Report Stage.  I believe the LDA can add value here.</p> <p>The Government and I have always completely supported the provision of Traveller accommodation.  I have always done so right through and I feel strongly about it.  This year we have seen an increase in the budget for Traveller accommodation of &euro;15.5 million and it will all be spent.  Points have been made around underspend and they are correct.  Some local authorities have underspent.  This year that will not happen.  The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Peter Burke, is doing a really good job in this area.</p> <p>I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 6 and 31 but I want to explain why.  I brought an amendment on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to insert an expanded provision in section 15.  That is in place.  It is to ensure that when local authorities request the services of the LDA in respect of the development of large-scale sites in areas with a population greater than 30,000 - this is the area where the LDA will be operating - the agency can, where appropriate, assist in the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.</p> <p>One thing I do not want - I do not believe Senators want this either - is for local authorities to be uncertain about their role.  The provision of Traveller-specific accommodation is a matter for local authorities.  I have no wish to undermine the role of a local authority or the view of the role a local authority has.  There may be an unintended consequence if we were to move this role towards the LDA.  I realise Senators have no wish for that to happen.  I have changed section 15 following good discussions at the joint committee in this regard to ensure that Traveller accommodation is specifically mentioned.  Nevertheless, we need to be clear that the relevant local authority in any given area is the body responsible and resourced for the provision of good-quality Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>Thankfully, this year we will see the capital budget fully expended.  Last year, the allocation was over &euro;14 million.  In 2020 all of the capital envelope was spent, as is appropriate, for the first time in six years.  We need to continue that.  Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and others have been involved in the publication of the White Paper in this regard.  I have been heavily involved, as has the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on the justice side, because we want to and will bring an end to direct provision.  I have had discussions with the Minister and this has also come up at the joint Oireachtas committee.  It is for the specific Department to source the necessary accommodation for persons in the asylum process and I have offered the expertise of the Housing Agency.  We worked through this with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to assist that Department by providing expert advise on the sourcing, delivery and management of accommodation.  While the LDA has a specific role to assist local authorities in providing accommodation, this is an acknowledgement of the statutory role of the local authority as a housing authority.  The LDA will not be a housing authority or a planning authority.  Therefore, I cannot agree to the expansion of the LDA role to include provision of accommodation for applicants for international protection.</p> <p>Where the LDA's expertise is sought or required, it will be given.  We have had these discussions already.  The Housing Agency, as the joint committee discussed in detail, will have a specific role in advising the Department on asylum seekers and bringing about the much-needed end of direct provision, which is what we want to do.  I cannot accept amendment No. 7.</p></speech>

I am trying to build on the same kind of points.  "Social background" is problematic language.  We discussed it at great length and quite philosophically during the Affordable Housing Bill so I will not rehash that.  There were concerns across the House in relation to it.  The question of income was raised.  I give credit to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, for accepting my amendment on diverse, sustainable communities and diverse, intergenerational and sustainable inner-city communities.  I may submit that language again.  I encourage the Minister to consult the Minister of State because it would be useful if the same language was used in the Affordable Housing Bill and this Bill.  It brings a wider and more holistic recognition of what we are trying to create, rather than the narrow idea of social background.  I would also bear in mind that if we end up with what we are seeing, which is estates 20%, 30% or 40% owned by the same company, that is not giving us a meaningful social mix.</p> <p>I will speak to amendment No. 11.  I am concerned about the language.  It suggests "sustainable development".  I am all for that phrasing and for sustainable development goal 11 on sustainable cities and communities.  However, "new and regenerated communities" contains an assumption that these are new communities or communities that need regeneration or have deteriorated.  I propose the idea of "existing communities" because, in many cases, we have vibrant and thriving existing communities, inner-city communities in many cases, which have a growing housing need.  We have a new generation who wish to remain and live there.  In some cases, it is not a matter of regeneration.  I worry that we could drift into language of gentrification when we talk about new or regenerated communities, rather than existing or expanded communities, which are also part of the picture.  It is about the signal that sends.</p></speech>

It is inherently bad value.  There have been counterproductive attempts to constantly push private partnership into situations where public delivery should lead.  The problem is subsection (p) is muddy and it talks about public-private collaboration in relation to private land, agency land and public land.  We know public delivery of public housing on public land develops better public value in the current context.  Yet the insertion of private bodies into that mix means those bodies' goals have to be satisfied.  In many cases, those goals are a profit and a dividend.  If they are commercial bodies, that is their goal and function.</p> <p>I am concerned.  Perhaps there will be scope when the agency talks about what are or are not appropriate mechanisms but many of the mechanisms which have been used in the State's relationships with private and, in some cases, speculative bodies have not been appropriate.</p></speech>

We had people saying in the earlier debate that we cannot have leasing.  Now we are told we cannot have public private partnerships.  We do not want to vote for an LDA which will be tasked with providing public housing on public land.  I have said time and again we have to use every mechanism at our disposal, be it the councils, the approved housing bodies, the Land Development Agency, public private partnerships, leases or private builders to solve the housing crisis.  We consistently ask in this Chamber to tie two hands behind the State's back and still resolve the housing crisis.  It cannot be done.  Please allow this Government to use every tool at its disposal in order to solve the housing crisis.  Otherwise, do not complain that we cannot get on top of our figures.  The only way we will be able to do that is by giving the State every tool in its armoury to deliver for individuals and families.</p></speech>

Leasing has been appallingly bad value and it was flagged early on.  Strategic housing development has not led to the desired outcome.  I have been in this House over six years and have been lectured on the urgency of suspending normal planning processes and of leasing.  At the same time, I have seen local authorities have their hands tied behind their back by housing Ministers who have not allowed them to purchase.  They have forced them into leasing, instead of buying or building.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->With respect, when we talk about tools, it is appropriate for us to say that some tools are better than others.  Of course, we are pushing for action and investment but, to be very clear, we want to make sure that investment delivers housing for the long term.  When we talk about public housing, we want to still have that public housing in 25 years rather than a lot of public land having left public ownership and no longer being available, condemning another generation to struggle for public housing.  With respect, there are nuances and differences between tools.  In fact, the criticisms that have been levied and which this side of the House has put forward numerous times have been proven correct.  In that regard, we should be allowed to engage with the Minister.  We will make our points and he will take them on board in whatever way he wishes.  I will certainly not apologise for raising nuanced points regarding the difference between what is truly public and what is private.</p></speech>

When we are talking about housing, we are talking about people's homes.  We are also talking about the provision of homes and the State taking a lead in the provision of social and affordable homes for our citizens.  We are doing so in the context of a crisis.  We are coming out of a decade of undersupply of housing.  We are also doing it in the context of Covid, which led to a complete shutdown of construction.  Amplifying that problem, much of our population has been displaced outside of the urban centres.  The housing crisis has only intensified.</p> <p>On the suggestion that leasing is bad value, let me say two things.  I speak as someone who has spent time on a local authority and who has spent more than 15 years supporting people and helping them to avoid homelessness.  Local authorities did not have the tools to provide affordable housing or 100% public housing on public land.  This legislation and the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 are changing that.  It will not change it for only the next five or 25 years, but for generations to come.  Public houses will be built on public land and it is to be hoped that they will be there for 100 years or more.  </p> <p>In the here and now, we provide more than 70% of all of the emergency homeless accommodation in Dublin within my constituency.  In this area, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive will pay twice as much for what I consider substandard emergency accommodation than what it would pay for a 25-year lease on a brand new, purpose-built home with an energy rating of A.  In a human crisis, it would be negligent and abusive of any of us to tell the Dublin Region Homeless Executive or Dublin City Council not to lease those homes, to leave those people in that substandard emergency accommodation, not to let them move on with their lives and to traumatise them and their children because we have a principle of not leasing homes.  That is what is being suggested here.  I, for one, will not stand over that.</p></speech>

To remind Senators, we are seeking to use land that is lying idle right now.  We talk about new communities or regeneration but we are not excluding anyone.  Some of these are old industrial units or old hospitals, such as the site in Dundrum.  In many instances, it is about creating new communities.  The amendments tabled, specifically Nos. 9, 10 and 16, seek to amend section 2 to include reference to &ldquo;vibrant, sustainable, mixed income communities&rdquo; or to change references to social background.  As currently drafted, section 2(c) provides that one of the purposes of the Bill is "to counteract segregation in housing between persons of different social background".  Section 2(n) provides that a purpose of the Bill is "to facilitate measures designed to achieve socially integrated housing".  These are very strong, clear provisions.  I oppose the amendments as I believe the issue is adequately covered and the amendments do not substantially change anything.  We all want the same thing.  It is covered in the Bill.  We want the Land Development Agency, LDA, to actually deliver and build homes.</p> <p>We all recognise the importance of greater integration in housing and the delivery of mixed-tenure affordable and social public housing on public lands.  We are trying to achieve that with this Bill.  If one looks at the original general scheme of the previous Bill on the LDA, one will see that we have moved forward a great deal.  It is now focused on delivering mixed tenure and social and affordable homes.  That is key to building sustainable communities.  </p> <p>It is vital that the State uses its land to provide affordable homes for purchase and rent as well as social housing using, as Senator Cummins said, all the means at our disposal.  We have to do that as we are still in a crisis.  We may deliver 20,000 homes this year, between public and private.  We need to be building 33,000.  We needed to build 33,000 last year but built 20,000.  Already, 26,000 homes that should have been built were not built because of Covid.  That is the situation we are in.  We cannot continue to debate matters back and forth, although it is another thing to say that in a debating chamber.  We just need to get on with it.  The Affordable Housing Bill has just passed without any dissent in this House.  It passed with 101 votes for and 8 against in the D&aacute;il.  That gives us the tools to deliver affordable and cost-rental housing at scale.  Through the Land Development Agency, we have an opportunity to ensure the State uses its own lands properly for the good of everyone.  What can be wrong with that?  Most people will agree that is where we should be.  Some do not and I respect their position but they must be really clear.  I am not making a political point with a view to causing difficulties but I cannot agree with parties that say they want a Land Development Agency but that they do not want it to build or plan for homes.  We need an agency that will partner with that awful thing, the private sector, in some instances.  That will happen and it will deliver homes for people and for families.  It will deliver more public homes than have ever been delivered before.  These are good things.  To be fair, I know that all Senators recognise that and want it to happen. </p> <p>I cannot accept amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 16.  Amendment No. 11 seeks to amend section 2(d) by inserting the word "existing" after "new".  The subsection already provides for the sustainable development of new and regenerated communities.  The State has lands on which there was never housing before.  I am not talking about gentrification of areas but about bringing lands that may have been industrial or commercial lands back into use for housing to bring about regenerated communities.  I do not believe this amendment adds significantly to the provision.  I will not be accepting amendment No. 11.</p> <p>Amendment No. 17 proposes to delete a subsection which provides for the establishment of "appropriate mechanisms and collaborative structures between public and private bodies to develop relevant public land, land owned by the Agency and [in some instances] land that is privately owned that is identified as suitable for the strategic and timely delivery of housing".  I oppose that amendment because it would shut off an avenue completely.  We had a discussion on this matter in the D&aacute;il as well.  We also got to a stage when discussing elements of the Affordable Housing Bill at which it became clear that some Members would never accept any type of private finance and that they would only accept the use of Exchequer moneys.  That is not sustainable.  We need both.  The State needs to lead.  We are the biggest investor in housing and the biggest builder, and rightly so.  The State will do that but it is necessary and wholly appropriate for the LDA to partner with other bodies and to establish commercial arrangements, where appropriate, in line with other commercial State bodies.  In its role as a development agency, the LDA will work with other public and private sector landholders to develop larger sites for the provision of housing and the regeneration of communities.  This happens in many other countries.  These countries do not just say that one cannot touch public lands.  While these provisions are fully appropriate, I remind Senators of what is important with regard to the LDA in light of some of the concerns that have been raised, which I do not share although I do understand them.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Land Development Agency will remain in the ownership of the State with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform as its only shareholders.  It is a public body and there is no provision for any other shareholders.  In addition, all dividends will be returned for the benefit of the Exchequer.  Ministerial approval will also be required for the establishment of any subsidiaries of the LDA and, with significant oversight, the LDA will be fully accountable to the joint Oireachtas committee in any of its activities.  </p><p>Amendment No. 30, which I believe is the last one, seeks to amend section 14 by replacing "facilitate the provision of housing for the public good" with "deliver social and affordable housing".  We are talking around this because this is what we are already doing and it is not necessary.  The housing will, of course, be for the public good and we want to ensure that it is.  It will be social and affordable and it is clear from the Bill that the LDA will be delivering affordable, public and social housing on public land.  I will therefore not be accepting any of the amendments that have been tabled.  I thank the Senators, however, for having done so because it allows us to have this discussion around the important elements of housing delivery through the LDA.</p></speech>

If one looks at land, it is the key component of housing.  We, not us, but previous Governments, have made mistakes in the past by allowing the market to lead and putting houses in the wrong place.</p> <p>When one looks at what the LDA hopes to achieve, this Bill is long overdue.

This is the core of it and it is not a question of not liking it because I am very happy for a private market to exist and for the State to engage in the use of private land.  I discussed that with Senator Casey on the Affordable Housing Bill.  The key concern is the use of market dynamics and these amendments amend that section in the Bill which talks about &quot;deficiencies in the housing market and to alleviate the shortage of land available for housing in circumstances where that market is experiencing a systemic housing shortage&quot;.  We need to be clear that this is allowing the market to lead, where it has, in fact, already led much of this and where there has been an over-reliance on the market.  That is why my amendments say that if we want to be real about addressing and delivering housing, we need to identify two of the problems and name them.  </p><p>Two of the problems I suggest we name are speculation and exploitation of scarcity.  The core dynamic of speculation and of large-scale investor, commercial, property investment is the logic whereby scarcity creates demand.  The fact is that again and again this and the previous Government have constantly tried to encourage the role of speculative property investors to engage and these Governments have tried to think of what they need to do to persuade them where we have in fact ended up creating endless perverse incentives.  We have strategic housing developments, the majority of which have not been started even though they got fast track planning permission.  We also have a lowering of standards, which we have read of in the reports, leading many of those who are shovel-ready to go back to the planning process again because they know that their political pressure will allow the standards to be lowered so that they can fit more units in.  These are the facts.</p><p>We know on leasing and can see that dynamic whereby we have created competition.  It is not a matter of local authorities having to make that hard choice in these matters.  We know that there are situations where local authorities are competing with investment firms for housing in this State.  Those are the market dynamics because the market will be given what we have heard about which is risk-free leasing with guaranteed returns over long periods of time, an asset at the end, with the mortgage having been paid.  I am saying this to simply point to the fact that we need to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes again.  We do not need to but if we frame this approach as simply as being shortages that have just magically happened to the market rather than the fact that we know that there are tens of thousands of planning permissions that are not being used because the land value is going up all of the time.  That is a market dynamic that needs to be addressed.  </p><p>That is also why in amendment No. 14, I specifically suggest that the agency, among its many functions - a great deal of which are very laudable ones - should not permit private investment funds to purchase lands, developments or housing for private profit.  If it is going to be public land for public good then let all of it be public land for the public good.  I am suggesting that there be an explicit exclusion here which would send a signal that this is not business as usual, that this is not simply a scaling up of business as usual and that there is no danger of us transferring further resources.  People have seen that they bailed out the banks and developers, that they are transferring money in a large-scale way through leases, and are worried now that public land is going to end up being transferred again to benefit a cohort of people.  That is a very real concern based upon a real record of matters, as we know what drove the property crash in 2008.  That is the context of my amendments.  I will not have many more such amendments on the Bill which will talk about this point as the rest of them are very technical.  If we set this in a wrong way at the very beginning under the purposes of this Act, how we frame the Act and as to the problem, then we will not arrive at the solution that we need.  The fact is that property speculation is not part of the solution but is a large part of the problem.</p></speech>

We reckon that we have enough zoned and serviced State land to deliver about 114,000 homes across the country but what is happening with it?  Very little and that is why this Government wants to get to grips with this through the LDA to deliver it.  In some instances it will mean partnering with the private sector and I do not see anything wrong with that as we need homes for people.  We can either have the ideological discussion back and forth and say that I want this but do not want it this way.  As I said earlier on, we are 26,000 homes behind in two years because of Covid-19 and we really do not have that luxury.  Some of the instances and concerns that the Senator has raised will just not come to pass because they are protected against already.  We can live in a world in which conspiracy exists or we can look towards what the reality of the situation is.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We want an increase in the delivery of housing across the State and, in particular, on affordable housing where it is so acutely needed.  I remind the Senators opposite that the budget passed for 2021 was the biggest public housing budget in the history of the State.  I accept that the Covid pandemic has affected delivery, but we will get back and make up for lost time.  Some &euro;2.1 billion in capital has been allocated.  We need to ensure that we keep up social housing provision, but that we are also delivering affordable homes and cost-rental homes as provided for when we passed the Affordable Housing Bill earlier without any dissent in the House.  That is a good thing.  </p><p>One of the key principles of the legislation relates to delivery of affordable housing.  Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 make reference to speculation and exploitation.  The subsection in the Bill provides that one of the purposes of the Act is to address deficiencies in the housing system and alleviate the shortage of land for housing where the market is experiencing a systemic housing shortage.  It is very clear.  I cannot accept amendments Nos. 13 and 14.  </p><p>Amendment No. 34 seeks to insert a new provision that prevents the agency from permitting any private investment funds to purchase land.  I remind Senators of what the Government has done recently.  We have basically banned the bulk sale of all new properties.  Section 57 deals with the disposal of land by the LDA and subsidiary DACs and provides that ministerial approval is required where the LDA or a subsidiary seeks to dispose of land.  Ministerial approval is also required because of the change in legislation I introduced very recently where more than one house is being sold as part of a linked transaction.  That is specific to the LDA.  The agency will not be able to dispose of more than one house to a single purchaser without seeking ministerial approval.  That is what we have done.  I think the Senator will recognise the importance of that.</p><p>Of course, there will be occasions where it may be appropriate to sell more than one home, such as where the LDA is selling to an AHB, perhaps for cost rental, or to a local authority.  Ministerial consent would not be required for the disposal of a single house for sale or purchase, but it will be required for multiple units.  We are well covered in that space.  I know the point the Senator is making.  We do not need to see speculation or exploitation, but the Bill as it is structured is all about releasing idle public land for productive use, which will have a calming effect on the rest of the market because we are getting more land into the market to build homes for our people, which is what we wanted to do.  </p><p>Therefore, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 34.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to include universal design so that we would have homes suitable for people of all ages and crucially homes that are accessible, helping Ireland to meet its obligations under UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  The Minister will be aware that we have ratified that convention.  In dealing with best practice, it would be appropriate to refer explicitly to universal design and the UNCRPD as part of best practice in construction.</p></speech>

It would not be practical at the end of the day.  We always felt there was an element when designing a complex of housing where a number of units would be designed with universal design in mind so they are protected for people for the long-term future.  However, having universal design across all housing is not practically possible.  If we were to do so, it would increase the cost of housing substantially.  I believe the report indicated it could increase the costs by 7% to 8% per housing unit.  I understand the concept the Senator is proposing, but it would not be practical to apply it across all housing.  However, we need to consider universal design as a proportion of all housing being built.</p></speech>

The subsection as currently drafted states that one of the purposes of the legislation is to promote best practice in housing development.  This amendment would go further and Senator Casey has dealt with it very well there.  The LDA will promote best practice in housing development and in line with this provision will use innovation and innovative construction methods.  Like any builder, it will be required to comply with all appropriate building standards that are in place.  Universal design is one thing and we also have the design for life.  We are moving more towards not needing as many adapted homes as currently.  We are well covered with a broader definition within the Bill as it stands without seeking to include a specific reference to universal design.  While accepting and recognising why the Senator tabled the amendment, we are well covered in that area and I cannot accept it.</p></speech>

However, in Germany and Austria, limited profit associations are legislated for in respect of cost-rental accommodation, whereas we do not have that.  I do not see why ethical investment firms, as the Government side refers to them, could not already build cost-rental dwellings without the need for legislation and to have a limited return unless public money is provided to them.  We discussed this matter previously in the debate on the Affordable Housing Bill and I made my displeasure known at that stage.</p><p>Amendment No. 77 seeks to ensure that on the LDA land and the land that the agency takes over from the State, local authorities, the OPW, the Prison Service etc., the provision of housing is 100% public housing, that is, cost rental, affordable, affordable purchase and social.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I acknowledge the acceptance by the Minister of amendments in respect of this on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  They will affect some of the larger towns, with populations of more than 150,000, namely, Dublin and Cork.  There are other cities and towns, however, that are affected by this.  As a policy, where the LDA takes over land, it should be exclusively for the delivery of long-term public housing, and that is what amendment No. 77 concerns.  It will provide for a number of grades, starting with 20% to 40%, in order that each individual site can be then broken up according to what is appropriate.  It is unfortunate that in Limerick, for example, which has a very significant need for social and public housing, potentially 70% of the land available there could be sold on to the private market and private developers and lost by the State forever.</p><p>The one amendment I will push is No. 77.  I ask that the Government take it on board, although I do not expect it to and I acknowledge the moves it has made in respect of Dublin and Cork.  They are too limited and I would prefer the provisions to be applied nationwide and to all lands that operate under the LDA.</p></speech>

It states: "In page 49, line 8, to delete 'Minister' and substitute 'relevant local authority'."  It is a clerical amendment to change the reference to section 77, which will be amended by our next amendment, No. 84, which we will come to later.  As the Bill stands, the Minister may set any percentage he or she wants for the number of houses in a development that will be affordable or cost rental, and we want to change that to make it the decision of the local authority, which is the rationale behind the amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#TTT00300"><p>I have a number of amendments in the grouping.  I would prefer if my amendment No. 80 were accepted, although I am happy to yield to amendment No. 79, from Senator Boyhan.  A number of the amendments in the grouping are related to the question of cost rental.  They concern the factoring-in of equity return, which is ultimately an additional cost and one that is unnecessary in the context of cost rental.  That is why, with my amendment No. 80, regarding what cost-rental dwellings might be eligible, I have narrowed the definition.  Amendment No. 20 seeks to do this as well.</p> <p>We have talked a great deal about the fiscal opportunity.  I have engaged with the Minister over the past year and a half and talked about the window whereby low-cost public financing is available.  We are seizing that, but it is important for the record that when we say we should seize the moment in regard to low-cost public financing, we should take steps that will lead to long-term benefit, such as the excellent idea of cost rental.  The money can be taken and there can be access to the capital upfront to build something, it will be paid back over a long period and there will be an asset to the State or to an approved housing body at the end.</p> <p>What we are not saying is that we should use this moment of fiscal opportunity to create future dividends for equity firms.  That is the concern of the involvement in this.  It is important to recognise that just because financing can be accessed and paid back over a long period now, that will not always be the case.  That is why when we talk about good value for money, we want to ensure that in 25 years, the State will be left with an asset it can use to deliver future social public housing.  Similarly, in the case of my amendment No. 81, where public land is made available for the purposes of the development of cost-rental dwellings, that public land at the termination of the cost-rental period will revert to public ownership.</p> <p>The nature of cost rental is such that those who have fronted the money have been paid back for what they have put in.  If they are not motivated by profit, it is enough for them to be motivated by being paid back, and there are many provisions and details regarding how they are paid back.  If their motivation is equity return, unfortunately from my perspective they get an equity return every year for which they have that investment as well.  They do not need to walk away with a property on public land as well at the end of it.  That is why amendment No. 81 is so important.  The sentiment of my amendments regarding percentages are worded better by the amendment tabled by the Labour Party, so I will not move my amendments in that regard in favour of supporting amendment No. 77, from Senator Moynihan.</p></speech>

While I support the sentiment of the Labour Party amendment No. 77, I am not inclined to support it.  The percentages should strive to be 100% social and affordable but should be left to the discretion of each local authority, based on its assessment of local housing needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#TTT00500"><p>I am sure the Minister will agree that every opportunity should be availed of to provide 100% public housing on public land where it is needed and that he will support that.  We should remember that, as drafted, the legislation provided for 30% and that, in fairness to the Minister, that was increased to 50%, while the Part V provision was increased by a further 10%, which brought it to 70%.  The Minister then increased it to 80% and 20% for the cities of Dublin and Cork, and that must be recognised.</p> <p>It does not always work out that when a policy has been drafted at national level, it works its way down to county level.  In the north of my county, Wicklow, I know that if there was public land there, it would be used 100% for public housing.  Moving farther into the more rural areas of the county, however, we would probably be trying to attract in private investment and build private housing along with public, cost-rental and affordable housing.  We all agree that public land should be used for public housing, but we also must recognise that sometimes there is a need to bring in some private housing to create the mix of communities we all desire.  I could highlight areas in Wicklow that are crying out for private housing rather than social housing.  We need to incentivise that, and in the case of public land, we probably could create a better mix.</p> <p>I fully accept the idea of 100% public housing for public land, but there are cases where we need that flexibility.  Moreover, I am not in favour of central government dictating all the way down to local level.  We need to give that flexibility regarding the type of housing down the line.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#TTT00600"><p>I agree with my colleague Senator Casey.   The importance of the legislation relates to the flexibility.  I know of specific similar cases in Wexford where in order to get the development up and running, we will need to attract in a private developer, and that will mean allowing for a mix of types of housing on the land.  We could say about some of these sites that we will be very ideological and that there will be only social and affordable housing on the sites, but that may mean those homes will never be built.  It is important that we do not tie people's hands.</p> <p>The Minister has moved considerably, particularly in urban areas where it is almost easier to direct the building of social and affordable housing, but for many rural areas, that represents a much greater challenge.  It should be acknowledged how far he has gone.  Like Senator Casey, I am not in favour of a centralised control whereby the Minister would direct exactly what should be done throughout the country.  With the Office of the Planning Regulator, we have seen some of the difficulties regarding allegedly centralised control.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not think we should move to that situation.  Local circumstances will demand a local response.  As the Minister said earlier, if we could get more than 100,000 homes built solely on public land tomorrow morning, it would be fantastic.  However, the problem is not going to be solved by a centrally driven ideological approach.  It has to be examined case by case.  Outside of the major urban areas, a partnership with the private sector may be required.  If we were to take too rigid an approach, as per these amendments, it would present some problems.</p><p>Another question that needs to be asked, and which is core to some of the discussion around ideology, is what is the problem people have with the private sector?  There is a notion that the private sector is some sort of evil body.  In most cases, the private sector in local communities are local builders.  They want to contribute to the construction of social and affordable homes, but they know they need to get the right mix within the local community.  They are committed to the community.  That may mean some private homes needs to be built on the site to make the overall project viable.</p><p>The Minister's flexibility on all of this should be acknowledged.  It is essential we allow some flexibility, particularly outside of the major urban areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#UUU00200"><p>There are a number of issues amalgamating here.  One concerns the Office of the Planning Regulator.  Has the Land Development Agency engaged with local authorities that currently are compiling their area, county or city development plans?  We must learn from the past.  We must not replicate the mistakes we made in previous generations.  That is why, in section 77(2)(c), reference is made to the need to counteract undue segregation in housing between persons of different social backgrounds.  As Senator Byrne said, we all want to deliver the right mixture of housing for our fellow citizens.  If I am honest, my natural inclination would be to support the Labour Party amendment.  We need to get the mix right.  To be fair to the Minister, he has come on a huge journey in terms of the percentages in the context of what we are delivering.  I will not repeat what other Members have said.</p> <p>Affordable and social housing is being built and developed on public land.  I am thinking of two sites in Cork in particular, namely, St. Kevin's and Boherboy Road.  There is also a third site in the docklands of 146 acres.  This Government has awarded the local authority the largest amount of money ever to regenerate Cork city and to include social and affordable housing as part of that development.  The Minister is right.  It suits the narrative of some not to recognise the awarding of &euro;2.1 billion.  Do we know what &euro;2.1 billion is and what it will deliver and the empowerment it will give to citizens to have their own home?  Do Members know what &euro;2.1 billion is?  As I said earlier in the Chamber, we can have a hooley in the land of milk and honey, but some of us live in the land of reality.  We can record a 60-second video segment, but it will not build a house.  Senator Byrne is 100% correct.  Many of the builders I know are living in the community, employing in the community and contributing to the community.  Some may argue they are making a profit.  That is their job.  Are we telling the local hoteliers and restaurateurs they should charge for rooms and meals at below cost?  Of course, we are not.</p> <p>I am all for, and support, the concept behind what Senator Moynihan is trying to achieve in her amendment.  My concern, however, is that, on another level, we are not going to engage with the Office of the Planning Regulator and we are going to tie the hands of local authorities.  I am thinking in particular of Cork, where parts of the city were located within the county boundaries previously and there is a planning problem.  A logjam is being created there.  I do not recall which Member said it previously.  At one level, the policy is brilliant but the practicality of it on the ground is completely different.  The one thing I do not want to do is to centralise the power completely in the hands of the Minister or the officials in the Custom House because I trust the officials in Cork city and county, for example, to do the right thing.  Looking at the plans that have been drawn up for the Boherboy Road and St. Kevin's developments, not one person in this Chamber would vote against them.  There was a segment in a radio programme today about the criteria for selection and the waiting list.  We could have the ideological debate all night.  Do we really want to have houses built and public lands utilised or do we just want to create the political football and fail to recognise the views and needs of people?  If those of us who are practising politicians listen to messages from people, whether it is in by-elections, door-to-door canvassing, in shopping centres or when we meet them elsewhere, it is clear they want Government to act and deliver.  They are tired of the sloganeering and the soundbite politics.  They want houses delivered.  They want to see bricks and mortar put on public lands in the context of this Bill.</p> <p>The whole incentivisation piece is one that I think we should discuss further.  I said as much today in the debate on the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  I will return to the issue in respect of another section.  </p> <p>We need to drive it on.  It is about building.  It is about the public realm in our cities and counties that will be delivering housing for people.  That is the essence of what we should always keep at the forefront of what we do.</p></speech>

I will not detain the House any longer than I have to on these amendments other than to state I cannot accept amendments Nos. 20 and 77 to 81, inclusive.  I wish to explain some of the rationale that has been addressed as part of the discussion.</p> <p>Amendment No. 20 seeks to amend section 4, which provides definitions of references made in the Bill.  I already made substantial amendments previously.  I brought forward amendments in Part 9 on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il to align the provisions of this Part more closely with the recently published Affordable Housing Bill and Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  As part of these amendments, a new definition of cost rental has been included in section 74.  That is why I cannot not accept amendment No. 20 as tabled by the Labour Party Senators.  There is a new definition that is fully aligned with the Affordable Housing Bill.  We needed to make sure that happened as both Bills pass through both Houses.  It ensures the cost rental housing delivered under this Land Development Agency Bill is exactly in line with the definitions set out in the Affordable Housing Bill.  It provides that any affordable housing delivered on relevant public lands by the Land Development Agency or any other developer for purchase or cost rental will be fully in accordance with the provisions of Part 2 of the Affordable Housing Bill.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator Casey and Senator Buttimer already mentioned the changes that we made, especially in urban areas of population of over 150,000 like Cork and Dublin, where, by the way, affordability is at its most acute.  That is why in those areas we have upped the rate to 80% of affordable housing.  When we include the Part V provision of 20%, it is 100% affordable and social there.</p><p>Senator Byrne mentioned a pertinent point around the mix.  We made some changes around the phrase "undue segregation".  We do not want communities to be segregated and I agree with every Senator who says that.  A Senator may say he does not want communities to be segregated on the basis of social background or the type of housing.  However, if we double down by simply saying it must be all public in a given place, then we are bringing about that segregation.  We must look at areas where it is more appropriate to allow flexibility.  There are parts of the country where no private homes are being built because of a viability issue.  Basically, the only homes being built in some areas, especially in areas near the Border and midlands, are public homes.  Then there are many people who cannot qualify for those homes.  We have to try to get the mix right.  This can be through what we did earlier with the Affordable Housing Bill and through the LDA in areas where it will operate by activating the land and getting it back into use.  It is far more appropriate for the developer of a site to agree the appropriate tenure mix for affordable housing.</p><p>Every Senator has mentioned the local authority being central to this.  Who are developers going to agree the mix with?  It will be with the planning authority, which is the local authority, as part of the planning process.  That is the most appropriate place for it.</p><p>On the one hand we have some Senators backing local authorities and saying they want local authorities to do it, but on the other hand they want to tie the hands of local authorities by setting a specific percentage.  I understand and respect why it is being set.  It is not that I disagree with anything in it but I believe we are being far too prescriptive so I cannot accept that.</p><p>Everyone knows the provision of affordable housing is of the utmost priority for those of us in the Government.  When the legislation was first drafted and published, work was not completed on the Affordable Housing Bill.  That is why I made the changes to section 9.  The aim was to align the affordable housing definitions directly with the LDA because both tranches of legislation will deliver significantly on the affordable housing side.  It is appropriate that the delivery of affordable housing under this Bill is linked for the first time to actual definitions within the Affordable Housing Bill for cost-rental affordable purchase.</p><p>Amendment No. 79 is about the percentage to be developed on relevant public land.  I am opposing the amendment for many of the reasons I have outlined.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 80 and 81 seek to introduce limits on cost-rental dwellings under the Bill.  I am unsure whether that is something we would want to do.  Again, it would be removing input from those who know best.  I will not accept these amendments as any cost-rental housing delivered on relevant public lands either by the LDA or another developer will be provided fully in accordance with the provisions of Part 3 of the Affordable Housing Bill.</p><p>I thank the Senators for tabling the amendments but I will not be accepting any of them.</p></speech>

The amendment is to ensure any public land that goes to the LDA which is under the control of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department, the Commissioners of Public Works or in the Phoenix Park in Dublin is not transferred to the LDA.</p> <p>It is important that certain lands within the country have a great amenity purpose.  From time to time there are proposals on the table, especially when we move in and out of the boom and bust housing cycles that we have had from the foundation of the State.  We had them in 1970s, 1990s, 2000s and so on.  There is always a call or something of a move to build on or provide housing on certain sites.  I want to ensure limits if we are transferring land to the LDA.  We do not necessarily have the accountability in the LDA that we have when land is under the control of a Minister.  We want to ensure these lands are not transferred.</p> <p>I had thought that it was self-explanatory and that the Government would have accepted it.  The provision tries to ensure that the Bill is future-proofed.  I am not suggesting that the Minister has any proposals like that on the table but I believe it is important for future-proofing.</p> <p>I will come to another amendment that I have proposed which might seem a little strange.  It has to do with co-living and student accommodation on LDA lands.  I will give an example of why I put this in.  Last summer I put in-----</p></speech>

I saw it put forward in the D&aacute;il and had expected that it would be accepted because it is eminently sensible.  We talk about public land.  It is about making clear that certain kinds of land serve other purposes that are core to the public good and are part of our responsibility in terms of biodiversity, the environment and public amenity.  This includes lands that are national parks, heritage sites and the Phoenix Park.  It is especially important that we copper-fasten this.  The Minister will be aware of the concerns now that the heritage portfolio has fused with the housing portfolio.  Some of the normal checks and balances we might have had between Departments may not be in place.  It is useful to show or indicate the importance of the heritage part of the housing, local government and heritage remit by excluding certain lands with a core heritage function from potential transfer to the LDA.  I may bring a version of this amendment on Report Stage that would look to special areas of conservation and national heritage areas.  It would be appropriate that they would not be transferred to the LDA.</p></speech>

I grew up beside one of our greatest heritage sites.  When I saw this amendment I was unsure whether I was reading it correctly.  I cannot for a moment see the LDA approaching any of these lands in respect of development.  However, I understand the concerns that the Senators have raised.  We have county development plans under which all these lands are protected.  Section 52(3), which relates to the report that has to be provided by the LDA, states:</p> <blockquote> 	In providing a report under <i>subsection (2) </i>the Agency shall, in relation to each parcel of land referred to in the report, take account of:  	(a) the objectives of the development plan and local area plan in force for the area where the land is situated;<br /><br />(b) any masterplan affecting the land ...  </blockquote> <p>All of these lands are protected by legislation and the development plan process in every county.  I cannot fathom, even with the greatest stretch of my imagination, how the LDA would look at any of these parcels of land with an eye to the potential of building houses.</p></speech>

I wish that the Office of Public Works would renovate some of the vacant homes in the park and make them available to be inhabited.  A good number of the park lodges have been lying empty for far too long.  As Senator Casey said, local authorities all over the country spend the best part of two years every five years making development plans for their counties.  They take great care and interest in the management of the lands within their local authority areas.  It is with that great care and interest that they make zoning decisions.  There is no suggestion from this Government or the Department that any lands that have been zoned which are not zoned for housing would be built on.  Phoenix Park is a UNESCO heritage site.  Most of the lands are protected through zoning and other designations under planning.  I look forward to the Minister confirming that.  There has been much miscommunication about what the Land Development Agency will do.  It would be an alarmist message if it was to go out of this House tonight that we are in any way supporting the destruction of or building on any of our heritage sites or indeed open green spaces and recreational areas, which are so valuable to us, not just here in the city but also to communities all around the country.</p></speech>

I do not envisage any of the lands in question being developed.  I am thinking of Regional Park Ballincollig and Fitzgerald's Park in Cork.  I have a question arising from the amendment about old, disused Garda barracks and Army buildings.  Some retired members of our Defence Forces need housing.  How can we use those types of dwellings to assist in the provision of housing for these men, in particular, who have served our State?</p> <p>I have a question about the county and city development plans.  We have all seen the utilisation of public space in a better way.  Cork has 17 streets pedestrianised.  We need more green spaces and public parks rather than fewer.  Like Senator Fitzpatrick, I do not think that any of us are seeking a debate about using national parks for the development of housing but some buildings can be used to assist in the provision of housing.  That should be considered but nobody from our side of the House has any notion of developing those places.  As Senator Casey said, we have the buffer of the city and county development plans at any rate.</p></speech>

I will use this opportunity to talk about the Phoenix Park.  There is vast real estate in the Phoenix Park which I have had the privilege of visiting recently.  Many Senators will know that the HSE has St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park, which has significant issues with dereliction.  There is an old military school, which is empty and derelict.  There is a beautiful Anglican church, which is locked up.  There are amazing mews and old military buildings.  It is an amazing place.  I would love to see it developed and I would like to see houses and homes in it.</p> <p>The LDA is developing Shanganagh Castle, which is an amazing site.  It was once a prison.  A beautiful building will come back to the local authority.  The LDA has an amazing plan for the Central Mental Hospital.  They are all purpose-built, period, amazing buildings.  Had the local authority and a number of other people gone inside, they would have made everything protected structures and we would not be doing anything there either.  We can be imaginative.  They do not all have to be institutional, modern buildings.  I believe that the LDA has the capacity, and I am confident that it has the willingness, to attract architects, designers and new people to reimagine our built living space.  Why can we not have public realm, theatres and interaction at the top?  Why must everywhere have shops on the ground floor, offices on the next floor and three or four residential floors?  Turn it all on its head.  I do not know if anyone has been to Malm&ouml; in Sweden, where there are theatres and libraries at the top of buildings.  It is a matter of reimagining the opportunities to build.</p> <p>I am not singling out the Phoenix Park but we cannot stand over the amount of amazing buildings in this national park that could be put to use.  A number of gate lodges are all derelict and empty, all of which are protected structures.  There are buildings all around the park.  There is a substantial opportunity to develop St. Mary's Hospital and the military barracks, which are at the edge of the park, at the lower road.  Perhaps we have the foresight, vision and boldness to move out and close down the clapped out, disgraceful facilities that are there.  Everybody will know about St. Mary's Hospital from television and various news media over the last year.  The staff do a great job.  Many of the patients have no alternative services.  Would it not be fantastic if we could have a financial package that would see everyone transferred out of there and a new development and purpose-built health facility for the people who were there?</p> <p>There are many barracks in this city.  They will be politically difficult for people to take on board but many could be relocated and the buildings could be turned into housing schemes.  I support what Senator Moynihan is talking about.  I did not want to let this opportunity go without highlighting the vast real estate and potential in the Phoenix Park.  We should have the courage, guts, energy and imagination to develop them appropriately and sensitively, to revitalise that part of our city.  With all this amazing public realm all around us, would any one of us not want to live up there?  Let us get out of the box, imagine, push out the boundaries, and empower the LDA to look at projects like this.  That would be a good day's work.</p></speech>

When I looked at this amendment, I was surprised.  I respect the right of Senator Moynihan and indeed any of her colleagues.  I would never be against people tabling amendments.  It is unfortunate that we have created a debate as if somebody on the Government side of the House had this in mind.  This has come from an amendment from the Opposition.  As far as I am aware, nobody is in favour of development on these open spaces.  That is quite clear.  I am protective of open spaces.  Senator Boyhan made a point about derelict sites in Phoenix Park and other areas that have been neglected.  Doing something with those would be perfect.  To support Senators Casey, Fitzpatrick and Byrne, nobody on this side of the House is saying that anything in this Bill will try to take over some of these areas of natural beauty, which are so important to all our people, for building houses.  I look forward to the Minister clarifying the matter this evening, once and for all, because I do not think it exists.  It is unfortunate that sometimes we start these arguments when there is no truth to them at all.</p></speech>

I know Senator Moynihan is genuine in her belief about the provision of public housing but I was disappointed with the Labour Party's approach to this.  It stated that following the establishment of the Land Development Agency, it would have compulsory purchase powers and would be able to take over large tracts of land in areas such as the Phoenix Park to turn into public housing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As Senator Casey outlined, there are clear safeguards and protections in place in legislation today.  As Senator Murphy said, it is unfortunate that this approach is being taken.  I agree with Senators Fitzpatrick and Boyhan, who have said that there are under-utilised buildings on many Office of Public Works, OPW, lands and not just in the Phoenix Park.  We can be more imaginative in using those.  For a long time, there has been talk about an official residence for the Taoiseach.  Why not use some of the under-utilised buildings in the Phoenix Park for that purpose?  I do not necessarily expect the Minister to comment directly on that.  There are many under-utilised public buildings.  We could be more imaginative in terms of how we use them.  It was unfortunate that the LDA was presented as seeking to take over some of this land that is valuable to all of us.</p></speech>

I wonder why that land is not covered in the amendment because obviously, we want to build on that too.  This amendment was not moved with as much gusto in the D&aacute;il by the acting spokesperson, Deputy Duncan Smith.  Even Deputy Smith understood the purpose of this amendment.  If one was ever to look at creating an issue out of a non-issue, this is probably one of the most spectacular examples of it.  It is a magnificent misrepresentation and manipulation of the facts.  Senator Byrne was right.  The debate has taken place in good faith this evening.  However, everyone knows that the aim here is to have a register of relevant public land identified in one place.  Other Senators are talking about bringing amendments on heritage sites, and this type of thing.  That creates an idea that the LDA is the bogeyman under the bed.  We might as well put in the GPO so that we can say we will not convert the GPO into co-living apartments.  That is where we are getting to with this type of amendment.  The Bill deals with relevant public lands in ownership of public bodies in areas with a population of over 10,000.  The Senator may know this from the research she did when she tabled this amendment, as well as from all the publicity that was garnered from this amendment over the past number of months.</p> <p>Section 3 of the Phoenix Park Act 1925 confirms that the park is for the general purpose, recreation and enjoyment of the public.  That is the clear position.  Senator Casey has rightly said we have copper-fastening of county and city development plans all over the place.  This is not what the LDA is going to do.  All Senators know that.  We all know that this is not the case.  It is a register of public land.  This is an example of raising an issue to say anything - an amendment has been proposed just in case the LDA is going to build in the courtyard of Dublin Castle.  It will not do so.  It will not transfer Dublin Castle out of the OPW to build apartments.  It just simply will not.  We have spent longer on this amendment than it warrants.  I will not be accepting it.</p></speech>

The board of the LDA discussed putting co-living on a public site, which was the former Meath Hospital.  I want to clarify that.  We can have such situations with the board of the LDA, or with people involved with the board of the LDA.  This Bill says that the LDA has the ability to acquire land by compulsory purchase order if it is of strategic importance or if it is needed to connect sites.  The legal protections that apply to the Phoenix Park do not apply to the OPW-owned lands in Farmleigh.  The LDA is not accountable to the Oireachtas.  It is accountable to the Minister.  Under the powers that the LDA will have, it could potentially decide that it is going to connect up sites in the Castleknock and Blanchardstown areas of west Dublin and it needs a portion of land to do so.  I am not saying this would happen under this Government.  It is this type of thing that the amendment is trying to protect against.  Again, in national parks such as Killarney National Park, there is a land population.  I am not saying that this is going to happen, and I do not think it will.  There will certainly be enough public land available to the LDA.  However, co-living brought home to me how the board of the LDA might think in terms of things like that.  I am seeking to copper-fasten in legislation that they will not be able to do these things.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for clarifying that this Bill is not doing anything more than what it says.  It is not changing any legislation, unless the Bill specifically says that it is changing legislation.  There is no legislation being changed that will put in jeopardy lands that are mentioned here, such as lands under the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I am not entirely sure why the Phoenix Park has been singled out.  There are lands all over the country.  However, I thank the Minister for putting that on the record.  We need to be careful that people do not worry about the lands they use for recreation and, quite apart from that, our nature reserves all over this country.  This is important to us.  We certainly would not sign up to or vote through anything without having checked this.</p></speech>

We should be having a wider debate on Senator Boyhan&rsquo;s contribution in the context of how we can develop in tandem with the LDA to work in partnership with local authorities, the Army, the Garda or whoever in looking at different models around the development of housing.  We should not be afraid to be ambitious and different.  If this means having an honest conversation, let us have it.  I often look at this, as a member of the Constitutional Convention.  I think the Minister was on it also.  He mentioned Malahide.  The Citizens&rsquo; Assembly and the Constitutional Convention have done a power of work.  This is an area we could look at, if Oireachtas committees have not done so.  We must look differently now.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan mentioned the city of Malm&ouml;.  He and I have been in other cities, such as Geneva, where we saw a model of housing being developed that is different from here.  As the world evolves and changes, we should look at how we can remodel and refit some of our public buildings.  I go back to my fundamental point, which is that there is a need to reincentivise, to reinvent and to provide for affordable, cost-rental or social housing in parts of our cities where there are buildings lying idle for a variety of reasons, such as dereliction.  In some cases, councils do not have the wherewithal to develop.  The living over the shop scheme, for a variety of reasons, has not worked.  That needs to be looked at again.  There are parts of this city, of my own city and of other cities, where we can-----</p></speech>

The concern is not any one place or area but that land going to the Land Development Agency is no longer State land.  We will come to that later.  There is a specific provision that says it will not be and that concern comes later.  Amendment No. 22 provides an appropriate consultation point in the relevant Oireachtas committee, which can bring together different perspectives from different parts of the country and provide insights.  </p><p>Senator Boyhan wants to speak on amendments Nos. 23 and 24.  They relate to a key concern of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, that the content of any direction under this section be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>, a national newspaper and the websites of the Minister and the Land Development Agency. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#YYY01600"><p>Amendment No. 23 is another of the amendments the AILG brought to the joint Oireachtas committee and subsequently wrote to the members asking for their support.  It states:  </p> <blockquote> 	In page 12, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:  	&ldquo;(5) The Minister, in giving a direction under subsection (1), shall publish the contents of such a direction in, <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;i</i>l, being the official Irish State gazette, at least one national newspaper and the Agency shall publish on its website the same contents, where a copy of the direction may be seen at all reasonable times.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>The amendment provides for the publication of any direction given to the agency by the Minister for housing who &quot;may ... give a direction in writing to the Agency or a subsidiary DAC, in relation to the performance of its functions under this Act, requiring it to comply with such policies of the Government as are specified in the [definition].&quot;</p><p>In the interests of transparency, it is essential that such direction-ordering is not done behind closed doors and that, to the greatest extent possible, the functioning of the agency happens in the open and that many people whose lives are to be affected by the agency and its work are kept abreast of any developments or changes in how the agency considers its business.  I hope the Minister will consider the rationale and accept the amendment.  However, it appears he might not be accepting any amendments.</p></speech>

It is critical we give local authorities and their members, irrespective of our constituencies or none, a key role in this.  A point we should also dwell upon concerns the creation of the offices of the Land Development Agency in Cork, Dublin and Limerick, including how they are populated and their role and remit, in keeping with what Senator Boyhan has said.  The Senator could have included in his amendment the whole thing around the office of the Land Development Agency.  It brings into question the role of the strategic policy committees of our local authorities, which have specialised members in association with the elected members.</p><p>A mapping exercise was carried out by the Land Development Agency on public lands.  In the context of this section and its performance under the Act, surely a synergy must be developed with the local authority committee of housing or the local authority, whether Cork City Council or Kerry County Council, to ensure there is transparency rather than a veil of secrecy, as Senator Boyhan has called for and I agree with him.  It is critical that there is confidence in the Land Development Agency and how it delivers.  </p><p>Senators Boyhan and Higgins referenced <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>and the national newspaper.  I ask Senator Boyhan if we have to put the planning notice in a national newspaper and on the website.  The types of newspapers available are changing.  Meanwhile, many people are looking to varying sites for information and the website is not sufficient.  We need to embrace other possibilities in that regard.</p><p>We have seen the mapping exercise carried out.  We need to see action on that.  I would like to see a greater role for the strategic policy committees of councils in the overarching direction and delivery of policy and in working on the futuristic vision of a city or county.  In Cork, we have had the Cork land use and transportation study, LUTS, in the 1960s and 1970s, the Cork area strategic plan and now metropolitan Cork.  We saw developments last week with BusConnects, which is not relevant to this but is part of the overarching policy.  In the context of the Land Development Agency, I am afraid we have seen Government give an inordinate amount of money to the development of the Cork docklands and that will be lost in the delivery.</p></speech>

Publication in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il </i>is one element of this but how the members of the board of the agency are appointed, what interests they must declare, the manner of their appointment, the constitutional balance of the board and how often the board must report to the Minister are all elements of transparency.  We heard about the importance of policy and the input of local authorities but it is important to remember that an authority's powers under section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001 are still limited in this legislation.  That is the most important area of policy in respect of the disposal of land and it needs to be addressed.  We also talk about local development plans.  Many such plans are still in development.  Is it the old plan or the new plan that gets an input?  When talking about transparency and engagement with local authorities, many constructive proposals have been made that would strengthen these areas of the Bill.  This amendment regarding <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il </i>is one of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2021-07-12a.413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2021071200002#ZZZ00300"><p>I concur with Senators Boyhan and Higgins on the need for the highest standards of accountability and transparency in any State agency or organisation.  However, the provisions made in respect of the LDA mean that it will be accountable not only to the Minister and the Government, but to the Oireachtas.  It will be accountable to all Oireachtas joint committees, the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It will be subject to freedom of information legislation and will rely on the planning authorities for planning permission for any developments it seeks to undertake, which it will do in partnership with our local authorities.  They are ably represented by our local authority members, who defend and champion their community's interests at every opportunity.  I have observed the agency with regard to communications on its website and it has made the database publicly available.  That is the valuable information and it can be argued that it is, initially, the most valuable contribution the agency can make to helping us all to address the housing crisis.  It is compiling and assembling a publicly available database, which will be open to public scrutiny.  There could not be more transparency.  The minutes of board meetings are posted on the website and are freely available to the public.  As I have said, the organisation is accountable not only to the Government, but to the Oireachtas and to all of its organs, and is also subject to freedom of information legislation.  These are very valuable mechanisms to ensure there is full accountability and transparency.  With regard to stipulating that a direction must be published in a national newspaper, while I am a reader of newspapers myself, who among us knows whether there will be national newspapers, international newspapers or newspapers at all in 50 or 100 years?  I am sure the Minister will confirm this but I believe the highest standards of governance, accountability and transparency have to be met by the LDA.  I know the rest of my party agrees with that and I believe the Minister is legislating to ensure it.</p></speech>

It is important that there be accountability and transparency but there is also a need for education among the wider public so that people can understand what the agency is doing, its purposes and its objectives.  The mapping will be interesting.  As citizens, we should be able to access maps and know what purposes are assigned to land.  It is all very well to publish this information on as many sites and in as many newspapers as possible and to publish it in<i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>, but the reality is that <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il </i>is only read by civil servants, academics, cranks and nerds.  There is a certain degree of overlap between some of those groups.  The crucial issue is ensuring that there is a broader understanding of what the LDA is trying to do and of how to use land effectively.  Our councillors and citizens more generally should have a means by which to have input or to ask questions.  The design of the website will be important.  Many people cannot decipher planning notices, for instance.  We need things to be in plain English so that they are accessible and can be used.</p><p>I also agree with Senator Buttimer about the greater use of SPCs, which is related to this.  Information on these committees at local authority level should be provided.  Some are very innovative.  I appreciate that the Cathaoirleach thinks I am straying-----</p></speech>

Many different points were raised, all of which are valid.  With regard to plans for local authorities and what their SPCs do, I have always been at pains to say that I firmly believe in rebalancing the power between local elected members and the executive in local authorities.  We need to empower our councillors and we are certainly trying to do so.</p> <p>With regard to the amendments of Senators Boyhan and Higgins, I will finish as I started and say that I will not be accepting them, although I understand why the Senators have tabled them.  I will briefly explain why I am not accepting them.  I oppose them as it is a standard provision that a Minister may make regulations or issue ministerial directions as and when required without prior consultation with an Oireachtas committee.  If we were to accept the amendments, we would be doing something completely different.  We would be tying the hands of any future Minister, not just mine.  Regulations and ministerial directions will be made in accordance with the Bill, which will be enacted following the approval of the Oireachtas.  It is normal, as part of the governance of State agencies, that Ministers can issue directions to State agencies.  Most of these directions are policy directions and generally relate to the implementation of Government policy.  The LDA will be required to comply with any direction issued to it.</p> <p>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 seek to insert a new subsection on specific publication arrangements for ministerial directions.  I cannot accept these amendments as it is not standard procedure for ministerial directions to be published in such a way.  Under section 9, the Minister may give a ministerial direction following review of a report compiled by the LDA and such directions shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will be freely available for examination.  </p> <p>Senator Fitzpatrick put it well when she mentioned the other checks and balances we are putting in place that were not part of the original general scheme, which has evolved right the way through.  I am referring to the general scheme of a Bill in the previous Oireachtas.  These measures include the application of legislation on freedom of information and lobbying and reports to the Oireachtas joint committee.  All of these appropriate measures now apply to the LDA.  However, we do not want to strangle an agency before it gets going.  The vast majority of us agree that we need an agency that will deliver homes for our people on underutilised State-owned lands.  Senator Buttimer has given us good examples, including examples of where the agency can be transformative in Cork.  In many instances, the agency will work in partnership with local authorities to bring their expertise to the development of bigger sites.  We need to show delivery and that is why it is important that the agency breaks grounds on its first site this year before speeding up from there so that people can see what it does.  As Senator Byrne correctly said, there is work to do in informing people of what the reality of this agency is.  We spent a fair bit of time this evening talking about what the agency will never do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Darragh O'Brien:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2178"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2178&amp;amp;pid=DarraghOBrien&amp;amp;year=2021&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=12"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is the responsibility of all legislators to make sure the issues they raise are genuine and that we do not act in a way that leads to any misinformation, misinterpretation or manipulation of the reality of this matter.

We are determined and we are making progress.  We will see that progress through.  I thank the Senators for tabling the amendments.  I appreciate their tabling them but I will not be accepting them.</p></speech>

He might revert to me on that.</p> <p>The Land Development Agency website needs to be more up to date.  The Minister might also revert to me on mapping exercise I spoke about.  We have seen on the website the number of projects to be delivered.  To go back to Senator Boyhan's remarks, many of the sites were the sites of old barracks.  That reinforces the view, which I share, that they need to be developed.  We need to be imaginative in our approach.  The Minister might revert to me regarding the offices in Cork, the website and the mapping exercise.</p></speech>
