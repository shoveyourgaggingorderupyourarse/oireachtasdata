The Taoiseach said on Thursday last that he did not direct anyone, yet on Friday he said &quot;I wouldn't say it was my finest hour and I take responsibility for this having evolved to what people might imagine it is&quot;.<br/>I am sure the Leader will agree that no one has had to use his or her imagination in trying to figure out what has gone on here.  People might have had to stretch the bounds of credibility in terms of the actions of the leader of the State but no one has had to use one bit of imagination to figure out just what was going on.<br/>Yesterday we heard the Taoiseach say that he did not apply &quot;normal Fine Gael standards&quot; and he blamed officials in the Fine Gael party headquarters.  He actually tried to differentiate between his role as Taoiseach and as leader of Fine Gael.  Unfortunately this does not wash because the Taoiseach must also have forgotten his appointment of his neighbour, Darragh Loftus, to the board of SOLAS, as reported in today's <i>Daily Mail</i>.  Obviously the same standards applied to that particular appointment.  Again, not much imagination is required to figure that out.<br/>The Taoiseach, as far as I am concerned, has still not spelled out his role in this affair.  He has tried to exonerate his own office and officials in his Department, blame people in Fine Gael headquarters and shaft the poor innocent party in Donegal who was set to be a Senator but will not now be a Member of this House.  We had the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in the House last week who gave an excellent display in ignoring questions.  A litany of questions were put to her by Senators from all sides of the House and she answered none of them.  She just blindly read from a script and kept repeating elements of it.  Many of the questions posed remain unanswered.  Indeed, her half-hearted statement yesterday raises other questions.</p> <p>The half-hearted statement that she made yesterday raises other questions.  When did she receive the request from Fine Gael officials that Mr. McNulty wished to be appointed to the board under her remit?  Why did she act with such haste in doing a banking inquiry by extending the number of board members to facilitate party cronies?  Who suggested the other appointee, who is from Limerick?  Was it party headquarters again or were there other reasons?  The Taoiseach is blaming Fine Gael headquarters but I want to know what role his own advisers or officials played in requesting that Mr. McNulty be appointed to the IMMA board.  This entire situation is incredible, bizarre and completely unacceptable.  It is an affront to the entire arts community, to anybody who ever served in this House and to the Irish people who voted, against the Taoiseach's will, to retain this House.  The Taoiseach simply gave it the Harvey Smith by doing what he wanted and using it as a mere tool to facilitate political advancement for some of his own flock.</p><p>Rather than answer questions to the media on one hand, or the D&aacute;il on the other, we feel that the most appropriate forum in which the Taoiseach should answer questions is in this House.  For that reason, I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Taoiseach will come to the House today to answer questions on this issue.  He has a responsibility to this House, as a democratic institution of the State, and we are entitled to answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100003#B00200"><p>The latest development in the John McNulty affair took place subsequent to my contribution on the Order of Business yesterday.  It took place during our Order of Business, when the Taoiseach informed the D&aacute;il that Mr. McNulty was requesting that people not vote for him.  I put my own concerns about the manner of his appointment on the record last week, when I said it was unfortunate that anything might undermine the reform process of appointments to boards which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform had initiated.  It is essential that we see proper reform and, for that reason, I welcome the announcement yesterday by the Minister of a new and revised model for ministerial appointments to State boards so that for the first time we will see a clear process whereby all appointments to vacancies on boards will be advertised openly on the <i>stateboards.ie</i>portal, which is operated by the independent Public Appointments Service, PAS; vacancies will be managed through a transparent assessment system designed and implemented by the PAS; and Ministers will be supported by the service in making appointments to State boards and required to set out comprehensive criteria for the filling of vacancies.<br/>We are aware this is not a particularly recent phenomenon.  Under the previous Fianna F&aacute;il Government there were many instances of stuffing of State boards.  All of us want that process brought to an end and to ensure that a clear model is put in place with transparent and objective criteria for appointments to State boards through the PAS system.  For this reason, I welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and ask the Leader to arrange a debate in due course on the reform agenda he has set out.  The Minister will be coming to the House tomorrow to deal with the Freedom of Information Bill 2013, and he has been in the House previously to debate several pieces of legislation.  In light of the announcement of the new process and the passage, hopefully tomorrow, of the aforementioned Bill, we should use the opportunity to debate the reform agenda generally.  That would perhaps give us a context for the unfortunate issues that have arisen in the past week.<br/>I also ask for a debate on the e-conveyancing model, which will be examined by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  We have debated this issue previously.  It is a useful model to speed up and ensure greater efficiency in the conveyancing system in Ireland.  The Law Society and others have put it forward and we will be hearing from them today and putting forward recommendations.  I would like the opportunity to debate the issue in this House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100003#B00300"><p>The other day I introduced the topic of motor taxation, motor insurance, NCT testing and the labels we have to stick in the windscreens of our cars, which appear out-of-date and old-fashioned compared to what more modern countries are doing.  Interestingly, the British introduced that system today.  From midnight last night, drivers are no longer required to put stickers on their windscreens because everything will be registered and read from a distance by the police force there.  It appears to be a simple system, although I gather they are having some difficulties with it in Britain.  Given that it is capable of being implemented and has been introduced in other countries, however, it is something we should consider here.</p><p>I am usually opposed to more regulation and controls.  In the case of crowd funding, whereby small businesses can avail of opportunities to secure loans from people with small amounts of money, such as &euro;50 or &euro;100, on which interest is paid, this is a system which has worked very well.  I have been involved with one crowd funding operation, Link Financial, and it has done a world of good for a number of SMEs.  However, there is a reluctance on the part of the public to get involved because it is not controlled.  It is openly unregulated.  This is one of the few occasions when I suggest that we should have more regulation rather than less.  The idea is to encourage citizens to lend to small businesses and get a reward for doing so.  The system has worked very well in America and it is working quite well in Britain.  I think it would work well here.  The companies that have become involved with the system have been very happy with it.  All we need to do is to encourage more to get involved.</p></speech>

These posts are over and above the recent announcement of new posts, at a time when services nationally are struggling due to the lack of resources and staff, and are dependent on the use of overtime and agency nurses to fill shifts regularly.  It is increasingly difficult to remain uncritical of the manner in which mental health services in this country are run.  This entire issue is symptomatic of a lack of leadership at administrative and political levels.  I have on several occasions asked the Leader to facilitate a wide ranging debate on mental health policy and I ask again whether he can propose a date on which we can discuss this important issue.</p></speech>

This is the forum where the vacancy for the Seanad occurred, on the election of our former colleague, Deirdre Clune, to the European Parliament.  The issues surrounding Mr. McNulty and the lack of transparency should be debated in this House.  The people decided in the referendum held 12 months ago to save the Upper House and the Taoiseach should be reminded that the least he owes us is to come into the House today, if possible, to offer us an explanation.  The issue has been widely debated.  I have been listening to the news since 7 a.m. about the debates that took place in the Lower House yesterday and apparently today it will be the principal axe to grind for the Opposition.</p><p>I ask the Leader to remind the Taoiseach that this House continues to exist.  Less than 12 months ago the people decided we should remain in existence.  The fact that we need reform is without a shadow of a doubt.  It is not good enough that any Taoiseach, past present or future, should appear once during the lifetime of a Government.  Perhaps the Taoiseach has been in the House twice but the kernel of the problem is a vacancy in the Upper House.  The Taoiseach is obliged, constitutionally, morally and legally, to come before us to give us simple answers on what went wrong.  We are not going to crucify him.  The last occasion he came to the House he said that he was coming in peace.  I am sure he will get a peaceful reception again but we are entitled to ask proper questions.</p><p>I listened to Senator Bacik's comments on the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, regarding transparency and reform in how we make appointments to State boards.  That was exactly what Michael Lowry promised 20 years ago.  It did not happen.  We are in the 43rd month of this Government.</p> <p>One of the principal objectives of particularly Fine Gael and the Labour Party before the last general election was reform of our political system.  Forty-three months on, little if anything has happened.  So I believe the Taoiseach should attend the House.</p><p>I endorse what Senator Byrne said yesterday about the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland that is imposing a substantial increase in the levy nurses have to pay.  While I obviously will not mention the name, I got an e-mail from a nurse, not from the South, who pointed that the 2011 accounts of the board, which were published online, showed that &euro;5 million of its expenditure went on the upkeep of its swanky office in Blackrock, County Dublin, and that the average salary of its staff is more than &euro;71,000.  Ordinary nurses working on the front-line had two hits in cuts last year and now they are being hit again by their board.  I do not think the board realises the hardship and the hard work of the nurses in front-line services.</p></speech>

Irish Water is refusing to instruct the local authority as its agent to carry out repairs to housing estates that have not been taken into charge where problems occur with pumping stations with sewerage, etc.  My county, Tipperary, has 40 estates that have not been taken in charge.  In Carrick-on-Suir, my town, Manor estate has serious problems with sewerage systems.  Irish Water will not allow the local authority to address the problem.  Many of these estates are owned by developers whose companies have been liquidated and liquidators are dealing with the financial problems.  The liquidators are not dealing with the issues the residents are encountering.  The local authority is not allowed to deal with it.  Irish Water will not instruct the local authority to deal with it.  The local councillors are frustrated at the lack of any developments on the issue.</p><p>I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on behalf of all these residents across the country and on behalf of councillors who are totally frustrated with the situation to put a contingency fund into place until these estates are taken in charge which would allow Irish Water to give instructions to the local authority to carry out the repairs that are necessary.  The difficulty will only be in the short term because most of these estates will be taken in charge in the next 12 months.  Irish Water was very happy to take all the assets from all the local authorities across the country worth billions of euro but it is refusing to deal with the problem I am pointing out now.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to address this matter urgently.</p></speech>

I have been astonished by the position of Labour Members.  They have consistently said it was nothing to do with them.

This is how the Constitution is structured and I resent the word "hacks" being used in reference to Members of the Oireachtas.</p><p>One of the issues that has not been highlighted is that the Taoiseach has appointed 12 people in total to the Seanad, eight of whom were women.  He has appointed only two people from the Fine Gael Party out of the 12 people, with three from the Labour Party and seven Independents.  That is his record to date on which we have had no discussion in the media.  For three days last week we had non-stop commentary on one issue without any reference to the 12 people the Taoiseach appointed previously.</p></speech>

I wanted to make a comment on this matter.</p><p>Eight weeks ago I raised an issue relating to the HSE whereby 1,100 people have been appointed to permanent positions with full salaries without job interview and without it being clarified whether they have the skills for those jobs.  They went in to fill temporary positions and under the Haddington Road agreement and the Croke Park agreement their jobs were made permanent and pensionable.  That was 1,100 people and here we are talking about one nomination.  It must be remembered that the Taoiseach did not appoint John McNulty; he nominated him.</p><p>We have now have had no debate on those 1,100 people who have been appointed to key positions in the HSE.  As a result of my doing an interview on RTE Radio, I got e-mails highlighting many other Government statutory authorities where jobs were also filled without a job interview.  One of the positions filled carried a salary of &euro;90,000.  The person filled it in a temporary capacity and has now been made permanent.  We should have a debate about hiding behind the recruitment embargo whereby jobs are not properly advertised and people are being put into temporary positions without it being clearly set out that they have the qualifications to fill those positions.  It is about time we had a decent debate on that issue.  We need good people in our health service even when we already have many good people in it.  In future we need to ensure we have the right people in the jobs which are crucial for the development and reform of our health system.  The Minister should come into the House to deal with that issue.</p></speech>

The article stated:<blockquote>Home-buyers are once again overstretching themselves with outsized mortgages in the fresh frenzy to get on the property ladder.  In echoes of the recklessness that preceded the crash, some banks are lending up to 4.5 times combined income when a maximum of three to four times is considered prudent ...  [Davy has] called on the Central Bank to intervene to ensure loans do not exceed 80% the value of a property and that lenders carry out proper stress tests.</blockquote>This is advocated by people on this side of the House through No. 32 on the Order Paper.</p> <p>It is also relevant to freedom of information, which we will discuss tomorrow.  The Central Bank of Ireland, at the instigation of the European Central Bank, wants exemption from freedom of information.  I tabled an amendment on Committee Stage, which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, is considering.  I cannot think of a sector in the world less deserving of exemption from freedom of information than the Irish banking sector.</p></speech>

It is disingenuous of Fianna F&aacute;il to throw muck about the appointment of people to State boards.  Many of us on this side of the House could point to appointments to State boards made by Fianna F&aacute;il.<br/>As Senator Barrett pointed out, we seem to be in recovery regarding the housing market, as recent fiscal figures demonstrate.  Again, I felt a certain sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>when I heard the statements from the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, on our need to abandon Part V of the Planning and Development Act as soon as possible.  The CIF proposes a 1% levy on all property purchases, to which I have no objection in principle as long as it assists people in need of social housing.  However, the president of the CIF described Part V as a &quot;boom-time tax&quot;.  Let us be clear that it was a tax that was not paid.  I did an analysis that showed 45,000 extra units would have been built for social and affordable housing had the previous Government enforced Part V.  It did not, and as a result we have 26,000 fewer social housing units and I hazard a guess that with 26,000 additional social housing units, we would not be facing the homelessness crisis we do.  Sometimes <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>is exactly that, same old, same old.</p></speech>

If one examines the appointment of Mr. McNulty to the board of IMMA, the appointment of Mr. Quinlivan to the board of Irish Water and subsequently as a driver to a Minister of State, what strikes me is that the people concerned saw nothing wrong with it.  There is a mix-up in their understanding of governance, particularly in the situation with Mr. Quinlivan.  The culture is rotten.  Will the Leader ask each Minister to produce a list of all their board appointments and who recommended each one?  I realise there have been different practices and some have been through advertisements, but some have been through recommendations.  We need a clean sheet.  While I accept what the Minister, Deputy Howlin said, we need an end to this, so let us have it all out and get it over with.  I would like the Leader to respond to my request.</p><p>Yesterday, I said 10 October will be a test for the Government.  Some people have voted for Mr. McNulty even though he has said he does not want people to vote for him and he is withdrawing.  If he wins, and the election is declared invalid, and Fine Gael then produces a candidate who can win, it will also look very bad.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach said Fine Gael&rsquo;s behaviour showed we are not worthy of winning the seat.  He should remember those words.</p></speech>

These guidelines will set out requirements which will be expected to apply to all State board appointments in terms of the calibre and quality of candidates and broader public policy considerations relating to general equality and other diversity objectives.

I also back the issue of the nurses' registration fee being raised from &euro;100 to &euro;150, a very serious issue which would be dealt with.  I have had contacts from a number of people who work in the nursing profession and it is very serious to increase their registration charge.</p></speech>

The final OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, report is due in September 2015, 11 months from now, and there is a concerted effort internationally between the G20, the OECD and, in the past week, the British Prime Minister.  It is important not just to build on the number of jobs being created now but to protect existing jobs.  As part of this it would be very helpful if we had a debate on the matter to put some of the facts on the table so people can hear what the position is.  We are told the State is doing something illegal, but it is not.  Although taxation laws are being met properly to the requirements of several investigations, on every occasion we seem to be the poster boys to be kicked around for some international practices happening within countries.</p><p>The &ldquo;double Irish&rdquo; is a US taxation issue that can be resolved in the US if it changes its tax code, not something that can be resolved here.  The US can deal with the matter, but, for whatever reason, it chooses not to.  It is very unfair and unreasonable that Ireland is kicked around every time.  It is very important we take the opportunity to have a debate in the Seanad to put the full facts out there so people can hear what is happening.  It would also be a major benefit for a number of companies here which are very concerned that there may be movement before September 2015.</p> <p>If this can be facilitated, it will be the biggest issue we will deal with between now and the budget.</p></speech>

I did not hear the Fianna F&aacute;il leader admit he got it wrong by not putting forward a Fianna F&aacute;il candidate for the Seanad election.  There were calls for the Taoiseach to come before this House to account for himself.  Senator O'Donovan mentioned the Constitution and under the Constitution the Government is responsible to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, although I hate to point this out.  The Taoiseach explained the situation to the other House yesterday and put his hands up, which is not something many former taoisigh have done.</p><p>Regarding State boards, the Taoiseach was wrong in this case but I point out to Senator MacSharry that when Fianna F&aacute;il was voted out of office, it stuffed more than 300 people onto State boards before the new Government took office.  Fianna F&aacute;il made people chairmen of institutes of technology and various other bodies during the aforementioned interregnum - this should not be forgotten and I will not let the Senators forget.</p></speech>

The decision was made by the Government and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, that all vacancies on State boards must be advertised openly on the State boards portal operated by the Public Appointments Service.  Candidates must meet specific and detailed criteria determined by the relevant Minister to be necessary for the effective performance of a role.  They must also be processed through a transparent assessment system designed and implemented by the independent Public Appointments Service to support the relevant Minister in making appointments to State boards under his or her remit.  These requirements will provide a credible, transparent and robust appointments model that will ensure vacancies on State boards are filled by candidates of the high calibre that is required to successfully perform the challenging roles involved.  This is what people want and this is what they will get.</p><p>Senator Quinn raised a point he made some weeks ago on embracing new technology with regard to tax discs, insurance and so on.

I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister.</p><p>Senator Landy spoke of difficulties relating to estates that are not taken over by local authorities and I am sure he will raise this with the Tipperary man who is Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.</p><p>Regarding Senator Norris's points, I addressed yesterday, in reply to Senator Cullinane, the issue of statements made by the driver for the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Paudie Coffey.</p><p>Senator Burke spoke of 1,100 people appointed without interview to fill temporary vacancies in the Health Service Executive, HSE, who were then employed on a full-time basis.  The recruitment embargo has created difficulties and I agree that it should be debated in this House so I will try to have the Minister come before us to address the matter.</p><p>I agree with the comments made by Senator Barrett on the property market and he is correct that banks should assess all current loans.  An exemption for the banking sector relating to freedom of information was raised and I am sure this will be discussed when the Freedom of Information Bill is discussed here tomorrow.</p><p>Senator Hayden spoke of developers and raised the failure of the Government to enforce Part 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the difficulties this has caused.  I note her points and we will ask the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to come before the House to address this matter.</p><p>Senator Healy Eames raised the voting process for the Seanad election.  It will be a secret ballot, as she knows, and I am sure we will all accept the democratic vote that ensues.  I look forward to working with the person elected.</p><p>Senator Comiskey welcomed the new US ambassador and raised the need for a debate on the issue of undocumented Irish people in America, which was raised in the House yesterday.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will come before this House in two weeks to speak on Syria, Iraq and the issues he addressed when the Seanad was recalled.  I have also asked the Minister to address the issue of undocumented Irish people in America and to speak of his visit to the US.  We will have a far-reaching debate on those issues.</p><p>Senator Michael D'Arcy called for a debate on the Irish corporation tax regime and it would be apt if that debate was held now, as the issue is under discussion throughout Europe and elsewhere.  The Senator knows that in July 2013 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, published its base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, action plan, which represented a roadmap for work that will be undertaken on this project.  BEPS is about tackling mismatches between the tax rules of different countries and aligning taxing rights with substance.  Companies should be taxed where their substantive operations are based and this is in line with Ireland's strategy for attracting foreign direct investment, FDI.  Ireland has never been and will never be a brass-plate location - we want real foreign direct investment that brings real jobs.  BEPS offers more opportunities than risks for Ireland because, at 12.5%, Ireland has the lowest general corporate tax rate in the OECD.  Corporate tax rates are a matter of national sovereignty and this Government is committed to maintaining this.</p><p>Ireland's competitive corporate tax rate, the availability of skilled workers and its reputation for business friendliness are huge advantages that other countries will struggle to match.  As international tax loopholes are progressively closed, our low general corporation tax will become even more attractive.  As we continue to improve our attractiveness in terms of knowledge-based investment, research and development and intellectual property, we can grow our share of FDI-related investment and the potential for thousands of additional jobs.  I will ask the Minister for Finance to come before the House as soon as possible for a debate on the Irish corporate tax regime.</p></speech>

I invite the Leader to commence proceedings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1130" speakername="Maurice Cummins" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100008#H00300"><p>I am privileged today to lead the tributes to the former Senator, Dr. Edward Haughey.  Sadly, Dr. Haughey passed away after a tragic helicopter accident in Norfolk in the United Kingdom in March 2014.  I take this opportunity to express my sympathy and that of the House to all who loved Edward Haughey dearly and, in particular, to his wife, Lady Ballyedmond, and his sons, daughters and close friends who are present in the Chamber this morning.  Senator Haughey was a Member of both the 20th and 21st Seanaid, that is, from 1993 to 1997 and from 1997 to 2002, where he made many notable and passionate contributions.  Dr. Haughey's political career extended further than his seat here in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, as he also took a seat on the red benches of the House of Lords.  He became one of the first Members in decades to sit in both the British and Irish Parliaments.</p><p>As one of the better-known Members of this House, Edward Haughey was not only recognised for his memorable contributions here but also will be remembered for his outstanding business achievements.  Seanad &Eacute;ireann has a notable relationship with Northern Ireland affairs and Dr. Haughey, with so many other Members, championed the cause of Northern Ireland and peace between Northern and Southern Ireland.  At a time when Northern Ireland was suffering a bad reputation abroad, the entrepreneur in Dr. Haughey began to shine and he began to invest heavily in industry there.  He took over an old factory building and transformed it into a huge pharmaceutical enterprise, namely, Norbrook Laboratories, which is one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world that employs more than 3,000 people across four continents.  It is only right in this regard that Edward Haughey will be remembered for bringing significant employment and investment to Northern Ireland during the darkest days of the Troubles.</p></speech>

In this regard, it is both interesting and fitting that Members should be holding these tributes to Dr. Haughey at a time when both the British and Irish Governments have announced their commitment to the resumption of North-South talks and to bringing people together.  I am sure that during his time as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, Dr. Haughey's sound advice and counsel was sought on Northern Ireland affairs by both sides of the Upper and Lower Houses.  Once again, I extend my deepest sympathies to the Haughey family and thank them for taking the time to come here on their journey to join with Members in the House to pay tributes.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

Ba dhuine faoi leith &eacute; agus thug s&eacute; misneach agus inspior&aacute;id d&uacute;inn freisin.  Down through the years, many distinguished people have served in Seanad &Eacute;ireann from the worlds of literature, culture, art, sport, agriculture and industry.  There is no doubt but that Edward Haughey was foremost among those distinguished people who have served here.  He served for two terms, having been appointed by Albert Reynolds and by Bertie Ahern.  During his time in the Seanad, he was spokesperson on Northern Ireland, as well as being a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</p><p>On looking back through his speeches in the Seanad in recent days, I realise the contribution he made at that time in bringing peace to Northern Ireland because coming from the background from which he came, he brought a unique perspective to Northern Ireland.  He had spent a number of years in New York, where he learned so much about what his own future would hold subsequently.  When he eventually came back in the late 1960s - at the time as a lone trader - he put into action everything he had learned in America.  From that position, Members should consider the current status of Norbrook Laboratories.  It employs 2,000 people, not just in the North of Ireland but from both North and South.  The value of its exports runs into hundreds of millions of euro at present and its payroll alone is in the region of &euro;75 million and makes a major economic injection into the local economy.  I mention this because this was the unique perspective to which I refer, because ultimately, what was important was his political philosophy.  He believed that politics was the vehicle towards stability and quality.  That was what was important and he had a specific vision of stability and equality.  He also believed that each individual should be able to aspire through hard work to improving his or her own lot, as well as that of the nation.</p><p>I served with him during his second term in the Seanad and when I look back on his contributions, it always struck me that he was a very focused gentleman.  He did not use words lightly, each word was measured, and he always realised the seriousness of the turbulent times being experienced in Northern Ireland during that era in our history.  However, with hindsight one can now see the building blocks he put in place to ensure his contribution would provide the stability of which he always thought.  He had one great motto in life, which could apply to everyone in this House, as well as to all human beings, and that was that he was elated by success but importantly, he was educated by failure.  To me, that encapsulates what all our lives should be but it was important from his perspective that he acted according to the principle.  It is one reason he was so admired, not just on this island but internationally as well.  I do not believe any person ever achieved so many honorary doctorates as did he both in Ireland and abroad.  I was going through the list and he must have at least 30 or 40 exceptionally impressive and significant achievements in his own lifetime.  However, he never forgot the spirit of work and did not believe in waste, because he was a determined person and would see opportunities where someone else would not.</p><p>At the same time, he always remembered other people.</p> <p>He was the philanthropist par excellence.  We need only look at Dublin alone where he donated &pound;1 million to the new veterinary hospital in the university in Dublin.  Interestingly, it is named as a permanent monument to Albert Reynolds because of the work Albert Reynolds did for peace.  He donated &pound;1 million to research also. When we weigh and think about the effect that investment of his generosity had on the lives of other people, we conclude it is absolutely unique.  It also continues to grow and multiply.</p><p>There is no doubt that Lord Ballyedmond was a family man in every sense of the word.  I welcome Lady Ballyedmond, Caroline, James, Edward and friends also.  It is because he was a family man and the family worked together, encouraged and supported each other that his successes were so huge and important to the lives of so many people.  When I realised he was here in the Seanad I often felt there was something particularly generous about the fact that somebody who had so much at his disposal and had already achieved such a strong foundation in his own life, his family and his business was prepared to come in here on a regular basis and at a time when it was most needed to make very focused contributions.  That was appreciated by all open-minded and right-thinking people at that particular time.</p><p>I listened to Donie Cassidy, who was a former Leader of this House, paying tribute today to the former Senator, Edward Haughey.  Donie Cassidy had a wonderful and productive working relationship with Edward in those years.  Donie would always remind me that when Edward left this House and went back to Northern Ireland or to any part of the world, he always brought with him the importance of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the platform which it gave him.  We can use the word &quot;visionary&quot; very lightly.  That is true.  He was a visionary.  There is no doubt.  However, he was also - as Edward said in his eulogy - an enigma and a very complex man.  Now we have the opportunity of revealing all that to ourselves and putting it on the record of the House.  Not only was he a visionary, he was also inspirational and above all else he was an innovator.  It is so sad that at the peak of his success, ability and opportunity he should be taken from Lady Ballyedmond and the family.  However, I have no doubt - from what I have heard from Donie Cassidy and from what I have read - that the family have a basketful of good memories.   The family will have those memories for many years to come.  I have no doubt that his legacy will not go unnoticed and that many of the things which he did not complete in his own lifetime will be brought forward.</p><p>We are so happy in Ireland today that the peace process is embedded, that it is rooted, and that we are beginning to see the fruits of peace and justice on this island.  However, the more we think about it, remember it, celebrate it and commemorate it, the name of Edward Haughey will always be central to that story.  That is why I am so pleased, with the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, to have the opportunity to contribute in a small way today.  This is a limited time.  We have only so many words.  How can so much in such a short time be encapsulated?  I am very anxious that Edward's family would appreciate that what we are saying is heartfelt.  We too have been inspired by him, his life, his words, his actions and his achievements.  Please God, we will go forward with that motto - which I mentioned - in all our lives.  That we would all be elated by success but that we would also be educated by failure.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.  Go raibh r&aacute;th D&eacute; ar a anam, agus le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, he will not be forgotten, not just in this House, but in any part of Ireland or wherever he has worked, practised, served or interacted.  There is no doubt about it.  He was special and he was extraordinary. </p></speech>

I wish to join with others on behalf of the Labour Party group, and as leader of the Labour Party group, to pay tribute to the late Dr. Edward Haughey, who as others have said served as a Senator in this House for two terms, from 1994 and again in 1997.  As we know, he died very tragically earlier this year.  I particularly wanted to speak personally because two of Edward's children, Caroline and Edward, are former students of mine in the law school in Trinity.  I wish to extend to Caroline and Edward - and James and Mary - not just my own personal sympathies and those of the Labour Party group, but also the sympathies of all my colleagues in the law school in Trinity.  I have specifically been asked to do so by the head of the law school, Dr. Oran Doyle.  There is a strong family connection with Trinity. Trinity really does appreciate that and, as a Trinity Senator, I appreciate that.  I had a very productive working relationship with them, particularly with Caroline, on criminology research as a student.  I know what great students they were and how very much we value them as alumni of Trinity.<br/>I wish to say a few words about the late Dr. Haughey who I did not know personally, but who, as others have said, was a very successful entrepreneur and who combined successful careers in both business and in politics across two islands.  In a unique sense, he contributed an enormous amount to his local community and to the broader communities in Britain and in Ireland.  He brought many jobs to Newry, as founder and chair of the Norbrook veterinary pharmaceutical company.  I am told there are thousands of jobs across four continents with Norbrook.  Others have spoken of the success of that business. <br/>He combined that with a successful political career.  The Leader of the House has said that he was the first person in decades to serve both as a Senator in the Upper House but also in the House of Lords in England.  He must have been unique to have served two terms as a Senator nominated by different Fianna F&aacute;il Taoisigh and for him then to go on to become a sitting Member of the House of Lords for both the UUP and, subsequently, the Conservative Party.  He had a truly unique political career which was influential on both sides of the Border.  As others have said, he brought a unique perspective on Northern Ireland to the Seanad.  This House has always had a particular interest and affinity with the politics of Northern Ireland.  Many of his obituaries mentioned the work he had done behind the scenes on the peace process.  This was done at personal risk to himself and his family.  He did become a target - as we know - for dissidents at a certain time.  His philanthropy was also commented upon as were the donations he made - often anonymously - to different projects such as local schools and at third level.<br/>There was a very important obituary in the London <i>Independent</i>which referred to his time in the House of Lords, to which he was appointed in 2004, when he became Baron Ballyedmond and how he had moved at that point into the heart of the British establishment.  An anecdote points out that he was sitting next to Margaret Thatcher at a House of Lords' dinner in 2008 when she became faint and was taken to hospital.  Clearly he had a political career that spanned contact at very high levels in Britain and in Ireland.  The same obituary in the London <i>Independent</i>spoke of his reluctance to delegate and his success as a self-made businessman.  There was a lovely quote from the local journalist, Eamonn Mallie, who said that Edward Haughey: <blockquote>... gave a huge lifeline to south Armagh.  He took over an old factory and he turned it into a huge concern.  He was an absolute dynamo, a phenomenon, he just couldn't stop - that's the sort of guy he was.  </blockquote>The obituary quotes tributes from across the political spectrum and others too.  Those sorts of tributes encapsulate the great achievements that Edward Haughey had in a career that was all too sadly cut short.  I wish to conclude by expressing my own sincere sympathies to his wife, Mary, Edward, James and Caroline and to those family and friends who are here today, his son-in-law, who I have just met, and to other family and friends and to convey all of our sympathies on behalf of the Labour Party group and my colleagues in Trinity.  Go raibh maith agat. </p></speech>

I am taking a slightly different role today because I have heard so many wonderful stories about our friend, Eddie Haughey.</p> <p>I got to know him very well.  The very first time I met him, he and his wife, Mary, and I and my wife, Denise, were at a dinner here in Dublin.  I was introduced to him as Senator Feargal Quinn.  It must have been about 1993; I had just become a Senator.  It was fairly clear that Eddie did not know a great deal about life down here at that stage.  He certainly learned later.  He asked me what state I came from and I asked what he meant by state.  He assumed I was American.  He did not even know that there was a Seanad here.  He then collared me and asked how one can become a Senator.  I talked to him about that and said I would love to see somebody like him in the Senate because I have a criticism when I see a Government being run by people who have never had to worry about finding the money to pay the wages at the end of the week.  I told him that I would like to see more business people like him in the Government, the D&aacute;il or the Seanad or anywhere else.  I was thrilled when he became a "twofor" - I think that was his term. He told me a "twofor" was someone who gets two for the price of one and that he was going to bring both business experience and Northern Ireland experience to the Seanad.  That is exactly what he did, as we heard from Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  He created Northern business here and he was able to get involved and talk about it.  He became a spokesperson for the Fianna F&aacute;il Government at the time.  I do not believe he ever took the Whip to the extent of saying he was going to do what he had been told to do.</p><p>Our offices were across the road in Kildare House and we used to walk over whenever a vote took place.  I explained to him that the pedestrian lights between Kildare House and here were the fastest moving pedestrian lights in Dublin, in case a vote were to be called and we were at the other side of the road and were to miss it by a few seconds.  On one occasion he talked to me about how he had tabled an amendment.  I said that was interesting and he said that it was against a Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  I said to him to go ahead and do it.  I was normally voting against the Government at that time but in that instance I was going to vote the other way around.  He had such a sense of humour and joy and he really enjoyed being here.  Others who have spoken today have spoken of the joy he took in being deeply involved in Northern Ireland affairs but also in business affairs.</p><p>I had another link with him in that my grandfather came from Attical, which is not that far from Ballyedmond.  Some years after I had first met him, Edward had an illness and was out for a few weeks.  I was going to a family funeral in Attical and I phoned his office to see how he was and if I could get in touch with him as I would be going past Ballyedmond.  Even though he had been out of action and laid up, he still went to work there on occasion.  He should not have been doing it and he said he would be back to Ballyedmond Castle in a few minutes.  I waited for him and he showed me around with such great pride and with great stories.  He was a storyteller galore and could entertain so well.</p><p>When my daughter, Gillian, who is a friend of his daughter, Caroline, was invited to Caroline's 21st birthday, she said the hospitality that Mary and Edward gave was such that everybody felt welcome in Ballyedmond Castle.  They also felt welcome here.  I remember he invited me to have a look at his house in Fitzwilliam Square.  We walked over and what a lovely house it was.  We got an invitation to dinner there one night, but he did not get outside caterers to do the dinner.  He got his own team from Ballyedmond Castle to come down to Dublin and entertain his guests here, and what a great night it was.  A number of us from the Seanad were invited on that occasion.</p><p>My last time to meet him was at the time of Seanad reform.  The referendum took place a year ago this week.  He immediately offered to do anything he could to help.  He was very happy to get involved in that.  When we had a little lunch - I would not say celebration - afterwards, he came down and met many old friends here and everyone remembered him so well.  We got a jolt when he died but I prefer to look back on today as a celebration of a life that fitted so much into it and also brought so much joy to so many of us.  What a great success story it has been to have somebody who could be successful and still have that sense of family, humour and personality that he was able to instil in everyone he met.  I am happy to say to the family here today that we miss him, and they miss him, but I am sure he is looking down at us and smiling and saying: &quot;I think I made a mark.  I think I made a difference.&quot;  He certainly made a difference to everybody with whom he came into contact and to people in Northern Ireland, certainly around Newry, where my father grew up, and in north County Louth as well.  I hope he is looking down at us and that he is proud of the team that has come to pay respects to him today.  I know we are proud of him as well.  This is a man whom we will not forget, whom we honoured and enjoyed, and a man who showed us what can be done if we are determined to do it.</p></speech>

I have neither the blas nor all the colourful talk that I heard especially from Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Senator Quinn.  I served with him in the Seanad from 1997 to 2002.  It was a major achievement that he had served in a previous Seanad and was appointed by two different Fianna F&aacute;il taoisigh.  I remember him as a kind and friendly man although I did not know him terribly well.  I met him a few times with former Senator Maurice Manning.  He loved telling stories and sharing a joke, and in that sense he was great company.  We are always reminded of him now when we are on the train to Belfast because we pass by Norbrook Laboratories.  It is a magnificent monument to him.  I extend my sympathy to all of his family here today and ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p></speech>

I, too, am glad to offer my sympathies today on behalf of my party, along with my colleague, Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and express them to the family.  I met former Senator Haughey on one occasion at Trinity College with Caroline, who was in my class.  He was certainly put to good use by Caroline on the law society committee to get very high-profile and important guests for debates.  That is certainly something that sticks in my memory.</p><p>When we think of people who have been appointed by taoisigh, and Edward was perhaps unique in being appointed by two different taoisigh, we look at who was appointed as well.  Former Senator Gordon Wilson was appointed in that same Seanad in 1993 by Albert Reynolds, and former Senator Maurice Hayes was appointed in 1997 by Bertie Ahern.  They are the sort of people that the taoisigh of the time were appointing to the Seanad and it is always instructive to look at one's colleagues on the list of Taoiseach's nominees.  It speaks to what the taoisigh at the time were trying to do in building links between North and South, promoting understanding here of what was going on in the North and in the North of what was going on in the South, and bringing the countries together.  Edward's family can rightly say he played a significant role in that.</p> <p>He did not just clock in and out during his time in the Seanad, as very few do, but actually played a full and key role with Members here in terms of legislation.  I understand that he also played an important role within the Fianna F&aacute;il Party at the time.  I again express on behalf of my party my heartfelt condolences to the family.  It was a terrible shock when their father and husband died and we certainly felt for the family and are still thinking of them today.</p></speech>

I attempted last Saturday to imbibe his spirits there.  From Faughart I took a right turn and as I went down that road, the man from Newry was delivering Royal Mail, probably as close to Dundalk as his route would take him.  I took another turn and the speed limit signs were in the metric system again.  I felt that a man from that vicinity would be very well placed to play a notable role in the reconciling of the two traditions on this island.  The loyalty of Edward Haughey to his home place of Kilcurry was recognised.  A boulder outside the very impressive community centre stated that is was built "with the generous support of Dr Edward Haughey and the people of this community".  That community centre was formally opened by the former Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Mr. Dermot Ahern, on 15 June 2003.</p><p>There is a vintage sycamore tree in the village, which will be over 200 years old next year and which has survived many car crashes and attempts by Louth County Council to knock it down for road-widening.  It is stated that it marks the boundary of three townlands: Kilcreevy, Balriggan and Carrickedmond.  That set me thinking that Lord Ballyedmond started off in the townland of Carrickedmond, and he did not forget his roots.  That is acknowledged in the community to this very day.  He emigrated to New York on leaving school, where he acquired a prodigious reputation for hard work in selling animal drugs.  As my fellow Senators have said, he returned to Newry in 1968 to establish Norbrook Laboratories, which employs 3,000 people, 2,000 of them in Northern Ireland.</p><p>His investments in research and development led to the patenting of a long-acting antibiotic drugs for animals, which brought him export orders from the United States and Africa.  He had animal drug products in the entire market range; as he said himself, he could cater for anything from a poodle to a lion if animal pharmaceuticals were needed.  Norbrook Laboratories won the Queen's award for export achievement four times and the Queen's award for enterprise in 2011.  Those honours followed, as Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute; said, honorary degrees, including from the University of Ulster, and an honorary fellowship of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.  He was by then one of the largest veterinary drug suppliers in Africa and 80% of the output from Newry was exported.</p><p>In his political career he ranged, as Senator Byrne and others have said, from Fianna F&aacute;il to the Ulster Unionist Party to the Conservative Party.  He came to this House on the nomination of the Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, on 30 December 1994, in the presence and in the tradition of great Ulster Senators like Gordon Wilson, Seamus Mallon, John Robb and many others.  He served also on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  A man with strong south Armagh and County Louth links, he was ideally placed to represent one tradition to the other.  He persuaded David Trimble and the Ulster Unionists to sign up to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.  After that, David Trimble nominated him to the House of Lords and he shared the distinction of being a Member of Parliament in both countries with people like Henry Grattan.  As he was loyal to his neighbours in his youth in Kilcurry, so he was loyal to this House.  As Senator Quinn said, when we had the contest between David and Goliath to abolish this House and David won, Edward Haughey supported David.  We are very grateful for that support and for his encouragement.  It was invaluable because Edward Haughey made a stand on our behalf when so many people in the other House wanted to see the end of the Seanad and we are grateful to him for that.  </p><p>On 30 March 2014, Edward Haughey was killed in a helicopter crash in Norfolk along with his colleague Declan Small from Mayobridge, a friend of the family.  We also extend condolences to his family and to the families of the pilots, Carl Dickerson and Lee Hoyle.  At his funeral Mass in Newry cathedral, Canon Francis Brown praised Edward Haughey's generosity to many good causes.  He said that Edward made many significant donations over the years to educational establishments and charitable organisations.  Most of these were never published, and many charities and schools in the locality benefited.  I have in my possession very tender letters from Caroline, saying how much her father admired this House and how much he liked to visit Trinity College when his children were studying there.  As Senator Bacik has said, that is reciprocated fully by us; we valued him hugely.</p><p>In Newry, Canon Brown praised a man who was &quot;self-taught, hard-working and determined, with a thirst for knowledge&quot;.  Reading through his biography, one sees that Edward Haughey's father died two months before he was born and his mother, Rose, was responsible for rearing him.  We think of her today and that the family is now reunited.  Later that day, after Canon Brown had spoken, Edward Haughey returned to Kilcurry for the last time.  He was a remarkable man who never forgot his neighbours from his boyhood years.  May he rest in peace in Kilcurry, and again, all of us in this House extend our condolences to his wife, Mary, and his children, Caroline, James and Edward.

I served with him on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and it is fair to say that he is one of the unsung heroes of the peace process.  In politics, and life, the limelight shines on just a few but people like the late former Senator Haughey played a significant role in bringing all traditions on this island together.</p><p>His commercial life and record speaks for itself but his political life is also quite fascinating.  He was a person who served as a Fianna F&aacute;il nominee in the Seanad and then served another jurisdiction as an Ulster Unionist and a Tory peer.  This shows how bridges can be crossed, how divides can be brought together and how politics can bring about real change.  Much of the work which has stemmed and flowed from the peace process and the good we see coming from it is the result of the input of people such as the late former Senator Haughey.  I know he truly enjoyed his time in this House.  I know from my time as co-chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly that he enjoyed his membership of that committee.  Along with interesting political characters such as Peter Brooke, Michael Mates and Seamus Mallon, he was a very significant voice on that forum.  He was an interesting alternative voice which forced all of us to recognise that life and politics and particularly the British-Irish situation was not as black and white as we sometimes thought.  His role was significant and he will be fondly remembered.</p><p>His death was a great tragedy but his family can be consoled by thoughts of the significance of his memory.  His influence was so strong and, as some of my colleagues who knew him much better pointed out, the charitable work and the benefits which flowed from that are and will be a lifelong monument to his memory.  I join in the tributes to a very great man who will be long and fondly remembered.</p></speech>

As has already been said, he was appointed by two different taoisigh, the late Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern.  I will not go over the salient, interesting and important points made by many of the speakers today on both sides of the House but if memory serves me correctly, there is a west Cork dimension to the appointment of the late Dr. Haughey.</p> <p>If memory serves me correctly, there is a west Cork dimension to the appointment of the late Senator Haughey.  I am subject to correction but I believe my memory is not dim yet.  I was in the Seanad up to January 2002 and lost out, which is part of politics, but in the spring of that year a young man from west Cork was appointed to this House.  The appointment of Brian Crowley, MEP, was an important one because he was the first person in a wheelchair in the Seanad.  He has gone a long way since then.  In the summer of 1994, Brian Crowley, MEP, was elected to Europe with a phenomenal vote.  The arising vacancy allowed the then Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, to appoint Edward Haughey as Senator.</p><p>I have a speech but I do not usually stick to a speech when I know someone.  I was in the Seanad with Senator Edward Haughey as I was re-elected in 1997 until 2002.  I attended at least one of the renowned parties to which Senator Quinn referred.  I will say no more about that.  It was enjoyable to say the least.</p><p>I have an abiding memory of the late Senator Haughey.  As one speaker said, he was not a person who came to the Chamber every morning and spoke on the Order of Business.  He spoke when he had something to say, which was not frequently, perhaps once a month.  From my conversations with him I am aware that he was an astute listener to what was going on in the Seanad.  He met people and heard what Members on all sides had to say.  He listened.  One of the biggest criticisms levied at me by a friend of mine in politics many years ago is that my one problem was that I do not listen.  To be successful in politics one must listen to what is being said.  That is true on both sides of the Border.  Senator Haughey moved the peace process into the Chamber through his influence in business and otherwise.  My abiding memory is that he was a man who had achieved huge success as an entrepreneur.  He did not need the Seanad from the point of view of income, but he was appointed on two occasions and made an excellent contribution.  He was one of the pieces in the jigsaw puzzle of the peace process.  He was an honest broker who listened in a quiet and unassuming way and took the message back to the North.</p><p>That is my memory of him.  I am pleased to be present to convey my sincere sympathy to his wife, Lady Ballyedmond, his sons, daughter Caroline, and his extended family and friends.  As one speaker said, we are present to commemorate his contribution to Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  It is a sad loss but it is also a celebration.  Before I conclude we will stand for a minute&rsquo;s silence and say a prayer or whatever else people wish to do.</p></speech>

I am pleased to announce that as a consequence of these consultations I propose to introduce a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee and Report Stages, which amendments I believe go a considerable way towards addressing the concerns expressed to me by a range of stakeholder interests.  I believe that a good balance has now been struck in the Bill that not only meets the needs of a flourishing industry but also serves the greater public good and protects the environment.</p><p>The purpose of this Bill is to reform and update the legislative framework for forestry.  This will support the development of a modern forest sector which operates in accordance with the principles of good forest practice.  The current regulatory regime, underpinned by the Forestry Act 1946 has been in place for almost 70 years.  Considerable changes have occurred within the forestry sector during that time.  There have also been many technological, scientific and regulatory developments in the intervening period.  Key among these has been the recognition that forests are a multi-functional resource that provide significant economic, social and environmental benefits.  As Minister with responsibility for forestry I must ensure that the governing legislation for forestry is flexible and facilitates rather than restricts the sustainable use and development of this important national and natural resource.</p><p>Before elaborating on the provisions of the Bill, it would be useful to put into context Irish forestry in terms of size and contribution to the economy of the country.  By the early 1900s, forest cover in Ireland had been reduced to 1% of the land area of the country.  This contributed to the need to regulate felling through the introduction of the Forestry Acts 1928 and 1946, which ensured that forest cover was maintained.  The area of the national forest estate in Ireland is now over 730,000 hectares or almost 11% of the total land area.  While this has expanded significantly since the early 1980s with the introduction of grant schemes aimed at encouraging private landowners, mainly farmers, to become involved in forestry, it is still relatively low compared to our EU counterparts given that almost 40% of total land in the EU is under forest cover.</p><p>More than 54% of the national forest estate is in public ownership, mainly through Coillte Teoranta, with the remaining 46% in private ownership.  This contrasts with the position 20 years ago when 70% was in public ownership and only 30% was in private ownership.  There are more than 19,000 private forest owners throughout Ireland, the majority of whom are farmers.  Ireland's forest sector comprises a growing sector, a vibrant processing sector and a modern harvesting and transport sector, with total employment in the region of 12,000.  These jobs are mainly in rural areas and make a significant contribution to the local economies in which they are based.  Exports of wood products in 2012 were just over &euro;300 million, with wood-energy and processing also expanding as forests enter the production phase.  Ireland's forests are widely used by the public for amenity and recreation, with an estimated 18 million recreational visits to Irish forests each year.  The number of visits continue to increase, making this area a huge part of our tourism resource.</p><p>Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I have visited forest plantations, nurseries and timber processing facilities to see first-hand the actual work involved.  I have also met with a number of representative groups, including timber processors, forestry companies, forest owner groups - which is a new grouping established to protect the interests of the now many private forest owners - and environmental organisations.  My door is open to all involved in this sector.  During my travels around the country over the last 12 months I met with many people who are committed to this industry and who are interested in working with the forest service and my Department to build it into the future, thus creating a huge number of jobs across rural areas.  </p><p>I will now address the main provisions of the Bill and give a general outline of its scope and how the proposed system of regulation will work in practice.  Members will appreciate that many of the provisions are standard, technical or legal provisions and do not require any further clarification.</p><p>Part 1 contains a number of general provisions including the Short Title, rules governing the laying of documents before the Houses of the Oireachtas, service of documents and expenses of the Minister.</p> <p>Section 2 contains the important definitions which determine the scope of the Bill.  It is of necessity an extensive list that draws on many aspects of forest operations and practices.</p><p>Part 2 outlines in some detail the functions of the Minister, both general and specific.  The general functions in section 5 include a range of promotional responsibilities relating to forestry, including afforestation, good forest practice that maintains the biological diversity of forests, the promotion of knowledge and awareness of forestry through education and training, and the development and marketing of a quality based processing sector.  The Minister's general functions also include the regulation and monitoring of forest operations to ensure that forests are properly managed and protected from harmful pests, diseases and invasive species.  The specific functions of the Minister are set down in section 6.  These primary functions include the granting of licences for felling, afforestation, forest road works and approval of forest management plans, and the attaching of conditions to such licences and approvals.  Regulation of forestry activities is essential both to avoid environmental damage and to maintain the existing forest estate so as to protect the investment by the State in the afforestation programme.  An important feature of this section is the granting of powers to the Minister to give legislative effect to guidelines and standards covering a range of environmental considerations, from water quality to the protection of species such as the red squirrel and the freshwater pearl mussel.</p><p>Section 7 elaborates on the technical aspects of the Minister's powers relating to the granting of licences and approvals, including the setting of conditions, the extension of such licences and approvals and their suspension or revocation.  Section 8 allows the Minister to appoint committees to assist and advise in the performance of his or her functions.  Where advantageous, this may include the delegation to a committee of certain functions, subject to the Minister retaining overall responsibility and accountability.  Issues concerning the confidentiality of the work of the committee and the responsibility of members are set down in section 9.</p><p>Section 10 enables the Minister to require forest owners to submit a forest management plan in support of applications for consented activities.  Such plans would cover felling, including thinning, reforestation, forest road works and other forestry-related activities such as amenity and recreational use of forests.  The forest management plan will also provide a mechanism whereby an application for a felling licence may be incorporated within the plan thus allowing for a flexible, responsive and timely system for dealing with activities such as thinning.</p><p>Part 3 provides for protection of the environment when any forestry activity is being planned.  The licensing of forestry activities must have regard to the continued protection of the environment.  There are consultation processes in place with a range of stakeholders, including the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Inland Fisheries Ireland, An Taisce, local authorities and the public.  There are also guidelines on matters such as water quality, landscape, biodiversity, archaeology, and protected flora and fauna.  Approximately 18% of the land area of Ireland is designated under European law as special areas of conservation or special protection areas.  There are also additional national designations, such as natural heritage areas and national parks.  Forest activities may be restricted in these designated areas.</p><p>Section 11 requires the Minister to have regard to the social, economic and environmental functions of forestry; and to follow good forest practice and to take particular account of the potential impact of forestry activities on different habitats and species in forests.  Activities occurring within designated areas or affecting protected species, or activities that have the potential to impact on such areas or species, must be assessed for any adverse impact.  Where it is considered that the activity has the potential to adversely impact on the designated area or protected species, the Minister will require the completion of an assessment of the impact of the forestry activity on the habitat, plant life, birds or animals so affected.  Such assessments could also include proposals to avoid, mitigate or ameliorate any potential impact and if acceptable, these would then allow the proposed activity to proceed in an appropriately controlled and measured fashion.</p><p>Sections 12 and 13 are technical provisions that place an onus on forest owners to notify the Minister if their forest is damaged or destroyed, and also give the Minister the power to require information from forest owners and wood processing businesses for statistical or investigative purposes.  Section 14 is important in the context of forest protection.  Both 2010 and 2011 were among the worst years on record for land and forest fires in Ireland with many forest fires being caused by the uncontrolled burning of vegetation which spread to nearby forests.  The forest estate suffered over 3,000 hectares of damage during those two years.  This provision allows the Minister to serve a notice on a landowner to remove vegetation from uncultivated land that is posing a threat to an adjoining forest or to authorise persons to enter the land and remove the vegetation.</p><p>Section 15 deals with the control of species such as grey squirrels and rabbits where they pose a threat to forests.  It allows the Minister to serve a notice on a landowner requiring him or her to take specified action to protect neighbouring forests from damage.  Where land is unoccupied, or the owner fails to comply with such notice, the Minister may authorise a person to enter the land and deal with the particular species.</p><p>Part 4 deals with felling licences.  The current licence system operated under the Forestry Act 1946 is now considered cumbersome in the context of the needs of a modern forest sector and wider society.  The Bill proposes to simplify the process by replacing the two existing licences with a single felling licence.  There will no longer be a requirement for a person to lodge an application for a felling licence at the nearest Garda station.  The licence will be valid for a period of up to ten years with the possibility of an extension for a further five years, that is, 15 years in all.  When the Minister grants a licence, he or she may impose conditions, including whether or not the land should be replanted.  One of the primary purposes of the afforestation programme is to maintain and increase the national forest area, and replanting will continue to be required in all but exceptional circumstances.  Unlicensed felling will continue to be an offence with penalties, on summary conviction, of &euro;200 for every tree removed and-or imprisonment for six months.</p> <p>On conviction on indictment, penalties ranging to a maximum of &euro;1 million may be imposed and-or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.  These penalties are at the higher end of the scale reflecting the seriousness of the offence and the need for dissuasive measures to ensure that the forest estate is protected.</p><p>In response to submissions from industry sources, I introduced amendments on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il and a new section 18 now provides for fixed timelines for the processing of felling licence applications.  Many people wanted to know when their applications would arrive back on their desks.</p><p>Section 19 of the Bill provides for exemptions to the requirement for a felling licence.  These include all trees within an urban area; trees that must be removed for public safety reasons or to prevent the spread of fire, pests or disease; and trees outside a forest that are within 10 m of a public road which the owner considers to be posing a danger to road users.  An important exemption from the licensing requirement is that landowners will be able to remove trees on their own holdings for their own use, up to a limit of 15 m3 of wood in any period of 12 months, provided the trees are outside a forest and do not form part of a decorative avenue or ring of trees on the holding.  Concern was expressed in a number of quarters about the need for the protection of larger established trees in hedgerows and individual old or veteran trees in the context of this provision.  In response, I introduced an amendment on Report Stage that extends protection for such trees within the environs of national monuments or archaeological sites, trees within designated European sites and trees which are more than 150 years old.  Notwithstanding the exemptions, the Bill in section 20 also enables the Minister to issue an order prohibiting the felling or removing of any tree, with penalties for those who do not comply.</p><p>Section 21 allows the Minister to notify the Property Registration Authority of the imposition of a replanting order on land where trees have been felled without a licence or in contravention of a condition of a licence so that these can be registered as a burden on the land until the replanting order has been complied with.  This is to ensure that trees which have been illegally cut down are replaced and also to protect prospective purchasers of forestry land.  Once the conditions of the licence or the order are satisfied, the Minister, on such notification by the owner, will inform the registering authority of the discharge of the burden or compliance with the conditions.</p><p>Part 5, section 22, sets out the requirements for licensing of afforestation and forest roadwork projects and aerial fertilisation of forests.  This is a technical provision which expands on the application process.  It empowers the Minister to impose conditions on the grant of licences, provides for the imposition of penalties where unlicensed development, or development that does not comply with the conditions of a licence, takes place and also provides for the making of regulations governing the issuing of licences.</p><p>Many of the provisions of the Bill impose obligations on owners and other parties engaged in forestry activities and the enforcement provisions in Part 6 are vital to ensure compliance with those requirements.  Section 23 allows the Minister to appoint authorised officers to enforce the various statutory provisions.  These officers are normally departmental forestry inspectors but members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also authorised officers for the purposes of the Bill.  The powers of authorised officers are listed in detail in section 24.  They include the power of entry onto lands to inspect and remove, if necessary, any material considered a risk to trees and to remove records or other information relevant to the inspection or investigation.</p><p>Section 25 empowers the Minister to charge for licences and other services provided by the legislation.  It is a matter of policy as to whether there should be charges for such services and its inclusion in the Bill should not be interpreted as a statement of intent at this point.  During the consideration of this section in the D&aacute;il, I introduced an amendment on Report Stage that provides for an element of parliamentary scrutiny of any proposal to impose charges.</p><p>One of the important tenets of sustainable forest management is the regeneration of forests following felling.  The licensing system outlined in this Bill is built upon the premise that, save in exceptional circumstances, forests that are felled must be replanted.  Where illegal felling has occurred, it is important, therefore, that the Minister has the power to impose an order on the offender compelling him or her to replant the area or an equivalent area within his or her ownership.  Part 7, section 26, provides the Minister with such powers and also makes it an offence if the offender fails to comply with the order.</p><p>Part 8 of the Bill deals with offences and penalties and encompasses an extensive list of such offences in section 27.  Offences range from submitting false or misleading information in support of an application for approval or a licence to failure to comply with notices or other conditions or requirements.  Important provisions include causing irremediable damage to a tree and, as referred to already, intentional or reckless setting fire to trees.</p><p>The penalties in section 27 range from &euro;200 for damaging or removing a tree to fines of up to &euro;1,000,000 and-or five years' imprisonment for conviction on indictment of felling or removing trees without a licence.  The penalties applicable, which are ranked according to the seriousness of the offence, are of necessity severe so as to act as a deterrent against wrongdoing or failure to comply with conditions set down in the legislation.  Where the offence is committed by a body corporate, section 29 enables the Minister to prosecute both the body corporate and officers of the body corporate.</p><p>Part 9, section 30, enables the Minister to make regulations relating to the range of forestry activities, including afforestation, forest protection, forest roads, training and education.  Importantly, the regulations also include provisions to prevent the entry into the State, or the control or extermination within the State, of insects, pests or invasive species that might threaten trees, an important provision having regard to the recent outbreak of ash dieback disease.</p><p>In Part 10, section 32, provision is included for payment of compensation in certain limited circumstances where applications for licences are refused.</p><p>Finally, the Bill includes an amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001 to extend its remit to a number of forestry activities and to provide for the establishment of a forestry appeals committee.</p><p>I thank Senators for their attention and I look forward to hearing their contributions to the debate.  This is a really important area.</p> <p>The potential for the forestry sector to deliver jobs and exports is underestimated.  Many hectares of land across the country that are not viable for dairying or other agricultural uses could be considered for forestry.  Many Governments have committed taxpayers&rsquo; money to progress the forestry industry but I believe there is still more potential for job creation in rural areas, as well as in tourism and forestry linkages.  I have met many landowners who have invested in forestry because their lands were not viable for dairying.  They got much information from Teagasc and the forestry service on how to switch over to forestry.  It is a good story that can be built upon.</p></speech>

I agree with him on the importance of our afforestation programme and our publicly and privately-owned forests which play an important role in biodiversity and recreation.</p><p>At one time the island of Ireland was completely covered by forests.  By the turn of the 20th century, the forests had been reduced to 1.5% of total landmass, coming to 135,000 hectares.  In 1903, the then Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction acquired the Avondale estate in County Wicklow, along with woodland areas of some other estates, which saw the initiation of State intervention to provide forestry cover.  In 1928, when the Forestry Bill 1928 was taken in the Seanad, there was a heated debate between the Minister for Lands and Agriculture, Mr. Patrick J. Hogan, and Members on the future of State-owned forestry and who would benefit from it, as well as who would suffer as a consequence.  The intervention by the State and those early steps in the 1920s proved to be successful, albeit until the 1970s.  The 1946 Forestry Act brought about increased State intervention along with other Acts in the 1950s and 1980s.  With EU grants becoming available in the 1980s through the agriculture Department, the private forestry sector began to develop.  Coillte, established in 1988, also proved instrumental in developing this sector.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has targets for increasing forest cover from 10.9% by 2030, proving the success of State intervention along with the influence of the European Commission.</p><p>What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on the concerns brought forward by forest growers on taxation issues affecting their industry?  How will the new Common Agricultural Policy affect the continuing of grant aid and growers&rsquo; investment?  As the Minister stated, with the forthcoming milk quota changes, it may not be economically viable for some farmers to continue dairy farming.  For other farmers, their lands might not be suitable for sheep farming or tillage.  Afforestation could prove to be the answer for these farmers.  As it will involve capital expenditure, it is important the banks are aware of the afforestation programme.</p><p>It is important Coillte is kept in State ownership so as to drive the industry&rsquo;s development.  Our publicly-owned forests are a tremendous resource, attracting 18 million visitors, along with &euro;360 million in direct revenues to the State.  Coillte is committed to the development of walkways and cycle routes in our forests.  With the increasing challenge of rising obesity levels, there is a need for people to be more physically active and our children to engage more with outdoor living.  Coillte&rsquo;s forests would provide an excellent resource in this regard, particularly for those children growing up in cities.  A tailor-made schools programme could be developed in conjunction with the Minister&rsquo;s Department to allow those children not growing up in rural Ireland but deserve its benefits to go on nature walks and learn more about nature.</p><p>I acknowledge that when this Bill was going through the other House, the Minister of State was willing to take on amendments.  We will probably table amendments too but I see no reason this Bill should not be supported in general.  There are issues for the industry, as a whole, such as the public good for Coillte and the grant aid and taxation issues for private growers, which can be addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1124" speakername="Michael Comiskey" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100016#Q00300"><p>The purpose of the Forestry Bill 2013 is to reform and update the legislative framework relating to forestry.  It will support the development of a modern forestry sector to operate in accordance with good forestry practice and with a view to protecting the environment.  The forestry industry is of great importance as it affects so many different sectors of the economy.  National forest cover stands at 11%, of which private-owned forests account for 46%.  These are mainly owned by farmers and it is important they are becoming more involved in this industry.</p><p>Governments have made a significant investment in the development of forestry over the years to ensure a critical mass of timber to sustain the timber processing and products sector.  Forestry provides significant benefits including rural employment, valuable exports, climate change remediation, social and recreational benefits, as well as environmental value.  Forestry also makes a considerable contribution to the economy.  The direct output from the sector, excluding the processing sector, was &euro;378 million.  For every &euro;1 million of expenditure in the sector, a further &euro;780 million in expenditure is generated in the rest of the economy.</p> <p>Hence, the overall value of the forest sector to the Irish economy was &euro;673 million.  Direct output in the processing sector, including mills, sawmills and other wood processors, was &euro;1.3 billion.  The total value of the forest industry to the economy of the processing sector, direct and indirect, was &euro;2.2 billion.  On forest recreation, there are more than 20 million visits annually to Irish forests, with 200,000 people using forest trails for exercise.  Trekking through forests is an important part of walking tourism, which attracts 500,000 visitors who spend &euro;138 million annually.  </p><p>Forestry also has an important role to play in climate change.  Forests contribute to reducing Ireland's carbon emissions through the replacement of wood fuels and products with imported fossil fuels and energy intensive products such as steel, plastic and aluminium.  The use of wood to produce heat and electricity in Ireland resulted in an estimated 560,000 tonne reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2012.  This Bill recognises the important contribution which forests do and can make in mitigating the adverse affects of climate change.  </p><p>The Forestry Act 1946 is the primary legislation underpinning the current forestry regulatory framework.  Aspects of the 1946 legislation relate to land acquisition, research and development. flora and fauna, vermin control and a felling licence system which provides for limited and general tree felling.  The Forestry Act 1946 is replaced by this Bill.  Much has changed in the Irish forestry sector since the enactment of the 1946 Act.  Forestry has transformed into a different industry, thus there is a need for the Bill update the legislative governing forestry.</p><p>The objective of the Bill is to promote and facilitate the growth and sustainability of our forestry sector while at the same time having regard to the protection of the environment and maintenance of the social benefits of other public goods provided by forestry.  The Bill is about forestry and good forest practice.  It is necessary to streamline and simplify the various processes.  It will benefit not only the forest sector but the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which is responsible for the administration and regulation of forestry.  The Bill provides for a comprehensive statutory framework for the regulation of forestry-related activities into the future.  It provides among other things for the streamlining of the felling licence process, greater flexibility within the licensing system and the placing on a statutory basis of the various forest guidelines, including those relating to plant health, and forest management plans.  It also expands the power of the Minister and appointed authorised officers in relation to the control and prosecution of illegal or dangerous acts that threaten the forest estate.  It provides for significant and dissuasive penalties for those prosecuted of such offences.  </p><p>It is not envisaged that this legislation will result in any significant additional cost to the Exchequer or business.  It will have positive affects on the environment by providing a greater emphasis on the compliance with sustainable forest management, SFM, and the environmental guidelines published by the Forest Service.  This will help to conserve biological diversity within forests and ensure that we continue to gain from the other ecosystems and services that forests provide.  The Bill will also have a solid impact on rural communities by way of its encouragement of employment in these areas.  </p><p>I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100017#R00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, to the House and thank him for his opening contribution.  I agree with Thomas Pakenham that we live with trees and that they are our neighbours.  I would propose greater protection of them than is provided for in particular parts of this Bill.  For example, section 19 provides for the felling of trees and section 20 provides for the powers of the Minister in this regard in respect of persons caught doing so.  I would provide greater powers under section 20 than section 19.  However, I will come back to this later.</p><p>I am concerned about ash dieback disease, which was a major issue for the Minister of State's predecessor, the late Shane McEntee.  The problems we experienced in this regard were in part the result of our importing ash into this country because we did not have enough of it here, which imported ash was contaminated.  I would have expected the GAA and forestry authorities to  have made a better job of anticipating the demand for ash in this country.  As I recall it, according to the late Minister of State, Shane McEntee, the ash dieback problem here originated from imported ash products.  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, would update us on progress in this area.  In my view, the late Minister of State, Shane McEntee had more hope than confidence that future such problems could be averted.  The late Sir Horace Plunkett was a Senator and first secretary of the Minister of State's Department prior to the setting of the State, at which time there was much interest in development issues.</p><p>I am concerned also about the amount of sitka spruce that we have been growing for a long time.  Will it ever realise much in the way of value added?  If we had planted much more valuable varieties in the late 1940s when the late Sean McBride was moving on the big forestry targets, would we now have a much better resource?  We seem to grow a lot of low value trees.  I regard leylandii as a tree species that should be banned in this country.  It is a blot on the landscape everywhere.  I am concerned, too, about the rhododendrons in Killarney.  I am sure that like me the Minister of State has received e-mails from botanists expressing the view that if we do not address the spread of rhododendrons, indigenous trees such as the arbutus, an indigenous Irish tree, and the oak will be destroyed.  </p><p>Some cleared forests are like a lunar landscape.  I welcome the provisions provided for in this regard in the legislation.  However, during a visit to Wicklow I noted that there are many tree stumps there.  When harvesting a crop farmers prepare the land for the next year.  Why, at a time when we are trying to promote tourism into the country, is there a delay between taking the first crop and planting the second crop, which results in an unattractive landscape?  </p><p>In terms of the Minister of State's plan for this area, there is a need for consideration of the educational aspects of this sector.  We used to have relevant educational facilities in Kinnity, Avondale and the John Kells-Ingram farm near Slane, which was attached to the agriculture school in Trinity College where previously Professor Lawrence Roche worked and where Frank Confrey is currently doing work.  Are the necessary educational facilities to provide the required labour force in respect of the Minister of State's development plans available?  The Minister of State might also address the media concern around the issue of pay in respect of the chief executive of Coillte.  On recreation, reference has been already made to the 18 million visits.  People who live near Donadea would like to pass on to the forester in charge their appreciation of that valued amenity.</p><p>The Minister of State said in his speech that under Part 2, section 5, forests are properly managed and protected from harmful pests, diseases and invasive species, which begs the question of how the ash dieback disease got from central Europe to Ireland, why we did not have measures in place to prevent that happening and how much it will cost to address that issue.  On section 10 and forest management plans, is it the intention to impose such plans on the managers of private forests or will exemptions be granted to those who can prove that they have been managing their forests well up to now?  Perhaps the Minister of State would elaborate on how it is proposed to progress this section.</p><p>The Minister of State also said in his speech that forest activities may be restricted in designated areas such as national parks.  We need to urgently address the rhododendron issue, which is of concern to many botanists.  This issue is also covered by section 10. </p><p>On section 14, which deals with vegetation and fires, is it not possible to impose fines on the people who cause the fires, which as stated by the Minister of State in his speech, cost millions of euro of damage?  Is there a liability in law in respect of a person who starts a fire which results in substantial damage to other people's property?  If not, that is a moral hazard problem.  While I acknowledge the need to provide for tidying up afterwards, providing in law that a person who sets fire to another persons property will have to meet the cost of putting things right, would be the correct thing to do.  </p> <p>On the single felling licence and that unlicensed felling is be an offence with penalties of &euro;200 for every tree removed, I wonder is that &euro;200 enough.  If one removes a tree, it will take 20 or 30 years to replace.  There is no point in planting a few saplings.  One destroys a view or amenity, and it could take 20 or 30 years before it is restored.  Should there be a lasting penalty, not only the replacement of a tree with a sapling.<br/>We paid tribute to the late former Senator Edward Haughey earlier.  In his village, Kilcurry, a 200 year old sycamore was defended by the locals against Louth County Council and it is now a valuable part of that amenity.  In this regard, it might be a model.  Is the forest estate protected?<br/>Section 19 removes exemptions to the requirement for a felling licence and it is draconian.  The Minister should look where we are, in Merrion Square.  The section removes exemptions from all trees in an urban area.  I refer to cities such as Brussels where the forest goes right into the city.  If section 19 were implemented without the controls in section 20, the Phoenix Park, St. Stephen's Green and trees along roads all would be endangered.  I would not like to give any consolation to those who knock down trees that they have <i>carte blanche</i>to do so under section 19.  The exemptions to the felling licence requirement include all trees within an urban area.  Trees are part of the urban environment.  They enhance it.  Not to protect trees brings me to the kind of building there was in the boom era in Ireland where the landscape was completely flattened.  Let us keep trees because they enhance the value of the environment for the children who will eventually live in those houses.<br/>The exemption also includes trees within 10 metres of a public road posing a danger to road users.  Such trees also insulate properties against noise from roads.  I seek a balance in that regard, and not to give <i>carte blanche</i>to engineers to start knocking them.<br/>Deputy Tom Hayes stated the Bill enables some prohibitions but it is not good enough the way in suburban estates in the Dublin area old houses are bought and everything is levelled to fit in as many houses as possible with them stating they will plant a few saplings and in 20 or 30 years nobody will know the difference.  The inherited trees are part of our heritage and we should protect them.  I would hate to see any threat to the Botanic Gardens, old estates, urban areas, amenity areas, etc.<br/>A replanting order is not good enough.  One will never replant adequately, for example, when one knocks down an old oak.  As I stated, it will take 20 or 30 years before one would restore the amenity.  I would look hard on that.  Could the Department Google to see where all the trees are and then protect them and make it difficult under section 20 to get those exemptions?<br/>I mentioned replanting the areas.  The &euro;200 fine for damaging or removing a tree is too low.<br/>The measures to prevent the entry into the State and to control pests are important and I support the Minister of State on them.<br/>I thank the Acting Chairman, Senator van Turnhout, for her indulgence and thank Deputy Tom Hayes for listening.  This is a major piece of legislation.  I note, as other Senators stated, that the Minister of State took in lots of suggestions from the D&aacute;il.  I wish him good luck.  When I pass Dundrum, between Dublin and Cork, I know there is a Tipperary man in charge of the forest and that is reassuring.</p></speech>

As a fellow Tipperary man, I can assure him I am not going to do so anyway.  All I can say is that the ash was certainly tested on Saturday last.  As anybody who saw the slow-motion shots on RTE will confirm, they literally showed the hurleys bending as proof positive that that ash is in good condition anyway and is probably not the imported stuff.</p><p>On a more serious note, I welcome the Minister of State.  I listened intently to his opening remarks where he covered in great detail the terms of the Bill.  I have a few issues to raise, more for clarity than anything else.</p><p>I am thrilled at the decision of the Government a number of months ago to retain Coillte in State ownership.  That was a major issue in rural areas, where the Minister of State and I live.  Indeed, many from urban Ireland were concerned because of the facility, resource and amenity that the Irish forest is to the people of Ireland.  That was a good decision by the Government.  Despite the financial and other difficulties, there are certain assets that cannot be sold off.  In my view, forestry is one of those.  I commend the Minister of State for his input at the time.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  As Deputy Tom Hayes stated in his opening remarks, this is to replace legislation some of which is 70 years old.  That was a time when workers went into the forest with horse and bow saw, knocked trees in that fashion and drew them out onto the road, and then they were moved, in some cases by river and canal.  We have moved a long way since then in Ireland and have modernised.</p><p>Senator Comiskey is probably one of the foremost experts in this area even though many may not know that.  I would say he has more knowledge on the subject than all of us here in this room combined.</p><p>I welcome that there are so many jobs in the sector in this country but I see massive potential, and the Minister of State finished his closing remarks with that.  We currently have 11% afforestation in Ireland and the European average is 35%.  We have a long way to go.</p><p>One of the quandaries to which the Minister of State might respond is that he will never see trees planted on his land or, indeed, any land, in the Golden Vale-----</p></speech>

Where do we marry the incentive for the profit line for land that is not currently afforested and how do we provide a greater incentive for farmers and landowners to get into planting?  No doubt more jobs will grow from extra planting.  In our constituency, Medite, which is one of the best employers in the country, has a massive timber plant in Clonmel.  We see what that can mean to a local community, for example, with spin-off jobs.  We need more such companies around the country.</p><p>I welcome the section on environmental protection and matters such as walking rights.  I also welcome the section on pest control.  When one sees this as a full section, it might seem unimportant.  However, it is vital for the survival of saplings and young trees that pest control can be introduced.</p><p>On the incentives for afforestation that exist currently, does the Minister of State foresee anything in the coming budget that will provide further incentives?  This is extremely important, as Senator Barrett stated already.  The difficulty is that when forest trees are taken out, for some reason there is a gap and that gap is too long.  The expert on my right tells me that, in fact, when they are being cut, there is an acid put down into what is left of the roots of the tree which kills them over a quick period.  At one time, that was not possible and it took a long time to get rid of the roots and introduce the new system as the roots clogged up the soil.  That is now not the reason and we need to provide greater incentives to landowners and farmers.  Is there anything coming down the track for that so that we can grow it?</p><p>On the felling licence issue, I am glad that commonsense has prevailed.  I have, it is not a holding, two acres of land on which I have trees.  I was envisaging I would have to get a licence to knock down the few trees for myself but the Minister of State has clarified that matter.  One can knock what one needs for one's own firewood.</p></speech>

Hopefully, we will not need to buy too much coal.</p><p>The timescale of the felling licences is something that has concerned those in the sector.  Can the Minister of State clarify whether the Bill will reduce that timescale?  Currently, it takes up to 12 months to get a licence.  That is too long, if somebody is trying to organise to bring in machinery and to agree contracts with the suppliers, etc.</p><p>The Minister of State mentioned the regeneration of forest land that has been felled and under the Bill there will be a compulsion on those who have felled illegally.  Does the same apply to those who legally fell?  In other words, if somebody plans to fell their trees and he or she has the licence, is there a legal obligation on him or her to regenerate and replant within a period of time?  I would like clarity on that.</p><p>The levels of expansion in the sector need to be clarified.  I read the transcript of suggestions from other parties in the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>Some suggest that we should put in 20,000 ha per year up to 2020 which would replace what is being felled.  What are the Minister of State&rsquo;s and the Department&rsquo;s thoughts on that?  How do we reach a point where we not only maintain our<i>status quo </i>at 11% but also expand?  If we stand still everything will be knocked eventually.  There will be nothing left. <br/>As Senator Barrett said we seem to allow ash come in willy-nilly from Europe, not just eastern Europe.  This brought in ash dieback disease.  I am glad to report that the GAA is already involved in ash planting projects across the country but they will not come to fruition for another ten years.  I am concerned that if one tree is identified as having ash dieback, all the ash planted around it must be taken out.  Is that necessary or can we control it without knocking everything?  It is like a bulldozer effect, if there are a couple of trees with ash dieback we might take out ten acres of good ash which could be used to make hurleys.  If nothing is being done about that the Minister of State might highlight it in the Department and reconsider the policy adopted.</p></speech>

Every time I see forestry come up on our schedule my mind goes back to the last debate we had with the former Minister of State, Shane MacEntee.  I think of him because he was the last person to speak in here about ash dieback and he was very concerned about it.</p><p>I share the concerns of other Senators.  Will the Minister of State give us an update on the national position of ash dieback because we have not heard much about it recently?</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has supported this Bill despite our constructive amendments having been voted down by the Government parties on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  What party with the best interests of this nation at heart could not support further and better forestry provision to maximise the economic, environmental and social value of forests?  The natural resource of our forests and woodlands must be regulated and used in the interests of the Irish people.  There is economic potential for forestry but that too must be regulated so that our indigenous growers and processors will reap the benefits.  The idea of selling off harvesting rights to foreign interests must be rejected when investment at home would ensure that the monetary benefit would stay in Ireland, but would also ensure the ecological security of our woodlands.  We had several concerns which the Bill goes some way to address, but not far enough.  It is not difficult to see the challenges being created for people who are trying to marry environmental concerns with generating an economic benefit.  It is a question of the happy medium.  No one involved in the industry is trying to damage the environment but something must be in place to help people when making decisions.  When they go out of their way to protect the environment it should not be at a loss to their incomes.  This is a major problem for those in the private forestry sector.</p><p>I am also concerned by the powers that the Bill gives to the as yet unspecified people who will police it.  These people will enter people's property and land without warrants.  They can walk in off the road and make a determination that will have considerable financial implications for people in the industry.</p><p>One of the amendments we will bring forward on Committee Stage will seek to oblige the present or any future Minister to provide information to ensure the public and other authorities are regularly informed of the role and condition of forests as well as of all forestry activities.  Our support for this Bill is based on two factors, namely, the development of the industry and the wish to protect our natural resources.  The land of Ireland for the people of Ireland is a principle we take seriously.  This is not just for purely economic benefit but for the enrichment of all our lives and the protection of our national ecological heritage.</p><p>I sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions which has heard quite a few petitions on the suburban issue of trees overhanging people's gardens.  I am from a rural area but this appears to be a major issue in some suburban areas.  I am not sure if this Bill addresses that problem, or if it falls under the remit of the Minister of State.  It appears to be a substantial issue where there is a hiatus in the legislation.  I would also welcome any further support that could be given to forestry-based tourism.  There is an excellent mountain bike trail in Derroura in Connemara, which would benefit from further investment through Coillte.  More work on that kind of tourism and linking it to the Wild Atlantic Way would be quite welcome.  There are some fantastic woods which are under threat, for example in Galway, the Merlin Park Woods, which have not been developed as a full public amenity yet.  Certain people have plans to drive a bus route through those woods.  I call on the Minister of State and his Department to examine that issue and do what they can to support the people who want to preserve it as a community forest that can be used for generations to come.  Go ginear&aacute;lta, t&aacute;imid ag tac&uacute; go l&aacute;idir leis an mBille seo.  Beimid ag teacht chun cinn le leasuithe, ach f&aacute;ilt&iacute;mid roimh an reachta&iacute;ocht.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1187" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100019#T00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  The Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, all-Ireland roundwood production forecast 2011-2028 illustrates the increasing production potential from Irish forests, which will almost double to 7 million cu. m from the current 3.79 million cu. m.  The harvest from private forests is forecast to increase tenfold within this timeframe.  It is therefore right and proper that the Minister and the State should ensure that the conditions are right to promote and properly regulate the forestry industry.</p><p>Some within the private sector have been less than welcoming to the Bill.  There are several issues on which I would welcome the Minister of State's views.  Irish forests are among the healthiest in Europe.  We have comparatively little in the way of forest pests and diseases but we import vast quantities of firewood in the form of logs, along with pellets, pressed sawdust and other sawmill by-products from other European countries and further afield, which can be subject to infestation and disease not seen here.  Disease and infestation would have huge implications for the forestry industry here.  This could be addressed by increasing our own production and becoming more self-reliant.  In that regard there are no specific objectives in terms of reducing our imports, and we all know that targets concentrate the mind.  There are reports available, such as the one I have mentioned, indicating that we can increase production drastically.  The Minister of State might consider my constructive suggestions in that regard.</p><p>I compliment the Minister of State for amending the period for which a felling licence can be issued, to ten years with the potential for a further five years.  The point has already been made that the current felling licence regime is prone to delay.  I welcome the removal of the dual licence process and the involvement of the garda&iacute; in the process.</p><p>I compliment the Minister of State and the departmental officials for committing to legislation the granting of a licence within four months.  In section 18 (2), however, one of the reasons stipulated for delaying the issuing of a felling licence could be due to the number of applications submitted to the Minister.</p><p>Serious consideration should be given to mending that section as it seems to raise a concern about potential licensing inefficiency.  Can the Minister of State assure the House that he will commit sufficient resources to the forestry service to ensure that present delays are eliminated and that future ones will not occur?  There are industry suggestions that the service does not have sufficient resources and I would welcome the Minister of State's views on that suggestion.  Another problem is the onus on private foresters to destroy vegetation or vermin.  While I see the logic of that, for example, the associated fire risks,  vermin eradication is far more complicated and is not easy or cheap.  The forester might have to dedicate considerable time and moneys to this matter.</p><p>What exactly is envisaged in respect of section 15(1) where the Minister directs that certain specific steps be taken to prevent such damage within such time as the Minister may specify?  I am concerned that these steps would be either prohibitively expensive or time consuming.  Privately-owned forests account for almost half of our forest cover and are mainly owned by farmers who are already subject to rigorous inspection regimes of their day-to-day operations.  The industry is concerned that this legislation would needlessly add to that burden.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to allay those fears.</p><p>The provision of an appeals mechanism is welcome.  No administrative action should be above review and the appeals structure will create confidence in the new system.  I welcome the Bill and suggest that the Minister of State and the officials reconsider the issues I have raised with a view to making the warranted licensing regime and ancillary matters less onerous.</p></speech>

There is always next year.</p><p>I welcome this legislation.  I come from a part of the country where there is very little forestry.  Cromwell once described the area of north County Clare from which I come as not having enough water to drown a man, enough earth to bury a man or enough wood to hang a man.  We could do with more trees, therefore.  Trees breath air and energy into our society.  They are a natural beauty and a fundamental and wonderful part of nature.</p><p>The system of planting trees needs to be fundamentally reformed.  If one wishes to build a house, thereby putting an object on the landscape, one applies for planning permission, posts a site notice and places an advertisement in the newspaper.  A five-week period is provided so that people can make submissions on the application.  The planner will analyse the submissions and both the applicant and the people who make submissions have the right to appeal a decision.  Unfortunately, that process does not apply to people who wish to plant trees.  Like houses, trees are objects that can be very destructive and dangerous if they are not planned properly.  Houses that are properly built can be beautiful and provide homes for people.  Forests that are planted properly are also beautiful and can provide great leisure opportunities and a valuable natural resource.  However, forestry has to be done properly.</p><p>The Minister of State has a duty of care to ensure that proper procedures are put in place in respect of people who apply to plant trees.  Unfortunately, the only obligation currently is to publish applications on a website.  There is no obligation to post a site notice of the intention to plant the land or to put an advertisement in the paper.  People who may find themselves living near a new plantation have no proper procedure through which to make objections.  If a decision is made to permit a plantation, there is no avenue of appeal.</p><p>I have dealt with a number of constituents who found themselves in a situation whereby forestry projects proceed without any consideration for the impact on them, apart from a very basic level.  Some inspector will attach special conditions but as a rule this does not happen.  People can find that a forest effectively surrounds their houses beyond the statutory 50 m space in which trees cannot be planted.  People who were previously living in open countryside have found themselves living in the middle of a forest.  This is not good enough.</p><p>We are living in a period when transparency and accountability are demanded on a regular basis.  Unfortunately, however, there is no such openness in regard to forestry plantation.  When it comes to making representations as Members of the Oireachtas, depending on the officials with whom we engage, we get co-operation in some cases but no co-operation whatsoever in many others because, unlike officials in planning authorities, they have no legal obligation to engage with us.</p><p>We have a lot of work to do if we are to be fair to those who wish to plant their land, the environment, those of us who are tree huggers and love trees, and the people who find themselves living beside plantations.  I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's thoughts on this issue.  He will have ample opportunity on Committee and Report Stages to introduce amendments that reflect the concerns I have raised.</p></speech>

Opposition Members have been very helpful in steering this Bill in a helpful direction.  It is all about timber and trees.  There is something very special about trees and their connection to the environment.  When I took over this position a little more than 12 months ago, my knowledge of forestry came from the area in which I lived.  Growing up in a rural area, I saw trees being planted and felled for mills like Dundrum, where 20 people worked.  While the mill in Dundrum has since closed, forestry is now a vibrant industry with huge potential.  Therein lies some of the issues, which I will raise in a general manner rather than respond to individual Senators because we will be able to discuss these issues in more depth on Committee and Report Stages.  Senator Barrett raised specific issues which I hope to be able to discuss in detail on later Stages.</p><p>The importance of forestry to the economy has been outlined by several speakers.  Senator Landy spoke about Coillte and the Government decision not to sell it.  I was delighted that the Government took that decision and it was widely supported by the Irish public for many reasons.  One of the issues that tends to escape commentators' notice is the huge potential for tourism and recreation.  One speaker raised the issues of obesity and amenities for children.  The Department is forthright in encouraging this use of forests.  Coillte and everybody else who is engaged in the industry want to make the land available so that people can enjoy fresh air and learn about trees.  As Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, I encourage schools to get involved with us in terms of visiting their local forests.  Senator Conway spoke about Kilkenny's victory in the all-Ireland last Sunday.  Big and small occasions could be marked by planting a tree.  We should be more forthright in using trees and the environment in this way.  I am the oldest of a family of ten.  My father planted a beech tree when each of us were born.  He is dead and gone but the trees are still there and they will be there when I am dead and gone.  There is a special story in trees and in our environment and we should encourage this at every level.</p> <p>We should encourage it at every level.  I will encourage it while I remain in this position.</p><p>I wish to address some general issues such as ash dieback and land availability.  Senator Landy spoke about good land but the reality is there are large amounts of marginal land across the country.  A land availability committee has been set up under Nuala N&iacute; Fhlatharta from Teagasc, which is currently examining what land can be made available for forestry in the future.  There are reasons one cannot plant forestry on certain types of land.  Last night I attended a meeting with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and departmental officials, on hen harriers.  Last week Nuala N&iacute; Fhlatharta reported to us on the land that could be made available.  The figure is astonishing.  A total of 180,000 ha of land could be made available if we changed practices.  The report is not fully complete but I hope to have it by Christmas in order to make extra land available, to lift some restrictions and to encourage people who own land to consider forestry.</p><p>The hen harrier is a problem that must be addressed.  The extra land that could be made available is significant when one considers that we plant in the region of 66,500 ha of forestry each year.  I expect some movement in terms of potential land availability in the coming months, certainly by early next year, in particular when the new forestry programme that is out for consultation has concluded.  We received many views on the issue.  We must go to Europe with the programme in the coming months.</p><p>We must be able to reassure people who commit to forestry because it is a significant commitment.  One does not just make up one&rsquo;s mind to get involved in forestry over night; it involves a 20-year or 30-year commitment and then one must replant.  It is a decision that impacts on future generations, which is not easy, because it is possible to change from dairy to beef production in a year.  Land owners are used to such change.  The reason for the introduction of the Bill is to make it easier and more accessible to get involved in forestry and to reassure those who make the decision to get involved that they are protected.  We will try to deal with land availability in the coming months.</p><p>Taxation is an issue.  There is no doubt people were encouraged to go into forestry for tax reasons.  Currently, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is carrying out a review.  Submissions have been made to him and I hope we will come to a conclusion that will help forestry.  The approach on taxation was designed to encourage participation and I wish that to remain the case.  However, change is required.  There must be a levelling of the playing field over a period when clearfell takes place and money has been received for one year.  I have written to the Minister for Finance on the matter and spoken to him personally and I hope the issue will be resolved.  That might happen given the improved economic climate.</p><p>Another concern raised by many speakers is ash dieback.  I acknowledge the work of my late predecessor, Shane McEntee, who was most committed to resolving the situation.  Such was his concern that the problem appeared to affect him.  We constantly monitor the situation.  The disease has been dealt with on plants where it was identified.  That approach will continue.  Dieback is removed where it is found in a plantation.  I agree with what Senator Landy said, namely, that it might not be possible to clearfell all forestry and that the focus will be on removing the affected plants.  Older plants are not affected by ash dieback.  The disease is confined to imported stock.  We encourage people to use native-grown species not imported plants.  Ongoing work is carried out in conjunction with the GAA.  Last Saturday I met an official in Croke Park and it is intended to have more meetings with him to deal with the matter.  The problem could become a major one but we continue to monitor the situation.</p><p>Senator Naughton referred to licences.  Extensive discussions were held with the farming organisations.  I put significant effort, in conjunction with spokespersons in the D&aacute;il, in trying to come to an agreement that felling licences would be processed within four months.  It was a considerable job, not least in terms of convincing officials, because of the lack of resources in the Forest Service due to the economic climate.  I well understand the situation.  However, we did set a timeframe for it, and in the same way as planning permission is dealt with, felling licences are to be processed within four months.  I welcome the measure, which is included in the Bill.</p><p>I wish to work with the Seanad on the details raised in connection with the Bill.  We received much support in the other House from spokespersons.  I also acknowledge the support and help of farming organisations, the forest owners association, mill owners and everyone involved in the healthy and lively discussions that were most worthwhile.  Ultimately, when the Bill is passed by both Houses and signed into law, we will be in a far better position.  As a Parliament we will have made our mark in terms of forestry in the future.  I wish to see the forestry sector develop and grow.  There is potential for that all over the country.  Commitment to forestry is evident.</p><p>I agree with what a speaker said about education.  There are many ways in which to reach young people.  Two weeks ago when I was launching a product in County Laois I met young people who are training to be foresters.  They hope jobs will be available in the Forest Service or in a private company involved in planting land.  There is also great potential in the milling industry.  We have a most efficient milling industry.  There are numerous opportunities given the many items one can make with or carve out of wood.  The forestry industry is a good news story.  I sincerely thank all those who have helped to progress the Bill to date.  I look forward to working with the Seanad on the remaining Stages of the Bill.  The proposed change will be for the good of those involved in the industry.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 delete the definitions of &quot;alternative valuation&quot;, &quot;determined valuation&quot; and &quot;current valuation list&quot;.  The definitions of &quot;alternative valuation&quot; and &quot;determined valuation&quot; are no longer required as a consequence of proposed changes to the provisions dealing with occupier assisted valuation.  The definition of &quot;current valuation list&quot; is deemed to be superfluous and has the potential to cause confusion, given that there can only be one valuation list at any one time and for which there is an adequate definition in the Act.<br/>Amendment No. 5 makes the following three changes.  First, the definition of &quot;material change of circumstances&quot; is extended to include relevant property becoming licensed or ceasing to be licensed under the licensing Acts 1833 to 2011.  Second, a definition of &quot;officer of the commissioner&quot; is inserted.  This term encompasses persons who are in the employment of the Valuation Office and also persons who are engaged by the Commissioner of Valuation on contract as part of an external service provision or outsourcing arrangement.  This definition is needed to ensure functions assigned to officers of the commissioner throughout the Act can also be carried out by persons engaged to work on an outsourced basis on behalf of the commissioner.  Third, the definition of &quot;rating authority&quot; inserted by the Local Government Reform Act 2014 is extended to include Inland Fisheries Ireland and to state that the functional area of Inland Fisheries Ireland is the State and its territorial waters.<br/>Amendment No. 6 deletes the definition of &quot;substituted valuation&quot; as this term is no longer used in the proposed changes to Part 5A dealing with the occupier assisted valuation.  This amendment also changes the definition of &quot;value&quot; which is a technical tidying-up amendment resulting from changes made to the Valuation Act 2001 in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

The proposed amendments are very broad and would potentially exempt a very large number of organisations and would probably exempt many entities that it does not intend to exempt.  While I understand what the Senator is trying to achieve by the amendments, they raise a number of serious questions.  What sporting entities would be exempt?   Let me give an example.  Does it mean or could it have the unintended consequence that Croke Park and the Aviva stadium would be exempt except for their bar areas?  These stadia are used as conference centres also and are in competition with other venues that would not be exempt.  What about high end golf clubs?  These are also sporting entities.  There is the issue of commercial gyms.  Exempting any not-for-profit club venue could have significant implications that I do not feel have been thoroughly considered in these amendments.  As Members will be aware, the Government has proposed an amendment to this area which I believe is a balanced extension of the current exemption available to sport clubs and which we will deal with later in the debate.  I regret that I cannot accept the amendments.</p></speech>

Essentially it is the same as our Bill which the Government accepted in the D&aacute;il, so will my amendment be accepted, given that it would do the job?  The Government amendment seems quite lengthy and complicated.  Amendment No. 3 would just exempt the part of a club that is not licensed.  The Government amendment does not go as far as what is proposed in this amendment because the Government amendment includes places such as parts of the club that would be rented out to other sport clubs.  Amendment No. 3 is very simple.  It demarcates the licensed area of a club, which will be available on a map for the pub licence for the purposes of the club, and exempts everything else.  Is it correct to state the Minister of State is not going as far as that?</p></speech>

The Private Members' Bill had its Second Stage debate in the D&aacute;il on 4 July 2014.  In the course of that debate, the response delivered on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform pointed out the technical flaws in what was proposed.  We acknowledged the intent of the Bill, however, while recognising the technical flaws in it, and we committed to taking a look at it in our Valuation Bill.</p><p>We do not believe the proposed amendment would work in practice and I will outline the reason.  In summary, once a club is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, it is registered in its entirety.  It is not possible to distinguish between parts of the club where alcohol can be sold and parts where it cannot.  The amendment would not give relief to sports clubs as intended.  I will propose a separate amendment to Schedule 4 to address this issue.</p></speech>

My understanding was that there is a map of licensed premises, as there usually is with any application for licensing.  It sets out the usual red line.  If the Minister of State is indicating that is incorrect, I will accept it, but what he is proposing would not go as far as we intended or what Government Deputies are advertising in their local newspapers.  It is a bit more complex than that.  I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

That amendment will go further than the <i>status quo</i>and ensure that only commercial activity within a sports club is rateable.  That is not the current position.  A map does not delineate the licensed area but is rather used for other purposes.  Under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act 1904, the club would be registered in its entirety.  We have a genuine technical concern that Senator Byrne's amendment, if we accepted it, would result in the <i>status quo</i>and it would not be workable.  The amendment I will introduce later will strike the right balance between acknowledging the fact that sports clubs are playing a major part in communities and that we wanted to go further in giving them an exemption.  We also want to ensure that the parts with commercial activity are rateable.<br/>The Senator and I are aware that in our respective constituencies, as in small towns and rural villages everywhere, there may be a bar in a GAA club and one across the road that is not part of the club.  It is important to have parity in such circumstances.  Commercial activity will be rateable but other activities will not.  Guidelines will be published by the Valuation Office in that regard.  I understand very much what the Senator is seeking to do and I acknowledge the role played by Deputy Cowen and Fianna F&aacute;il in trying to get to this point.  For technical reasons, I cannot accept the Senator's amendment and I see the Government amendment as striking the right balance.</p></speech>

The vast majority of clubs throughout the country were not there in 1904.  At that time, a club probably referred to an exclusive gentleman's establishment, which would be quite different from the community-based institutions encountered in the Minister of State's area in Wicklow or Senator Byrne's area in Meath.  Perhaps this could be borne in mind.  The clubs in mind for the 1904 Act were very strange organisations and Senator Bacik would certainly not approve of them, for example.  This can be compared to today's average GAA or soccer club around the country.</p></speech>

Although I do not wish to speak for Senator Byrne, it seems the purpose of his amendment and the Government amendment is to acknowledge that trying to fit sports clubs into the bracket of a community hall is an outdated process.  We will have the debate later but, ultimately, at the end of this debate the legislation will be a better and clearer on what is the position regarding a sports club, commercial activity or a rateable premises.</p></speech>

This seeks to make an occupier exempt from rates when he or she takes over a premises with a bill outstanding from a previous occupier.  If legislation could be changed, it would reflect reality.  There was a court case in Swords some time ago in which a judge refused to allow a judgment to be registered against an individual landed with a rates bill from a previous occupier.  That seemed reasonable and fair, and as the courts have acted in this way, we would like to insert this amendment in the legislation.</p></speech>

This is a rates issue and measures have already been taken earlier this year by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in this regard.  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 was enacted in January and introduced a range of reforms to the local government system.  It included some important measures to address some of the main issues affecting payment of commercial rates by businesses, including repeal of subsequent occupier liability.  Schedule 2 and Part 6 of the Act repeals subsequent occupier liability within rating law by amending section 71 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1838.  I know Senator Barrett will give out to me for quoting legislation from so far back.  It also deleted section 19 of the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1849, the effect of which was to remove the liability placed on new occupiers of properties for up to two years of outstanding rates of the previous occupier.</p><p>The commencement of the repeal was given effect to in the Local Government Reform Act 2014 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) (No. 2) Order of 2014, statutory instrument 146 of 2014.  It took effect from 24 March 2014.  This is a strong indication of the Government's commitment to removing any barrier to enterprise development and supporting business start-ups or existing businesses wishing to expand or relocate.  It was not the intention in removing subsequent occupier liability to undermine local authorities' collection powers and put at risk the collection of rates income.  That is why a related provision within the Local Government Reform Act 2014 indicated that all unpaid and outstanding rate liabilities should be discharged prior to the transfer of ownership or other interest in a property, including tenancy.  This transfer of interest must be notified to the local authority within two weeks of its effect.  A penalty has been provided where the owner does not meet obligations under the Act.  This measure strengthens local authority collection powers in the area without causing any additional burden for subsequent occupiers.  Furthermore, this section provides that any rates due by any owner of a relevant property and not discharged shall remain a charge on the property.  The amendment took effect from 1 July 2014.</p><p>In principle, we agree with what Senator Byrne's amendment is trying to do and we contend his aims were realised in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.</p></speech>

In page 4, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:
&ldquo;Amendment of section 9 of Principal Act
4. Section 9(11) of the Principal Act is amended by substituting for &ldquo;under this Act&rdquo; the following:&quot;under this Act, including the entering into arrangements with persons (other than officers of the Commissioner) to perform such functions or portions of such functions, including with respect to different classes of relevant properties or different geographical areas within rating authority areas&quot;.&quot;.</p></speech>

The overall purpose of the provision is to enable the commissioner to augment the internal capacity of the Valuation Office by engaging external resources.  It is an enabling provision, and initially the commissioner is expected to pilot such outsourcing in selected rating authority areas.  This amendment now gives the commissioner the flexibility, where it is deemed necessary, to restrict the functions that may be performed by external service providers to, for example, particular classes of relevant property, such as retail, office or industrial units, or that outsourcing could be restricted by geographical area within a rating authority area.</p><p>This amendment also means that section 4, as published, will be deleted.  The amendment originally envisaged for section 4 was made in the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  This needed to be done early in 2014 to ensure there would be no possibility that the valuation list would be deemed incomplete.  Heretofore, State-occupied property that was not rateable was valued.  This was an inefficient use of Valuation Office resources.  These properties were not valued as part of the Dublin city or Waterford revaluations, and this Bill will mean that if the property is not rateable, it does not have to be valued.  The amendment needed to be made in early 2014 to align what has to be done in practice with legislation.</p><p>This amendment is basically about speeding up the process of revaluation so that people can benefit from a fair and accurate valuation in a timely fashion, while recognising that we do not wish to waste the resources of a State office by having it value buildings that are not rateable.</p></speech>

Two or three years ago the issue of outsourcing was first raised, with the four Dublin local authorities and Waterford being done to date.  If we kept at this rate, we would not get to the end of valuation of properties in the State until 2029.</p> <p>The progress that has been made has been miserable.  At the time it was proposed that funding would be given to the Valuation Office to employ more people, but that did not happen and outsourcing was mentioned.  Now we are discussing giving more powers to outsource.  Has any consideration been given to self-assessment for rates?  We have accepted self-assessment for the local property tax.  The calculation of rates is laid down on paper.  I have always made this argument.  My understanding was that the rateable valuation was calculated as the best achievable rent of the property multiplied by the square footage.  The best achievable rent in properties over the past five years has more than halved but nobody has come knocking on my door to say their rates have reduced by more than 50%.  Now that outsourcing seems to be accepted, has any consideration been given to self-assessment? </p></speech>

The entire purpose of this legislation is to speed that up.  That is one of the reasons we are looking at giving the Valuation Office the ability to outsource certain tasks subject to certain provisions.  As the Senator will have seen in my remarks, we are giving the Commissioner of Valuation the ability to limit and restrict those functions to what he or she believes to be appropriate.  We intend to pilot this in Carlow and Kilkenny and if it works to continue to roll it out.</p><p>I will come to the issue of occupier-assisted valuation when we discuss amendments Nos. 31 to 37.  In this Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill we are very eager to ensure there are as many inputs as possible for occupiers to give the information they have.  This legislation will allow the Valuation Office to request certain information of the occupier, which is a step forward and to be welcomed.</p></speech>

We will get to discuss much of this during the course of this debate.  We have increased the length of time for occupiers to make representations, which is a more informal part of the appeals process than having to go all the way to a tribunal.</p><p>It is also important to give some context as to why the process has taken so long.  The Senator, as a businessman, will recognise the shock that took place in our property market has made it quite difficult to know when it is appropriate to look at valuations and revaluations.</p><p>I give credit to my officials and those in the Valuation Office.  Limerick is now nearly finished.  While the Senator is right that there is a significant amount of property left to be revalued, we now estimate that approximately 50% of the valuation base in the country has been revalued.  That equates to approximately 35% of buildings.  I am very eager that this would happen as quickly as possible so that everybody can benefit from the more modern provisions of the legislation.</p></speech>

This brings together the objectives of ensuring that values are correct in themselves and that they are correct relative to other values on the list.</p><p>The objective is to ensure that properties of equal value situated in the same rating authority pay equal amounts of rates and that one ratepayer is not given an undue competitive advantage over another.  The revaluation of a rating authority is about producing a valuation list that is fair and equitable to all ratepayers in that rating authority area.  As a result of a revaluation, properties of similar value should have a similar rates liability.  In this regard, section 19(5) brings clarity to what is required of the valuation manager when compiling a valuation list, namely, that he or she must determine the correct value for the property and that the value must also be relative to the value of comparable properties on the same valuation list.</p><p>Producing a valuation list comprising valuations that are not relative to each other would result in similar properties having different valuations and as such would result in different rates liabilities, which would give certain ratepayers a competitive advantage or disadvantage, thereby negating the benefits of a revaluation.</p></speech>

Constitutional issues have been raised over the effect of the amendment.  Later in the legislation the Valuation Tribunal is required to determine the value of a property on an appeal and one that accords with the results required to be achieved by section 19(5), the criteria the Minister of State just set out.</p> <p>It seems sensible that there be equity and uniformity of value between comparable properties and parties on the valuation list, and the Minister of State has outlined this, but various interested parties have sought legal advice on this area of the legislation.  Some of these parties have met the Minister of State to discuss this and I spoke privately to him in Oldbridge, County Meath, to alert him to difficulties with some aspects of the Bill, such as this.  Some parties believe the proposed amendment is actually a response to the Commissioner of Valuation and to the determinations of the Valuation Tribunal in a number of appeals brought by ratepayers that ended up in the High Court.  There was a famous case relating to the Carlton Hotel - in one case six ratepayers received an appeal against the certificate of value relating to their property.</p><p>The tribunal, in its determination, referred to the difficulties encountered by the Commissioner of Valuation in gathering appropriate information from other similar businesses in the area.  The tribunal noted comparative evidence was offered but was not persuaded it was decisive.  The tribunal came to a conclusion in those cases that, I am advised, would not be possible if this section is put in place.  It has been suggested to me that this new section is designed to prevent a situation like the one that arose in the Carlton Hotel case, which is responsible for many of these reforms.</p><p>We suggested that the original Bill sought to override these cases and the Minister of State's predecessors took over a year to change this.  The legal advice I have received says the amendment will achieve exactly what we objected to last time.  The new section 19(5) was designed to prevent the Valuation Tribunal from operating as it did in those cases.  If the Commissioner of Valuation applies a particular method during a revaluation of properties such as hotels, licensed premises, petrol stations, nursing homes and other properties where the net annual value is not readily ascertainable by comparison with the rents of similar properties, a ratepayer who, with expert evidence, challenges the method chosen by the commissioner in an appeal to the tribunal will be met with the reply that, if the commissioner's chosen method is set aside and another method is applied by the tribunal to achieve a more accurate result, it will distort the uniformity of value between the ratepayer's property and the properties of those who chose not to appeal.  It is difficult to understand why a ratepayer who has appealed against a valuation should be placed at a disadvantage because other ratepayers may have failed or neglected to appeal.</p><p>I thank the various hotels and organisations that challenged the rate valuations in Fingal because they achieved something, namely, this legislation.  We now wish to make sure the legislation does not prevent such challenges in future.  The effect of this provision would be to prevent such cases proceeding.  A ratepayer would be able to challenge the application of the commissioner's chosen method of valuation but not the method itself.  I suggest that the effect of the proposed section 19(5) is almost identical to what I objected to before and I understood this was going to be changed.  I suggest that what is proposed is unconstitutional for the same reason that I objected previously.  The Minister of State needs to re-examine this, though I know much work has gone into it.  Assurances were given that issues such as this would not arise so it needs to be looked at.  Perhaps the Minister or Minister of State could meet the various interested parties as they are representatives of affected businesses around the country with no hidden agendas.  I will oppose this section and I ask the Minister of State to think again.</p></speech>

As I outlined previously, providing a valuation list that comprises valuations that are not relative to each other, results in similar properties having different valuations, which results in different rate liabilities in the same area.  This puts certain ratepayers at a competitive advantage or disadvantage over other people in the same geographic rateable area.  It is only appropriate that when an appeal is being assessed the same criteria as applied in the original valuation be used.<br/>When the Valuation Tribunal allows an appeal under section 37 with a view to amending the valuation, it will be required to do so in accordance with section 19(5).  In essence, the Valuation Tribunal is placed in a similar position to the valuation manager when determining the value of a particular property.  I think it would be peculiar to have the Valuation Tribunal applying different criteria to those used by the valuation manager to make the original valuation and I cannot think of an appeals process that works like that.  The objective is to ensure that the valuation manager and the Valuation Tribunal, on appeal, apply the same criteria when determining values.<br/>The Valuation Tribunal is in exactly the same position as the valuation manager in that it must look at the information and data that was available to the valuation manager and form its own conclusions as to the correctness, or otherwise, of that valuation.  Where a valuation is incorrect it can be changed by the Valuation Tribunal.  The tribunal has extensive powers that are set out in Part 7 of the Valuation Act but both criteria must be weighted by the Valuation Tribunal.  It would be inappropriate that the Valuation Tribunal, on appeal, would assess a valuation on different terms and by reference to different criteria from those considered by the valuation manager.  It is also appropriate that ratepayers who appeal their valuations to the Valuation Tribunal and those who do not appeal have the values of their properties ultimately determined by reference to identical criteria, in other words, the criteria now set out in this section.  Any other approach could result in a most unsatisfactory outcome.<br/>Senator Byrne has alluded to the Carlton judgment and I wish to put its conclusions on the record of this House.  I will refer to extracts taken from the judgment of Ms Justice O'Malley, delivered on 11 April 2013.  In her conclusion she stated &quot;it seems to me that both sides are in error to the extent that they are each seeing one part of the picture&quot;.  She went on to say: <blockquote>The Commissioner is certainly correct in saying that uniformity and equity are essential to the administration of the rating system, as they are in relation to any tax.  Like must be treated alike.However, there is a logically prior issue and that is whether liability to the tax in question has been properly assessed in the first place. There is no merit in the uniform application of a mistake.</blockquote>She continued:<blockquote>I also cannot accept the contention that, under the Act, uniformity and the tone of the list have no role.  It would, again, render the terms of section 31 an absurdity.</blockquote>We are trying to get a balance between the correct value and equity and the tone of the list.  We have consulted widely on this legislation, as the Senator acknowledged, and received a submission from the Society of Chartered Surveyors, much of which was encompassed in this section.  If there is an opportunity for further engagement between now and Report Stage I would be happy to take it.  My officials are in contact with the Irish Hotels Federation and we want to get this legislation right, though we also want to account for both equity and correct valuation.</p></speech>

If a person is told the correct value cannot be examined due to the uniformity issue he or she will find that questionable.  These amendments were made late in the day, after the consultation process ended, and the tribunal will be hamstrung.  It will not really deal with appeals but rather mistakes made in the office.  The question will not be whether the wrong procedure was used and the Carlton and Roganstown cases will be undermined by this legislation, which is a pity.  There will be more cases before the courts because people will feel it is not fair that the correct valuation is not being considered.  The correct valuation may be overlooked to allow for equity and uniformity of value.  All properties will thus have an incorrect valuation and that is wrong and unconstitutional.</p></speech>

It is not correct that the tribunal will have to choose one legislative provision or the other.  The tribunal will have to give account of both and that is the balance we are trying to establish.  I reiterate, it is very important that when a valuation manager assesses a value the criteria he applies to do so, the two set out, are the same as those used in an appeals process.</p> <p>There should not be a scenario in which, if one appeals a valuation, one gets assessed on a valuation rate using a different set of criteria from those that apply to a business person who has decided not to appeal a valuation.  There must be consistency in the process.</p><p>With my officials, I would be happy to engage with stakeholders before Report Stage, but I am satisfied that this section strives to get the correct balance while also acknowledging, as outlined in the High Court, the need to take account of both aspects.</p></speech>

The hoteliers seem united in their opposition.  I am sure they have good grounds for doing so, all of which I might not appreciate.  I am concerned for hoteliers who are still regaining their feet.  NAMA has a few more hotels to sell and so on, but we appreciate all that hoteliers have suffered and what they are doing now to expand tourism and attract more visitors from abroad.  I feel for them.  They have communicated with me.</p><p>The Minister of State is a highly considerate man whose talents and expertise in this field I appreciate.

Like every Senator from the great tourism county of Kerry, he is right to be concerned about the hospitality sector, as we all are in this and the Lower House.  We have taken many measures to try to help the sector.</p><p>It would not be correct to claim that we were not taking account of data.  When discussing previous amendments, I made it clear that we were using new technology to ensure that we had the most information available to the Valuation Office.  It is important to point out that a number of hotels have already benefited from the revaluation process.  The valuation base is remaining the same.  For every valuation that increases, another will decrease.  The pie is not being increased in size.  Rather, it is being redistributed in a fair manner to reflect current valuations.  The data indicate that 50-55% of ratepayers have received reduced valuations.  As a businessman, Senator Coghlan will appreciate the importance of ensuring fairness.  This is the balance that was found in the High Court.  Everyone has an entitlement to a correct value, but it must be cognisant of other values of a similar nature in the same rateable area.  It is important that some hotels and commercial interests are not placed at a disadvantage.  There must be equity and correct values.</p><p>Crucially, the valuation manager will apply these criteria at the initial point.  To apply a different set of criteria at the point of appeal would be in effect to begin a different valuation process, not an appeal.  This could disadvantage those who did not appeal in the first instance.</p></speech>

It should have been abolished and replaced by a site valuation tax when the Government introduced the property tax.  I believe that was the Government's intention.  It certainly was the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government's intention.</p><p>It will not matter if there is an incorrect value on a property, as that is not the only criterion.  The Minister of State is right to point out that it is a case of and, not or, as long as everyone with a similar property has an incorrect valuation.  If the valuation for every petrol station in the area is wrong, it does not matter as long as those properties are similar.  That is the effect of the section.  However, this is not the way to tax people.  They should pay what they owe.  The section does not help.  Rather, it creates further confusion and will undoubtedly lead to more cases in the High Court.  They will involve not just having decisions quashed but also questioning the constitutionality of this legislation.  We are charging a tax, a rate, and the matter must be taken in the most serious way.</p><p>It is a pity, as rates should be handled by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, not the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I often wondered why rates used to be handled by the Department of Finance when they comprise a jobs issue, in that they form one of the key costs affecting businesses.</p><p>Although I will oppose this amendment strongly, I ask the Minister of State to take time to consider the matter, although not as long as the last time, even if that was not his fault.  The Bill has been on the Order Paper since August 2012.  Business people are crying out for reform of their rates because they cannot afford to pay them.  To achieve a resolution, will the Minister of State engage in short and sharp consultations with the bodies that represent the businesses that will be affected?</p></speech>

Currently, these dates are one in the same.  The separation of the dates allows time for appeals to be heard and minimises losses in rates revenue for local authorities.  Both of these amendments are needed to clarify which date is being referred to.  The first is an amendment to clarify that it is the publication date specified in section 21(1) of the principal Act that shall not be later than three years after the commissioner makes a valuation order.  This removes any ambiguity that may have surrounded the word "date" when used without qualification.</p><p>The second amendment is to section 56 of the Act, which section empowers the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to limit the aggregate rates collected in a rating authority area in the year following a revaluation.  This is an important power as it assures ratepayers that revaluation is not about increasing rates but rather is about a fairer distribution of the rates burden based on modern valuations.  The amendment is a technical change to the definition of &quot;appropriate year&quot; to reflect the change proposed for section 21 of the Act which would allow for a separation of the publication date and the effective date.</p></speech>

This is a practical measure which streamlines the procedures for correction by the valuation manager.  In other words, the commissioner's chief operating officer may correct any errors that may occur in the valuation process, including the correction of an error in the valuation of a property.

We have seen in recent times where an error was made in respect of which the commissioner had to accept responsibility even though the mistakes was, possibly, made by the valuation manager.  If a valuation manager makes a correction, will the buck stop with him or her or will it stop with the commissioner?</p></speech>

Currently, there is no provision for the correction of an error prior to publication.  For example, if a valuation certificate issued today contained an error and that error was not corrected prior to the publication date, the occupier would not have simple recourse in terms of having that error rectified.  We are speaking in this regard of clerical errors which can be amended by the valuation manager rather than having to go through the reserved function of the commissioner.  It is a practical measure which speeds up efficiencies and assures occupiers that where errors occur they can be corrected in a speedy manner in advance of a list being published, following which they would have to go through a more complex process.</p></speech>

Clerical errors occur all the time.  The difficulty is the definition of clerical error and whether this presents an opportunity for someone to take advantage and identify a mistake as a clerical error when clearly it is not.  The question regarding responsibility is important given the existence of a commissioner.  We are probably all<i>ad idem</i>on the spirt of this proposal.  What is at issue is how precisely what is proposed would happen.  Practicality should be part of this debate.</p></speech>

The error has no consequence until the list is published.  In other words, if we can fix an error before the list is published, the occupier has not been disadvantaged and the valuation is correct.  Obviously, the commissioner and Valuation Office will continue to be responsible for the operation of services.  For want of a more parliamentary phrase, the buck will stop with the head honcho.  As I said, the error has no consequence until the list is published.  What we are trying to do is ensure that where an error occurs it can be amended as quickly and speedily as possible.  That is important.</p><p>Senator O'Keeffe asked what safeguards are in place.  I am satisfied that this legislation, in terms of the safeguards it puts in place around ensuring correction valuations, is robust.  It also provides for a valuation tribunal.  I am confident that the legislation is robust and that there are enough safeguards in place to ensure that we can stand over the integrity of the system.  I think it is important that if an error is made in a valuation that the occupier can be confident that the error can be amended in advance of a list being published.  </p></speech>

What is the problem that is being corrected?  Have there been many delays as a result of a problem in this area and have people been disadvantaged in that regard?  I do not want to be critical of Ministers or officials but it must be remembered that this is a tax we are placing on people.  It is a heavy burden on people.  While the intention is to ensure things are run better this must be done carefully.</p><p>I would like to know what the problem is that is being corrected.  Also, what does clerical error mean?  There is no definition in this regard in the Bill.  I would like to see such a definition included.  I wonder about this section.</p></speech>

We agreed an amendment earlier in relation to allowing the commissioner restrict what can be outsourced and so on.  It is important to note that we are not providing that anybody can tamper with a certificate but rather that a valuation officer, who is the person tasked with carrying out a valuation, can do so.  We are seeking to provide that where an error is made on a certificate which arrives in an occupier's place of business - the error might be a wrong description of a premises or a numerical error which could have resulted in the actual valuation not being correctly transposed into the valuation certificate - the error can be corrected without having to go back to the commissioner.  This legislation is all about speeding up the process and making it more efficient and modern while allowing an element of outsourcing.  We are making provision for the correction of an error by the valuation manager.  I think I have said all I can at this stage.</p></speech>

My problem with this legislation in general is that all these little provisions with which we are dealing &ndash; and I have been alerted to the Schedule which is to be inserted &ndash; seem to be reactions to court cases in which the Commissioner of Valuation has lost and the Government is trying to get the provision in through legislation.  This is the argument I made in the previous debate we had where we had to vote.  I do not know the origin of this and I am wondering; that is all.</p></speech>

As Senator Mullins said, there is nothing sinister in it.  The Bill is about modernising our valuation system and, where possible, helping the ratepayer.  Thankfully, as my officials inform me, there are very few instances of this.  While I do not have statistics to hand, it is not a widespread problem.  However, any of us could encounter a situation in our constituencies whereby somebody receives a valuation certificate that is incorrect and under current law there is no recourse for such a person other than to go to the Commissioner of Valuation.  We are suggesting a streamlining measure to assist a ratepayer who, as the Senator said, is already paying a tax to the State, in having the error rectified at the lowest possible place, which is the valuation manager.</p></speech>

The section also provides for an amendment to section 26(3) to enable the valuation manager, if he or she thinks it appropriate to do so, to amend the terms of the proposed valuation certificate, regardless of whether or not representation was received.</p><p>Amendment No. 17 proposes to amend section 26(2) of the 2001 Act by making specific reference to the proposed value.  The objective is to ensure a comprehensive and extensive examination of all material facts can be carried out at the representation stage of the valuation cycle and for the avoidance of any doubt as to whether this can include consideration of the amount of the proposed valuation.  The increase from 28 to 40 days of the period during which representations may be lodged is contained in the Bill as initiated.  This extension will afford ratepayers a reasonable and longer period in which to consider whether making representations is warranted or to provide them with more time to make their submissions.</p><p>It is proposed to amend section 10 of the Bill so as to provide the valuation manager with flexibility to ensure the valuation list published under section 23 is as robust as possible.  To achieve this, the following measures are required.  Where the valuation manager exercises his or her powers it is also considered necessary that the valuation manager be empowered to ensure subsequent proposed valuation certificates regarding the same property where he or she forms the view that it is appropriate or necessary to amend the original or previous proposed certificates issued.  It is also proposed that where the valuation manager considers it necessary to do so, he or she may issue a new proposed valuation certificate arising from the subdivision or amalgamation of relevant properties for which a proposed valuation certificate may or may not have already been issued.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the valuation manager considers it necessary, he or she may increase or decrease the valuation of a relevant property.</p></speech>

Hypothetically, if a property of 3,000 sq. ft. is subdivided into two commercial units of 1,000 sq. ft. leaving one third unused, would the two properties pay the full rate on the full valuation of the 3,000 sq. ft. unit?</p></speech>

In such a case, the rates would be divided three ways.  Where the valuation manager considers it necessary to do so, he or she may issue a new proposed valuation certificate arising from the subdivision or amalgamation of relevant properties for which a proposed valuation certificate may or may not already have been issued.  The valuation manager has the ability to issue a valuation certificate, whether or not one has already been issued regarding a subdivision or amalgamation.  In the situation the Senator described, where a property is divided in three, three separate valuation certificates would apply.  Does that answer the question?</p></speech>

The valuation manager has the ability to issue a certificate.  As I said, the 3,000 sq. ft. unit would be divided into two units which would account for only 2,000 sq. ft. of the former property.

The valuation will still stand, but will be apportioned to each of the individual units.  If 1,000 sq. ft. is not being used, the valuation of it will be assigned to the occupier or owner of it and a valuation certificate will be assigned to each of the other two.

Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each local authority.  Forf&aacute;s has concluded that, as property tax, commercial rates should not discriminate between businesses based on performance.  As part of a balanced taxation system, other taxes are more appropriately designed to account for business performance, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and labour taxes.  The role of the Commissioner of Valuation and this Bill, as distinct from other potential pieces of legislation, is to put a value on a property, which is subsequently used in the calculation of the rates due.  The Commissioner of Valuation does not collect rates.  This legislation governs the valuation process, not the rates process, and we cannot mix the two in one piece of legislation.</p></speech>

We are proposing a reasonable provision to include some sort of ability to pay clause.  I understand that such a provision exists in the United Kingdom.  Why can we not have one here?  Has the Department considered this issue?  On the last occasion we discussed it with either the former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Brian Hayes, MEP, or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, there was an indication that the issue would be investigated.  I understand that the revenue implications need to be carefully considered but this is a serious issue.  Rates create a significant cost for businesses and are probably the highest fixed cost after rent.  It is possible to renegotiate the rent and reduce staffing and pay costs but businesses cannot change their rates bill.  The reality is that many county councils are not collecting rates because people simply cannot pay them.  One might think the country is coming out of recession but the unemployment rate is still over 11%.  A considerable number of people are struggling and the Government should give serious consideration to this amendment because it responds to a need that I am sure has been expressed to the Minister of State in his constituency clinics.</p></speech>

However, businesses also have a right to expect local government and that the people we elect in local elections will make decisions which reflect ability to pay.  This Government has increased the base of revenue for local authorities.  We have seen how councillors have made decisions in recent days about reducing or increasing the property tax.  I am pleased that the rate has been reduced in my county.  These are the decisions that people have to make in regard to how they want to run their local authorities and fund services.  Where the burden should fall, be it on businesses or households, or how it is spread is a matter for local authorities.</p><p>This Bill attaches a value to each building.  It is up to councillors, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to consider the rates to be applied.  We provide the valuations in a clear manner and in accordance with market rates, taking into context the value of other similar properties in the area.  The rate or cost to business is applied by local government.  Many fine people serve in local government and it is up to them to make those decisions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1163" speakername="Tom Shehan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100029#EE00300"><p>In regard to the ability to pay and the calculation of rates, a supermarket comprising 4,000 sq. ft. with 20 staff, a turnover of &euro;2 million, gross profit of 10% and net profit of 4%, can be levied with a rate of &euro;8,000 per annum.  On the other hand, a professional operating out of two rooms with a turnover of &euro;1.5 million per annum might pay &euro;300.  I have long argued that the calculation of rates should have a connection to turnover.  The turnover should be reflected in the rates.  As has been noted earlier, I do not think many of us can give examples of rates being reduced.</p><p>A lot of people who would like to get into business are being pushed away by the fixed costs.  Last year or the previous year, a county manager showed initiative by reducing the rates in regard to an area of a town with no commercial activity for a period of two years.  Businesses which are struggling with increasing bank charges and other expenses should be helped in some way.  Previously, some local authorities set rates that reflected businesses' accounts but I understand that the ability to do this has been removed.  I do not think that was the best thing to do but I join my colleague, Senator Byrne, in asking the Minister of State to consider this issue.  It is often the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  Many business people are not taking a wage because they want to pay the rates and the water bills, along with everything else.  They need to be given some breathing space or a light at the end of the tunnel along the lines of ability to pay.</p></speech>

I am not inclined to link rates to turnover because I believe there should be a link between rates and profitability.  One could have a high turnover and tight margins.  While the Bill deals with the issue of valuations, I hope that valuations reflect the changing situation in towns that have been decimated as a result of the recession or because major multinationals have moved in and sucked the heart and life out of the town centres by establishing large supermarkets on the outskirts.  I come from a town which has lost 1,000 industrial jobs over the last seven or eight years.  Three major multinationals have located on the outskirts of the town and they sucked life and business out of the centre.  Businesses are struggling as a result.  I hope that when valuations are carried out in that town, they will reflect the significant reduction in footfall and business.</p><p>I agree with the Minister of State that it is a matter for the local authority to decide whether hardship or economic capacity should be taken into consideration.  Some local authorities have shown initiative in providing incentives for certain parts of towns to attract new businesses.  I hope that continues and that the newly elected local authority members will be more proactive and innovative in how they structure their finances.</p></speech>

I am sympathetic to the point being made on all sides of the House regarding the pressures on businesses, which I have observed in my own county.  However, the Bill allows us to fix the way in which we value a building and the letting value of that building.  Revaluation will go some way towards addressing the issues raised by Senator Mullins.  The revaluation process in the towns and villages around the country will take into account the potential lease value of a building.  If a town has been decimated during difficult economic times, the revaluation process will assist by establishing a more up-to-date valuation on its buildings.  Rates are somewhat linked to profitability for the same reason, albeit indirectly.  The letting value of a property is indirectly linked to the potential profit that a tenant or occupier hopes to make from occupying the property.  The impact on the letting value is based on the potential for profitability.  It is important to note that profitability can vary significantly within and between sectors, such as retail, fuel sales and hospitality.</p> <p>There are some important points here that must be heard clearly and loudly within local authorities, as they make their decisions in the run-up to their budgets, as well as in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in respect of the commercial rate system as a whole.  This legislation is trying to set a value as to how the actual charge is levied and how they arrive at that charge is a matter for local authorities in the first instance.</p></speech>

This amendment has set out clear and restrictive criteria on how to deal with this.  It is not good enough to wash one's hands of it and to state that local authorities make such decisions, because they do not.  Local authorities depend entirely on funding from central government.</p></speech>

They cannot do anything and even what they could spend the property tax revenue on was set out.  The rates are there but were the local authorities to reduce their rates at present, there would be nothing left and they would get nothing back from central government.  They cannot move and they cannot touch anything.  The idea that local authorities are free to tax and spend as they like is completely wrong, as they have various statutory obligations.  This is a big issue and is a cost that cannot be changed.</p><p>Colleagues here have stated that some local authorities allow this or have something available from which people can benefit.  However, this is not the case with all local authorities and no standard exists.  This amendment would set the standard and as for the idea that because this Bill is connected to valuation, Members therefore should not discuss this or it is not relevant, had that been the case, it would have been decided on by the Cathaoirleach.</p></speech>

County and city councillors have a decision to make on whether they wish to keep all of it at the same national rate or to vary it downwards or upwards by anything between 0% and 15% and then they get to make decisions.</p><p>A great many people in many parties ran in elections because they wished to have an impact on their communities.  While I acknowledge it has been difficult for people to pay, the local property tax now provides local authorities with the ability to make decisions.  This decision was made in my native county of Wicklow, which would have been approximately &euro;3 million better off with the property tax this year.  However, the county councillors took a decision, which I believe to have been the correct decision, to reduce the property tax rate by 15% and the council will now be only approximately &euro;800,000 better off.  Nevertheless, they are still better off.  The point I am making is they had decisions to make.</p></speech>

One could argue that it is taxing some small entrepreneurs too highly.  Consequently, I am satisfied that there already is an indirect link to rates in respect of profitability through the issue of leasing value.  I am satisfied the revaluation process will address some of the issues raised by Senator Mullins and I am satisfied that local authorities now have a new set of tools they did not have previously with regard to deciding how to spend they resources.  However, I take Senator Byrne's point about an inconsistency in respect of an application.  This issue also arose with the non-principal private residence, NPPR, charge and I take the Senator's point that it now is evident with regard to inability to pay.  I will raise this matter with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly.  There should not be an inconsistency in how councils deal with difficult situations and I will engage with my ministerial colleague in this regard.</p></speech>

However, this should all be under the local government remit and should all be considered as a whole, rather than within the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  At this stage, I consider it to be an oddity that it is under the remit of the Minister of State's Department.  This should be under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, where one could look at the overall mix together.</p></speech>

This is an issue we have already touched upon in the debate, particularly the contribution from Senator Tom Sheahan.  Before detailing specific amendments, I wish to give some background to the changes proposed for the new Part 5A.</p><p>The use of the term &quot;self-assessment&quot; has led to some confusion.  Contributors to the debate on this issue have expressed the view that ratepayers in an area that has been revalued would be disadvantaged by not being able to self-assess.  The figures I have put on the record earlier indicate that the revaluation process is well under way, with some counties completed.  It was never the intention that self-assessment would allow rate payers to determine their own valuation or even be like those who self-assess the local property tax.  Valuation for rates purposes is a very different exercise and self-assessment in this context was always going to be within tight guidelines, with the power for the commissioner to ultimately determine that valuation before it became effective.  Consultations by the Valuation Office confirmed the view that enforcement of a self-assessment regime requires considerable powers and ability to levy and collect surcharges and financial penalties.</p><p>The role of the Valuation Office is to assess liability but not collect any element of the rates or related surcharges.  Accordingly, a number of practical difficulties with the operation of this part, as originally drafted, were identified in earlier stages of this debate and are now being addressed by Committee Stage amendments.</p> <p>To avoid confusion, it is proposed to amend the heading of this part of the Bill and refer to occupier assisted valuation in future as this term more accurately reflects what will happen in practice where the Valuation Office may request occupiers to assess the valuation of their properties.  To facilitate this, the Valuation Office will provide them with indicative valuation levels based on market evidence available to the office.  Rate payers can propose a different value but it will be examined for correctness by the Valuation Office and an alternative valuation can be proposed by the commissioner, if necessary.</p><p>The Bill, as amended, will now give occupiers who provide valuations of their own properties the right to make representations where the valuations they submit are not accepted.  This is a right occupiers did not have in the Bill, as published, and, as I previously suggested, it is important that we afford occupiers the opportunity to engage in the more informal element of the appeals process, the representation stage, before taking the formal route of an appeal.  Such a participative approach has the potential to speed up the overall valuation process.  The amendments provide for the Minister to make regulations for rate payers to undertake certain functions leading to the assessment of the valuation of the premises they own or occupy, as the case may be.  The amendments also provide that the commissioner or his officer may make inquiries or seek information or records at any time to satisfy himself or herself as to the accuracy of a valuation submitted by an occupier of a property.  The officer may then enter the valuation provided on a valuation list or substitute a valuation of his or her own.</p><p>When an occupier fails to submit a valuation under this section, the valuation manager may determine the valuation of the relevant property and enter it on the valuation list.  This is important to note.  The Valuation Office is not in the business of collecting surcharges or imposing financial penalties when it is possible to avoid them but we must ensure that every property has a valuation attached to it.</p><p>Amendment No. 21 simply substitutes the word &quot;estimates&quot; for the word &quot;assesses&quot; as it is considered a more accurate term that is more in line with the terminology used throughout the Bill and principal Act.  Amendment No. 22 provides that the regulations for occupier assisted valuations will now be made by the Minister, rather than the commissioner, as was originally envisaged in the Bill, as published.  Amendment No. 23 means that regulations may cover the valuation or some of the steps comprising a valuation.  Amendment No. 24 is a minor technical change to the wording.  Amendments Nos. 25 and 27 provide for the extension of deadlines where material is submitted online or electronically.  Amendment No. 28 makes provision to restrict occupier assisted valuations to certain components of a valuation.  For example, this might mean the exclusion of particular types of specialised properties or categories of property.  Amendment No. 29 means that regulations made by the Minister may be specific to certain components of a valuation.  Amendment No. 30 provides that a published valuation list may include a combination of properties that were subject to direct assessment by the valuation manager and occupier assisted valuation by the occupier.</p></speech>

When this was published in the summer of 2012, it was welcomed as the Minster, Deputy Howlin, said this Bill "will also provide the legislative basis for carrying out a revaluation based on self-assessment".  He did not say anything about occupier assisted valuation.  It seems the Government has rowed back on this and I cannot see how it is alluded to in the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100032#HH00700"><p>I said we will refer in future to occupier assisted valuation as this term more accurately describes what will happen in practice.  The Senator has correctly quoted the Minister, Deputy Howlin, on Second Stage but we are trying to introduce a balanced system whereby the occupier can provide more information to the Valuation Office or provide an alternative valuation.  This system will allow the Valuation Office to ask the occupier to provide information.  I recognise that this is more complex than the system of self-assessment for local property tax - we have already discussed how a value is arrived at and it is a more complex process.  However, under this system an occupier will be able to submit an alternative valuation to the Valuation Office and provide information.  For example, an occupier may have information that the Valuation Office does not have relating to a change of floor size or other changes to a building.  There is an element of people providing information but this must happen within a structure.  This is why the term "occupier assisted valuation" will prevent people in other counties, whose property has already been revalued, having concerns about missing out.  Everyone will be revalued on the same basis of an occupier assisted valuation wherein the occupier can provide information, feed into the process and inform the Valuation Office of certain things.  Obviously, the scheme must operate within the guidelines laid down by the Valuation Office.</p></speech>

It seems a whole new approach has been taken that is completely different from what was announced two years ago.  This is unfortunate as the argument on Second Stage was that self-assessment would not happen all at once around the country.  Rather, it was argued that it would happen only in certain counties and we argued that it should happen nationwide.  Now it seems that the process will only be to provide assistance to the Valuation Office - that is a big change.</p></speech>

There was always an intention that the rate payer could provide his or her own valuation to the Valuation Office and this remains the case.  I am trying to be clear that there is a situation where the Valuation Office will have to assess a valuation - it need not accept a valuation that is provided.  This system is more complex than that applying to local property tax.  I do not accept that a rug has been pulled as the substance of this has not markedly changed.  We are trying to bring clarity on what we hope to achieve and how it will work.</p></speech>

It said the commissioner "may make regulations providing for the carrying out of the valuation of relevant properties".  This has now changed to "the Minister may make regulations providing for the carrying out of the valuation or the taking of one or more of the steps that comprise such valuation".  This is a massive change that goes against what the Minister, Deputy Howlin, announced two years ago.  We gave our support to this section and it was argued that it would not spread throughout the country all at once.  I think the plan was to have a test county and then apply it on a county by county basis.  This is a huge change and I appeal to my colleagues in Fine Gael to raise this matter with their parliamentary party.  The Minister has changed the name from self-assessment to occupier assisted valuation and some of these amendments make radical changes that completely alter the face of this legislation.  If the Opposition tabled such amendments, they would be ruled out of order.</p></speech>

The Senator is bringing the war into this House.  It was always intended that the occupier would have more input in the process, as was the case in earlier sections.  Profitability, turnover, ability to pay and economic developments on one or other side of town are all factors that play a part in a valuation.  I would love the opportunity to perform a self-assessment but we must be realistic.</p></speech>

I could not think of a better day to put forward my motion for the fundamental right of citizens to choose whether or not they have their water medicated with fluoride given that from today, 1 October, they are paying for it.<br/>It is inarguably a breach of the European human rights and biomedicine directive Article 1 which states, &quot;Parties to this Convention shall....guarantee everyone...respect for their integrity and other rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to the application of biology and medicine.&quot;  Article 5 states, &quot;An intervention in the health field may only be carried out after the person concerned has given free and informed consent to it.&quot;  As the Irish public has not given consent nor has it been given full information on the adverse risks, this medical intervention is in breach of these directives.  I would like to see these human rights directives become law.<br/>In March 2006 the National Research Council, an arm of the US National Academy of Scientists, issued a review of all the available literature on fluoride's health effects.  The report was written at the request of the USA's Environmental Protection Agency.  The report represented three years work of deliberations by a panel of 12 scientists who were selected for their balanced views.  It acknowledged the following adverse effects of fluoride not previously identified: thyroid impairment; type 2 diabetes - an issue that upsets the Minister as Minister for Health; dental fluorosis; arthritis; bone fractures; lowering of IQ; and brain damage, the latter especially in the presence of aluminium.  All of these effects with the possible exception of bone fractures and lower IQ can occur at one part per million, that is 1 ml per litre.<br/>Eminent scientists, doctors, toxicologists and chemists have written countless books and reports on the adverse effects and dangers of fluoride.  The Government has reviews that suggest this is perfectly safe.  The National Research Council's three year reports say it is not safe.  We all know for sure with any medical controversy we must err on the side of safety.<br/>I am not a scientist, a doctor or a chemist and never will be, but having taken the NRC's findings into my thinking and considering the countless books that have been written by these erudite academics and scientists, I am not willing to continue to risk the health of my family, who are here today, by exposing them to fluoridated water or stand here as a Senator.  I know for sure we cannot continue to take a chance.  If even one minutiae of what these scientists, doctors, books and countless studies say is correct we must cease fluoridation and remove any risk from the future health of our citizens.  I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is present but I wish the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, was present also.<br/>I might add that I believe every Irish citizen who chooses has the right not to pay Irish Water for water that is fluoridated.  I am delighted to pay for Irish water but please do not put medication in it without my permission.  Some 98% of Europe has rejected fluoridation so why are we still doing this?  It is against the law in Holland but compulsory by law in Ireland.  This makes no sense.<br/>One of us has got it terribly wrong.  I repeat my sentiment that just in case Sweden, Holland, Belgium and most recently Israel have got it right, should we not look at the issue?<br/>Why do we not have the same labelling as our American counterparts, namely, &quot;Warning, keep out of reach of children under eight years of age&quot;?  I have a tube of American toothpaste with me.  As I have stated it reads,<blockquote>Warning, keep out of reach of children under eight years of age.  If more than that used for brushing is accidentally swallowed, get medical help or contact a poison control centre right away.</blockquote>Based on this warning alone we should clearly understand that fluoride is a poison.  Under US law, the FDA's warning must be on packaging, boxes and tubes in the United States of America.  I have with me another tube of toothpaste which is Irish but does not have that warning. <br/>I absolutely love everything to do with America.  It brought fluoridation here in 1963 when it appeared to be the right thing to do. That was 51 years ago.  In the US all fluoridated toothpaste carries a poison warning.  If one swallows more than a pea sized amount, one should contact a poison control centre.  The very same toothpaste sold here has no warnings.  I ask the Minister to ask the expert group on fluoridation why our citizens are being kept in the dark about its dangers.<br/>Critically, fluoride is added to tap water at potentially toxic levels.  A glass of Irish tap water contains the same amount of fluoride as a pea sized amount of toothpaste.  I am having dinner in the restaurant tonight and I hope to see the Minister of State there.  I ask her to remember that a glass of tap water contains the same amount of fluoride as a pea sized amount in toothpaste.  Fluoride is a pharmaceutical-grade chemical that goes into the toothpaste.  We take an industrial grade from a super-factory in Spain, near the Basque region.</p> <p>Excuse me if I cannot pronounce it.  It is hydroflurosilicic acid that goes into our water. This is not quite as straightforward as fluoride.  I have left a graphic with my speech - which I am going to give to the ushers now - on the toothpaste packaging, for everyone to see.  There is nothing like seeing is believing. </p><p>On fluoride, many people have said to me, &quot;Mary-Ann, I have been brushing my teeth for years. I have been drinking water. I am fine, my children are fine&quot;.  However, it is a cumulative poison.  I want to give the Minister of State an analogy.  Think of tobacco.  Think of the Minister of State and I having a cigarette tonight.  We are not going to get lung cancer.  We are going to have to smoke for a long time before it is going to have dreadful, devastating effects on our health.  The Minister of State and I could have got a job in the shipyards in Belfast with the asbestos.  We would not have died after three months but what about had we stayed there working as others did?  After fifty years, deaths occurred.  It is the same thing with fluoride.</p><p>Fluoride is a medicine.  I tried to look at what levels of dosage we should take.  One milligramme per hour?  One milligramme every four hours or once a day?  Drugs should be prescribed by body weight.  We all know and understand that.  Those who really are affected by the nationally prescribed drug, fluoride, are vulnerable young children, who are lighter in body weight.  The Minister of State and I, if I can catch her attention for a moment, often come in here and talk about vulnerable babies.  That is what I am here to talk about this evening.  These are the people I really want her to think about.  Never mind us old codgers and Senators.  We have had our lives.  These babies are lighter in body weight and drink three to four times more liquid than adults relative to their size.  Therefore, they get three or four times more fluoride toxic effects.  As they cannot excrete fluoride, 90% of it stays in their bodies.  I am not quoting off the top of my head.  Everything I am saying has been researched and can be backed-up.  With one of the lowest breast-feeding rates in Europe, Irish mothers are feeding fluoridated water mixed with baby formula to our precious babies, their children.  </p><p>It is arguably a breach of human rights to drug a population against their will via the water system. </p></speech>

It was debated before in this House but it was quite some time ago.  I, like Senator O'Brien, do not remember a big debate about this in 1963.  It must have been a very emotional time when it was being done.  It is taking away the rights of every citizen to feed themselves with fresh water by ensuring there is something in that water.  Having studied this issue for the last week or two, I am concerned when I order a glass of water.  I am not sure whether I am drinking fluoridated water or not.  As Senator O'Brien says, if it is tap water it will contain fluoride.  I am not sure if the water in front of me is tap water.  Neither can I always be sure if the water we buy in bottles comes from a well or a tap.  I have 16 grandchildren and I know that my sons and daughters, who are concerned about the well-being of those children, are going to give much more thought to this in the future when it is brought to their attention.<br/>The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment is interesting.  Usually when an amendment is put before the House, it disagrees with the provision.  Senator O'Brien's motion is that Seanad &Eacute;ireann notes the fundamental human right of every citizen to choose whether or not to have their water medicated with fluoride given that they are from 1 October paying for it.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment seeks to delete all the words after &quot;Seanad &Eacute;ireann&quot; and substitute the following: &quot;calls for the removal of fluoride from the public water system&quot;.  One is capable of being accepted as much as the other. <br/>Senator O'Brien has spoken vividly about the figures around the world.  I have done some work on that also.  The motion is very important.  It is a huge change for citizens that we now have to pay for our water.  From a business perspective it is right that the citizen is given the opportunity to choose the type of product that they purchase.  We do not have that choice.  We purchase water but we do not have the option of non-fluoridated water.  I do not want to go through the figures Senator O'Brien has given at length but it must be emphasised that most EU countries do not add fluoride to water.  Some major and influential countries are not even allowing local authorities to make their own decision on fluoridation.  Senator O'Brien mentioned the situation in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden.  They are among the countries who have banned fluoridation altogether.  We only need to look north of the Border where there is no fluoridation.  It is interesting to see Mr. Walter Graham here tonight. He was instrumental in playing a very large part in drawing the attention of various towns in the North to the issue to the extent that they no longer have fluoridation there.  <br/>Belgium went so far as to ban tablets and chewing gum that contain fluoride over fears that they might increase the risk of brittle bone disease. There does not appear to be any worldwide movement for countries to start to add fluoride to water supplies, the opposite is the case.  Last August, Israel officially stopped adding fluoride to its water supply on the basis that it is medical treatment and people have the right to choose whether they want to be medicated.  It is interesting to consider the country with the world's largest population, China, does not add fluoride to its water supply.  These are strong examples and it is very clear that what we are doing is completely out of the norm.  Is Ireland right on the issue and the rest of Europe wrong?  There is no fluoridation in Scotland, Wales and most of England.  These other countries are not fluoridating their water on the basis of medical evidence. <br/>There is also an ethical issue when it comes to medicating a water supply.  There is a range of well documented side-effects linked to excessive fluoride use in the medical evidence.  Senator O'Brien has dealt with some of those.  I will not get involved in them but the most common is dental fluorosis which changes the appearance of teeth.  In addition, various studies have pointed to lower intelligence levels in children, an increased incidence of bone cancer in teenage boys and increased risk of bone fractures and thyroid dysfunction.  Senator O'Brien drew our attention to the tubes of toothpaste and the cartons of toothpaste for sale in America.  The example provided says: &quot;Warning: Keep out of reach of children under six years of age.  If you accidentally swallow more than used for brushing get medical help or contact a poison control centre immediately&quot;.  That is very interesting.  What is particularly interesting is that it does not apply to toothpastes that do not contain fluoride.  They do not have that warning.  In America, it is necessary to have that health warning on every tube of toothpaste that contains fluoride.  A new study published in one of the best known peer reviewed medical journals, <i>The Lancet</i>,  now labels fluoride as a development neurotoxin which could cause damage to the brain. This is due to a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and reduced IQ in children, mostly in China.  The study puts fluoride in the same category as substances such as arsenic, lead and mercury.  There are a number of interesting articles on that.  <br/>I will deal briefly with two other points.  Some 98% of the countries of Europe have rejected fluoridation.  Why are we doing it?  There is an international movement away from fluoridation. It is becoming redundant.</p> <p>It has been rejected in countries and communities around the world and fluoride is a highly poisonous substance.  Most people are unaware of how toxic it is.  There is enough fluoride in a tube of toothpaste to kill a 12-year-old child.  While Members have a great deal to do this regard and have a great deal to learn, this is the start of a debate and I hope the Minister of State will enlighten them in the time ahead, in order that they can make a decision on the subject.</p></speech>

I also welcome this debate and it is important that Members bring up such matters for review on an ongoing basis and if there are new developments in this area, Members certainly should consider them.  In the context of discussing the possibility of fluoridation causing problems, it is interesting to note that when the Act was passed in 1960, the average life expectancy in Ireland was then 69.69, whereas it is now 80.5.</p></speech>

Progress has been made and the average life expectancy is now 80.5 years in real terms.<br/>The constitutional issues are interesting and I have downloaded a copy of the case of Gladys Ryan <i>v</i>. the Attorney General.  It was dealt with by Mr. Justice Kenny and then by the Supreme Court.  Interestingly, Richie Ryan, who subsequently became Minister for Finance, acted as a solicitor for Gladys Ryan although he was not related to her.  He assembled a quite strong legal team to deal with the matter in the High Court and Supreme Court.  He had, as senior counsel, Se&aacute;n MacBride, T.J. Connolly and Seamus Egan, that is, a strong legal team to fight this question concerning the constitutional provisions.  It dealt with the Constitution under Articles 40.3, 41 and 42.  The matter of the constitutional issues was clearly argued in both the High Court and the Supreme Court.  I read an article containing an interview with Richie Ryan some years ago in which he raised the issue as to whether all the information was made available to the courts at the time.  While he raises serious concerns from that point of view, this is the case law we now have.<br/>A number of steps have been taken since 1963 and 1964, when the case was dealt with in the courts.  There have been a number of reviews on the issue and a number of recommendations were produced in a report in 2002.  Interestingly, the motion's proposer raised the issue of fluoride and the danger to children.  It is an important issue because one recommendation in the 2002 report pertained to infant formula and perhaps it is also a question of disseminating more information.  The fifth recommendation of the aforementioned report stated that infant formula should continue to be reconstituted with boiled tap water in accordance with manufacturers' instructions or that, alternatively, ready-to-feed formula could be used.  The other part of the recommendation was that the use of bottled water to reconstitute infant formula was not recommended unless the labelling indicated its suitability for such use.  I believe that report contained a total of 33 recommendations and the question is whether all of them were implemented fully and whether people are aware of them.  I believe this certainly is an issue that should be revisited.  If Members wish to consider this issue because other matters must be examined of which people must be made more aware, they certainly should do this.  They should make people aware, in the public domain, as to what are the concerns.<br/>The Irish Dental Association appears to be strongly in favour of fluoridation.  In a statement it issued it noted that it:<blockquote>strongly endorses water fluoridation as the most practical, cost effective and safe, public health measure to control the occurrence of tooth decay in Ireland.  Community water fluoridation is endorsed by the World Health Organization ... as the first choice method of providing fluoride to communities.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ... and the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environment Risks ... have also endorsed water fluoridation.  The US Surgeon General described water fluoridation as one of the top ten greatest public health measures of the twentieth century.</blockquote>I am quoting from the Irish Dental Association statement and while I do not suggest this is gospel, I note that association clearly is strongly in support of the current policy with regard to water fluoridation.<br/>If I may, I will revert to the constitutional issue, as the Gladys Ryan <i>v</i>. the Attorney General case established a strong position with regard to bodily integrity.  However, one aspect of Mr. Justice Kenny's decision in the High Court held that there is no contractual right to a piped water supply.  It stated:<blockquote>The plaintiff has no legal right to a supply of piped water and the Act of 1960 does not impose any obligation on her or on the members of her family to drink or use the water coming through the piped water supply ... the plaintiff probably has a right of access to a supply of water, but this does not give her a right to a supply of water which has not been fluoridated through the piped water supply ... I am satisfied that the plaintiff ... can, by the expenditure of a few pounds, remove all or almost all the fluoride ions from the water coming through the piped water supply.</blockquote>Members must deal with this debate in that context.  I believe the constitutional issues have been dealt with.  Members certainly must review and keep in mind constantly any developments that have occurred in recent years and make the public aware of them but I strongly support the amendment to this motion and ask my colleagues for their support on the matter.</p></speech>

For me, the jury is out on this question and I have read a considerable amount on the subject in recent weeks.  I do not like the thought of being forcibly medicated, any more than anyone else would, and I do not like the thought of anything being applied forcibly.  While I cannot support the motion in its current form, nor can I support either of the amendments, including the Government amendment.  The latter is the set-piece Government amendment and when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government, such amendments were no different.  It commends the Government, maintains the current position, will not change and all the rest of it.</p><p>This issue last was reviewed in 2002 and it is time to review it again.  I desire that a review be undertaken on the effects of fluoridation, given the additional research that is available, of which there is quite a lot from the United States.  In this context, Senator Mary Ann O'Brien may have mentioned many countries in Europe, including Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, Scotland, Sweden and Switzerland, to mention a few.  I have known people from these countries and did not note they had any particular tooth decay issues.  They were fine, healthy people and these countries clearly have taken a decision not to have fluoride applied to the public water system for a reason.  There are clear concerns about it, as fluoride is poisonous, as has been outlined in respect of toothpaste and processed foods.  Even before one comes to treated drinking water or toothpaste, children could be taking in much more fluoride than is safe in a general sense.  A huge number of studies link it to quite a number of different diseases and there is a body of scientific research that supports this view.</p> <p>From what I have read in recent days, we are not talking about a bunch of crazies who have a vested interest in getting this.  Equally, I do not think the State believes it is doing harm by keeping it in there, but it warrants a review.  It is something that comes up frequently.  Some friends of mine will only have bottled water and will try to ensure their children do not have access to fluoride.<br/>The reasons for Senator Mary Ann O'Brien tabling the motion are absolutely sound.  I read her very good article in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I also read the comments that people added online.  An interesting broad church of people gave their responses to it.  We certainly could do worse than have a review at this time given that it is 12 years since the last one when we decided to continue with the policy.  It would be timely to review it again and the Minister of State would be doing us all a favour by answering that this evening - there might be no need for a vote.<br/>Some of the information highlighted to me on the effects of fluoridation of water is indeed frightening.  It was clearly a 1950s solution and approach to a particular issue which is outdated.  We have all taken on board our responsibilities in the context of dental health.  I do not believe it is impossible for us to continue to be dentally healthy as a nation if we opted to change the policy.  I accept we do not want to scaremonger and say we are all going to die.  Senator Mary Ann O'Brien made the point about it being the cumulative impact of this over a long period.  There may be links to some of these illnesses and perhaps if we took it out and monitored it over a ten-year period, we might see some results.<br/>Our starting point should not be that fluoridation is the bees' knees and we will continue with it.  The approach ought to be that policies need to be reviewed on an ongoing basis.  It has been 12 years since the last review, other research is available and there are fears out there.  At an absolute minimum, even if we were to continue with the policy, we should reassure people why we are doing that and we should outline the levels of fluoride in water, why it is there and how it is possible to avoid intake of it by avoiding fluoridated drinking water.  People are entitled to know that and the nation should inform people about the level of fluoridation in the water so that if they feel they do not want themselves or their children exposed to it, they must get other forms of water for drinking, brushing teeth and so on.<br/>We should have tabled an amendment but were not quick enough.  If we had tabled an amendment, it would have called for a review and that ought to be done.  I do not want to delay the House.  I thank Senator Mary Ann O'Brien for her very informative article in today's newspaper.  It certainly gave me new information that I did not have in addition to other information that was given to me.  According to my documentation 97% - Senator Mary Ann O'Brien mentioned 98% - of people in Europe clearly have concerns and they are not crazies so let us have a look at the most up-to-date research on the issue with an open mind and be flexible on what we might do following a review.  I know where Senator Mary Ann O'Brien is coming from, but I do not think it is possible that we could all have an individual choice because of water supply - John next door cannot have it if I do not want it.  Maybe we could look at that.<br/>I am not convinced that I want it completely removed from the water system.  I have major concerns as an individual with young children.  The Minister of State would be best advised to conduct a review at an absolute minimum among the staff at her Department.  I am sure there is no additional cost for that - people are being paid in the usual way as members of staff.  Perhaps she could report back to us in a month or two with the results of that review and we could consider the issue again.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Mary Ann O'Brien for tabling the motion and I acknowledge that some Senators have a particular interest in it.  Unlike others, I have been listening to the debate about fluoridation all my life.  My father had a particular interest in it, as did my father-in-law after that, so it is a debate I have been listening to for many years.<br/>I acknowledge and thank the Senators for holding this debate.  I commend everyone who contributed.  I know others are yet to contribute, but I have to leave early.  The Government will not support the motion in its current form, but the Government has proposed an amendment that provides for the continuing review of this important issue of public interest and concern.  I commend the Government amendment before the House and I hope everyone has read it.<br/>Water fluoridation is the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the recommended level for the prevention of tooth decay.  Fluoride is a natural mineral used by the body to strengthen teeth and bones.  Fluoride occurs naturally in all water supplies at different levels and is found in soil, fresh water, seawater, plants and many foods.  As the Senator pointed out, fluoridation began in Ireland in 1964 on foot of the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960.  The Act and the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007 provide for the making of arrangements by the HSE for the fluoridation of public water supplies.  The local authorities, acting on behalf of Irish Water, act as agents for the HSE in providing, installing and maintaining equipment for fluoridation and in adding the fluoride to water and in testing the fluoride content of water to which fluoride has been added.<br/>In Ireland, naturally occurring levels of fluoride tend to be so low that they do not provide sufficient dental benefits.  However, there are exceptions.  Among the evidence presented to the Oireachtas prior to the introduction of fluoridation 50 years ago was the discovery that the public water supply serving the village of Patrickswell, County Limerick, had a fluoride content of around 0.7 to 1 parts per million.  No other water supply in the city or county of Limerick was found to contain fluoride to that significant effect.  The then Medical Research Council of Ireland carried out a special examination of children attending Patrickswell national school.  It found that the teeth of the children who had been using the naturally fluoridated water supply in that village since birth or the greater part of their lives had less dental decay than the other children attending schools in the rest of the city and county of Limerick.<br/>Artificial water fluoridation replicates a natural benefit by making good a fluoride deficiency in some water supplies.  The benefits to oral health brought about by fluoridation have been experienced all over the world.  It is hardly surprising that water fluoridation is recognised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States Public Health Service as one of the ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.  As Senator Colm Burke has already outlined, in the case of Ryan <i>v.</i>Attorney General in 1964, the Supreme Court did not accept that the fluoridation of water was, or could be described as, the mass medication or mass administration of drugs through water, as suggested by the Senators.<br/>The Health Products Regulatory Authority is the competent authority for the licensing of human and veterinary medicines and medical devices in Ireland.  The HPRA considers that neither drinking water itself nor the fluoride added to drinking water in the form of fluoride salts or silica fluoride, as defined in the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, should be categorised as medicinal products.  The HPRA considers that the fluoridation of drinking water should be seen as a measure consistent with general public health management.  Fluoridation can be likened to adding vitamin D to milk or folic acid to cereals.  More than 370 million people worldwide receive the benefits of water fluoridation.  All EU states have fluoride, in one form or another, at the centre of their public policy approach.</p> <p>For some European countries, water fluoridation is impracticable due to the large number of separate water sources.  Many of them choose salt fluoridation or milk fluoridation as an alternative to give the health benefits of fluoride exposure to their citizens.  Several countries have opted to use other approaches to fluoridation such as investing in large public dental services, as in the Netherlands and in Nordic countries.  In such cases, fluoride is administered to children in school clinics.  There is evidence, however, that other methods of fluoridation such as milk fluoridation or topical applications are not as clinically effective or as cost effective.  There is some evidence too that water fluoridation may have particular benefits for persons on lower income.</p><p>Major fluoridating countries include the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Colombia, Chile and several others.  Fluoridation coverage in the USA is approximately 200 million people.  Almost 6 million people in the UK have fluoride added to their water with another 330,000 having naturally fluoridated water.   Approximately 10% of the population in Spain has fluoridated water.  Salt fluoridation is practised in many South and Central American countries, as well as in the EU, notably in France, Germany and other central European countries.</p><p>In Ireland, approximately 3 million people have fluoridated water supplies.  Fluoride strengthens the teeth.  Strong teeth result in fewer fillings, fewer extractions, fewer visits to the dentist and lower dental bills.  To date, there has been a highly significant reduction in the proportions of decayed, missing and filled teeth of people living in areas supplied by fluoridated drinking water when compared to those in non-fluoridated areas.  Even with a background of widespread availability of fluoridated toothpastes, the difference between fluoridated and non-fluoridated communities remains.  A further factor is Ireland's high level of sugars consumed and the poor tooth brushing habits of our children and adolescents compared to their European counterparts.  Accordingly, the use of fluoridated toothpastes alone is insufficient to prevent tooth decay.</p><p>By comparing similar fluoridated and non-fluoridated populations, we can assess the benefits of fluoridation.  The study, Oral Health of Irish Adults 2000 to 2002, showed decay scores were lower among fluoridated groups for all age groups and particularly in the 35 to 44 age group.  A 2014 study by Public Health England compared fluoridated and non-fluoridated parts of England.  It found that in fluoridated areas there were 45% fewer hospital admissions of children aged one to four for dental caries than in fluoridated areas.  The recently published Queensland study, Child Oral Health Survey 2010 to 2012, commissioned by the Queensland Government in Australia, shows substantial differences between the levels of primary tooth decay in long-term fluoridated Townsville at 39% and the previously non-fluoridated rest of north Queensland at 57%.</p><p>Consumers sometimes express concerns about potential negative effects of drinking fluoridated water.  Such concerns are not allayed by scaremongering and misinformation used by opponents of fluoridation.  I accept, however, that the arguments on both sides have not been fully fleshed out.</p></speech>

Dental fluorosis is a cosmetic or aesthetic condition which refers to the way teeth look.  It is not considered to be an adverse health effect.  At the levels of fluoride present in Ireland's water supplies, any occurrence of dental fluorosis is very mild or mild.  In most cases, it is only detectable by a dentist as faint white flecks on the surface of the teeth.</p><p>Regularly conducted studies on dental health in Ireland, carried out when the upper limit for fluoridation was 1.0 part per million, confirm the low level of dental fluorosis.  In the majority of cases, dental fluorosis generally does not require any treatment.  The non-treatment of dental fluorosis has no health consequences.</p><p>The policy of fluoridation was the subject of a major review in 2000.  A forum on fluoridation was established, comprising largely of persons with expert knowledge from the fields of public health, dental health, food safety, environmental protection, law and ethics, water quality and health promotion and a consumer representative.  The main conclusion of the forum&rsquo;s report, published in 2002, was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure.  The forum also recommended that, given the increased access to fluoridated toothpaste and in light of the best available scientific evidence, the optimal level of fluoride in water should be redefined from the then level of 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million to between 0.6 and 0.8 parts per million with a target value of 0.7 parts per million.  Parts per million is equivalent to milligrams per litre.  This change was implemented by the Fluoridation of Water Supplies Regulations 2007.</p><p>Another important recommendation of the forum was that an expert body should be established to implement the recommendations of the forum, as well as advising the Minister and evaluating ongoing research on all aspects of fluoride.  Accordingly, the expert body on fluorides and health was established in 2004.  It continues to share its expertise and provide advice on fluoridation and related matters.  It considers scientific evidence submitted to examination by other scientists, usually by publication in recognised peer-reviewed scientific journals after such publication has been approved by independent referees.  This ensures the advice provided by the expert body is impartial and evidence-based.  The expert body is satisfied, having studied current peer reviewed scientific evidence worldwide, that water fluoridation at the level permitted in Ireland does not cause any ill-effects and continues to be safe and effective in improving the oral health of all age groups.  These views are supported by reputable international agencies and valid scientific articles and reviews.</p><p>It is worth noting EU law defines a maximum permitted concentration of 1.5 parts per million for public water supplies through its drinking water directives.  The Irish levels are set at around half that permitted by EU legislation.  Systematic and comprehensive reviews of fluoridation have been conducted in many other countries too including the United Kingdom, such as the York review in 2000 and the Medical Research Council in 2002, Australia in 2007, Canada in 2010, the European Union in 2011 and New Zealand in 2014.  None of these reports established any basis for considering that artificially fluoridated water poses any systemic health risks.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review.  The work done by the expert body and what we learn from international studies have been invaluable.  It is important the public is continually reassured about the use of fluoridated water.  It is for this reason that we have asked the Health Research Board to undertake a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation at its current level on the health of the population and on the environment.  This particular initiative will consolidate the research worldwide using a systematic approach.  We expect to have a definitive report from the Health Research Board by the end of this year.</p><p>The Department is also collaborating in a University College Cork-led research project, Fluoride and Caring for Children's Teeth, FACCT.  The study will consider the impact of changes on the oral health of children following policy decisions relating to toothpaste use by infants and young children made in 2002 and the reduction in the level of fluoridation in drinking water in 2007.  In addition, a study on general and oral health findings in adults linked to the duration of exposure to fluoridated water as part of the Irish longitudinal study on aging, TILDA, has commenced.</p><p>I note the concerns expressed by Senators do not relate specifically to health but to an ethical argument, namely, freedom of choice.  The suggestion is that it is the right of every citizen to choose whether their water is fluoridated.  This is troublesome and, as far as I understand, not supported by the Supreme Court.</p> <p>How would it operate in practice?  Would there be two separate public water supplies, one that is fluoridated and one that is not?  Clearly, such a system would be impractical and expensive beyond our current capacity.  There are parallels with the ban on smoking in the workplace.  Some people would like to have the freedom to choose whether to smoke in a workplace.  However, the exercise of that choice can have a negative impact on the health of others.  Therefore, we see the value in restricting an individual's freedom of choice when it impacts upon the health and well-being of others.  Is it ethical to stop fluoridation if doing so leads to poor dental health?  We have a duty to make that choice, informed by evidence and in the best interests of the public.  Tooth decay has a significant impact on health and well-being and results in high costs to the individual and the State.  It is largely preventable and, therefore, a high priority for oral health promotion.</p><p>The Oireachtas, in its wisdom, introduced fluoridation 50 years ago.  The Department of Health continues to review this policy and sees no benefit in its cessation.  The costs of cessation are likely to be considerable.  Ceasing water fluoridation without putting in place an alternative programme would be very costly.  Fluoridation is known to decrease dental decay substantially, for example, in the order of 40% in children, according to Irish health statistics.  The lifetime cost per person is approximately &euro;1 per annum.  Ceasing water fluoridation would lead not only to the additional financial burden of treating tooth decay but also to social costs, as tooth decay can lead to pain, trauma, disfigurement, loss of teeth and function, problems with nutrition and growth, and work or school absenteeism.</p><p>In some European countries that do not fluoridate their water, fluoride varnishes are applied to children's teeth twice per year.  In Ireland, screening is usually provided twice for children in primary schools, typically in second class and again in sixth class.  The introduction of a similar programme in Ireland would mean that children would be seen 16 times in primary school.  This would require a significant investment in personnel and resources.  Water fluoridation is the most cost-effective method of preventing dental decay and overcoming the poor risk profile in Ireland.</p><p>The Nuffield Council on Bioethics in the UK published a landmark report on ethical issues in public health in 2007.  It recognised the tensions between protecting personal autonomy and promoting the welfare of all.  To quote from the report: &quot;From an ethical and practical standpoint, an important dimension of public health policy is therefore to balance the liberal emphasis on choice and autonomy with the imperative to support those who do not have the opportunities to choose, because of, for instance, poverty or dependency.&quot;  Given that fluoridated water does not smell or taste differently from non-fluoridated water, the freedom of choice argument is essentially a debate about whether individuals who have a personal preference not to drink water containing 0.6 to 0.8 parts per million of fluoride should be able to prevent the rest of society enjoying the considerable benefits afforded by fluoridation.  It is the view of the Government that they should not.</p><p>I thank the Senator for introducing a topic that I have been examining for all of my life.

I will begin my support for Senator Mary Ann O'Brien's motion by addressing the issue of semantics.  According to the Government's amendment to our motion, water fluoridation is not medicinal.  I looked up definitions of "medicine".  A fairly standard one is "a drug or other preparation for the treatment or prevention of disease".  The amendment goes on to argue that water fluoridation is an effective means of preventing disease, namely, tooth decay.  As such, the first line of the amendment is intended to lead us down a detour while the Government contradicts itself in the amendment's second line, making the detour a dead end.</p><p>I will address the substance of our motion.  Fluoride is the only chemical added to public water to treat the consumer of the water rather than the water itself.  Therefore, fluoride is viewed by the Government as a form of medicine or a health treatment that prevents disease.  Consequently, the fluoridation of public water must be held to the strict scrutiny and standards applied to other health treatments.  Citizens must enjoy the same rights as regards water fluoridation as they do in respect of other aspects of health.  Reducing human rights arguments to a &quot;liberal emphasis on choice&quot; is unacceptable.</p><p>In no other area of health care does the Government impose a blanket treatment on the entire population without the expressed and informed consent of those affected.  Citizens must be given choice over their health treatment and be provided with a recourse to opt out if they wish to forgo said treatment.  It is unethical to force an unwanted health treatment on an individual.  The Government should not continue to impose water fluoridation requirements universally.  If the national mandate continues, the Government must provide support to those who do not want to be treated.  There are practical ways of doing so.</p></speech>

To ensure the health and safety of its residents, the Government must re-evaluate its law and policy in light of the recent emerging evidence to which Senators Mary Ann O'Brien and Quinn referred.  The Minister of State referred to the constitutional case, which Senator Burke first mentioned.  While that is interesting, if scientific evidence emerges to indicate that fluoride can be a risk to our health, it must at the very least mean that our citizens should have a choice.  We do not have a right to choose to reject an imposed health treatment, particularly if there is evidence indicating that it may create a risk to our health.  A growing body of scientific literature questions the long-term safety of water fluoridation, but I will not go over it again.</p><p>It is important to note that rates of tooth decay have plummeted in Ireland since the 1960s.  We do not know how much of that improvement in oral health can be attributed solely to the fluoridation in water.  Education and practices in oral health have also improved dramatically in recent decades.  The improvement could have been owing to these, even in the case of poorer children who are well able to be educated like the rest of us.  In the same timeframe, many European countries witnessed similar declines in the rate of tooth decay without the use of public fluoridation of water.  In Finland and Germany, for example, the number of cavities did not increase.  Indeed, some countries saw declines despite the cessation of water fluoridation.  This must be taken into account.</p><p>A point that has not been mentioned much in this debate is that opposition is growing to the fluoridation of public water.  As Government representatives, we must consider this issue.  In 2002, a public survey found that 45% of people in Ireland had concerns about water fluoridation.  Many local efforts have worked to stop the fluoridation of water.  Since 2012, local councils have passed motions calling for the cessation of water fluoridation.  The Government, in its wisdom, needs to listen and the growing public resistance must be incorporated into national policy.</p><p>Ireland is the only EU country with a national regulation stipulating public water fluoridation.  This year, Israel stopped adding fluoride to its drinking water following a decision of its Supreme Court.  That ruling was clearly rooted in the individual's human right to decide whether to consume water treated with fluoride.</p><p>Like others, including some UN conventions, it is my opinion that legislation must guarantee the human right to choose in questions of health and ensure an adequate standard of living, including access to adequate drinking water.  Therefore, I support the motion and call on the Government to change the law.  The Government must first ensure that, as the hippocratic oath demands, its health policy does no harm.</p></speech>

The motion overstates the case.  Senator Colm Burke referred to the Supreme Court ruling of Mr. Justice John Kenny that it is not a fundamental right.  While people generally should be free to choose, it is difficult to see how this right can be balanced with the undoubted benefits to the public of fluoridation of water.</p><p>Nothing in the contribution by the proposer of the motion is uncontested.  Senator MacSharry said the jury is out on this, but it is not.  The expert body on fluorides and health is unambiguous about the safety of fluoridation of water.  Fluoridation is measured as parts per million and 0.6 to 0.8 parts per million is deemed to be the optimal level for protecting overall oral health for all age groups without causing any risk to health.  The correct amount of fluoride in water is not harmful according to the expert body.  The WHO is also clear on it, and explicitly recommends that those countries which do not have access to optimal levels of fluoride and have not yet established systematic fluoridation programmes consider the development and implementation of fluoridation programmes.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rated fluoridation as one of the ten most important public health achievements in the 20th century.</p><p>The idea that fluoridation is compulsory by law in this country and banned in others is incorrect.  Senator Zappone spoke about the semantics of the argument, and I would like to have a debate on the importance of our use of language, although we do not have time in this contribution.  Fluoridation is supported by law in this country.  It is not banned in other countries, just not required in law.  This is very different from taking an active legislative measure to ban it, which is not the case.  The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks is unable to conclude that fluoridation of water places any risk on human health or the environment.  It is very difficult to understand why we would have such little faith in the organisations charged with weighing the scientific evidence in an objective manner and suppose that, somehow, they are conspiring in some way to cause public ill health when their objective is the opposite.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HSE, Department of Health, the expert body on fluorides and health, the EU bodies, WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are all giving assurances that there are no demonstrable risks to health from fluoridation and I am happy to take their advice.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, referred to peer-reviewed scientific evidence and this is the most important factor when we consider any argument for or against any measure.  The last time we debated fluoridation of water in the House I heard very many inaccuracies, including that the fluoride used in water was a by-product of some industrial process, possibly fertiliser production.  It is very important that we, as legislators in this House, no matter what our different views, put the facts into the public domain rather than scaremonger, as the Minister of State said.</p><p>While I have some sympathy with the argument, I am very familiar with the Nuffield study, which weighs the balance between the right to choose the use of a product against the public health benefits of a product.  While the jury is out on that question, it is not out on the health risks related to fluoridation of water.  Even if I were to state I was an advocate of the right to choose in virtually all areas of life, it is very difficult to see how, with one public delivery system, we can provide both fluoridated and non-fluoridated water.  Regarding the balance of rights, this cannot be provided.  To say it is a fundamental human right is an overstatement of the case and does no justice to those who propose, in genuine good faith, that water should not be fluoridated.</p></speech>

I agree with most of what Senator Gilroy said.  One of the functions of the university constituencies is to bring the research of those universities to the House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch&rsquo;s statement corresponds with the research.  In the Patrick&rsquo;s Well example, where fluoride was naturally present, the decayed, missing and filled teeth index was much lower than in the rest of County Limerick.  That was not a plot by any chemical industry, as speakers have said; it was naturally present in the water.  Fluoride is naturally present in a number of areas, such as Gyles Quay, which is in the Minister of State's constituency.  It is also present in a number of places in the UK, where 330,000 people have water that is fluoridated naturally by the topography of their area.  A study found North-South differences, including a dramatic difference between the dental health in Sligo and Derry, in favour of Sligo.  There are differences in dental health over time since we started fluoridation many years ago.  Last month, a paper was presented at the World Dental Conference in New Delhi confirming the positive aspects of fluoridation.</p><p>The evidence is overwhelmingly in favour of the benefits of fluoride.  The benefits are particularly obvious in deciduous teeth.  Those who want the choice to have non-fluoridated water would impose a particular cost on children, whose deciduous teeth will fall out much more.  If they succeed, there will be a significant cost by way of dental fees to restore the resulting decayed, missing and filled teeth index.  For &euro;1 per year a person receives all the benefits stated in the literature.  I commend the dental profession on being in favour of a public health measure which reduces the demand for the services of dentists.  I would like other professions in the country to be as patriotic as dentists.  Usually, when professions come here, they want more money for themselves.  Dentists are a noble exception, saying this public health measure reduces the demand for their services.  This is a commendable difference between dentists and other professions.</p><p>The expert body on fluorides and health continues to do research.  When this began, 50 years ago, it dealt with the arguments about damaging effects of fluoride.  The quantities of fluoride one would have to consume to experience the damaging effects were massively in excess of anything that is present in water.  Fluoride is not a risk to health in the current quantities but has very positive general health impacts.  What happens if we return to the previous situation of high levels of decayed, missing and filled teeth?  It would have serious impacts on people&rsquo;s general health to have a head full of decaying teeth, and it is not included in the calculations.  Fluoridation of water has been a success in health terms and is supported in the literature in refereed journals, as the Minister of State said, and as the previous Minister of State, Deputy White, said here on the previous occasion it was debated.  While I appreciate we must examine any instance where medical treatment damages people&rsquo;s health, iatrogenic disease in general, the balance of the literature is that fluoridation is overwhelmingly positive and, therefore, I support the Government amendment.</p> <p>This is a successful public health policy by any measure.  As we said, one can compare Patrickswell to the rest of County Limerick at the past, one can compare Derry to Sligo in recent time, or one can compare the naturally fluoridated parts of the United Kingdom to the unfluoridated parts.  The fact is that eminent dental conferences such as the one in New Delhi last month continuously present the evidence and fluoridation is overwhelmingly endorsed.  </p><p>There are many other issues in the health service which deserve some of the attention that has been focused on the fluoridation of water.  This issue has been well discussed, well debated, and the research continually shows it has been a worthwhile endeavour so let us go on to some of the other much more urgent problems in the health service.</p></speech>

Beimid &aacute; mharc&aacute;il go tr&eacute;an agus t&aacute;im ag s&uacute;il leis.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward an amendment to the motion which in no way negates the sentiment that is being put forward by the Independent Senators.  However, we feel that in a situation like this we must call a spade a spade and it is our policy that fluoridation of public water should be discontinued immediately.  I disagree with many of the sentiments put forward by my good friend and colleague Senator Barrett; we often agree but not on this.  I have no doubt that when the Government of the day first introduced fluoridation in the 1960s it may have believed it was acting for the correct reasons.  According to a 2002 report from the Forum on Fluoridation, the fluoridation process was introduced as it was considered to be a much cheaper way of improving the quality of children's teeth than employing more dentists.  This led to the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, which mandated compulsory fluoridation by local authorities.  In 1965 the legacy of the mass medication of the population began.  </p><p>Fluoridation was introduced at a time when tooth decay was a significant health issue, representing a cheap way to deal with a widespread problem, especially among poor and marginalised people.  The Department of Health has never conducted any research on the health effects on the population of mass fluoridation in the intervening period, despite the fact that this was stipulated in the 1960 legislation.  The argument today is that there is no longer a requirement within the scope of public health for continued water fluoridation.  The need for fluoridation, if there ever was a need, has been entirely negated by modern use of fluoride toothpaste, which ensures a more than adequate supply of fluoride for the purpose of improving dental health and we also have improved dental services.  A 2001 report in the United States detailing recommendations on using fluoride to prevent and control dental decay claimed that earlier studies from the 1950s indicated that water fluoridation had led to a reduction of 50 to 60% in childhood cavities.  More recent studies, however, indicate a much lower rate of 18%.  </p><p>There is no need to swallow fluoride in order to protect teeth and dentures.  The purported benefits of fluoride are topical, they are on the surface, but the risks are systemic.  Therefore, it makes more sense to deliver fluoride directly to the tooth in the form of a toothpaste.  Fluoride toothpaste is the most widely used and rigorously evaluated fluoride treatment.  A report entitled Oral Health in the United States: The Post-Fluoride Generation states that the introduction of fluoride in the early 1970s is considered to be the main reason for the decline in tooth decay in industrialised countries and toothpaste appears to be the single common factor in countries where tooth decay rates have declined.  </p><p>Across Europe, countries have ceased the practice of the fluoridation of water such that 98% of Europe's population no longer drink fluoridated water.  This is the only country with a statewide policy of mandatory fluoridation and local authorities cannot make the decision to stop the process.  Many local authorities have approved motions to seek to stop the process, but they have been told it is not possible for them to do so.  Most countries in Europe have experienced substantial declines in cavities without the use of water fluoridation.  For example, in Finland and Germany tooth decay rates remained stable or continued to decline after water fluoridation stopped.  </p><p>I therefore hope that the Government amendment to the motion will be defeated and that our amendment will be accepted because although we agree with the statement about the human right of citizens, we feel that the only way to end this policy of fluoridation is to call for the removal of fluoride from the public water system.  This would allow people to choose whether or not to use toothpaste with fluoride in it.</p><p>There may also be a technical issue with the Government's amendment.  I do not think that the first part of the amendment, &quot;that water fluoridation is not medicinal but the adjustment of the natural concentration of fluoride in drinking water to the recommended level for the prevention of dental caries (tooth decay)&quot;, is a sentence, and it does not seem to make any sense.  Even on that technical issue the Government should withdraw this nonsensical amendment.  It is nonsensical both in its wording and in its sentiment. </p><p>There is a general sense, as was put forward in a Private Members' Bill brought by my colleague Deputy Brian Stanley in the D&aacute;il recently, that there is no argument for the continued fluoridation of water.  I commend the people who have lobbied on this issue, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, and we will support them until fluoridation is ended.  If people then wanted to have that choice, they have the choice of what type of toothpaste to buy.  I agree with Senator Gilroy, something that does not happen very often.  As he said, it will be difficult if people are given a choice as to whether or not they want their water fluoridated because the water is fluoridated at a central source, so it will be impossible to give fluoridated water to one person and non-fluoridated water to the person next door.  That is why we feel that the amendment that we are putting forward, calling for the removal of fluoride from the public water system, is the way to go.  We hope that we do get to put the amendment and that we get full support from the House.</p></speech>

I want to begin by strongly commending Senator Mary-Ann O'Brien on putting forward tonight's motion.  It is important that the people's Parliament here in the Oireachtas discusses an issue of fundamental human health.  Whether one agrees with the fluoridation of water, or where there is conflicting scientific evidence as to whether the fluoridation of water is beneficial to human health, it is only right that we should debate it here.  I have read many journal articles in this area.  As a former food technologist I have a particular interest in the area, and as someone who worked in the food safety sector, I would like to think that I know something about it.  One must only look at the conflicting evidence that is coming from all over the world.  One would have to, on looking into one's heart, say that there is a need for a systematic review of our fluoridation of our public water drinking supplies.  Simply because of the existence of conflicting evidence, one would have to at least look at doing that.<br/>When the legislation was brought forward in 1960, a young Fine Gael Deputy at the time put forward an amendment which was accepted by the Government requesting that there would be periodic reviews of the fluoridation of our public water supplies.  There have been <i>ad hoc</i>reviews and surveys but there has been no conclusive review.  One recent review was carried out by the Department of Health in January, but it only scratches at the surface; it does not look at the conflicting international evidence and does not come up with a detailed response to all of that.  I ask why this is the case.  People will pay for their water from this day forth and therefore an individual who is purchasing a public good will purchase that good whether or not they agree with the fact that there is fluoride added to the water.  Is that right?  I do not think so.  They are paying for a product.  They may not agree with what is in the product so therefore why should they have to pay for the product because they have no alternative way of getting that water into their property?  There are fundamental and ethical questions in that alone.<br/>It costs &euro;10 million a year to fluoridate our public water supply.  The product specification given by the company that supplies the fluoride to the HSE, Chemifloc limited, is alarming when one reads the list of what is contained in the parameter elements of fluoride - things like arsenic, mercury, nickel, lead, selenium.  Not since 1960 has the Department of Health in Ireland undertaken any environmental impact analysis of fluoride.</p></speech>

Why?  Surely it should be accredited.</p><p>I agree with my colleague, Senator MacSharry, that there is a need for an urgent review.  I thank Senators for tabling the motion, which I would love to be able to support.  Our party has, however, taken a different view and I have to stand with that.  There are serious questions.  We are the only country in Europe that adds fluoride to our public drinking water supply, although one can argue that there are small municipal councils across different parts of Europe that add fluoride.  The argument was made about other countries, so let us look at the other countries.  In France, for example, the head of the Paris directorate for the protection of the environment said that fluoride chemicals are not included in the list of chemicals added to drinking water due to ethical as well as medical considerations.  In Norway there was a rather intense discussion on the subject some 20 years ago and the conclusion was reached that drinking water should not be fluoridated.  That was from the national institute of public health in Norway.  In Sweden, drinking water fluoridation is not allowed by the national food administration drinking water division.  Israel was mentioned earlier.  In 2013, Israeli health minister, Dr Yael German, stated that water fluoridation poses dangers such as lowered IQ, brittle bones and teeth, and damage to the thyroid gland.  It was ruled that water fluoridation is unconstitutional, emphasising that it is dangerous and that the science defending the practice is outdated and no longer widely accepted.</p></speech>

I thank Senators Mary Ann O'Brien, Feargal Quinn and Katherine Zappone for tabling the motion.  I do not have all the answers but I stand here as a concerned citizen, a legislator and a mother.  I have heard enough to say that we should be concerned and careful.  We are talking about the public water supply in Ireland that is fluoridated without us having a choice in the matter.  This water comes into every one of our homes.  It flows out of the tap and we are told to drink at least four litres of it a day.  In a way, if I were to take it to an extreme, we are medicated according to thirst.  Looking at the wording of Senator O'Brien's motion, there is a fundamental human right of every Irish citizen to choose whether to have their water medicated with fluoride.  Putting fluoride into the public water supply is giving us a drug without our consent.  That is an imposition.  The only basis on which it can be done is if it is totally safe to human health.</p><p>Senator O'Brien and others have raised a political argument in the context of us paying for water from today.  That is another argument.  Let us go back to the substantive issue, which is about human health.  There is enough doubt raised in my mind to convince me that we have to research this area very carefully.  The first question I would ask is whether countries without water fluoridation have significantly worse teeth than Irish citizens.  The evidence I have looked at does not show that this is the case.  The main case for the fluoridation of water is that it reduces tooth decay.  Someone is wrong.</p><p>I was seconded to work in public health for a short time, and worked with a HSE doctor for whom I had huge respect.  I have contacted him on this matter.  He believes that the fluoridation of water is justified on public health grounds, but that it is an ethical issue, and that public health experts have not sufficiently acknowledged this.  Here is a man giving a view that there is a lack of balance in this matter.  He said it is critical that the Health Research Board reviews all the relevant evidence, and I would say urgently and within a timeframe.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said, there have not been regular periodic reviews.  It has not been adequate at all.</p><p>The citizens' health is at risk in this regard.  Children are in far greater danger because their body weight is much lower.  There are shocking statistics that if a child were to eat a whole tube of toothpaste, which I know is unlikely, given his or her body weight and the amount of poison that would be ingested, he or she would die.  Half a tube of toothpaste would put him or her in a coma.  That is from the forum report to the Irish Government in 2002.  We are all told to give children a pea-sized amount of toothpaste, but children under two do not have the reflexes to spit out and there is toothpaste with fluoride for children up to two years of age.  In America, that very same toothpaste carries a warning that it is a poison.  That is not on our toothpaste here.</p><p>A total of 98% of Europe has rejected fluoridation, so why are we still doing it?  Are they all wrong while we are right?  It is prohibited by law in Holland but compulsory in Ireland.  There is a range of evidence that others have reflected in their arguments.  It was interesting that the Israeli minister for health, Ms German, said Israel's decision not to go with the fluoridation of water was supported by World Health Organization statistics proving that tooth decay has declined equally in countries with no mandatory fluoridation.  If that is the case, why do we have it?  I am not saying Israel is the only example we should look at, as 98% of Europe is also not choosing it.  There is an international movement away from fluoridation.  It is becoming redundant and is being rejected in other countries.</p><p>Fluoride is a highly poisonous substance.  It carries a poison warning in the United States.  There are more than 1,000 scientific studies saying fluoride in water causes health damage, from osteoporosis to arthritis to gastrointestinal cancer to dementia.  These are very serious claims which would contradict what Senator Barrett is saying.  We urgently need a time-bound review of the research in this area.  Will the Minister of State request the Health Research Board to conduct a systematic review of the evidence in this area urgently, and to report back to this House by January 2015 at the latest?  It should answer the following questions.  Do the citizens of countries without water fluoridation have significantly worse tooth decay than Irish citizens?  Is there a greater incidence of diseases such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, lower IQ, and other major illnesses such as dementia in countries with fluoridated water versus countries without fluoridation?  How effective is using fluoride in toothpaste, which can be spat out, versus a fluoridated water supply in preventing tooth decay?</p><p>I thank the Senators who tabled the motion for being thought-provoking.  It is in the interests of public health.  The very least we can do for each other is come up with some definitive answers that will help us inform future policy in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2014-10-01a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1156" speakername="Mary White" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2014100100041#RR01000"><p>I am very disappointed that this motion has been tabled by Seanad colleagues.  Fluoridation has consistently been the subject of misinformation and distortion of evidence.  It is quite disappointing to see the sponsoring Senators join this bandwagon.  We should be celebrating the fact that this year marks the 50th year of the fluoridation of public water supplies in Ireland.</p> <p>This public health measure has been reviewed numerous times and every review shows fluoridation has benefited the dental health of Irish children.  Its introduction in Ireland was promoted by Se&aacute;n MacEntee, then Minister for Health, who passionately believed our children deserved no less.  Its legitimacy was validated at a long High Court hearing in 1965.  In the same year, the Supreme Court rejected the assertion that fluoridation of public water violated the Constitution's guarantee to bodily integrity, a finding which this motion should recognise and on which its proposers should inform themselves.</p><p>A number of respected and expert reviews of fluoridation in Ireland have taken place to review concerns expressed.  The then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, established the Forum on Water Fluoridation in Ireland in 2002 and launched its report in the same year.  How can the sponsors of the motion cast aside the main findings of the forum's report?  Water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of children but also that of adults and the elderly.  The best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water in Ireland, namely, one part per million, human health is not adversely affected.</p><p>The expert body on fluoride and health was established as a result of the forum's recommendation to advise the Minister with responsibility for health on all aspects of fluoride, emerging issues and research findings.  This expert body, under the chairmanship of Dr. Seamus O'Hickey, continues to meet and discharge its responsibilities.  It has found no study which casts doubt on the safety of water fluoridation in Ireland.  The expert body states the only known side-effect of water fluoridation is dental fluorosis, a superficial staining of the tooth surface which has no adverse health effect and can be removed easily.</p><p>The expert group states much dental fluorosis comes from sources other than fluoridation of water, such as the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpastes, which are generally 1,500 times more concentrated than fluoridated water.  The expert group recommends that fluoridated toothpaste should not be given to children under two years of age and adults should supervise children aged between two and seven years when brushing with fluoridated toothpaste so a tiny amount is used and it is not swallowed.</p></speech>

Fluoride is not intelligent; it does not have a label stating it must go straight to the teeth.  It goes into our tummies.  It is soluble.  Within five minutes it is in every cell in one's body.  I want Senator Barrett to listen to this because we are not only talking about teeth but every cell in the body.  What about the rest of the skeleton?  Everyone has stated dental fluorosis is a definite and we have found something on which we all agree.  What about skeletal fluorosis?  If teeth get dental fluorosis why cannot the rest of the skeleton get fluorosis?  Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease which in mild form can cause fractures.  Golly gosh that is a cost to the nation for older people with hips, broken bones and brittle bones.</p><p>I was very glad to hear Senator White clarify the point on children aged under two years.  To return to my speech, what about children aged under two who must drink bottled feeds?  I believe it was Senator Burke, but perhaps it was Senator Gilroy, who stated one must follow the manufacturer's instructions when making up formula feeds.  Having had five children, I cannot remember a manufacturer's feeding tube stating it should be mixed with boiled fluoridated water.  Babies are not supposed to have fluoridated water.  They cannot excrete fluoride efficiently.  Adults can filter 50% but babies retain 90%.  This is based on studies which have been conducted and are true.  Babies weigh between 12 and 25 pounds and per body weight need three to four times more liquid per day than adults to stay alive because they do not have any teeth so they cannot eat.  Their food comes from drink and bottles.  They take in three or four times more liquid and fluoride than we do, which is a serious problem.</p><p>To come back to Senator Barrett, who may not have been here for my speech, I quoted from the National Research Council report from the United States.  It is an arm of the US National Academy of Sciences.  It conducted the largest piece of research ever conducted in the history of the human race since fluoridation has become apparent, when 12 scientists chosen for their balanced nature spent three years examining the pros and cons in 1,000 reports.  The Senator can read my speech later because I have very little time left.</p><p>I did not know that fluoride is found in pharmaceuticals, steroids, anti-inflammatories, antimalarial drugs, anaesthetics, anti-fungal treatments and antibiotics which are given to children.</p> <p>The pharmaceutical industry is with us on this as well.</p><p>Could the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, also ask the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, whether the expert group tested our water recently?  Can we have a breakdown of exactly what is in the water?  How many humans and how many counties have been tested regarding their levels of fluoride?  I bet she will tell me they are never tested.  How many foods have been tested?  How many beers have been tested?  How many Irish soups and ready meals?  How much Irish cheese?  How many Irish smoothies?  They all contain fluoride because they all are made with fluoridated water.  Earlier someone said one can make a baby's bottle with boiled water.  Boiling does not make fluoride go away.</p></speech>

Its decision was supported by the World Health Organization's statistics proving that tooth decay has declined equally in countries with no mandatory fluoridation.  It is about diet; it is about calcium, magnesium and zinc.  It is the toothbrush that is the greatest invention of the past 70 years, not fluoridation.  We need education, not fluoridation.</p><p>Shame on them all.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, had stayed because we need to review this outdated 51 year old policy and not have Senator Mary White in here looking wistfully back to the past and quoting outdated health policies.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, to bring this message back.  I will not press the matter to a vote because we will not win it this evening.  I am glad Sinn F&eacute;in is with me on this issue.  We are on a journey and we will get this done.  In Israel, it had to be taken to the Supreme Court.

Colombia remains one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a trade unionist.  NGOs on the ground are saying that now is not the time to increase trade links.  They welcome the peace and the land reform talks, however nothing is set in stone and all is still in flux.  </p><p>The Colombians want trade but trade that works for them and does not undermine local economies or improve the human rights situation.  A human rights report has revealed that in the second half of 2013, the Colombian police were the principal perpetrators of human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law.  The report concluded that these figures &quot;contradict considerably with the official government discourse which is centred around the consolidation of peace in Colombia&quot;.  Columbia has experienced more than six decades of violence linked mostly to a deep unresolved agrarian conflict.  At the heart of this conflict is land and how power is abused in Colombia.  The EU states that there are human rights clauses in the FTA but human rights must always be included in the EU's free trade agreements and while a violation of human rights by any country could warrant suspension, this has never occurred.  Additionally, the free trade agreement does not exactly say what constitutes a significant enough human rights violation to suspend the agreement.  Will one murdered trade unionist suspend it?  Will ten murdered landless peasants at a protest suspend it?  One only has to look at how Israel has conducted its affairs in recent times to see how low the EU's threshold is for human rights clauses in free trade agreements.  Israel indiscriminately bombed Gaza, killing more than 2,188 people, the vast majority of whom were civilians and many children, as the Minister knows, and more than 11,000 people were injured.  It committed war crimes, it is a serial human rights abuser and it has continued to violate international law, continues to occupy the Palestinian territories and yet the EU's foreign trade agreement with Israel is ironically &quot;based on respect for human rights and democratic principles&quot;.  I think the people of Gaza would dispute that.  If the EU will not cancel an FTA agreement with a country that commits blatant war crimes and human rights violations, it does not hold out much hope that it will do so with Colombia.</p><p>Ireland is the only country left to sign an agreement.  Effectively, we are asking the Minister to confirm when he will bring this issue to the D&aacute;il or Seanad.  We believe we should have the opportunity to vote on this issue.  Does the Minister agree that he should hold an open debate, either in the Seanad or in the D&aacute;il?  While it is helpful to raise the matter on the Adjournment, I would imagine there would be many Members of the Oireachtas who would want to have their say on this issue.</p><p>I look forward to the Minister's response.</p></speech>

I am pleased to come before this House to debate this agreement.  It is one of a group of agreements between the EU and Colombia, Peru and most recently Ecuador, the Andean countries.  The agreement incorporates commitments on human rights, sustainable development and the objective to reduce poverty.  This is set out in the first principle of the agreement.  It has been provisionally applied by the EU since August 2013 and has been ratified already by 17 member states.</p><p>I should acknowledge the important work done by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Tr&oacute;caire and others in highlighting the human rights concerns associated with Colombia and in drawing these concerns to the attention of the international community.  The promotion and protection of human rights is a core principle of Irish foreign policy and I believe that the provisions of the agreement support this core principle.  I believe that the provisions of this agreement, including asymmetric trade preferences for the Andean countries and the binding provisions on human rights, labour standards and sustainable development will complement the existing mechanism for multilateral political dialogue, such as the EU human rights dialogue with Colombia.</p><p>The international experience is that economic disadvantage and isolation reinforces the potential for human rights concerns.  In contrast, engagement with the international community and institutions, in this case the EU through trade and political dialogue, promotes both economic and social progress.  This agreement provides an enhanced basis for openness, prosperity and accountability for the parties to it.  The agreement both legitimises and animates the union in promoting its social and democratic values.  It is useful to recall the language in the text of the agreement which relates to human rights.  Article 1 of the agreement provides that respect for democratic principles, fundamental human rights, and the principle of the rule of law, are &quot;essential elements&quot; of the agreement.  The significance of this is that if one party breaches the &quot;essential elements&quot;, the other party would be entitled to adopt proportionate measures without delay.  Such measures could include the termination of the agreement, as the Senator has acknowledged.</p><p>Title 9 of the agreement contains a legally binding sustainable development chapter, which includes provisions on labour, and the mechanisms through which civil society groups, including trade unions and NGOs, can participate, raise concerns and express views.  The parties to the agreement are obliged to review and consider these views.  In addition there are domestic advisory groups composed of civil society representatives, which must be consulted and which can also make recommendations on their own initiative.  There is provision for regular inter-governmental meetings.  These meetings must include an open session where civil society organisations and citizens can directly raise issues.  All decisions or reports from these inter-governmental meetings must be public.  The sustainable development chapter establishes a specific arbitration system to deal with disagreements on the implementation of its provisions.  An independent group of experts can be requested to assess the signatories' fulfilment of their obligations and to issue public reports, on the basis of which an action plan or other corrective action is to be implemented.</p><p>Moving to the bilateral level, as this House will be aware, Ireland is an unfailing promoter of human rights.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his officials, including the embassies on the ground, work closely with our fellow EU member states and the EU's External Action Service to support positive developments in Colombia.  This work is aimed at promoting the progressive improvement of human rights standards.  In Ireland's bilateral contacts with Colombian authorities - at political and at official levels - we can raise human rights and other issues.  We are also able to use these opportunities to acknowledge some positive developments that have been noted by, amongst others, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  These include the peace process, with its agenda covering critical areas including agrarian development and political participation - two areas where progress has been secured in the talks during the course of this year.  These are very positive developments, for which credit to those involved is due.</p><p>In Ireland's engagement as a member of the UN Human Rights Council, we attach priority to issues relating to human rights defenders.  We emphasise that civil society organisations need space, that human rights activists must be able to exercise their rights, including freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and of association and that States must fulfil their obligation to create an enabling environment allowing non-governmental organisations to make their contribution to the creation or consolidation of rights-respecting democracies.</p><p>In an increasingly inter-dependent world, important economic and social benefits can flow from increased international trade.  The economic impact in Colombia and Peru, and now Ecuador, of the free trade agreement with the EU will be significant and this can, in turn, contribute to the development of more equitable, just and peaceful societies.  Economic growth must be made sustainable and equitable through good governance in the form of respect for labour rights as well as environmental standards, and the full promotion and protection of human rights.</p><p>The free trade agreement with Colombia provides for a considerable and robust implementation and monitoring framework through the special intergovernmental trade committee set up under the agreement, together with its eight subcommittees, including the sustainable development subcommittee, all of which should lead to the best possible outcomes for the trade and foreign policy interests reflected in the agreement.</p><p>This agreement with Colombia represents an opportunity to support sustainable, equitable development.  It will be for all of the parties to the agreements to ensure that they deliver fully on this potential.</p><p>As to the timing of a decision on this, it will come forward for a decision in a short time.  The issue of whether a debate is ordered in the D&aacute;il is a matter for the Whips.</p></speech>

It is the prerogative of the Minister to decide to hold the debate.  The Whips' job is to decide the timing of the debate and when it should happen.  I am asking the Minister to give a commitment as Minister, to hold a debate on this issue.  The Whips can then work out all of the rest.</p><p>What exactly is a violation of human rights?  The Minister rightly articulated the principle on human rights that is included in the agreement but that does not respond to the question I asked.  I am aware it is customary to give a scripted speech in response but on the next occasion the Minister might be able to shed some light on.  If ten trade unionists were killed, would that constitute a violation of human rights and would it cause the agreement to be suspended?  What exactly would constitute a breach and how would the mechanism be trigged and work effectively?</p></speech>

There is a domestic consultative panel, a joint civil society platform and a partners country domestic consultative mechanism, as I outlined in my reply.  These have to be done publicly and openly.  Where those start to breakdown obviously that triggers a reaction.  It depends on the level and each case must be judged on its merits.  By having agreement, by engaging with people and by forcing this iterative process, one delivers reform.  What the Senator is advocating, which is that we refuse to have such an agreement, is that one steps back.  Evidence shows that does not improve the human rights record, does not improve labour rights standards and does not improve environmental standards.  It is a question of engaging.</p><p>Of course there is a judgment call as to when one triggers actions.  It is not realistic to say that an X, Y or Z occurrence will lead to an automatic red card.  That is not realistic.  This is a process with civil society, trade unions, NGOs, intergovernmental and domestic consultative processes.  By putting those in place one creates a momentum for the delivery of the change we all desire.  </p><p>The Senator's desire for a checklist and qualifying that once one does something then it is gone, is not the approach that has been taken.  </p></speech>

Having such an agreement and having the consultative mechanisms that underpin it are worth putting in place.  Let us try to win progress through the agreement.</p></speech>

He is well aware of the difficulties in rural areas regarding broadband.  I am sure he is aware of the fact that 30% of trade is now done over the Internet yet only 10% of Irish companies seem to have a presence and an ability to sell over the Internet.  A large part of this is due to an ineffective broadband system throughout the country and in rural Ireland it is a major impediment.</p><p>The focus of my concern is not only the lack of broadband but broadband speed.  One study has shown that the speed of broadband and fibre optic networks in Ireland is less than 1% while the OECD average is 9.6%.  A fibre optic network can lead to potential savings in the four main economic areas of electricity, transportation, education and health but, as I have said, the fibre optic network here has been less than poor.</p><p>With regard to the speed of our network at 10 MBps, the Irish network is just over 10% whereas in the UK it ranges in the high 30s to the mid-40s in percentage terms of their ability to get 10 MBps or more.  We have a number of proposals.  One proposal is like the rural electrification or group water schemes where communities could put in ducting which accounts for 90% of the cost of installing a fibre optic network.  That is the future-proof way of having a better network.</p><p>We all know the difficulties encountered when installing masts in rural areas.  The Minister of State knows that communities, such as those in his area, are quite willing to install fibre optic networks given that the tools, mechanism and money could be put in at a reasonably inexpensive cost relative to the State installing same.  In the same way as rural water schemes were installed by communities, the ducting could be done which accounts for 90% of the cost of a fibre optic network.  If the network is installed by a private contractor or the State, there is no doubt it would be done at a huge expense and enormous waste.</p><p>Rural broadband, and broadband in general, are a concern for Kerry but are also a concern for Donegal because they are used for commerce throughout the world, and increasingly so.  However, small businesses and communities around Ireland - in Kerry, Donegal and elsewhere - do not have access to adequate broadband.  In some cases they do not have access to broadband at all.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator for tabling the question.  Broadband is a subject close to my heart and he is right that Donegal faces the same challenges as Kerry.  I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on this matter.</p><p>The State only intervenes in the competitive telecommunications market where there is evidence of clear market failure and such intervention is always subject to EU state aid approval.  The national broadband scheme was one such intervention.</p><p>Let me be clear on this matter, there is no question of services being withdrawn following the ending of the scheme.  3 has confirmed that, following the expiry of the scheme, it will continue to provide coverage throughout national broadband scheme areas on a commercial basis, and that customers should see no change to the level of service or speeds provided by 3.  It has also announced plans to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS coverage areas within the next three years offering significantly faster mobile broadband speeds.</p><p>I understand that former NBS customers who choose to stay with 3 can avail of the same choice of broadband plans and tariffs as those offered by it in non-NBS areas.  Furthermore, there is now a choice of commercial operators offering broadband services over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout much of the area previously covered by the NBS.</p><p>Through the national broadband plan, the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.</p><p>The commercial sector is currently investing approximately &euro;2.5 billion in new infrastructure and services.  These investments are delivering high-speed broadband to homes and businesses across Ireland for whom low speeds would have been the norm just two years ago.  The pace of investment is encouraging and is having tangible impacts on communities across Ireland.</p><p>The Government has made clear its intention to ensure that all citizens and businesses can access high-speed services, regardless of where they are located.  The national broadband plan, therefore, aims to supplement the significant commercial investments with a State-led intervention in the areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p><p>The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is currently finalising a mapping exercise which will identify the precise areas of commercial investment and those areas that require a State-led intervention.  The Minister and I intend to publish a series of interactive maps later this year for public consultation where operators and citizens can give feedback, with a view to ensuring that we correctly identified all of the areas requiring intervention.  These maps will be dynamic and subject to change as future commercial investments are announced or rolled-out.</p><p>Publication of the maps represents an important milestone in the overall project.  It will feed into a detailed implementation strategy which will be of published in 2015, in tandem with an application for EU State aids approval.  The detailed plan will be the subject of a full public consultation and we will move quickly thereafter into formal procurement for a winning bidder or bidders to build the network.</p><p>The proposed State-led intervention will involve a substantial network build-out which will be capable of carrying even higher broadband speeds, as new and more bandwidth-demanding services emerge.  It will extend to locations in every county in the State identified as having no current or planned high speed network.</p> <p>This challenging programme is being progressed as a priority project within my Department.  The national broadband plan, which is being progressed in stages, will deliver quality, high-speed connectivity to meet the needs of present and future generations in all parts of Ireland.</p></speech>

My concern is that customers will not see a change in the level of service or speeds provided by 3.  Reports from many areas indicate that speeds have been reduced, and if such speeds remain, that will not be helpful.  The concern here is that 3 has said it will not improve the level of service or speeds.</p><p>I understand the Government proposes to apply for EU aid in 2015, but it will be 2016 before some of the areas in the Minister of State's constituency, as well as parts of Kerry, will see any funding and 2017 before improved service is a reality.  Approximately 90% of the cost of installing a fibre optic network is accounted for by the ducting system, and if communities are capable of installing a water network in their area, they are also capable of putting in the ducting required for a fibre optic cable.  This would ensure they would get broadband services much more quickly than the current projections.  I fear that the timelines referred to will not be met and that the areas that need broadband the most will not be connected any time soon.  Connectivity with the world should mean that a person working on the Stock Exchange can do that work from Inishowen or Valentia island, where the quality of life is much better than in places like London.  This is not possible, however, because such areas do not have access to high-speed broadband.  The commercial network operators are not providing such access, and while the Government intends to provide access to high-speed broadband where it will not be provided by commercial entities, the timeline for this is far too long.</p></speech>

The Senator alluded to the rural electrification programme in the 1920s and we are in a similar space now in that broadband has become the new electricity in terms of its importance.  There are demands for service in rural areas and it is important we reassure customers of 3 that the service they currently receive will continue.</p><p>Wearing my other hat as Aire St&aacute;it gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Gaeltachta, I have started a dialogue between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht through &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta on how to move this issue forward.  I have also had discussions with my party colleague from Kerry, Deputy Brendan Griffin.  I would be interested in hearing Senator Daly's views on how we can progress matters.  I know the Gaeltacht does not cover all of Kerry, but an organisation such as &Uacute;daras na Gaeltachta has a very important role to play in terms of trying to attract businesses to the industrial estates and p&aacute;irceanna gn&oacute; in rural Ireland.  I know that some companies provide their own broadband, but not every company is in a position to do that.  There are massive challenges in all of this.</p><p>Senator Daly referred to the possibility of communities building their own ducting.  A group based in the north west called ERNACT made a presentation some months ago to the Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and referred to Sweden as an example of such a model operating in practice.  That information was relayed to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and I have had discussions with the Minister, Deputy White, about the new national broadband plan.  The Minister is quite serious about it and committed to it.  It is important we make that big leap that is needed, similar to the one taken in the 1920s - an l&eacute;im mor chun tosaigh.  A big leap is needed and I am interested in working with Senator Daly on any suggestions he may have for Kerry.  Counties Kerry and Donegal are unique in some respects, although they and have similar strengths and weaknesses and face similar challenges.  We had our differences a number of weeks ago but we in Donegal will get over that.</p></speech>

The Minister is aware of the details of this case and it is long past time for this school to get a permanent building.  The school has done tremendous work in the area and is unique in terms of its establishment in modern times.

St. Peter's national school, Dunboyne, County Meath, is an English-medium, co­educational school under the patronage of the Church of Ireland Bishop of Meath and Kildare.  The school is located in prefabricated accommodation on a temporary site.  The Department has been made aware that this site has recently become restricted due to construction work under way on part of the land adjacent to where the temporary school is located.  The process of acquiring a site for permanent accommodation for St. Peter's national school is under way.</p><p>A possible site option was identified and assessment of this site by members of the Department's technical and professional staff deemed it suitable for development of permanent accommodation for the school.  Further to the technical assessment, Department officials commenced negotiations to acquire the site and these negotiations are ongoing.  Due to the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, it is not possible to provide further information at this time.  Officials from my Department have been in contact with the relevant school authorities to keep them apprised of the status of the acquisition process.  When the site has been acquired, the Department will be in a position to progress the school project concerned to the architectural planning stage.</p><p>I assure the Senator that officials from my Department are aware of the current situation with regard to the temporary site and the need to acquire a site for permanent accommodation as soon as possible and are working hard to achieve this.  I thank Senator Byrne for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding St. Peter's national school.</p></speech>

I fully appreciate and understand the commercial sensitivities surrounding land acquisition and believe that politicians should avoid discussing that issue in the context of schools.</p><p>The Minister appreciates the urgency of this matter.  The school is under the patronage of the Church of Ireland and is the only such school to have opened in recent times, as I understand it.  It performs a very important role.  Many of the schools in the area have been provided with new buildings and new accommodation, although I am not suggesting that everything is perfect in County Meath.  While I would not go so far as to say that St Peter's has been left behind, it has not been the prime focus of the Department in the context of south County Meath.  I would like to see the Minister give the school the focus it deserves and I am confident she will do so.  I look forward to progress being made.  I hope that by raising this matter in the Seanad, I can help to move matters along.  I am aware that some of my party colleagues intend to raise the issue in the D&aacute;il and that Councillor Damien O'Reilly will be raising it at local and national level.</p></speech>
