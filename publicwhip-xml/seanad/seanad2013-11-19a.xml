I am delighted to see Ms Jody Blake here today.  I am sure that she will be the judge of whether she has returned to a revised, rejuvenated and reformed Seanad.  I am sure that we missed her more than she missed us.  It is great to see her back.</p><p>  On behalf of my group, my colleagues and I wish Senator Jimmy Harte a speedy recovery.  All of us consider him to be a good friend and hope that everything goes well for him.  Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family at this time.  We hope and are sure that he will make a very speedy recovery.  We have thought about him since the news broke last Friday night and I ask the Labour Party leader to pass on our best wishes.  Our Whip has been in touch with the Government side already and it goes without saying that any arrangements that need to be made <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> voting can be taken as a given.  We hope that the Senator will be back with us very soon.  </p><p>  I shall turn to today's business.  With regard to No. 1, it might be good to debate the motion when it returns from committee.  I have raised the issue regarding betting tax with the Leader.</p> <p>That is a very important sector for us also but the horse and greyhound racing fund regulations should be debated in the House when the Leader believes the time is appropriate.</p><p>Does the Leader have a revised date for the publication of the Health Service Executive service plan?  There have been two extensions to the publication of the service plan that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is to bring before the Oireachtas with regard to the health budget for next year.  I was particularly concerned to read that the figure we were told initially was &euro;666 million.  Some say the figure is &euro;1 billion but reports at the weekend indicate it is &euro;1.2 billion.  I hope we will not have a scenario where the service plan is published the day before or the day the House goes into recess-----</p></speech>

It seems this plan will be published when neither House is sitting.  If that is the case, the Leader should give a commitment that this House will be recalled to discuss that specific item.  He has given a commitment, which I welcome, that when the HSE service plan is published a full debate will take place in the House with the Minister for Health present but I do not want the Minister to publish it on 20 December when Members have left for the Christmas recess.  It is too important for that to happen.  The Leader might indicate if he has an update on when the plan will be published.</p><p>Last week I raised with the Leader the issue of the welcome ECB rate cut that sees the rate at a record low level of 0.25%.  I asked the Leader whether the Government had any contact with the banks, which the taxpayers support, about passing on that rate cut to variable rate customers who are struggling.  Many customers in arrears, and those just outside being in arrears, need this rate cut to be passed on.  I was astonished to hear at the time that Government had not made any contact with AIB, Bank of Ireland, ICS Building Society or EBS.  I ask that in the coming week a commitment be given that Government must outline its view on that.  What surprises me is that a view is not being given by our Minister for Finance.  He is not giving any direction.  I am not asking him to micromanage the banks but I am asking him to state clearly whether the Government believes this 0.25% rate cut should be passed on to variable rate customers.  I am not asking him to direct Bank of Ireland, AIB or the other two mortgage lenders, ICS and EBS, to do that.  I am asking him for his view.  It would be very difficult for the banks to ignore a statement from the Minister for Finance that he believes the rate cut should be passed on but, more importantly, it would give an indication to those customers struggling on high variable rates that the Government actually does care.  I ask the Leader to inquire of the Minister for Finance if he would make a statement on the Government position on the 0.25% rate cut.</p></speech>

It came as a terrible shock to all of us in the Labour Party group and I know to all Members in the House.  We very much appreciate their thoughts, good wishes and co-operation at this time.  We have been in touch already with the Fianna F&aacute;il Whip about that.  All of us extend our good wishes, our love and our support to Jimmy and his family at this difficult time.  Everyone shares in the hope for a speedy recovery.</p><p>I extend condolences to our colleague, Senator Eamonn Coghlan, on the death of his mother.</p><p>On a more positive note, I welcome back Jody Blake.  It is lovely to have her back with us and to have that positive news today.  She was missed very much and I am sure the clerking role will be much easier for the Clerk of the Seanad now that she is back.  It is great to see her.</p><p>I welcome the decision announced by the Government last week in the D&aacute;il that we will exit the troika programme with a clean break without availing of the additional credit facility that had been speculated about.  We have had a very favourable reaction since to that decision.  It was an important decision the Government made.  We have not had an opportunity to comment on it in this House yet but I very much welcome that the announcement was made in the D&aacute;il on Thursday morning.  That was hugely important as a symbol of the Government's intent to ensure that the D&aacute;il and the Legislature is kept alongside in that regard.</p> <p>I look forward to further debate on this in due course, particularly around 15 December when we do finally exit the programme.  </p><p>I also welcome the good news of the State visit of our President Michael D. Higgins to Britain.  It is timely and it is good to hear that it will happen and that he will make an address to the joint Houses of Commons and Lords.  That will be a very important and historic event.  We all look forward to that. </p><p>I would like the Leader to arrange a debate on white collar crime in light of the verdict announced yesterday in what has been described as the biggest white collar trial in the history of the State, that of Mr. Byrne.  Some new legislative measures have been introduced in recent years to combat white collar crime.  The Government has promised to legislate for cyber crime.  These are two forms of crime that the Irish criminal justice system has neglected.  I would like us to debate white collar and cyber crime in the new year and the most appropriate legislation by which we can tackle these new and serious challenges.</p></speech>

Our family is complete once more.  I also extend my sympathy and good wishes to Senator Harte and his family following his most unfortunate and sad accident.  Reading between the lines, he seems to be making some marginal improvement and I hope that continues.</p><p>As I have been a frequent critic of China because of its human rights record, it is only appropriate that I place on record my strong welcome for the fact that in recent statements it has been showing remarkable change in this area, in particular the commitment to disestablish forced labour and re-education camps.  If it lives up to this promise it will be a very important step.  We should keep up our pressure.  We have a motion on the Order Paper about organ harvesting which still goes on but is winding down, in part because of pressure from countries such as ours.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade passed the motion unanimously and I hope we might do the same here.</p><p>There is a growing number of climatic catastrophes occurring all over the world.  Several of us, including my colleague, Senator Bacik, who produced a Bill in this House some years ago about climate change, have been concerned about the damage that is being done and the inevitable progress of that damage.  There have been climate change sceptics.  I do not know how anyone can remain sceptical in light of the extraordinary phenomena of freak weather conditions in places as far apart as the United States of America and the Philippines where a great tragedy has engulfed those lovely warm people, many of whom work here in the nursing profession - we know how caring they are and how much their families mean to them.  Now in the past day or two a cyclone has struck the heart of Europe, in Sardinia.  It is not possible to deny this any more.</p><p>I look forward to a debate on the exit from the bailout.  I do not think we have exited from anything.  We are still deep in the manure.  We would not have had the slightest additional degree of movement whether we had exited in this way or not.  This is a lovely sunny day - I am taking this line from somebody I heard on the radio because it is a very good analogy - but one would be a bloody fool to say one would not get an umbrella because it is sunny today.  One does not know what will happen tomorrow.  It might well rain.  Conditions change all the time.  The economic situation is very volatile.  The projected results for this economy from the OECD are very disappointing.  They show some small growth.  I do not mean to be hypercritical of the Government.  I am sounding a bit of a warning.  The United States of America is bound to have another crash.  I have not the slightest doubt that there will be another really severe wallop there because quantitative easing continues at a rate of $85 billion per month.  That is not going into productive industry.  It is going straight into the stock market.  It is going from a housing bubble into a stock market bubble and when that collapses, the whole house of cards will be up in the air.</p> <p>We must fight for fairness.  The Germans must be told we played a significant role in rescuing their financial system.  It is not just Germany plus the rest, and we are all the little peons working at their dictates.  It is the whole of Europe and what is good for Europe.  I predicted quite a number of years ago that either we would end up with a full fiscal union, which is the direction in which we are going, or the whole thing would blow apart.  We need to take this situation very seriously.  I look forward to the debate.</p></speech>

We were inquiring for her all the time she was away.  Thank God it is a sunny day and she is back.  I would like to pass on my sympathies to Senator Eamonn Coghlan, as I did personally this morning at the mass.  We all got a great shock at Senator Jimmy Harte's accident.  We are all praying for him.  I have no doubt Jimmy has huge strength of character and spirit, and he will make a recovery.  We just hope it is speedy.</p><p>When I came back last night, I watched a very good documentary on Joe Brolly and his campaign for a change in the system of organ donation.  He made an extremely powerful and compelling documentary, which in turn has made an extremely powerful and compelling case.  My understanding is that the Oireachtas health committee has unanimously endorsed the campaign and it has been accepted in Northern Ireland.  I would like to know the Government position on this.  Every day there is a delay in adopting the policy is a day too long.  We need to see action in this area.  What Joe Brolly has done for organ donation in this country is phenomenal.  I was most disappointed at the position of the Irish Kidney Association.  What Joe Brolly and his colleagues are doing is extremely positive.</p></speech>

I would like the Leader, using his good offices, to establish what kind of timeframe we are looking at in order to get an answer from the Government, in particular the Minister for Health, as to when the change Joe Brolly is seeking will become Government policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-19a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1142" speakername="Ned O'Sullivan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013111900006#E00500"><p>Last year, 24,000 horses were destroyed in our meat factories.  The number this year has reduced to 6,000 because of the tightening up of regulations since the horsemeat scandal.  This means we are effectively left with up to 20,000 unwanted horses.  We all know the evidence of this because we have seen it ourselves.  In addition, there is anecdotal evidence that many of these unwanted horses are being kept in unsuitable environments, very often owned by teenagers or even children who are not caring for them properly but are using them until they are finished with them.  These horses are unkempt and their hooves are not looked after.  It is a disgrace that it is happening.</p><p>  As the Leader will have the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to the House shortly, I ask that this issue be on the agenda when he comes.  It is surprising the Minister stated in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that while his Department has a comprehensive strategy in place for the taking into care of unwanted animals, he does not see there is enough need for it at this stage.  Deputy Coveney is a very good Minister but he obviously does not have his eye on the ball on this issue.  This is an embarrassing and shameful story for we, the Irish, who rightfully claim to be horse lovers.  We have always put forward the positive side of the horse racing industry and, as the Cathaoirleach knows, facing into the winter season, we have had Tony McCoy with his 4,000 winners and all the rest of it.  This is the downside of that story.  I appeal to the Leader to ensure it is brought to the attention of Minister.</p><p>  Like everybody else, I am delighted to see Ms Jody Blake back with us in fine fettle.  I sympathise with Senator Eamonn Coghlan on the death of his mother.  I express my shock and deep concern at the accident to our great friend, Senator Jimmy Harte.</p> <p>I hope and pray that he will make a full recovery.</p></speech>

It demonstrates to us all how incredibly fragile life is.  That fragility brings us to an announcement in the UK about a poisonous, malignant and damaging industry that permeates the entire planet, that of child pornography.  I would like the Leader to talk to the Minister and establish once and for all if the Government intends to follow the UK lead.  The US and UK law enforcement agencies have come together to target online abuse.  Microsoft and Google have also come together and ground-breaking engineers have brought out new technology that can spot straight away if somebody is trying to put up a paedophile's abusive video.  There are 100,000 terms that now block searches on Google and these changes will soon apply in 150 languages.  They have built a motorway for us.  This is a serious global problem.  I plead with the Leader to get our motor car and drive down that motorway which has been presented to us on a plate.</p></speech>

We are delighted to see her back with her beautiful smile.  I would also like to extend my sympathy to the Coghlan family and send my best wishes to my dear friend, Jimmy Harte, who is my neighbour down here in the back row.</p><p>I wish the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the rugby authorities well in their bid to bring the rugby world cup to Ireland.  It would be a great day for Ireland if we could get it and a great boost to the economy.  Hopefully we will have good news on that front.</p><p>I would also like to speak today about the LPT helpline.  On a number of occasions recently I have raised issues about the helpline and for some reason nobody there can answer my queries.  I am basically raising this on behalf of the public because if I have these queries, so does the rest of the public.  They must be having difficulty getting answers to simple questions.  For example, one person who paid the tax last year cannot now pay it online for some reason.  There is something outstanding and he cannot get into the system.  One person paid a certain amount last year and should pay double this year, but has been told to pay treble the amount instead.  These people cannot get answers to these questions.  People are left waiting a very long time for a reply and when they receive a reply, they are often told that somebody will ring them back, but nobody does.  I do not think the helpline is working very well on this occasion.  All of these things will have teething problems, but this is the second year of it and it should be up and running by now.  I intend to table this issue for the Adjournment debate but if it is not accepted, I would like the Minister to come in to the House to address the problem with us and try to fix things for the public.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in Party, I offer my condolences to Senator Coghlan on the passing of his mother.  I also wish Senator Jimmy Harte a speedy recovery and we in Sinn F&eacute;in send our best wishes to his party colleagues.  We are all friends of Jimmy and we want to see him back on his feet as quickly as possible.  He is in all our thoughts and prayers at the moment.</p><p>I wish to raise a disturbing issue with the Leader.  At the moment, 15 boats are tied up in Kilmore Quay in County Wexford.  The vessels will not be allowed back to sea unless they sign an affidavit which they have not yet seen.  This has apparently come from the Department.</p> <p>A total of 100 self-employed fishermen are affected.  They are now out of work coming up to Christmas.  As everybody knows, self-employed people find it very difficult to get social welfare, so they will be in a very vulnerable situation.  Staff who work in processing plants will also be affected.</p><p>Our party's spokesman on this area met with the owners of the boats this morning.  We were given some very important information about the quotas.  At the heart of this is the fact that the quotas are insufficient for fishermen to make a viable and sustainable living.  The megs - monkfish and megrim - quota is the bone of contention.  Irish fishermen in Area 7 off the south east coast have achieved 92% of their quota.  That is very difficult to achieve given that these tonnages are set on a monthly basis and if there is any bad weather, the quota is lost for that month.  To reach 92% is a high achievement.  French fishermen have only used 33% of their quota.  There is a clear and simple demand from Irish fishermen that the Irish Government negotiate with the French.  If the French are not using their quotas, as appears to be the case, those quotas should be made available to Irish fishermen.  Clearly, it is difficult for many fishing vessels and fishermen to make a living at present due to the restrictive quotas, and that situation is made even worse when foreign trawlers are not using up their quotas.</p><p>I appeal to the Leader to talk to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about this issue and to try to secure his intervention to resolve it and get those fishing vessels back to sea as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I also extend my best wishes to Senator Jimmy Harte for a speedy recovery.  Our thoughts are with him and his family today.</p><p>I congratulate the transition year students and the staff of Salerno secondary school in Salthill, County Galway, who are participating in a trial course, Young Minds Online.  A total of 50 transition year students will become social media ambassadors.  They will engage with their peers and other teenagers to help them learn about social media or online etiquette, such as safeguarding one's privacy online, handling one's online reputation and one's digital footprint, and helping to report and tackle cyber-bullying.  This is an excellent example of young people taking the lead in raising awareness about online etiquette and about tackling, combating and reporting cyber-bullying.  There was another excellent example of raising awareness of cyber-bullying, which we debated in this Chamber, in the case of Waterford Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, which produced a cyber code a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>This is important.  The key message is that young people should be leading the way.  If this trial course is successful, it will be rolled out across the country.  Salerno secondary school will also produce a policy document.  This will be not just for teenagers but also for adults, who often find the online social media challenging.  It is important that we are all aware of the dangers of online activities.</p></speech>

She might bring some law and order to a sometimes unruly House.  I also extend my sympathy to Senator Eamonn Coghlan on the death of his mother.</p><p>I shared a platform with Senator Jimmy Harte on the night before his tragic accident.  It was on the serious topic of a united Ireland but Senator Harte managed to bring it around to his much beloved issue of soccer, a united soccer team and whether he was in favour of Roy Keane's return.  He was always a man who brought levity to sometimes very serious topics.</p><p>Will the Leader find out from the Government Chief Whip when the legislation to ban smoking in cars when children are present, which was introduced by Senators Crown, van Turnhout and I over two years ago, will be progressed?  The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, came to the House to discuss it and we were told it would be progressed.  Two years later, a legislative measure that is not two and a half pages long and with which nobody disagrees has moved virtually nowhere.  Will the Leader check out the position in that regard?</p> <p> On the human tissue Bill, which subject was debated during the summer recess when the Seanad was recalled, some of the Members on the Government were told in their briefing notes and stated on the record of the House that the human tissue Bill would be brought in before the end of the year.  There is no timeline on the Government programme for it.  The year is almost at an end and we have not seen it progressed.  Senator Martin Conway spoke about the issue of presumed consent but we should be clear about that.  The head of the most successful organ transplant office in the world, the Spanish Transplant Authority, has stated that Government policy - I mean successive Government policy - is killing people because we do not have two things in place.  It has nothing to do with presumed consent, an opt in or an opt out model.</p><p>The two things we need are a national transplant authority and organ donor co-ordinators in hospitals.  That is what works.  It works in the North where there are 27 organ donor co-ordinators in hospitals.  There is no point having a presumed consent, an opt in or an opt out model if there is not somebody present to ask the families whether they would consider donating their loved ones' organs.  Not having a national transplant authority is one of this country's critical failings in this area.  We were one of the last countries in Europe to adopt the EU directive, the premise of which I do not disagree with, but its implementation was flawed.  It was the first time in the history of the State that we had legislation on organ donation, yet it was not done right.  Even worse, not one Senator, Deputy or even the health committee saw that legislation before the Minister signed it into Irish law.</p><p>The Leader might find out from the Government Whip when the human tissue Bill - the introduction of which was promised here, in front of all the Members, before the end of the year - will be brought forward.  I can provide the Leader with the extract from the Official Report when it was stated on the record that it would be introduced before the end of the year.</p></speech>

I also welcome Jody Blake back to the House.</p><p>I very much appreciate the assistance and co-operation of the Fianna F&aacute;il Whip, Senator Diarmuid Wilson, at this very difficult time for us.  I am sure all Members will understand that we are all very upset about Senator Harte and we wish for him and his family that he has a speedy recovery.</p><p>I welcome the announcement yesterday from the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, that she has identified 40 unfinished so-called ghost estates that she wants to have cleared within the next 12 months.  This is to be by agreement with the owners and developers of these estates.  Interestingly, only one in five of the ghost estates that remain to be resolved are in the possession of NAMA.  Therefore, many of the developers involved in these remaining ghost estates are small-scale developers and these loans in respect of them are held by the banks directly.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that progress has been made on the issue of ghost estates in that there are fewer than 1,300 compared with nearly 1,800 this time last year and that money has been made available by Government, &euro;5 million up to now and an additional &euro;10 million announced in the budget this year, to complete those estates that can be finished.  I believe we would all accept that they are worst blot on the landscape remaining from the Celtic tiger days.  Apart from asking the Leader to invite the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, into the House to discuss the progress that has been made on unfinished estates, this issue raises another more serious issue, namely, that very significant development levies were raised by local authorities from the construction sector during the Celtic tiger years.  Could the Minister of State be asked to give an account to this House of the balance of development levies that are left in the accounts of local authorities and what is being done with that money?  It is my understanding that a very significant sum of money remains with local authorities that was raised by development levies.</p><p>I am also aware there are difficulties in having local authorities take into charge estates that were built during the Celtic tiger years.  In spite of a circular letter that was issued, I believe, in 2008 that was supposed to speed up this process, I am aware that many local authorities will not now take into charge estates that were built in the 2000s.  Will the Leader invite the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to come into the House to give us a report on that?</p></speech>

I am doing some work in this area.  It is costing the State up to &euro;3 million to dispose of abandoned horses every year.  It is costing Galway County Council &euro;824 per horse to have them lifted.  This year to date, about &euro;220,000 has been spent by Galway County Council.</p><p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to postpone taking Committee Stage of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions ) Bill 2013 today until we have had hearings on this subject.  Company law is complex.  There needs to be a briefing on this Bill from those with expertise before it goes any further.  I looked at the Second Stage debate last week, which lasted about an hour and 15 minutes.  That is not adequate for such a complex Bill.  We have suffered from corporate vandalism and white collar crime in this country.  I heard Senator Bacik call for a debate on white collar crime today.  White collar crime happens in companies as well.  Our Government has spoken about a pre-legislative stage so that experts come in and brief Members of the Houses.  Can anyone tell me about an area that needs briefings more than company law?  Big business is complex and its machinations are not understood by the majority of people.  I would say this also applies to Members of this House, including myself.  I hope that we would get a serious debate on that issue.  I am tabling an amendment to the Order of Business and I ask the House to slow it down, postpone it and have hearings.  We have the public consultation process here which we could use as well.  We should not push this Bill through without proper debate.</p></speech>

Our thoughts are with him and his family at this very difficult time.</p><p>I join in the joy to see our friend and colleague, Ms Jody Blake, back with us and looking so well.  It is good to see that smile back in the Chamber once more.  I welcome the announcement yesterday that President Higgins will make an historic visit to the UK in April.  It reflects the growing maturity and excellent relations between our countries.  We are all very conscious of the very fragile peace process we have in Northern Ireland and I hope this visit will help in a meaningful way.  As elected Members, we all need to play a part in cementing that peace process and now that Seanad &Eacute;ireann has a renewed mandate, I ask the Leader to reactivate our invitation to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to come to the House so we can have some discussions on the peace process and how we as Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann can help.  </p><p>On a related matter, we are getting closer to 2016, which could be a very significant day for many of us in this House.  I ask the Leader for a debate with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht on plans to commemorate the 1916 Rising and other significant centenaries we will celebrate in the following years.  There is concern out there that not enough effort and thought are being put into marking this very significant historical event.  Historically, we need to mark it but there is also an opportunity to bring many people into our country over the next number of years to build on the tremendous work done during The Gathering.  We will have so many significant events to mark, it would be a pity if this is not well organised, marketed and planned in an appropriate manner.</p></speech>

I understand he is making great progress.  We wish him well and look forward to having him back here in the Chamber as soon as possible.</p><p>I welcome the proposed state visit by President Higgins to England next year.  He will be the first President of Ireland to do so.  I welcome the progress in the relations between our two islands, in particular, during the past two decades.  I wish the Government well and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar and his colleagues, in their application to be joint hosts with Northern Ireland of the 2023 rugby world cup.  This would be a great occasion for our island and it offers very great tourism potential and media exposure.  We are too small to apply to host any of the other major international tours except for the cricket tour.  My leader has informed me that we are quite capable of hosting it and maybe we should apply to host a future one.</p></speech>

I hope she missed us as much as we missed her.  It is great to her back at work.  I share in the expression of condolences to Senator Eamonn Coghlan on his recent bereavement.  We were all very shocked and upset to hear of Senator Jimmy Harte's accident on Friday night.  It is a real mark of the man to note the number of telephone calls I received from people of all parties in this House and the other House.  It is unique to see the esteem in which he is held.  We hope and trust he will be back here in the Chamber very soon.  We could say that Jimmy will be winning matches again here.</p><p>I wish to draw the attention of the House to a crisis in the Cork branch of Samaritans, the suicide charity, which is running out of money.  It takes a budget of &euro;80,000 to run the Cork office.  It seems that due to a falling-off in contributions the available funding will be about half of that amount.  Samaritans depend very much on the Christmas period to raise a substantial amount of money.  I hope they will be successful in doing so.</p><p>This brings me to the main point I wish to raise.  I ask for a discussion in the Chamber on the ways in which some charities are being funded.  All charities are very worthy and very good but some of them are doing work which might rightly better fall to the State.  Perhaps the State should reassess how it funds many of our charities.</p></speech>

The major Companies Bill is on the way and will take a long while, but we cannot expect to be spoon-fed collectively.

For weeks, I have discussed builders, developers, planners, county councillors, estate agents, accountants and architects, particularly in the context of Priory Hall.  Not one of them has been brought to book.  We all attended the Lower House and listened while &euro;10 million was handed out to the residents of Priory Hall, and rightly so.  They had nowhere to live after buying apartments that had not been built properly.  Answers must be given.  The Minister of State must tell the Seanad why no one has been brought to book when, at the same time, the public is constantly expected to put up with austerity and losing money and work.  I call for the Minister of State to tell the House what is happening with the ghost estates and why so many people who have no houses still have nowhere to go even though they have been on lists for years.  This is approximately the fifth time that I have asked for this explanation.  We are half-lemmings to dole out money to the people who have caused these problems before they walked away.</p></speech>

I commiserate with the Coghlan family and wish Senator Jimmy Harte a speedy recovery.</p><p>I wish to be associated with Senator Healy Eames's amendment to the Order of Business.  We had a most interesting speech on it by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I learned far more from her speech than is apparent from the Bill.  I compliment her on all her visits to the House.  What is at stake is not an issue between both sides of the House.  This is how we regulate accounts and one must be concerned about that.  Back in 2008, Ms Karen Erwin, the then chairperson of the regulatory body, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, commented on the shock to the system which poor accounting standards had imposed, but we have not dealt with that.  Rather than changing the way we regulate accounts as a by-product of the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, we should have it up front with a full discussion and the involvement of people such as Professor Brendan Walsh, the current chair of the IAASA and his predecessor, Ms Karen Erwin.</p><p>There is an amount of redacted material on accounts.  In addition, the existing regulatory bodies have failed.  Every year, the chartered accountants body has been fined by the IAASA.  If the State takes on these functions from the professional accountancy bodies, which is what is being sought, will we be liable?  Why have we not got anything back for the &euro;64 billion which the bad accounting of Irish banks failed to discover in the case of Ernst &amp;amp; Young and in the case of Anglo Irish Bank, or any of the other banks either?  They were all under investigation.  The reports for 2011 have that dreaded phrase &quot;redacted&quot;, which I hate.</p><p>We have to approach the regulation of financial institutions in Ireland in its own context with plenty of time.  It is not an issue between both sides of the House.  If we let accountants off the hook the public will want to know what Seanad &Eacute;ireann is doing.  They will ask why they voted &quot;No&quot; to the proposed abolition of this House.  There are serious issues which the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, highlighted much better than the legislation does.  The legislation appears to be fairly benign but the Minister of State's speech is well worth reading.  This is an attempt to transfer the burden of regulating accountants from their own professional bodies to us as taxpayers.  I have tabled some amendments which we can discuss, if the Leader so wishes.  It is such a major point of principle that we should not let bankers or accountants off the hook for the damage they did to this country in 2008.</p></speech>

We wish him well and hope he has a speedy recovery.  I also wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy to Senator Eamonn Coghlan on the death of his mother.  I welcome back Ms Jody Blake who has brought a sense of calmness to the Chamber today.  I call on the Leader to reply.</p></speech>

I understand that the Minister gave the HSE a further ten days to report back to him, so we will await that.</p> <p>I will update the House on progress on that matter.  </p><p>With regard to the ECB rate cut and the Minister's view on it, I will inquire whether the Minister proposes to make a statement on the matter.  As pointed out by Deputy O'Brien, it is not the Minister's intention to micromanage the banks.  However, I agree that his view on the matter should be sought.</p><p>I agree with Senators Bacik and Michael Mullins that the State visit to Britain by the President, Michael D. Higgins, is to be welcomed.  It is important in the context of relations between both countries, which have regularised and improved in recent years.  This visit will I am sure, given the Queen's visit to Ireland, be welcomed by all.  Senator Bacik also called for a debate on white collar and cyber crime.  While we had a debate on this issue recently, I will try to arrange a further debate.</p><p>Senator Norris welcomed China's apparent dismantling of the forced labour camps and commented on climate change and the freak weather conditions in recent times in the US, the Philippines and Sardinia.  He also called for a debate on the bailout exit.  I will try to arrange that debate.  I hope that Senator Norris's forecast of gloom for the US economy does not transpire for everybody's sake.</p><p>Senator Conway raised the issue of presumed consent for organ donations and Mr. Joe Brolly's documentary in this regard.  He also called for clarification of the Government's position on this issue and, like Senator Mark Daly, asked about progress on the human tissue Bill.  I will ascertain from the Minister when that Bill will come before the House.</p><p>Senators O'Sullivan and Healy Eames raised the issue of the number of unwanted animals roaming our countryside and, in many cases, the cost of disposal of these animals.  Senator O'Sullivan mentioned that approximately 24,000 animals were destroyed last year.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is well aware of the situation but I will bring the matter to his attention.</p><p>Senator Mary-Ann O'Brien raised the issue of child pornography and online abuse and the steps being taken in the UK in this regard.  She also asked that the stance of the Irish Government be obtained.  I am sure we will follow in the footsteps of the UK in this regard and I hope that this will be done sooner rather than later.</p><p>Senators Moloney, Wilson and Noone spoke of Ireland's application to host the rugby world cup.  It would be excellent in tourism and sports terms if our world cup bid was successful.</p><p>Senator Moloney also referred to problems with the helpline in regard to payment of the property tax and stated that in some cases callers are waiting up to 20 minutes for their calls to be answered.  I hope that as indicated by Senator Moloney she will table the matter for discussion on the Adjournment.  </p><p>Senator Cullinane raised the issue of the dispute at Kilmore Quay fisheries in regard to restrictive quotas.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has welcomed the commencement of crucial international negotiations on mackerel quotas in the North East Atlantic.  These negotiations are being hosted by Ireland in the National Seafood Centre in Clonakilty, which is in Senator O'Donovan's constituency.  Senator O'Donovan has also raised this issue in the House on several occasions.  As mackerel is the single most important stock of fish for the Irish fleet and the value of the international mackerel industry is estimated to be &euro;1 billion annually to the parties, we need to secure agreement at international level on the management arrangements of this stock and all quotas.</p> <p>I take on board Senator Cullinane's comments.</p><p>Senator Naughton complimented Salerno secondary school in Galway on an EU project and also the Waterford Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, representatives of which appeared before a committee of the House to discuss cyberbullying.</p><p>Senator Daly spoke about legislation on banning smoking in cars.  I understand the Department of Health is seeking legal advice on one outstanding issue on the Bill.  I agree that progress has been less than satisfactory.  I will urge the Department to make progress on the Bill as a matter of urgency.  The Minister came to the House and said he fully supported the legislation.  I cannot understand why advice on one issue is still outstanding after such a length of time.  I will certainly bring the matter to the Minister's attention.  I have spoken about the human tissue Bill and I will get an update on that matter for the Senator.</p><p>Senator Hayden spoke about ghost estates the number of which has reduced from 1,800 to 1,300, which indicates that progress has been made.  She also sought a report on the balance of levies raised and in the possession of local authorities.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, to come to the House to address that matter and also another angle on that matter raised by Senator O'Donnell regarding the accountability of engineers, architects, legal professionals and others who signed off on many of these houses.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is in the House, I hope those matters will be addressed.  I fully agree with Senator O'Donnell's sentiments.</p><p>In response to Senators Healy Eames and Coghlan, the Bill before us this week is the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, not the Companies Bill.  This is a small specific Bill to which a number of amendments have been tabled.  The Companies Bill will come to us in the new year.  It may be introduced as a Seanad Bill to the best of my knowledge.  I am sure there will be significant briefings on the other Bill, which is the large Bill to which the Senator was alluding as opposed to this Bill.  I ask the Senator to withdraw her amendment to the Order of Business because I believe there was a slight mix-up between the two Bills.</p></speech>

I think I had made most of my contribution.  I was explaining that the parliamentary activities allowance is the means by which the State supports our parliamentary system, which is based on political parties.  Most of us in this House joined political parties because we subscribed to the collective party policies.  From the comments made by Senators on the previous occasion it might be useful for me to explain the rationale and function of the calculation method used to determine the amount paid to parliamentary leaders to date for what is called the parliamentary activities allowance.</p><p>The purpose of the allowance is to support the parliamentary activities of parties.  It is not a salary for the leader, although I believe in ancient times one or two leaders regarded it as such but-----</p></speech>

It is not a payment to be divvied out among the members for their own use.  In order to calculate the level of support which will be paid to a party it was decided to base the total amount of funding on the number of Deputies and Senators elected or nominated to each of the Houses.  Other funding sources use different metrics, as I explained, such as the share of first preference votes used in the case of electoral supports but this is the method used to support parliamentary activity in the House.</p><p>As there are economies of scale for larger parties a flat rate per member would give large parties an advantage.  That is the reason it is a sliding scale - the more members the party has, the less the marginal amount.  It is to ensure that even small parties would have a coherent sum of money to provide the press office, the basic research and so on rather than over-advantage larger parties.  That is the way it works.</p><p>Similarly, the reduction of one third of the allowance payable in respect of Deputies applies to parties in government.  Even when we rebalance for scale we rebalance against parties in government because it is assumed they have additionality in terms of governmental supports that Opposition parties do not have, and that is the reason they are reduced by one third.</p><p>The legislation provides for a calculation based on a certain number of members.  It does not prescribe the amount to be spent in regard to individual members by a party, nor should it.  It is a matter for the party to determine.  It is a pool of resources for parliamentary activities and whether they want to use it primarily for primary research or more of it for public analysis - people do focus groups, public seminars and so - that is a matter for the parties.</p><p>That is the reason the mechanism is in place.  Parties provide a stable basis for the formation of both Governments and effective opposition.  That is not to be in any way disparaging of Independent Members of either House who have played historically a very important part but the basic units to form a stable Government here and in most western democracies is a political party.</p><p>It is the nature of political parties that members join and members leave, often for the best and most honourable of motives.  It would be wrong if a situation resulting from the internal issues of a party could lead to a change in the balance of supports to political parties.  Losing or gaining members in the lifetime of a D&aacute;il or Seanad should not affect the resources to the party.  As I said on the last occasion, parties make a determination.</p> <p>They construct a support and staff base.  They sign contracts and it cannot be that this would be dislodged because it would be an internal change in the middle of a parliament. </p><p> It is the vote of the people that determines who is elected to the D&aacute;il and that of the panels and selection criteria who becomes a Member of the Seanad.  That is determined on election day.  The parliamentary support system is put into place on that basis and in my judgment it cannot be dislodged in the life of that Parliament without reference back to the people.  While I am aware that the proposers of this amendment intend that the money would go back to the Exchequer it is then money lost to parliamentary activity which is important.</p><p> I recall during the debate on the funding of politics - and I will not refer to some of the unseemly things that happened such as quanta of money being paid to the party political system or individuals - we tried to change all of that with ethics legislation and electoral law change and the suite of measures that we brought in during the 1990s.  The <i>quid pro quo</i>was that since we would prohibit that sort of funding of political parties there would be State funding, not only for political parties but for parliamentary activity, which could not be funded in any other way.  It would also be done transparently so that if a candidate followed the agenda of a person with deep pockets that person could not endow the candidate to the extent of giving him or her an electoral advantage.  That is my view.  That set of proposals has been resilient up to now and for that reason I am not minded to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I like in particular his subtle but interesting change of philosophy in response to our amendment.  A fortnight ago he made a strong political argument that once people decide to leave a political party, and he referred particularly to the D&aacute;il, it would be his personal preference that they resign their seats and put their names before the electorate.  I do not know whether Deputy Gilmore, Deputy Rabbitte or Deputy Kathleen Lynch had a word in his ear but that view seems to have disappeared.  That was his strong argument a fortnight ago for not accepting our amendment.  He argued that people who stepped out of a particular party, and he referred particularly to the D&aacute;il rather than the Seanad, should resign their seats.  I disagreed with the Minister on that point.  I never proposed that Deputies Rabbitte, Gilmore or Kathleen Lynch should resign their D&aacute;il seats when they left the Workers' Party.  There are changes that happen in politics for various political or ideological reasons that bring about a change in people's status be they Independent or former members of a party.</p><p>Last week, the Minister dropped that argument and went on to suggest, as he has done today to a lesser extent, that an election take place because the electorate sends X number of Deputies to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad and that a party establishes its structure, staffing arrangements and plans accordingly, with set financing.  A party structure in the immediate aftermath of an election is put in place for a certain number of Deputies and Senators.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or the Labour Party decide to put a structure in place because they have X Deputies and Y Senators.  It is not unrealistic to say that once that quantum of Members changes there is a new political situation.  The Minister is correct to say that the party allowance is not allocated to an individual Member.</p> <p>I repeat that the legislation is very prescriptive as to what the money can be spent on.  It lists in black and white, or yellow, that it is to be spent on matters such as research, training, policy formulation, consultant services, opinion polling and purchase of support services for the parliamentary party.  Deputy Howlin is the line Minister who is attempting to defend the indefensible.  My very simple question last week, and I do not believe it is possible for the Minister to answer it in the affirmative, is whether the Fine Gael parliamentary party will spend any of that money on myself or Senator Healy Eames.  For example, will the Fine Gael parliamentary party spend the money under the research and training heading on Senator Healy Eames and myself?  Will the Labour Party parliamentary party spend any money under the policy formulation heading on Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall or Senator James Heffernan?</p><p>I submit to the Minister that moneys cannot legally be spent by the political parties under those headings for Members who have already left the parliamentary party but for whom money is still being handed over by the taxpayer to the party headquarters.  I simply do not believe it is possible to justify the parliamentary parties keeping the allowances in respect of Members who have left the parliamentary party.  The reason for the Members leaving is irrelevant.  The fact is that the major political parties are receiving taxpayers' money to spend on policy formulation, research and training for Members who are no longer within the parliamentary party.  It is not possible to justify that.  With his hat on as reform Minister, I again make the case to the Minister that if we want to bring about this new politics, which I believe most politicians and political parties promised at the last general election and which is urgently required, it is not living up to that aspiration to simply state that taxpayers' money can be handed over to a political party in respect of Members who are no longer part of that political party.</p><p>We have ploughed and harrowed the case.  We have had the Minister here on three occasions.  First, it was to know the Minister's views as to what people should do if they leave a parliamentary party, last week it was about the fact the parliamentary parties and headquarters put staff in place and that no changes can be made in that respect, and the Minister has expanded on that theme again today.  In my view, taxpayers' money was allocated in respect of Members on the basis that they would remain in a political party.  If they either leave of their own accord or, indeed, are forced out of the parliamentary party, that money should remain unclaimed.  We are talking in this year of some &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000.  It is not going to balance the nation's books but &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 is a lot of money and, over the remaining course of this Parliament, we are talking about a minimum of &euro;1.5 million being, I believe wrongly, handed over to political parties.  I do not believe it is possible to justify it.</p><p>While I do not want to press this matter to a vote today, I will certainly revisit it on Report Stage.  I would ask the Minister to again talk to his Cabinet colleagues and, on the basis of fairness, accountability and transparency, to reflect on what this money is scheduled to be spent upon, to acknowledge the fact it cannot be spent upon those of us who have left the parliamentary party and to ask the question, therefore, of why it should be paid by the taxpayers to a parliamentary party in respect of Members who are no longer within the parliamentary party.  It is a relatively black and white issue.  A school would not get a capitation grant in respect of pupils who have left the school.  Hospitals being paid on a per-patient basis would not receive money in respect of patients who have left the hospital.  An employer does not pay wages for people who have left its employment.  Why should a parliamentary party receive money on the basis of Members who are no longer within the parliamentary party?</p></speech>

This is an interesting process.  There is something fundamentally wrong and unfair about the way the business of party allowances is being done at the moment for Members who find themselves, often for very honourable motives, outside the party Whip system in the middle of a term.  We want the Minister to think this one through and come up with a way that would be acceptable to live with.  As it stands at the moment, it is not acceptable or fair.</p><p>Senator O'Keeffe made a good point last week, as did the Minister today, that there are costs to running a political system.  However, I felt there was a bias towards the party system because it was only a case of funding parties.  What about Independents?  The Minister made a very valid point today that this is about how the State supports the parliamentary system.  Should the State not support Independents who find themselves outside the parliamentary Whip system in the midst of a term?  Surely we are no less parliamentarians than Members of a political party.  I think not, nor do the people who elected us feel that way.</p><p>The Minister also mentioned that parties make commitments to staff following elections, and that was a valid argument, but it does not hold.  In the middle of a term during the last parliamentary session, Deputy George Lee resigned.  His secretary was not kept on.  She was let go.  No commitment made to her was kept.  Senator van Turnhout made a very valid argument that we can always give a notice period, and that there is nothing wrong with stating that there is three months' notice.  Senator Bradford and I are out of the Fine Gael Party since last July, so I think it would be valid if there was a cooling off period whereby a party could retain the allowance for a certain number of months.  We could live with that, but it is not fair that people conducting parliamentary business are not equally validated by the allowance system.</p><p>We are very honourably saying that at the very least, the moneys should be given back to the Exchequer.  However, given his logic last week and following the debate, a number of people said to us that on the basis of his argument, it would be appropriate for those of us who were members of a party but who are now independent to build the appropriate party for the services we are getting paid for as a result of being elected Members.</p> <p>Is the Minister saying that is appropriate?  The current logic does not follow.  Between the Members of Seanad &Eacute;ireann and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann at least four members of the Labour Party and eight members of Fine Gael, a total of 12, have left their parties.  Is the Minister saying those Members do not have costs in running their political affairs?  Of course they do.  Are those costs any less because they exercised a conscience vote or otherwise?  They are not.</p><p>As it stands, this is an insider job for parties and that is not good business.  It is not transparent, honest, open and certainly not reforming.  Let us face the fact that I and all Members, including the Minister and the Government, stood for election on the basis of reform and doing things better with less.  This is about trying to get more for less; it is trying to keep a lot more money for fewer Members.  That is not fair or just.  As Senator Bradford said, we will not push it to a vote today.  We will see the process through.  We want it to be open, honest, transparent and, above all, fair.  Everyone deserves a chance, and every parliamentary party Member and Independent Member deserves a chance.  There is a cost to their doing business, so let the cost go to the person to whom it belongs.  In this case we are putting up our hands and saying that we are happy that our allowances be given back to the State.</p></speech>

As I tried to explain to Senator Bradford, clearly very inadequately, his presentation is a fundamental misunderstanding, certainly a misrepresentation of the facts.  It is not the Senator's money, as he put it.  He said, &quot;It is not for me&quot;.  It is not for the Senator, no more than the Labour Party allocation is for me.  It is not his money to take away with him anywhere.</p><p>  It is a determination that we support parliamentary activities in Parliament <i>qua</i> parliament.  The legal mechanism is that we make that determination at the outset of the Parliament, on foot of the numbers elected by the people to sit in these Houses.  We do it on a sliding scale to avoid over-endowing the larger parties and on a differential basis to specifically advantage the Opposition over the Government.  I have explained that <i>ad nauseam</i>.  The notion that the money is not spent on the Senator is a fundamental misrepresentation of the truth.  It is not for the Senator, no more than the Labour Party money is for me.  It is for the activities of my parliamentary family in research, support, policy formation, promulgating our views, allowing people to communicate with us and in all the matters the Senator listed as being allowed.</p><p>  I have known Senator Bradford for a long time and I know he is a bright individual, so it is obviously my lack of communication that has failed to explain that fundamental issue.  It is not the Senator's money to take away or to give back to anybody.  If one thinks logically about it, there is no fixed sum of money.  When the Senator was a member of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, was he among the first ten or the second ten?  How much money was his out of the pot?  That is not the way it works.  It is not assigned to individuals.  It is determined by the full scale of the party returned to Parliament by determination of the people or the electoral process.</p><p>  I am a little confused by the presentation of Senator Healy Eames.  She said on a number of occasions that every Member deserves a chance and asked if they were lesser beings.</p> <p>The amendment proposes that the State should take back the money, not that it should be given to anybody.  It does not matter in terms of endowing anybody or about those concerned being lesser people or anything else.  Deputy Healy Eames would not be any better off if her amendment were carried.  It would simply mean that small pool of money, relatively speaking, would be lost to the activities of Parliament and that is something I would not support.  I certainly would not support the notion that a Member would be advantaged by walking away from a political party that had been determined by the people, or by the electoral system that elects Members to this House, and that Member could take their allowance with them.</p></speech>

That would be seen for what it was.  The Senator wants her little pot of money and to walk away with it.</p><p>I also want to say that what I said on the first occasion has been misrepresented again by Senator Bradford.  What I suggested in terms of resigning was that if a Member wanted his or her own allowance, there was a way to do that.  I was elected to the other House under the banner of the Labour Party with the resources of that party behind me, the discernment of my selection convention who wanted a Labour Party candidate to stand and for whom to canvass, and the unpaid work of scores of party members to elect me to the House.  It would be quite wrong for me to be able to say that I can make a discernment and nullify all that work and not give them the chance to put somebody in my stead if I had a conscientious objection.  If I felt that I could not in conscience remain, the right thing to do would be to resign, and then to get a fresh mandate from the people as an Independent.  One could then, rightly and morally,  take one's pool of money at that stage, but it is quite a different kettle of fish to do so in the context that was put forward here.</p><p>I have been around this course three times and have heard the same arguments three times.  I do not think we are going to have a meeting of minds on it because I understand that at the heart of this is a debate that is not about this Bill.  I am very conscious of that.  When people lecture me about reform, democracy and everything else when the point at issue amounts to simply taking money away from the political party of which they are no longer a member, I have to think about that.  The essence of the Bill before us comprises two main planks.  I am a little concerned that we are spending endless hours on the ancillary rather than the core of the Bill.  The two core elements of it are, first, to reduce the allowance to all political parties by 10% as a contribution towards reducing the overall costs and, second, to bring accountability, extending it from the parties which are, and always were, required to have audited, accounted and transparent accountability for the money they receive and to transfer that to all Independent Members.  Independent Members who are elected as Independent Members are entitled to a parliamentary allowance that is analogous to the sums given to the parties.  They now will be required in the normal way, in the same way as parties, to account for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-19a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1121" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013111900023#X00800"><p>I have three brief observations.  I agree with the Minister that we will not reach a consensus on this.  I assure him that this debate is about the Bill and what is contained in it.  As the Minister rightly said, the Bill is about saving money, approximately 10% of taxpayers' hard-earned cash.  We have put forward a proposal that would save another small amount of money, &euro;1.5 million or thereabouts, over the next three years, which is an amount not to be sneezed at.</p><p>The Minister said that the calculations are done on a sliding scale and therefore it is not a question of money being for A, B, or C.  I accept that the money is calculated on the basis of a sliding scale but the argument I put to him once again is that people no longer within a parliamentary party cannot be considered part of that sliding scale.  It is grossly unfair that he is unwilling to accept our argument in that regard.</p><p>We can all check what we said a fortnight ago because it is on the record of the House.  The Minister spoke about when people in their &quot;preciousness&quot; decided to vote against the parliamentary party.</p> <p>The Minister referred in particular to Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and he suggested, not I, that people who voted against the party in their preciousness, as he described it, should leave their seats in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and present themselves in a by-election.</p></speech>

I did not suggest then that he should leave his D&aacute;il seat and face a by-election.  I did not say it about the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, or anyone else because politics brings about its own events.</p></speech>

I am sure that when the Minister sits down with his friends in the leadership of his party, he will find that they had their own reasons for leaving the Workers Party, joining New Agenda which became Democratic Left and finally joining the Labour Party.  I did not question their motives or their validity as elected representatives or disagree with their decisions.  That is what the Minister said a fortnight ago, not I, when he referred to people and their preciousness.</p><p>What is before us today is the preciousness of democracy.  We all agree that politics should be funded and that there is an urgent need for reform but I do not think anybody can validly say that a political party should be in receipt of moneys for an incorrect number of parliamentarians.  The sliding scale to which the Minister refers is no longer appropriate in respect of Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il or the Labour Party.  I think Fianna F&aacute;il is okay at the moment from a numbers point of view but Fine Gael, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Labour Party are receiving party allowances for persons who are no longer within their parliamentary parties.</p></speech>

It certainly makes no sense from a reform perspective.  I will leave it at that.  If the Minister wants to call my argument precious, fair enough.  I think it is a very straightforward political argument and I hope we would be mature enough to accept that in the so-called new politics which we are trying to generate, we do not have to do things as they were done heretofore.  The Minister spoke about what he described as unseemly things being done previously.  I think this is quite an unseemly thing to do.  It is allowing parliamentary parties to keep money in respect of calculations which no longer exist.</p></speech>

This would be particularly true in the case of Fine Gael because there has been such anger, such a hardline attitude has been taken towards them and they have been thrown out of the party.

I do not recall significant hard feeling, although Senator Walsh can correct me.

They just want to get rid of these people out of the party because they voted a different way on a matter of conscience.  I think we need to take a stand on this issue.  The public would support them if the issue managed to gain traction in the media which has not happened as yet.</p><p>I point to a flaw in the legislation going back to 2001.  It was mentioned on Second Stage although I was not here for the previous Committee Stage debate.  Senators are not elected as members of political parties.  When I was first elected, I asked how the party got the allowance in respect of me.  I know it is not my money - the Minister does not need to remind me - it is the party's money and the party needs it.  We fill out a form on our first day to say what party we belong to but there is no reference in the legislation to this practice.  I suggest the officials should look at that because nobody is elected to the Seanad as a member of a party.  Had any one of us chosen to be an Independent Member at that time, the allowance would have been paid to us as Independent Members.  That is the legal position because we are not elected as members of a political party.  The Minister should look at that because it is a flaw going back to 2001.  There is no designation at any point in the Seanad election to describe one's membership of a political party.</p></speech>

It is not the Labour Party's money nor the Fine Gael Party's money.  It is certainly not the money of Senator Bradford or myself.  It is the State's money and that is why we want to give it back to the State now that we have left our parliamentary parties.  I do not think anything could be clearer.  To clarify what I meant about, as the Minister said, "lesser beings", there is a value given to a member of a parliamentary party that is no longer given when he or she is expelled from that parliamentary party.  There is a financial value which remains with the party and that is what I meant.</p><p>The Minister said this debate is not really about what he is talking about at all.  I regard this as quite insulting.  In my view, this debate is about the reform of politics and if it is not, it should be.  This is about how political parties and Independents are funded.

At mid-term or at a point in the D&aacute;il or Seanad term, a re-think is needed when a Member is expelled or leaves a party.  There should be some fair formula found to give the allowance to that person in his or her new status.  As a mark of honour and good faith, we are saying that in our case - Senator Bradford and myself - we would like that allowance to be returned to the State.  Last week, there was a big argument about the &euro;15 fee for a freedom of information request - &euro;1.5 million over the next three years would fund a lot of freedom of information requests in the interests of the citizens of this country.</p><p>My final question follows from what Senator Thomas Byrne said and it is a question I meant to ask the Minister previously.  Members of the Seanad are not on the electoral ballot paper as members of a party.  How then does a party legally get that money? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-19a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013111900026#AA00100"><p>Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht i mo oifig.  It has been interesting, but an important point of principle is at its root.  I listened carefully to the Minister.  Being from Wexford, I am familiar with the discernment of the Labour Party in many elections in selecting him as its candidate.  Equally, he will agree that people in Labour and other parties get votes from party supporters when they run under their parties' banners.  They also attract votes from people who, based on an assessment of the candidates that is right or wrong, support them as individuals.  In many cases, candidates depend on transfers that often come from other party candidates.  An accumulation of support from different strands leads to people being elected.  In this light, it is difficult to maintain the argument that people are elected based purely on party support and that, as a consequence, the allocation of taxpayers' funds to parties should be based on the number of their members elected to the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.</p><p>The individuals who are making this case did not choose to be outside their party.  The people in Fine Gael who supported them supported the Fine Gael platform, which was a pro-life platform, as clearly stated on behalf of the party and in individual pledges.  Individual Labour and Fianna Fail candidates currently sitting in this and the Lower House also made pledges.  As a consequence of the Members in question honouring the commitment they made under the party banner and as individuals on a particular issue of conscience, they found themselves not just leaving the party, but in some instances being bullied out of it.  Given the Minister's background and that of his father, a strong champion of trade unionism in County Wexford, he will recognise that no trade unionist or anyone of a reasonable perspective would condone or support such behaviour.  These Members were not just bullied out of their parliamentary party, but out of their offices.  They were threatened with not being allowed to run for their parties in future.  It was a prime example of bullying in the workplace.  Nothing has been done about it.  Unfortunately, our media has condoned it by being uncritical of what happened.  Among others, the Minister's father, God rest him, would have been strongly vociferous about this type of behaviour in any workplace.</p><p>People have adhered to the platforms on which they and their parties campaigned.  For the sake of political expediency, they have subsequently found themselves being dismissed from their parliamentary party.  In this light, there are real questions surrounding the payment, which is meant to support them in their political work, remaining with the party that bullied them.  The strong principle involved needs to be re-examined.  Perhaps the method through which the State funds political parties needs a root and branch analysis.</p></speech>

If the criterion at present is that people who are elected independently are entitled to those supports, it follows that people in Fine Gael or the Reform Alliance - who find themselves in such as position, although not of their volition - are also entitled to them.</p><p>Senator Byrne referred to my own situation.  A number of us had conscientious objections to a particular issue within our party, and we resigned the whip and left.  However, we did not do so on as fundamental an issue and certainly not on an issue about which the party had clearly given commitments which the Senators and TDs followed through on and honoured.</p><p>At a recent international conference, I was surprised at the number of people who approached me about the decision of the Irish public to retain the Seanad.  They expressed great surprise that in any part of Europe, and particularly in a country that had been so badly affected by the economic downturn, people would use their discretion to retain an institution and a group of politicians with whom they could have dispensed.</p><p>We need to re-examine the manner in which allocations are made to political parties.  Political parties require funding to get their message across.  It is part of the essence of supporting our democratic system and I do not have an objection to that in principle.  While we have a situation whereby funding is based on the number of seats, the money should follow individuals rather than what we are copper-fastening in this Bill.</p><p>As one who looks objectively at politics, I ask the Minister to re-examine this matter.  The logic in continuing it is not nearly as strong in light of recent events and particularly where issues of conscience are totally dismissed.  I will not say we are unique, but we are one of the few parliaments in the world with a rigid whip system which allows no departure from what is laid down by the Government.  In this instance it is not just the Government; I have also been critical of the EMC which I think is unconstitutional.</p><p>We need to examine our democratic structures which failed us in the lead up to our economic downturn.  The time has come to have a root and branch study to see what can be done to strengthen them and to ensure that in future we can be more confident they will stand the test of any political, economic or social storm we may face.</p></speech>

In making his last point, Senator Walsh suggested that money should follow the individual, but that is to misunderstand the basis of why the parliamentary allowance was brought into being, which was to support parliamentary activities.  A lot of individuals wanted to change or move within the established parliamentary systems determined by the people on election day.  The weight of support the people gave, either directly in the other House or indirectly through the election process for this House, is the snapshot that determines the balance of supports being made.  Therefore, it is not for individuals to walk away with it after that.</p><p>I have been criticised for suggesting that if people wanted to rectify that, it is open to them - not in this House but in the other one - to cause a by-election and have that tested.</p></speech>

I would not recommend it to the Senator as a certainty, shall I say.   In the other House, however, one would stand in one's own constituency and be able to ask the people who gave the original mandate, and those alone, to reconfirm that mandate, if one was so minded.</p></speech>

Although the Constitution does not recognise the role of parties, we all do.  Senators Byrne and Healy Eames made the point that none of the people elected to this House were elected on a party ticket.  It is true that there is no party allegiance on the ballot paper.  In the case of the Labour Party, we looked at the quota of councillors we had and selected candidates appropriate to that.  It may have been an extraordinary coincidence that the number of votes secured was closely affiliated to the number of councillors in the party.</p></speech>

I accept that people who operate outside their parties also get elected but they still have to convince their party councillors to vote for them which Senator Walsh did very well.  For anyone wishing to do tutorials about it, I would recommend it.  There was no luck involved.  Well travelled politicians in this House and the other House do not operate on that basis.</p><p>Reference was made to the inability to alter the fixed decision made on the day of the election.  If I leave my party, the party is not disadvantaged by that in terms of parliamentary support and if an Independent joins a political party, as happened in this House, he or she does not bring the allowance into the party.  It works both ways.  It is a system that has worked well.  I understand the motivation of those arguing the point and respect their points of view but the coherence of our parliamentary system and the supports parliamentary parties need to bring to debates in this House, communication with the electorate and the refinement and discernment of policies separate from the policies of Government, in terms of parties having to exist separately to prepare to forthcoming elections, is served well by the system I am proposing in this Bill.  If the view is that we need to look at this issue generally I have no difficulty with that but that debate is not appropriate to this particular legislation.</p></speech>

The Minister might confirm, unless he is changing it in this Bill, that this was never the position and that people do it because it is the right thing to do.  I wonder if the Minister was to provide for this in law it would beg the question as to why it would not apply in the reverse.  If an Independent joins a party today and he or she wishes to retain the allowance there is nothing, except media pressure, to prevent him or her doing so.  I believe if there was media interest in this measure the Minister would reverse course pretty quickly.</p></speech>

The <i>status quo</i> determined on the day of the election holds true so that if a candidate is an Independent the allowance is his or hers as an Independent.  The discernment is that it is the determination on the day of the election.  That is the point I made.  People leave parliamentary parties, often on a temporary basis.  For example, Deputy Penrose, who left the Labour Party parliamentary party has rejoined it.  While some people leave the party, others stay within the party, attend all party functions but do not take the party whip.  There are all sorts of variations.  The simplicity of the method in place is underscored by the often double or triple movement within a single Parliament.</p><p>  Senator Bradford made the point that a school will lose a capitation grant.</p> <p>It does not, of course, until the next capitation period.  If children move in the middle of the year, the Department does not start cutting back the allowance in the middle of the year.</p></speech>

The money is spent for the benefit of each individual Member.</p><p>  However, the Members to whom I have referred are deprived of that.  They do not have those financial resources even though they have been democratically elected.  They have a mandate from their electorate to represent them, but the State has decided through this and previous legislation not to equip them with the resources that enable them to function <i>pari passu</i> with every other Member of the Seanad or D&aacute;il.  We are disadvantaging a group of people who through no fault of theirs find themselves expelled from their parliamentary parties.  I believe there is a significant rights issue attached to that and I ask the Minister to reflect on it.  Perhaps we can revisit it on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I fundamentally disagree with this.  I see no reason not to treat this as a business expense.  For example, I have the experience of taking ten years to be elected, involving six elections.  I had an enormous overdraft and I do not see why that should not be regarded in all cases as a business expense.  I believe this should also apply to unsuccessful candidates, which would at least provide an equal playing field.  I see no reason for this restriction on the allowance.  First, it must be vouched, then it is reduced and then it is constrained.</p> <p>If we stripped ourselves naked and gave all our worldly goods to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and jumped off the roof of this House, the public would not pay a blind bit of notice.  Therefore, we are fooling ourselves if we think they will be impressed by this lot.  There will not be a blind bit of attention.  </p><p>I have also tried on several occasions to amend legislation of this kind in order to ensure that, for example, it is allowed against income tax.  I would be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say about that.  It is a very unusual job where entering the nomination process or applying for the job is so hazardous and uncertain and requires the spending of considerable amounts of money.  By the time the various reforms have gone through - it is obvious the Government is going to start with the universities - we will have enormous constituencies.  How are we to reach them?  How on earth is a new person going to break through the system if he or she does not get any allowance?  I will reserve my other comments to speaking on the section.  </p><p>I see no good reason a Member who has been elected should not be allowed to use some of this money to defray electoral expenses.  Maybe there should be a system where, based on the number of votes the candidate gets, there would be a sliding scale of reimbursement.  I do not actually take seriously the Government's moral stance.  I think this is all a degree of political posturing.  If the Government was serious it would look at the way in which the Presidency is regarded.  In terms of the Presidency, the entire financial structure has been deliberately skewed by the political parties in every possible way, including financial, against the running of an Independent.  </p><p>The constitutional review body was set up and it passed various ideas.  The Government selected those it agreed with and ran with them and simply tossed into the bin those with which it did not agree.  Some of those with which it ran were passed by a very small number of votes, in single digits.  In regard to one regarding reform of the Presidency and access to the Presidency - I have no intention at the moment of ever offering myself to the Irish people again in that role so I have no personal axe to grind - there is a democratic axe to grind.  I find it quite extraordinary and I hope somewhere out there somebody is listening because I know there are those reporters who castigate us and say there were only six Members in the Chamber when the Minister rose to speak.  There is not a single one there at the moment.  These was one decent Member in the House for about half an hour but he seems to have evaporated.  They always say they may not ever have been in the Seanad and probably could not find their way to it if they tried, but are always watching it on the monitor.  Hello out there, if anybody is watching on the monitors, the Constitutional Convention passed by 95% to 5% - that was the voice of the people - that the question of nomination to the Presidency and the way in which electoral expenses were dispersed should be looked at.  To put this in context, if the Minister is serious - I believe there is a degree of seriousness in him but I am not sure at what percentage I would evaluate it - about overall reform, he has to look at this if we want equality for our citizens.  In the Presidential election the candidate can be funded through the electoral parties and does not have to report it. </p> <p>They can pay for posters, propaganda, cars or whatever it is and they get three times the amount of donations that can be made before disclosure of the donor is required as political parties that are already at huge advantage nationally.  Does the Minister think that fits in with what he claims is the ethos of this Bill?  </p><p>I do not speak for the Independents but as an Independent.  I will always speak in what I believe is in the interest of maintaining a strong independent voice in Irish politics.  I have further remarks to make on the section but I will stop because I think we should push on with the Bill.</p></speech>

The judgement stated that "no branch of the government is entitled to use taxpayers monies from the Central Fund to intercede with the democratic process either as to the voting process or as to the campaign prior to the vote".  Using public moneys for campaigning is not allowed.  Imagine the advantage Senator Norris would have as an incumbent over another citizen using State funds to advantage him in a campaign.  That has been determined by our Supreme Court not to be fair or allowable.</p></speech>

Apparently, this situation does exist in the D&aacute;il so I am astonished as to why it is illegal in the Seanad if it is legal in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I put an amendment down which was not allowed.  The idea behind it should be considered by Government.  This idea is absolutely transparent.  Get rid of all the allowances.  One can make any kind of justification one wants.  I will not rehearse matters as I have put the historical reasons for these allowances on the record and they do not do politics any great credit.  It would be a very good thing to get rid of the whole lot of them.  It may not be politically possible at this stage but it is certainly something that should be looked at.  We should get the rate for the job.</p><p>I would also like an opportunity to put on the record of this House that I have not changed my position on this.  Some professor from some university wrote to the newspapers saying that I was more or less dishonest and had backtracked from my commitments to this, that and the other.  Another person who is rather more innocent said he was very disappointed that I had withdrawn from the commitment given the Quinn-Zappone Bill.  How could I give any commitment to that Bill when I only saw it the day it was introduced in this House, the same as all my colleagues?</p><p>I certainly would not have accepted the idea that we reduce our pay by 50%.  According to the Minister, the Taoiseach reduced his pay by 40%.  Nobody paid a blind bit of attention - not a bit.  He might as well not have bothered.  I do not want to work for half pay.  That is something that is a mark of dishonour.  I did not sign up to it.  I was never given the opportunity.  Nobody in this House except the two people involved were engaged in those discussions.  Even they were only brought in to a certain extent because it was produced by an anonymous group of lawyers.  I do not accept this idea of halving the pay of Senators.  I understand there may be political difficulties here but at the end of the day, I think what Members of Parliament should get is the rate for the job established by an external authoritative source.  </p><p>What happens to my colleagues who have left parties is a fine.  They are fined for leaving the party.  I will leave it at that.  I would like to sow the seeds of that idea in the Minister's mind.  Perhaps when things are more stable, we should look at making everything absolutely transparent.  Everything would be out in the open.  The Member gets whatever it is - &euro;60,000, &euro;70,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;100,000 - I do not care what it is.  The Member gets a nice round figure and pays everything out of that and all of it is taxable.  That is the way to be really transparent.  </p><p>There is another point I wish to make.  There is a difference with regard to Independents.  It is very difficult to justify an allowance that is to a large extent a fudge and I know it is a fudge.  With regard to Independents, each one of us must prepare material on every single item that comes before the House.  We are the constant presence here.  We try to be here all the time.  In saying that, I am not criticising my colleagues who are members of parties.  Very often, they are delegated as spokespersons on specific issues but we have to cover everything.  We also produce legislation.  If the Minister looks at the amount of legislation that has come from these benches over the past year or two, he will see it is quite astonishing.  Dealing with it entails a lot of hard work.</p> <p>That involves doing one's own research, learning the techniques, trying to get a prototype build together and then trying to get some degree of professional assistance to flesh it out in such a manner that it can be taken seriously in this House.  These are responsibilities that do not devolve upon my colleagues, whose contribution I value greatly, but who are members of political parties.</p><p>The Minister mentioned some of the people who put forward this business about halving our incomes.  I could not help but notice that they were all people who had not been elected but who were nominated so they did not have election expenses to start off with and they are part time.  We are dealing with this issue that is so important and there is not a single one of them around.  They also had substantial sources of income outside this House.  Therefore, I find it difficult to take that argument so terribly seriously since the Minister revealed the sources.</p><p>I feel it necessary for me to say that some of us work really hard - members of parties and Independents.  It is disheartening when one tries to cover one's job and spend long hours doing so, to be told that half pay would be sufficient.  Just as the Taoiseach was not noticed when he cut his pay nearly in half, nobody will notice.  I heard people saying we should work for nothing because it is such an honour.  This would result in an aristocracy of wealth.  This House would become like the old House of Lords which sat where the Bank of Ireland is now located.  Only the big people who are able to afford it will be in the House.  I am glad to say there are two or three people in this House who were unemployed before they came here.  They are not the aristocracy nor the elite.</p></speech>

I wanted to exclude the Independent Members from preparing a statement of any expenditure from the allowance to be paid to the parliamentary leader or to the Independent Member, as the case may be.  How much more work are we supposed to do?  I refer to the conditions of employment.  I lack the capacity for forward vision which Senator Walsh has - his gift of prophecy or clairvoyance.  I have no idea what the Minister's father, as a trade unionist, would think and I thought that was a rather extraneous remark.  As someone who is a member of three trade unions, the conditions of work in this place are becoming abominable. We are not trusted with anything.  We have to sign in.  I have had my full complement several months ago, at the beginning of June.  We are monitored and watched in this silly sort of way and in addition, we have to keep all these records and submit statements.  I just do not have the time.  I am doing the work I was supposed to do under the Constitution.  Do I have to hire an accountant?  What happens if I make a mistake?  Do I get into some kind of a difficulty?  </p><p>  I wish to delete the reference in the Bill to where an Independent Member in receipt of an allowance or portion thereof under section 10, dies, that his or her personal representative should prepare or cause to be prepared a statement of any expenditure from the allowance as soon as may be, but not later than 120 days after the end of the financial year in which the allowance has been paid.  I think that is daft.  For God's sake, could they not be allowed to keep the few days extra?  The Minister will be waiting a long time before he gets people making these returns.  A relative of my grandfather's was a knight of St. Patrick and he died in 1937.  The British Crown demanded return of all the regalia.  It took them three years to find the regalia because he had different places of residence.  They found a bit in Granston, a bit down in Doneraile and a bit in a house in London.  Eventually they sent them all back.  </p><p>  This provision is more pettifogging.  I refer to the provision about keeping records for not fewer than six years.  In my view this is an onerous provision.  I would like to see people in Parliament being treated with respect.  I have always tried to behave honourably.  I have never swizzled or cheated or inflated accounts.  This year I will probably be able to produce accounts for expenses that will show I will have spent a lot more than I looked for.  We are allowed &euro;12,000 unvouched expenses and I have put down &euro;3,000 because I was afraid that I would over-claim and then the newspapers - which are such friends of mine - would say that Norris stole this money from the Exchequer.  I do not agree with the provision to have to keep this stuff for six years.  I have already lost a computer; I do not know where it is but they are hunting for it.  I never used it.  I have no use for old receipts either.</p><p>  I would like to be treated with respect.  I know there is a growing lack of respect.  I am still a member of the Common Room and I am sure my colleague, Professor Barrett, is also a member.  In the old days, they had a book into which members wrote the expenses for their visitors' drinks.  I began to think I was an alcoholic because I had a whole series of pages because I was always bringing people in for dinner and to talk with them.  We would have a glass of Madeira wine, for example.

I do not want to be monitored.  The next thing we will have chips put in our ankles so that when we pass the gate we will be recorded.  Will we be required to put up our hands and say, "An bhfuil cead agam dul go dt&iacute; an leithreas, a Chathaorligh?"  I would like to be treated with a bit of respect.  Unfortunately, some in this House and in the other House, by abusing these payments, have brought them into disrepute but I feel insulted by them, the same way as I feel insulted that every single year I have to go and pay &euro;10 to a lawyer to say that I got nothing as political contributions.  The people who are really crooked will get around any piece of legislation but the people who are honest and honourable and decent will find themselves wasting more and more time on this pettifoggery.  I know it is unpopular to say but I do not give a damn.  If my voters do not like it, they can kick me out at the next election.  Some of them will not do so while some of them will but I would like to be regarded as an honourable person.  This would all be resolved if we were given the rate for the job.  We would then turn up, do the work and get paid.</p></speech>

It is not workable for us to require that Members only spend this funding on parliamentary activities without requiring them to show evidence that they have done so.  This is the new regime expected of us by the public.</p><p>The Senator rightly stated that, if Members do not wish to hold accounts, it is open to them to fund their activities from their own resources or salaries.  If they draw down this allowance, it must be accountable and spent on things that are allowable.  This must be clearly accounted to the people.</p></speech>

People are undoubtedly going through financial hell while we are cushioned.  However, I am thinking in the long term.  I presume we will eventually get a bit of sense, dismantle the existing financial system and install something that has at least some element of socialism.</p><p>I will make a final request.  Presumably, statutory guidelines or the like will be drafted.  Perhaps there could be a negotiation between the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  Certain expenses could be quantified as being almost, if not fully, automatic, for example, research, preparation of Bills, etc.  I will be interested to know the criteria and the allowable expenses and what means of vouching will be regarded as appropriate.  I am poor at keeping receipts and lose them all the time, but I take the relaxed view that they will turn up somewhere.  They always do.  However, I am worried now.  I accept that other Members have abused the system.  We are probably in this horrible situation of having to account for everything because some of our colleagues were blatantly dishonest about expenses.  I very much regret that.</p></speech>

Careful guidelines will be prepared for people's information.  We will know what we can spend money on, that we will receive receipts for same and that the spending will be accounted for.  Oversight will be provided by the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, via spot checks.  For this reason, Members must hold on to their receipts for a certain length of time, as SIPO will periodically dip into our accounts to ensure everything is fine, as is currently done in respect of the party leader's allowance.</p></speech>

I may just decide not to take any allowance and forget about everything, but Independent Members must discuss with their personal assistants and so on how this system will be implemented, what bills must be kept and where, who will be responsible for that, etc.  How imminent is the commencement?  Perhaps there could be a grace period.  Members need to know the statutory regulations or provisions on allowances if we are to accommodate ourselves to them.  There may even be some degree of to and fro between representatives of the Houses and the Minister's Department.  Will this system be landed on us at Christmas or some other festival?</p></speech>

Section 10E provides for me as the Minister to be able to fix a date from which the provisions of the Act relating to reporting and the retention of documents will apply to Independent Members and leaders of qualifying parties.  We want the legislation to be enacted, as it was a commitment made some time ago.  We will need to have a bedding down period, but the accounting will not happen for a considerable time after the money has been drawn down.  Members will have many months next year to get everything right.  While I am anxious that the legislation would come into effect in terms of the 10% restriction, given that it will save money, I will ensure there is proper time for people to understand and apply the provisions to their circumstances in a rational and unhurried way.</p></speech>

There will be a time gap between the commencement of the requirement and the reaching of the requirement to report, if Senator Byrne understands what I am saying.  We can commence that all moneys are accountable from this date, but the process of how that is done will not come until the money has been drawn down during the course of the year and the year has concluded.

The parliamentary allowance is vouched half-way through the subsequent year when 10% of Members are selected for auditing.  I presume that arrangement will apply.  From the perspective of fairness and transparency for Independent Members, I ask the Minister to ensure detailed guidelines will be published early.  I speak as someone who was audited under the scheme three or four years ago.  In fact, it was the first year of the allowance so it was only partial.  I was obliged to demonstrate I had spent &euro;12,500 in that particular year.  I had all my facts and figures because everything was paid by cheque.  My genuine political expenses came to well over &euro;20,000 but I felt the process quite unnerving and difficult.  The language of the correspondence received from the auditors was negative, to put it mildly.  In fact, I would describe it as almost threatening.  I could show an expenditure of &euro;20,000 plus, yet I was literally forced to prove myself innocent.  The process started in April or May of the year in question, and it was the following November before I was finally given a letter and a certificate to say that everything was in order.</p><p>I had one small query which a phone call could have answered, yet a whole chain of correspondence had to be entered into.  I am sure the auditors were doing their job fairly but to have matters working smoothly we need to liaise more fully with the auditors.  We should ensure that a month after one's accounts are submitted, one would have a face-to-face meeting with the auditors.  We may only be talking about 15 or 20 Members of the Oireachtas, but it would be a better system to have a meeting whereby questions could be dealt with rather than having an official, legalistic and almost threatening response.</p><p>In 2011, I simply decided to go back to the unvouched system, although the money was less, because I had had enough hassle from the vouched system.  Now we all have to go via the vouched system but we need to have structures in place whereby politicians are treated as being, on the law of averages, honest, decent and not trying to break any law or swindle any money.  Instead, however, we were more or less being found guilty until we could prove ourselves innocent.  A better system needs to be put in place as well as improved communication between the independent auditors and Members who are being assessed.  We should have a meeting four to six weeks after the accounts have been submitted in order that we would not have an endless chain of rather threatening mail from the office.</p></speech>

It is always a pleasure when he comes to the House.  The object of the exercise in transferring the jurisdiction for these procedures of examinership from the High Court to the Circuit Court was to save money.  Senator White covered it for the main Opposition party on the previous occasion when she estimated cost savings of about 30%.  It would be most interesting if the Minister of State had an estimate himself because that is the object of the exercise, which we support.  It was also an objective of the troika which pointed out that we have a problem of excess legal costs in Ireland.  Some supporters of the troika think that it left a bit early in not having ensured the legal reforms we hear the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, wants to bring in.</p><p>  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure the Oireachtas gets an estimate of the savings because we have a problem of high legal costs.  Wearing his other hat, I know the Minister of State promotes innovation and small businesses.</p> <p>One of the obstacles in this regard, as pointed out by the National Competitiveness Council, is the high level of legal costs.  Amendments Nos. 1 to 6, which I support, are an attempt to address this issue.  To keep people on their toes, it might be a good idea to set an annual estimate of savings to be achieved.</p><p>Another concern is that the savings from the personal injuries system which was established some time ago are being gradually eroded and that legal costs are a major factor in inflating insurance costs in respect of road transport and so on.  The Minister of State might re-examine this issue before Report Stage.  It would be good to know the Government's estimate of the savings upfront.  This is something that needs to be continually monitored lest we drift back into the old high cost mode, which is the purpose of the Minister of State's amendment of this section of the Bill, which we support.  My suggestion is that an estimate be made now of the savings to be made and that we ensure they are achieved.  In attempting to return the economy to where it was in 2008 we need to tackle the problem of sheltered sector services.  Legal costs are at the core of what is being done under this Bill.  If we quantify the savings we will know if they are increasing, which I hope they will do yearly, or if the legal profession is clawing back the ground that might be lost through the transfer of cases from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  Perhaps the Circuit Court proceedings will cost more than proceedings in the High Court, in which case what the Minister proposes to achieve would be undone.  I do not believe savings will be achieved without policing by the Department with the support of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2013-11-19a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2013111900035#KK00200"><p>I would like to comment briefly on the issue of legal costs and the troika.  I am not an expert in legal matters but it is about time we had a full debate on this situation.  Approximately five major firms, primarily based in Dublin, control the commercial law area.  Their fees, including to Government and internationally, is &euro;500 per hour.  Some of the solicitors in north and west Cork are on the bread line.  People tend to forget that currently more than 2,000 young qualified lawyers, some of whom have masters degrees, are unemployed and cannot access the system.  Debate on this issue should not be about the person in Bantry, Mallow, Killarney, Athenry or Donegal who is earning a crust in terms of charging a fee of &euro;50 per hour or less but about the monopoly within the Irish legal structure.  These firms will not engage with clients unless they have around &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million insurance cover.</p><p>During a conversation with a taxi driver on a recent trip from the airport he told me that he was a qualified barrister but was driving a taxi because he could not get work in that area.  People think that if a person is a lawyer, solicitor or barrister he or she is automatically in the big league.  There is a premier division of lawyers in Ireland.  It is a cosy cartel monopolised by five large firms.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, know who they are.  The debate needs to be about such firms and reducing their fees of &euro;500 per hour.  Most solicitors around the country charge approximately &euro;60 per hour.  Their situation is akin to that of farmers, the majority of whom, as the Minister of State will be aware, make approximately &euro;9,000 to &euro;12,000 per annum, while the remainder of them make approximately &euro;150,000 per annum.  </p><p>I would welcome an informed debate on this issue.  Perhaps the larger firms are being protected by the Law Society or Bar Counsel.  The vast majority of lawyers in this country are on the bread line.  I am speaking not about the rogues in the profession who are being weeded out, and rightly so, but about those lawyers around the country who are in serious difficulty, including law students with masters degrees who cannot obtain apprenticeships and so on.  I agree with Senator Barrett that legal costs is an issue but it is one applicable to a particular cartel that is monopolising international commercial transactions, including to Government.  I acknowledge this was also an issue in relation to previous Governments.  I will not name the firms concerned.  What I say is the truth, namely, there are five firms in this country that are earning more than 60% of all other legal firms throughout the country.  </p><p>My colleague, Senator Walsh, has often raised the issue of the colossal fees being charged by lawyers and the need to reduce insurance claims.  Insurance claims have fallen since enactment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill.  Having recently attended conventions and political gatherings in Kerry and Tipperary, I know there are many solicitors in Ireland who are barely surviving.  The notion that they are all creaming it is not true.  If we are to debate this issue then let us be honest and take on the cartel.  I propose that we also take on the Law Society and whoever else is protecting that cartel.  When it comes to dealing with the various issues that arise in Departments, the same firms are hired by Government.  No consideration is given to hiring any of the other approximately 10,000 lawyers in Ireland.  </p><p>I had not intended to contribute on this section but I felt I had to when I heard Senator Barrett speak about legal fees.  Let us have an honest debate about who is charging these fees and making the money.  Let us commission an audit in this regard and then tackle the people who are charging &euro;500 per hour rather than the people in Dingle or Connemara who are charging &euro;50 per hour and who are barely surviving.  We all know there is a cartel operating in this area.  It has been referred to previously.  Let us be honest in our debate on this issue.  The view often in the media is that all solicitors are robust and earning vast sums.  This is not true.</p></speech>

Another issue, which may not be one for today's debate but which the Minister of State might bring to the attention of the Government, is the role of the Government and semi-State companies in awarding contracts to the larger firms.  In my experience, part of the reason for this is because requests for tender for legal and other services require those tendering to have all sorts of coverage, which to be honest one would want to be digging a well in the North Sea to have.  This results in the exclusion of small to medium-sized firms from competing for business.  I ask that the Minister of State draw this issue to the attention of the Government.  While I accept the concern in regard to the provision of legal services, which is valid, we must ensure that competition is real competition.  There should not be false impositions on genuine competition.</p></speech>

The costs of an examinership will depend not only on the capitalisation or book value of the assets of a company but also on the nature and extent of the company's liabilities and the complexity of a particular case.  Hence, it would be extremely difficult to estimate the cost of a typical examinership on which to base annual estimates of savings.  To draw robust estimates would require information from the individual companies who applied for Circuit Court examinership and require them to estimate the savings from choosing the Circuit Court option over the High Court route.  This would be a hypothetical exercise and necessarily subjective.  To compel companies to co-operate in such a process would require legislation, which would also add to the administrative burden on companies.</p> <p> As the House may be aware, Standing Order 141A of the D&aacute;il provides that 12 months after the enactment of a Bill, the Minister or Minister of State, who is officially responsible for implementation of an Act, shall provide a report, which shall review the functioning of the Act and which shall be laid in the Oireachtas Library.  A report on the implementation of the Bill before the House today will be required 12 months after its enactment.  Therefore, the amendment is not practical or necessary and I do not propose to accept it.</p><p>Other Senators spoke about the cost of legal services and the top four that Senator O'Donovan mentioned.</p></speech>

On the previous day I was more convinced there would be savings from going to the Circuit Court rather than the High Court.  Now the Department does not know and has given the Minister of State a note indicating that it cannot tell.  Too much policy making is not based on evidence.  If the Circuit Court is not cheaper than the High Court, we should all vote against the amendment.  The Department must have some estimates of saving.  I am concerned over the lack of expertise in Departments given that they cannot answer a simple question.  We are doing it to save money and I am delighted, but I want to know how much.  We are being told they could not do certain things or it would be too difficult to find out.  If there are savings, I am sure the troika, the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, and everybody else in the Cabinet would be delighted to hear them.</p><p>I hope the Minister of State takes the other point on board more strongly.  I applaud the Minister of State and his colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, on being advocates of small and medium-sized enterprises.  We repeatedly run into the attitude that people are in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, but not in their sectors.  They will continue to give business to the big four or five, whether it is in accountancy, which we will discuss later in section 6, or in law firms.  The Minister for Health protects VHI, which is the biggest company and yet small and medium-sized health insurance companies are not wanted either.  In the area of transport, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, has indicated that small and medium-sized bus companies are not wanted because he will allocate the subsidy without competitive tendering and give exclusive rights to all the routes to the biggest operator.</p><p>This is capture of Departments by vested interests.  Even when they venture away from it and indicate they will do something that will cost a bit less, it is clear from the answer the Minister of State gave that the homework has not been done.  I ask for that homework to be prepared in time for Report Stage.  I should have mentioned the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who was here the last day and stood in magnificently as we always expect.  It must be something about Cork that gives us these Ministers of State to debate these issues.  It is disappointing.  Is the Department afraid that I will come back later and say that it promised 25% and there is only 22% or does it have no idea what the savings are and refuses to quantify it?  The Minister of State should ask the officials to quantify it.  We are trying to achieve political reform and get the country out of the mess in which it was in 2008.  I object to simple questions from Members of Parliament not being answered.</p><p>I hope there are savings and as a Member of Parliament I want to monitor those savings.  However, I cannot do it if I get meaningless answers indicating that the Department does not know.  Policies that were not properly appraised and analysed got the country into trouble.  This is an attempt to correct that situation and we still do not know.  Wandering around in the dark on policy is just not good enough these days.  I express my surprise that the Department has no idea of the savings for a measure it has proposed.  It is unacceptable for a major Department not to be able to answer that question.  I am sure the Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Noonan, will also want to know why there is no answer to it.</p></speech>

The 30% figure mentioned in public discourse on the issue refers to the estimated Circuit Court costs being 30% lower than an examinership process through the High Court owing to the legal fees element.  If we do not know how many companies will go into examinership from today and 12 months hence, how can we reasonably expect to create an estimate of the cost saving?  It is a hypothetical exercise.  While greatly respecting the Senator's views on the issue, we would create an enormous administrative burden - another administrative layer - in compiling the estimate.</p><p>Knowing the Senator as I do, I know he would not stand over creating another administrative layer in the system that would result in Departments going out to individual companies which applied for Circuit Court examinership and then putting a requirement on them to estimate the savings from choosing one court over another.  In an individual company's case it would mean in practical terms that company having to get two separate pieces of legal advice which would create an administrative burden for it.  It is not reasonable to compel companies to engage in such an exercise because we would need to create a legislative framework for that.  Furthermore, as I have said in the response, a report on the functioning of the Act will need to be compiled and laid in the Oireachtas Library, which should be sufficient.</p><p>The estimated savings of 30% derive from the potential difference in the legal costs between the Circuit Court and a higher court.  That is where that figure comes from.  I respect the Senator's views on the issue, but the Government is unable to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

In particular, businesses with potential for growth and job creation, which are being held back by legacy debt problems, are expected to benefit.  This, in turn, should feed into an improvement in the general employment and economic situation within the State.</blockquote>That is what we are trying to do.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch also said: &quot;This means, for example, that companies based outside Dublin will be able to apply for examinership to their local Circuit Court, thus reducing costs and travel time.&quot;  The very helpful briefing note we were given the last day stated that going to the Circuit Court would lower costs and provide greater accessibility for small private companies by eliminating the need for High Court involvement.  All of those are very desirable as the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said.  The very helpful briefing note we got was over and above what we expect, on which I commend the Department.  However, in policy making we need to be more precise than we have been.  There is too much wooliness throughout the public sector which gets us into so much trouble.  It would be much better to have an estimate and we could then assess whether we got the 25% or 30%.</p><p>  I do not know why it requires more auditors.  There are X cases and a saving of Y percentage.  They need to be multiplied together which could be done on the back of an envelope and given to the next Minister to come in.</p> <p>When we are asked to change policy, in this case, a change from the High Court to the Circuit Court, it would help if the Department had some idea what the savings would be.  I am surprised the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have not asked the Department.</p><p>We need regulatory impact assessments when we make these types of changes.  The Parliament is here to assist in rescuing the country from the situation it found itself in after 2008.  We would like to help and the amendment was tabled to assist in that regard.  The Minister of State could use it to explain to meetings of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association or whoever that the Government has saved that sector X amount in legal costs.  I believe ISME would welcome that, as would I.  I am unsure why the Minister of State is running into obstacles within the Department.</p><p>I am not going to push it but the Minister of State or the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, might consider the matter before they come back on Report Stage which, I understand, is due this week.  Anyway, it seems to me that the case for the Bill would be substantially improved by an estimate of the savings.  The savings are the reason we made the change in the first instance, and to make the change without any knowledge of what the savings would be is hardly the way to proceed.</p><p>I believe the Minister of State is correct but it would be reassuring to have the assessment.  In another context we discuss the problems with mathematics in the country.  If we put some mathematics in here it would make it far more precise, rather than simply an aspiration that we believe we will save money but with no idea how much.  For a country with a debt to GDP ratio of 125% we do not need it, but we need more information supplied to the Oireachtas, especially when the Oireachtas has been on the side of the Minister of State in this matter both the last day and today.  I will not push it any further but I appeal for information to be supplied to the House on Report Stage.</p></speech>

then another designated officer may apply to a judge of the District Court for an order under subsection (2).(2) On the hearing of an application under subsection (1) the judge of the District Court may, if&mdash;(a) the judge is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so; and
(b) the date to be specified under paragraph (ii) will fall during the period of validity of the warrant (including, if that is the case, such period as extended under section 20(10)),
make an order directing that the search warrant be endorsed so as to&mdash;
(i) substitute the name of another designated officer (the &lsquo;new officer&rsquo;) for the name of the designated officer who was expressed to have been authorised under the search warrant immediately prior to the making of the order (the &lsquo;previous officer&rsquo;); and
(ii) specify the time and date from which that substitution is to take effect.(3) Where an order under subsection (2) is made then, with effect from the time on the date endorsed pursuant to paragraph (ii) of that subsection&mdash;(a) the search warrant shall continue in full force and effect, but shall operate to authorise the new officer to execute the warrant as fully as if he or she had been the designated officer named in the warrant when it was first issued;
(b) the search warrant shall no longer operate to authorise the previous officer to execute the warrant (but without prejudice to the validity of anything done previously thereunder by that officer); and
(c) the order shall operate to&mdash;(i) relieve the previous officer from any duties to which he or she had been subject under section 20(2E) or (2F) (but without prejudice to the validity of anything done previously thereunder by that officer); and
(ii) impose upon the new officer any duties under section 20(2E) or (2F) that have not yet been fully discharged.(4) If&mdash;(a) the period of validity of a search warrant issued under section 20 (including, if that is the case, such period as extended under section 20(10)) has expired; and
(b) either of the conditions specified in subsection (1)(a) or (b) is satisfied,then a designated officer may apply to a judge of the District Court for an order providing for each of the matters referred to in subsections (2) and (3), other than those relating to the conferral or removal of the power of execution, and, on the making of such an application, the judge of the District Court may make such an order accordingly and subsections (2) and (3) shall apply for that purpose with any necessary modifications.
(5) For the purpose of subsection (4), subsection (1)(a) shall apply as if for &lsquo;(including any designated officer who is named therein by reason of any prior application under this subsection)&rsquo; there were substituted &lsquo;(including any designated officer who is named therein by reason of any prior application under this subsection or subsection (4))&rsquo;.
(6) An application under subsection (1) or (4) may, if a judge of the District Court directs, be heard otherwise than in public.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</p></speech>

It is more of a semantic explanation.  The new section will provide for an officer of the Director of Corporate Enforcement to be able to take over the statutory duties set out under sections 20(2E) and 20(2F) of the Companies Act 1990 in circumstances where the incumbent designated officer is no longer in a position to carry them out.  The duties under sections 20(2E) and 20(2F) arise if a named officer of the director has been issued with a section 20 search warrant under which "extended powers of seizure" are exercised.  The proposed new section will provide that if a designated officer named in a search warrant has ceased to be an officer of the Director of Corporate Enforcement or is otherwise unable to act, then another designated officer may apply to a judge of the District Court for an order that his or her name be substituted for the original designated officer's name on the search warrant.</p><p>This section is contained in the Companies Bill 2012 but is being brought forward to ensure that the process is in place should the need arise.  Effectively, if a designated officer should pass away or be incapacitated and needs to be replaced, the amendment allows for the procedure to take place and for the application to the court to be provided for.</p></speech>

I call on the House to reflect on what we have faced since we have come here and since Ireland has been in the financial straits in which it has found itself and which we are trying to sort out now.</p><p>  The average citizen has borne extreme burdens.  Unemployment and emigration have increased and so on.  Many of those directly culpable have borne none of the cost of what happened to put the country on the rocks, and they include bankers, accountants and the regulators of banks.</p><p>  This is why I am concerned about section 6.  The briefing note says the provision allows for a levy on statutory auditors and audit firms of public interest entities to defray the costs of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, in carrying out the functions of external quality assurance in respect of these public interest entities.  This will enable the IAASA to impose a levy on relevant statutory auditors and on audit firms to defray the cost of carrying out the quality insurance function which, it is proposed, will be transferred from the recognised accountancy bodies to the IAASA.</p><p>  In this section, as I understand it, we are transferring the responsibility for the conduct of accountants from the bodies themselves to a State body.  The hope is that we will be able to defray the costs.  I view this with extreme concern because I regard the accountants and the bankers as the key people who got us into this situation.  Where they presented accounts which the Government found out subsequently were not a fair and accurate reflection of the affairs of the banks - which we took over at a cost of &euro;64 billion - there should be no question that the costs are borne in any way by the State.</p><p>  Our function in all parts of the House should be to get better conduct from our auditors.  They failed miserably and I will present evidence on that presently.  They did disastrous damage to the country but now they seem to have successfully lobbied to push that function onto a State organisation which, according to its annual report, has 14 staff and permission for 15.  There are only 14 staff to assess 28,000 accountants and 19,000 trainee accountants.</p> <p> The people who got us into this should bear the cost of getting us out.  Moreover, this should happen in the legal profession with other cases of white-collar crime and there should be no question that anyone else other than that profession should bear the burden.  At the very least, serious discussions are needed about the role of accountants in the collapsing of the Irish economy in the first instance - I will present something on that presently - and second, on the reason the taxpayer is involved at all at this point, because it is the taxpayer who funds the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.  The explanatory memorandum states that 11 additional staff might be needed to do this, which will be a cost.  I acknowledge this may be recouped from the accountancy firms but the record in the field is not the greatest.  If the State takes on this function, as proposed in section 6, I am sure it will be a godsend to the lawyers.  They will from henceforth suggest that instead of suing the accountant who gave one the wrong advice, one should sue the State, which I note has a debt-to-GDP ratio of 124%.  Consequently, to those who have been wrongly and badly treated by accountants, the State will become a far bigger mark than taking on the accountants themselves.</p><p> A serious discussion is required on the reason the profession of accountancy has moved itself away from being responsible for its own regulation and for its conduct and the reason this in any way should become a burden on taxpayers, who already have borne enough in this regard.  I refer to page 142 of the current edition of <i>Phoenix</i>magazine in which it is noted that Mr. Paul Coulson won a phenomenal &euro;44 million award from SG Warburg, which was blamed for walking Yeoman into the disastrous CLF Holdings takeover in the first place.  In fact, he topped it up and the magazine estimates he eventually got approximately &euro;87 million out of SG Warburg, which is far short of our &euro;64 billion.</p><p> The reports of the IAASA reveal there have been problems with the manner in which that sector has been regulated and I want them sorted out by the accountants themselves long before they get themselves on the public payroll.  In respect of the attempt by the IAASA to investigate such people, I note that on page 24 of its 2011 report, with which Members are familiar from dealing with health insurance, the information is redacted or blanked out.  That is not very accountable as to what is going on.  Similarly, on page 23, in a table entitled, Summary of Section 23 Enquiry activity - 2011, one sees &quot;Redacted Text&quot; in the middle of it.  In the case of the conduct of Ernst &amp;amp; Young in respect of the Anglo Irish Bank case, the matter investigated was described as follows:<blockquote>Failure to detect the scale of Mr. Sean FitzPatrick&rsquo;s loans and their systematic refinancing over year ends and the lack of appropriate disclosure in the first set of Anglo&rsquo;s Financial Statements for the year end 30th September 2008, which were signed on 2nd December 2008, or in Ernst &amp;amp; Young&rsquo;s audit report thereon.  The conclusion of the special investigator was &quot;<i>Prima facie</i>case found&quot;.</blockquote>The next matter to be investigated was, &quot;Failure to refer to the transactions in September 2008 between [Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent] and Anglo in their audit report on the first set of Anglo&rsquo;s 2008 Financial Statements, in the absence of appropriate disclosure in those 2008 Financial [accounts]&quot;, and the conclusion of the special investigator was &quot;<i>Prima facie</i>case found&quot;.  As for the investigation into the &quot;Failure to ensure appropriate disclosure of a loan made to Mr. William McAteer, a Director of Anglo, in the first set of Anglo&rsquo;s 2008 Financial Statements or in their audit report thereon&quot;, the conclusion of the special investigator was &quot;<i>Prima facie</i>case found&quot;.</p><p> This is an area of malpractice from top to bottom with vast amounts of money.  If one turns to page 27 of the annual report for 2011 one finds that under investigation are PricewaterhouseCoopers in respect of the accounts of Bank of Ireland and Ernst &amp;amp; Young in respect of the accounts of EBS Building Society and Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc, which were audited by that firm.  Moreover, KPMG were the auditors for Allied Irish Banks plc, Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent plc, Postbank Ireland Limited and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Although there have been no penalties on any of those, through section 6 we are getting the State involved with that kind of track record.</p><p> This is not a case of Members on the side of the House making a political point.  Society needs much tougher regulation of the accountancy firms and as Senator O'Donovan observed about the law firms, it was the major accounting firms that got us into this.  They appear to me to be a strange set of people to take into public scrutiny when one could follow the example of Mr. Coulson and force them to regulate themselves and force them to compensate people who have suffered so disastrously from the low standards of accounting that pertained in Ireland.</p><p> Since making the annual report of 2008, Karen Erwin, who was then the chairman of IAASA, has stated she is extremely concerned about the loss of confidence in Ireland in both the accountancy profession and in auditing.  I do not believe this problem will be solved by taking it over as it is.  We have a very serious problem in this regard and in her statement in the 2008 annual report, the then chairperson stated:<blockquote>The confluence of these factors has significantly increased the risks associated with the preparation of statutory financial reports and, by extension, the risks associated with the audit of those financial statements.  These increased risk levels, in turn, significantly increase the risk of serious and lasting damage to public confidence in statutory financial reporting and in the accountancy profession.</blockquote>That is what she said in 2008 and I discern very little progress by the same body up to 2012 in its annual reports.</p><p> While I acknowledge there have been many changes at board level in that authority, are we leaving the State wide open if it takes on the responsibility, as happened with pyrite?  The State did not build pyrite in houses - builders did - but because the State was in some way engaged in the planning process to approve such building, the Minister of State, the Deputies and everyone in Leinster House were obliged to vote through money in the recent budget to repair the damage.  I would be interested in hearing the views of the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Shatter, in this regard but I would much prefer that the blame for the accounting failures in Ireland be put squarely on the accountants and not to have the possibility the State would be liable either for their costs of administration or for any damages that might result were these cases to ever reach a conclusion that the authority has here.</p><p> Ireland needs something like the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States, which provides for a five-member board - we have 14 members - that has a commitment to the interests of investors and the public.  Our accountants have no commitment to that because they destroyed the shareholders in the Irish banks and cost the public &euro;64 billion.  Section 104 of the aforementioned Act provides for annual inspections for each registered accounting firm with more than 100 issuers - which I believe means 100 customers.  I do not believe it is possible to do that either with 14 staff members or with an additional 11 staff members as promised in the explanatory memorandum.</p><p> On the power to suspend, as far as I can ascertain no one has been suspended in Irish accountancy since 2008.  While the Act provides for $15 million in fines, the highest fine imposed in Ireland that I have been able to find was one of &euro;100,000, for failure to comply with the High Court case and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.  The legislation also provides for prohibitions on insider trading and a prohibition on personal loans to executives.</p> <p>That has been at the kernel of how the banking culture in Ireland changed from the responsible approach which I would have known as a younger man to the irresponsible conduct during the Celtic tiger period.  There were commitments to honest and ethical conduct.  In the US, the budget for 2003 was $776 million.  The other issue it is investigating, which pertains to the point made by Senator Denis O'Donovan earlier, is that an authority in charge of accounting should investigate limited competition in accounting.  Rather than give consolation in section 6, now it is to be addressed on Report Stage, the entire House should unite and demand a much sterner deal in remedying what happened in 2008 and in getting some remedies for a public which feels very sore about this issue.</p><p> It is now five years later and nothing has happened.  I could read into the record some of the findings against the accountancy bodies by the authority.  So far as I can see they successfully sold the Government a pup to have this measure included.  When we have major disasters involving the Irish banking and accounting system all the talk about the free market and <i>laissez faire  </i>is quickly forgotten.  This is a huge moral hazard problem.  <i>Laissez faire</i> is all well and good until something goes wrong as stated by John Gutfreund, the former chief executive of Solomon Brothers.  There is regulatory capture here.  It is unpunished white collar crime.  In regard to nationalising it, I advise the Government not to go near it, make them tidy up their own mess and if the solicitors come in next week looking for their misconduct to be nationalised as well, I advise it not to do that either.  </p><p> We have to take a far sterner view of what accountants did in this country.  I mentioned a fine of &euro;100,000 and there was one in 2009.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants was ordered to pay &euro;11,325 to the authority within 14 days of the High Court making an order.  There was a complaint by the then Senator Shane Ross and others to the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the fine in that case was &euro;15,000.  Why is the taxpayer being asked to take up this burden?  What they want from us, as members of Parliament, is that we put the burden firmly back on the accountants and that they pay up, and pay up soon, as we are now in the fifth year since this was done.  The major firms, which are read into the record, which are in the authority's reports are still not answering the questions about how they found banks to be much more profitable than the unfortunate Ministers for Finance.  We have a duty to protect the taxpayers against any recurrence of that.  At least it should not appear as an amendment of section 6 to the Companies Act that the Government should prepare full legislation on how it intends to regulate accountants, emulate the Americans as in Sarbanes-Oxley, and address a problem between the banks and the builders.  As the Minister of State is aware from his constituency in Cork, they have driven this country to the wall and the implications for us of taking on the responsibility for regulating that sector are huge.</p><p> I will deal with the individual amendments but if the advice from the Department is that we have to do this, I ask the Minister of State to ensure that everything that happened, until Uachtar&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann signs this Bill, remains the responsibility of the accountancy profession and, in particular, the big firms.  They seem to have managed to evade the present system successfully and I fear they see us in this House as a soft touch and that they can continue to evade it.  </p><p> The international implications of having accountants who are not accountable are huge and the burdens on the Irish people have also been huge.  Ideally, the Cabinet should reflect on section 6 and work out with all the Members what is the appropriate response to having been seriously misled by the accountancy profession in regard to financial institutions and, perhaps, to call in Mr. Paul Coulsom, whom I quoted earlier.  If he extracted &euro;87 million from his advisers in transactions, maybe it is time the Irish taxpayer got a fair deal on this.</p><p> I am mystified as to how section 6 got into this.  Presumably, the accountants think it is urgent - I appreciate what the Minister of State said that the entire Companies Act will be enacted in time.  We need to know from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, why the present penalties are not working, why the present procedures are far too slow and why nothing has been done to recompense the rest of the economy for what happened in Irish banking and accounting in 2008.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert the following:<blockquote><br />The Recognised Accountancy Bodies remain the oversight bodies for the external quality assurance of audits until the enactment of this Act and shall retain the duties and obligations of such oversight up to and including that date.</blockquote>Under Chapter 2, Part 8 of the European Communities (Statutory Audits) (Directive 2006/43/EC) Regulations 2010, SI No. 220 of 2010, the recognised accountancy bodies have the power and do carry out quality assurance of their members' activities as statutory auditors and audit firms.  This will remain the position until the power is formally transferred to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, the IAASA.  Section 6 of the Bill provides for a levy, this speaks to the points made by Senator Sean D. Barrett, on statutory auditors and audit firms of public interest entities in order to defray the costs to the IAASA for carrying out the functions of external quality assurance in respect of these public interest entities.</p><p>  The amendment is unnecessary.  Additional functions in regard to the EU recommendation on external quality assurance are proposed to be conferred on the IAASA in the Companies Bill 2012 while the balance of the related functions would be conferred on IAASA by amendment to existing regulations.  The commencement of section 6 will not occur until all the relevant functions have been transferred.</p> <p> I believe amendment No. 13 is unnecessary and I do not propose to accept it.  The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority produces an annual report of its activities each year, which is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The IAASA can also be called to appear before any Oireachtas committee and it has appeared before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in December 2012.  The provision in regard to quality assurance in this Bill is strictly confined to empowering the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority to impose a levy again on statutory auditors and audit firms of public interest entities to defray the costs to it for carrying out the functions of external quality assurance in respect of those public interest entities.  Currently the recognised accountancy bodies, RABs who carry out the quality assurance function have the power to sanction their members, including by withdrawal of the authorisation to audit certificate.  It is intended that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA will have equivalent powers of sanctions when the functions are transferred and these powers again will be contained in the Companies Bill 2012 or the regulations, as appropriate.</p><p>First, let me speak on the amendment before us and be clear about the Government's position on it.  Other points have been made by Senator Barrett and we could have a very long debate on the morass in society.  I do not think it was only the accountants who were part of the morass.  Many others were part of it as well.</p><p>For the purposes of dealing with some of the points the Senator raised, it is important to address the issue in relation to investigations and proceedings against particular members of those accountancy bodies.  Investigations and proceedings against members of accountancy bodies in relation to events at the former Anglo Irish Bank were suspended at the request of the Director of Public Prosecutions in order that such moves would not prejudice forthcoming criminal trials.  It is important to state that in response to quite a large component of the Senator's contribution.</p><p>The Senator critiqued section 6 in its entirety, but that section gives effect to a European Commission recommendation on external quality assurance for statutory auditors and audit firms.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch may have addressed this issue during the Second Stage debate, but I want to state again that if we are talking about quality assurance in relation to section 6, it is important we note that quality assurance is the regular inspection of statutory auditors and audit firms to ensure systems are in place that will allow for consistently high quality audits.  The transfer of the important quality assurance function to an independent oversight body such as IAASA will strengthen oversight of the audit process in Ireland as regards these public interest entities.  This should help to restore confidence in audit in Ireland, which has been dented as a result of the so-called clean audit opinions given to the financial statements of systemically important credit institutions, which as the Senator rightly pointed out, later proved to be near or actually insolvent.</p><p>The transfer of the function to IAASA is to be fully funded by the relevant statutory auditors and audit firms with no cost to the Exchequer, apart from once-off start-up costs such as office equipment and so on.  This is in line with existing practice where statutory auditors and audit firms pay for this function.  The only difference is that this payment will be to IAASA and not the recognised accountancy body of which they are a member.  The cost of such reviews under the proposed system is likely to be greater because the quality assurance process will be more thoroughgoing than heretofore.  This is understood not to be a difficulty for the statutory audit firms concerned and they do not have a problem with it.</p><p>If IAASA is to undertake these additional quality assurance functions, significant additional resources will be required by that entity.  Again in June of last year, the Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation wrote to his counterpart in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform seeking sanction for IAASA to recruit 11 additional staff.  This has been proceeded by meetings between officials of both Departments.  Again, Senator Barrett referred to that issue.</p><p>I hope this addresses the substantive wording of the amendment as proposed by Senator Barrett.</p></speech>

What the Minister of State Deputy Lynch said on that was that the Government had decided that Ireland should move to a model of independent inspection of the audit of public interest entities based on the model set out in the European Commission recommendation on this matter.  She also said it had decided that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, should carry out these functions instead of the recognised accountancy bodies, RABs.  The RABs currently operate these functions under powers vested in them by regulations transposing various EU audit directives.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, said that international best practice as regards the quality assurance of audits, in particular of those companies classified as public interest entities, is that this should be carried out by public oversight bodies and not by the recognised accountancy bodies of which these audit firms are members.  Public interest entities are in broad terms systematic entities, credit institutions and insurance undertakings in combination with listed companies.  While it is not required by the current EU legislation that this scrutiny is an obligation, the matter is being considered under other proposals at present at EU level.</p><p>The problem with that is that scrutiny is being considered at EU level but it is not a requirement and we, however, have the worst problem.  Nobody produced accounts like the major accounting firms, not just Ernst &amp;amp; Young, which, interestingly, has tried to change its name to EY at this stage, but all the other firms as well that audited the other banks.  I do not know why nothing has been done about those procedures, which were mentioned in the IAASA annual report in 2011, but not in the latest one.  The supply of information seems to be reduced so that, year after year following this problem, nobody has paid any penalties and there is an attempt to persuade us that it is a good idea that the State should take on these functions, even on the recommendation of the EU.  I think the firms which committed those misdemeanours should bear the burden and there should be no question of the State bailing out anything.</p><p>The reason I tabled those amendments is that I wanted to be quite sure of that.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, mentioned the regulatory accounting bodies in her speech, but I do not think they are mentioned in the Bill.  We must ensure the RABs have responsibility until the President signs this into law.  Given their success to date at avoiding penalties and any consequences at all - many of them are still probably working for the State - somebody must say it is time the big accountancy firms performed to the standards we expect.  To allow them to shunt it all to the responsibility of a quango with only 14 staff, with the entitlement to recruit another 11 staff, and which is supposed to be policing 28,000 practising accountants and 19,000 student accountants is letting them off the hook.  That is my concern.  I want the strictest regulation of this sector.</p> <p>Accountants were not alone in causing the morass.  I would rank themselves and the bankers at 95% in causing the morass.  The rest of Irish society has borne the burden and the Minister of State knows it from being a popularly elected person.  We did not have a consistently high standard of auditing in Ireland and it will not come in at no cost to the Exchequer.  Auditing is substantially enhanced but we have not managed to get any money from the big five accountancy firms up to now; they have managed to get far more out of us.  When one sups in such company one needs a very long spoon.</p><p>The success of accountants is in manoeuvring this matter without incurring any penalties for what they have done to this country for five years.  It is a serious reflection on the elected people in the House, including this one, but I shall speak out against the legislation.  Accountants have been getting away with it for far too long.  They need much stricter regulation.  They need to pay what they owe us for the appalling advice they gave us and for putting the country on the rocks.  There are far too many accountants presenting each other with prizes for colour photographs in their accounts, image building, and so on with far too little accountability.  I worry about a country where even accountants do not want to be accountable for their actions.  We take this burden on with serious trepidation.  Why are we being pressurised by the accountants?  We heard as much when they appeared before the finance committee.  The provision will allow them to walk away.  They must send the odd cheque to the regulator but it will be nothing like what they have had to pay Mr. Coulson.  We do not need EU standards but the North American standards of probity.  The accountants have seriously damaged the country.  Today's debate is the first chance I have had since I came to the House to point out that fact.  We asked what the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Body, CARB, did but I think the answer was, &quot;Nothing&quot;.  We asked what penalties the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority imposed but they were minuscule compared with the damage that has been done to the country.</p><p>I ask that we protect taxpayers better than we did in 2008 and to protect them from the degradation imposed upon them by accountants in the country.  That is their purpose and they must do it.  They cannot walk away from those responsibilities.  We must, as we will undoubtedly in the Thomas Byrne case and other cases of white collar crime, extract liabilities from the professions.  Individual firms should remain liable and the costs incurred should be their responsibility.  </p><p>As I said on amendment No. 14, I do not want to see the taxpayer yet again being exposed due to low standards in Irish accountancy and at risk of awards from their private clients.  I am sorry that the State will not try to recoup from accountants or sue them.  In cases where accountants lose against their private clients it is no responsibility of any organisation funded by the taxpayer to help them recoup losses.  </p><p>I am disappointed that section 6 stands.  I do not see any great urgency in it; the urgency was in 2008.  We must tidy up all of the events of 2008, 2009 and 2010.  We must hold people responsible for chronic under-performance and not just take it into State supervision at this late stage.  Go raibh maith agat.</p></speech>

I tabled my amendment because things may develop again and there may be another Anglo Irish Bank.  </p> <p>There could be another case of money being moved into a firm at 11.50 p.m., being moved out at 12.10 a.m. and of people being persuaded that, for the accounting period, it was in it all the time.

The criteria for choosing the five member board in the American system was respect for the public interest and in the interest of shareholders.  Our 14 member board is very heavily dominated by the accounting industry.  The reason I put this forward as a safeguard is that they should not be able to transfer the burdens of the incompetence of their sector to the taxpayer at large.  If there is a judgment, because of inadequate application of quality assurance standards, it should be borne by the industry - I think I have the Minister of State's assurance on that - and not by the general public or the taxpayer.  </p><p>  Currently, to use the jaded phrase, we have been kicking the can down the road and nobody has borne the burden, or certainly no accountants have - in fact, I think they have prospered in the past five years after the way they conducted themselves in 2008.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  The Minister of State should make it quite clear that the costs of the authority will not be a charge on the public purse or on the general public but on the firms found to have breached and pursued an inadequate application of quality assurance standards.</p></speech>

We have all borne the costs because of the incompetence of accountants.  The taxpayer is seen by lawyers as an easy mark.  In my sector, if a lecturer or teacher did something wrong, it would be a much better mark to say he or she was acting on behalf of his or her  college or an even better mark to say he or she was acting on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, in which case the lawyers have a target fund which is the entire national debt of the country.</p><p>Under the system the Minister of State described, the costs always seem to borne by the taxpayers rather than the principals.  Perhaps that is what the courts decided but we advise the courts and we set the law.  Should the misdemeanours and malpractices which we have seen in this sector not be borne by the people in it?  We are trying to protect those who had nothing to do with these transactions but who have borne massive burdens since.  </p><p>The people want us to do this because they have been taken to the cleaners by accountants and bankers.  Any statement we can make that we disapprove of that system and that those involved in malpractice should be held to account, even five years later, would be some relief because people believe they have been made to shoulder all of the burden of this.  We have not singled out the three or four groups which imposed most of the misery on this country.  If they get away with it again, they will keep coming back which is a problem for the Minister of State as a young Minister, and no doubt a future Minister.  This is a chance to spell it out for them on Report Stage.  We do not want them coming back.  The past five years have been a nightmare which we do not wish to repeat.</p></speech>

However, I certainly have some sympathy with what Senator Barrett said.  We have accounting firms, auditing firms, etc., which seemed to be part of the demise of the banking situation we had over those long and hard years, but nobody seems to have been brought to account.  The same applies in other areas, even in the legal profession.  People who signed off on various projects which were found to be less than desirable have got away scot-free.  From that point of view, I sympathise with what Senator Barrett stated because the taxpayer cannot foot the bill on all occasions, which seems to be the situation currently.  We should do anything we can do to tighten that situation.</p><p>Having professions, such as the legal profession, accountancy professions and others, policing themselves is just not acceptable anymore.  It will have to be done independently in the future.  We should examine ways to ensure that happens in many of the professions which police themselves currently.   </p></speech>

It is what we call "lastminute.com".  As indicated during the Second Stage debate, it is proposed to introduce, at the request of the Minister for Justice and Equality, a number of amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 and the Bankruptcy Act 1988 on Report Stage.  For the convenience of Senators, I will circulate an explanation of the amendments.</p><p>The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 amendments will involve the insertion of a new section in page 11, between lines 14 and 15.  The proposed amendments to the Personal Insolvency Act relate to the debt relief notice process provided in that Act.  The process is one of the key judicial debt resolution instruments in the Act and, subject to relevant conditions, allows for the write-off of qualifying debt up to &euro;20,000, subject to a three year supervision period.</p> <p>The amendments are designed to respond to issues raised by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and will assist the MABS approved intermediaries in commencing the operation of the debt relief notice process in the 2012 Act and ensure greater clarity for debtors and creditors alike.</p><p> In brief, it is proposed to amend the Personal Insolvency Act:<blockquote>(a) in section 25, by substituting the following definition for the definition of &quot;debt&quot;:&quot; &quot;debt&quot;, in relation to a debtor, means a debt for a liquidated sum that, on the application date, is payable either immediately or at some future time;&quot;;(b) in section 26, by deleting subsection (4);<br />(c) in section 27(6), by substituting the following for paragraph (a):&quot; (a) the information contained in the debtor's Prescribed Financial Statement is true and accurate in all material respects, and&quot;,(d) in section 43(3)(b), by substituting the following for subparagraph (v):&quot;(v) the procedural requirements specified in this Chapter were not complied with;<br />(vi) the debtor has by his or her conduct within the period of 6 months ending on the application date arranged his or her financial affairs primarily with a view to being or becoming eligible for the issue of a Debt Relief Notice.&quot;, and(e) in section 44(3), by substituting the following for paragraph (f):&quot;(f) the procedural requirements specified in this Chapter were not complied with;<br />(g) the debtor has by his or her conduct within the period of 6 months ending on the application date arranged his or her financial affairs primarily with a view to being or becoming eligible for the issue of a Debt Relief Notice.&quot;.</blockquote> The Bankruptcy Act amendments will involve the insertion of a new section in page 11 between lines 14 and 15.</p><p> With the objective of reducing the costs associated with bankruptcy, the Insolvency Service of Ireland has proposed that it would provide, cost free, a facility on its website for a bankrupt to &quot;notice&quot; that fact as required by law.  Currently, only publication in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il and a newspaper are permitted.  This change could save a bankrupt up to &euro;500 in newspaper costs.</p><p> The textual amendment to a number of relevant sections of the Bankruptcy Act 1988 would allow the Minister for Justice and Equality to prescribe how notice was to be given by the bankrupt.</p><p> A further proposed amendment to section 140A(5) would permit the relevant register to be maintained in electronic format.  As a consequence, I am considering bringing forward amendments to section 8, that is, the commencement provision.  The proposed amendments outlined above will necessitate an amendment to the Long Title of the Bill.</p><p> For the Senators' benefit, I wish to inform them that the proposed amendments will be subject to full discussion on Report Stage.  There is no ambiguity about that.  This is merely a notification to Senators that they are being brought forward.  There will be no issue on Report Stage about ensuring these amendments are discussed thoroughly.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, said that some countries' auditing standards are deemed not to be the equivalent of those in the European Union.  We will let that go given our earlier conversation but included in the list was New Zealand.  It struck me as strange that New Zealand would be classified as a country whose accountancy and auditing standards were low.  I ask the Minister of State to check that between now and Report Stage, especially as there are many New Zealanders around this week who might be annoyed if Members of the House were casting aspersions.  Whatever about the rugby, if the Minister has evidence that their accounting standards are too low we will be glad to hear him on that on the next occasion we debate the Bill.</p></speech>

KfW is a public interest bank with various roles in Germany and beyond.  The Taoiseach gave scant detail when he said that it would be of assistance to the Irish economy, including granting finance to small and medium enterprises, SMEs.  This led one commentator to speculate wildly that it could be a backstop for the Irish Government and its sovereign debt requirements.  It is accepted that will not happen but the lack of detail has allowed that type of speculation to grow.  I want confirmation that this will not happen because the person who made the allegation in one of the national newspapers could well have read the Taoiseach's speech as giving that role to KfW.</p><p>We want to know several things about KfW.  Is it applying for a banking licence in Ireland?  Will it operate on the high-street insofar as there are high street banking services for SMEs?  Has the Government drawn up a memorandum of understanding with the German Government?  KfW is mainly owned by the federal government and partly by the states in Germany.  Does the Minister for Finance have a memorandum of understanding with the bank or with its chairperson who is the German Minister for Finance?  What is the expected level of credit that KfW will make available for Irish business and will it lend directly into business in Ireland or will it provide finance to the banks to then provide finance to business?  Is there any guarantee that the finance will come out of the banking system?  We have had bad experiences over the past few years in that regard and in regard to lending targets.  Will KfW compete with the banks or will it fund them?</p><p>When the Labour Party proposed a strategic investment bank in the last D&aacute;il - and it is in the programme for Government - KfW was mentioned as an example of what could happen in Ireland.  Will this bank complement the proposal in the programme for Government for a strategic investment bank or is it in fact the strategic investment bank?  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.</p></speech>

The discussions included a specific focus on finding ways to reinforce Ireland's economic recovery by improving funding mechanisms for the real economy, including access to finance for Irish SMEs.  In that context, the German Government has asked KfW, the German development bank, to work with the German and Irish authorities swiftly, in order to deliver on this initiative at the earliest possible date.</p><p>Officials of the Department of Finance have already exchanged working papers on this subject with KfW and the German Ministry of Finance.  On Monday of this week a productive consultation was held with the German embassy in Dublin.  This helped pave the way for discussions between the Department of Finance officials and officials of the German Ministry which were held in Berlin this morning.  Further work on this will continue with KfW and other key stakeholders over the coming weeks both here and in Germany.</p><p>The Minister for Finance is keen to see the establishment of a healthy and balanced relationship.  As the Department of Finance is trying to ensure that any initiative that comes out of this process is as effective as it can be, it will discuss approaches that meet the strategic objectives of both States and ultimately facilitate lending to the real economy, in particular to SMEs in Ireland.  This relationship may take the form of a memorandum of understanding or a contract or indeed we may formalise that relationship in some more appropriate fashion.  That is not yet decided.</p><p>KfW's model in Germany is to lend through commercial banks.  In the case of its agreement with Spain it provided a loan to ICO, the Spanish state investment bank which then lent the funding on to the commercial banks in Spain.  In the Portuguese instance there is not currently an established state investment institution and so KfW is assisting the Portuguese authorities in establishing an appropriate organisation and structure for facilitating lending to SMEs.  All appropriate options will be considered in the course of the discussions with KfW for the Irish case.</p><p>KfW holds a banking licence in Germany and under the rules of the EU can passport into Ireland if this is deemed necessary without a requirement to obtain an Irish banking licence.  I should note that KfW's import export, IPEX, bank notified the Central Bank of its intention to passport into Ireland in January 2008.  This, however, is not related to the recent announcement, rather it is part of ensuring that KfW can fulfil its mandate as an import support for German businesses.</p><p>Additionally, the Government has decided to establish the Ireland strategic investment fund, ISIF, which will absorb the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  Using the ISIF, the Department of Finance will maximise our resources to enhance growth in the Irish economy and improve key infrastructure to maintain Ireland's attractiveness as a place to do business and to create employment.  Officials of the Department of Finance are preparing the necessary legislation which the Minister anticipates will be enacted early next year.  Already, in the lifetime of this Government, the NPRF has established funds that support strategic projects and a number that support SME financing.</p><p>Further assessment of the need to create a strategic investment bank over and above the contribution expected from the ISIF will be informed by the requirements of the economy once the Government's key immediate objectives for the repair of the banking system have been completed.  The Department of Finance has not set targets for any strategic investment bank as its role has yet to be fully defined, and due to state aid considerations, its potential market is likely to be somewhat prescribed.  Experience in other countries suggests that any lending facilitated by a state investment institution like KfW or an Irish state investment bank is generally complementary to lending already taking place in an economy and can in fact assist commercial banks with access to cheaper credit lines such as from the European Investment Bank.</p></speech>

I am worried about a matter arising from the Local Government Bill 2013, the potential for rates to apply to unused or closed commercial premises and units.  Will the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government devolve responsibility to local authorities to make the decision on the potential for application of rates on these closed buildings?  High rates are the single biggest reason that many shop units lie empty in our towns.  My home town, Athenry in County Galway, has been hit especially hard with up to 30 vacant units.  There are also many vacant in Gort, Loughrea, Portumna and Tuam as a consequence of this business cost.  There is no doubt that rates deter people from going into business and this needs to be examined.  I have always thought it unfair to ask the business people of each county to shoulder the main responsibility for funding local authorities.  With the advent of the local property tax this must be reconsidered.</p><p>For the purposes of this evening's debate, however, I want to focus on the proposal to charge rates on closed commercial properties.  Members of the Opposition have recently said that the Government will apply a 50% rate on commercial properties that are closed.  Despite these utterances a cross-party delegation from Galway met with the senior Minister in the Department, which was under Fianna F&aacute;il and Independents at the time, who was in favour of levying a 50% charge on closed commercial premises.  I have reservations about this.</p> <p>Galway city is no doubt very different to Galway county.  There is a demand for commercial properties in Galway city, not least because of the footfall, the number of tourists visiting and population figures.  On the other hand, my own constituency of Galway East is like many other rural constituencies throughout Ireland where there are a plethora of shop units and other commercial units vacant and no demand for them.  However, this proposal would disadvantage them further.</p><p>On that basis, I appeal to the Minister of State and the Department to ensure that local authorities have discretion to make a decision on the application of rates on closed commercial properties.  Local authorities are best placed to decide this, given they are most familiar with the particular circumstances of our county towns.  For example, it would be ludicrous to charge rates on vacant premises in places like Athenry, Loughrea, Portumna and Gort in County Galway which, as I said, have a large number of units vacant due to the lack of demand for them.  The local authorities would surely recognise this.  I do not believe it makes sense to allow a Dublin bureaucrat to make the rules when a local authority would have a much better idea as to how to adequately fund itself, while applying fair rates in a way that can be done by taking into consideration the particular circumstances of that town.</p><p>If we stick to the goal of the Local Government Bill, which is to give more power to the local authorities and to the people, by letting the local authorities decide how to charge rates and whether they should apply rates on these buildings in these circumstances, this would help businesses and, therefore, our overall economy, as well as local government.  Our programme for Government called for reform to put people first and I believe we need to do everything to ensure we are always doing that.  To be fair, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government does just that.  Nonetheless, by devolving this responsibility with regard to rates on closed premises to the local authorities, we would be putting the people first.</p></speech>

I will convey Senator Higgins's views to him.</p><p>  The Local Government Act 1946 provides that where a property in a county council or urban local authority area is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate, the owner becomes liable for payment of rates.  However, the owner is entitled to a 100% refund if the property is vacant for specified purposes.  These are: where the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is bona fide unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are vacant pending redevelopment.  A small number of urban local authorities have historically had separate legal provision enabling a refund of 50% of rates on vacant properties.  While the same criteria for refunds apply, 50% of the rates paid is refundable to the owner of vacant premises in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork.  These legislative provisions are as follows: section 71 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930; section 29 of the Limerick City Management Act 1934; and section 20 of the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act 1941.  The majority of local authorities are currently subject to the provisions of the 1946 Act and the 100% refund regime.</p><p>  Section 31(<i>b</i>) of the Local Government Bill 2013 seeks to amend the Local Government Act 1946 by reducing the 100% refund regime to 50% for all local authorities, effectively reducing the refund rate to the same level as currently pertains in Dublin, Limerick and Cork cities.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government's intention, in standardising the level of vacancy refunds in this way, is to provide an additional incentive to commercial property owners to let commercial property and to reduce the incidence of vacancies, particularly in urban centres, thereby bringing commercial properties back into productive use.  From a local authority perspective, vacant commercial properties are also beneficiaries of local authority services such as pavement improvement, street cleaning, street lighting and so on.  It is only fair that owners of vacant properties should make a contribution, though less than those occupied, to the cost of providing these services.</p><p>  The Minister, in introducing the Bill on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il last month, indicated that he is fully conscious of the difficult economic environment in which many businesses and property owners continue to operate.  He further indicated there are numerous factors to be considered when proposing an amendment to rates legislation, including its effect on business sentiment and its impact on local government finances.  The Minister intends that this provision should not be interpreted as a further cost on business and gave a commitment to the House to revert to this matter again as the Bill makes its way through the Oireachtas to ensure there are no unintended consequences in how the provision would work in practice.  There will, of course, also be an opportunity for the issue to be discussed when the Bill comes before this House for debate next month.  I am sure the points raised by Senator Higgins will be considered by the Minister in the immediate future and when the Bill comes to the House.</p></speech>

I would make the observation that Dublin, Cork and Limerick are very different places to towns like Athenry, Loughrea and Gort.  Dublin, Cork and Limerick have demand for commercial units, so it is arguably fair to apply a 50% rates bill on unoccupied commercial premises.  It is very different in rural areas where supply exceeds demand.  That is the difficulty in east Galway, which is why I brought this matter before the House.  I appeal to the Department and the Minister's better judgment so as not to further burden those who own such properties and who are already struggling in this economic recession.  I ask that they take a commonsense approach and perhaps devolve some power to the local authority, which would be more <i>au fait</i> with how these towns are operating in terms of getting tenants into or being able to sell these commercial units.</p><p>  I welcome the fact the Bill is back before the House later this month, when I intend to make a submission on the matter.  I am glad to note the Minister of State will carry my submission back to the senior Minister in the Department.</p></speech>

It is my second time putting down the same Adjournment matter as I also dealt with this in February last, and I am now seeking an update.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, will be very <i>au fait</i> with this, and he ducks every time he sees me in the corridor because he knows well what I am going to ask him about it.</p><p>  For the information of the Minister of State, Kilcummin sewerage scheme was approved, went to tender, had a contractor appointed and had funding made available, but it was then pulled due to a problem with the contractor.  The people of Kilcummin feel absolutely frustrated at this stage.  They are being pushed from post to pillar and from Billy to Jack, as they say, and we seem to be getting nowhere.  If one speaks to the council, it is a matter for the Department; if one speaks to the Department, it is the council's problem.</p><p>  To be fair to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, he said at the end of the debate in February: &quot;If they reach agreement, we are in a position to look at the funding.&quot;  It is not a matter of funding for this scheme, or at least that is what I am being told.  A briefing note from the Minister's office in June 2013 stated that Kerry County Council had commissioned a further technical report which is expected to be forwarded to the Department in July 2013.  At an area meeting of Kerry County Council during the week, the councillors were advised that the report was with the Department.  Nobody seems to get a clear answer, so I hope the Minister of State is here to give me a clear answer and outline the current position.  Is it with the Department or the council, and what is the hold-up?  It is a never-ending saga for the people of Kilcummin.  I will wait for the Minister of State's reply before I comment further.</p></speech>

I am taking the matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan.</p><p>The Kilcummin sewerage scheme is included in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010-13 as a scheme to advance through planning during the life of the programme.  As the Senator will be aware, Kerry County Council awarded a contract for the combined Kilcummin-Barraduff sewerage scheme in 2007.  Work commenced on this contract in April 2007.  However, the contractor at the time was also engaged in construction work on another sewerage scheme, the Milltown sewerage scheme.  As a result, progress on the Kilcummin-Barraduff contract was slow.  In July 2007 the council suspended the contract in accordance with the terms that were set out in it.  The contractor agreed to withdraw from the Kilcummin portion of the contract and resumed work in Barraduff.  As a consequence of the problems, no work was carried out on the Kilcummin scheme.</p><p>Kerry County Council submitted a revised proposal for the Kilcummin sewerage scheme to my Department in December 2009.</p> <p>In view of the high unit costs associated with providing the scheme, the council was requested by my Department in May 2010 to review its scope.  The council submitted a further proposal to the Department in June 2012.  Concerns persisted regarding the unit costs of the scheme and, following discussions with the Department, it was decided that the council would submit further information to enable the Department to make a decision on the matter.  That submission is awaited.</p><p>The Minister is conscious of the impacts the discharges from Kilcummin are having on the local environment and on Lough Leane and is keen to have the problem resolved.  Therefore, when Kerry County Council submits the additional information, it will be dealt with without delay.  I am sure the Senator will hold us to that.</p><p>The council, meanwhile, has been moving ahead with the improvement of water services infrastructure in the county.  It has completed ten schemes or contracts in this regard, including sewerage schemes for Firies, Milltown, Farranfore, Rathmore and Barraduff, and water supply schemes or contracts in Listowel, Cahersiveen, Ardfert and at Scart reservoir, which is part of the central regional water supply scheme.  It has also completed the combined Waterville water and sewerage scheme.  The council expects to go to tender shortly on the Ardfert sewerage scheme and to award the contract for wastewater treatment plants for the Ballylongford and Tarbert sewerage schemes.  In addition, the council is also pressing ahead with its water conservation programme throughout the county, which was identified as a key priority under my Department's water services investment programme.</p><p>From 1 January 2014, Irish Water will be responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure.  That body is engaging with each local authority to assess priorities and is preparing a capital investment plan for 2014-2015.  This plan will provide for the transition of relevant projects currently included in the water services investment programme.</p><p>I realise this is not the definitive answer the Senator was seeking, but I hope it will provide some clarity.  To reiterate, the Minister has said there will be no delay in making a decision on the matter raised.</p></speech>

Somewhere along the line, it seems to have fallen through the cracks.</p><p>The Minister of State's reply was disappointing in that it echoed, almost word for word, the response I received in February this year.  The only substantive difference is the indication that the report is not with the Department.  I will have to go back to Kerry County Council to try to discover the true story.  It is claiming the report is with the Department.  Somebody, it seems, is telling porkies.</p></speech>

I am not a wholehearted advocate of direct provision as a means of housing people who are seeking asylum in this country, many of whom are in a distressed state.  I have been to two of these centres and was not at all impressed with what I saw.  We have responsibilities and duties as a State to respect and protect people who come here seeking asylum and to ensure that regard is given to their sense of integrity, belonging and decency.</p><p>What I saw in the two centres I visited was people putting their best foot forward.  The visits were arranged, with the centre management aware well in advance of our attendance.  I suspect we might have seen many different things if we had arrived unannounced.  Other public representatives who have visited direct provision centres over the years have told me they were met with aggression when they sought to speak to residents alone and hear their concerns.</p><p>As a country, millions of our people have emigrated over many decades.  Some were treated extremely well and have prospered and enriched the countries to which they migrated.  Others were not so lucky and were treated very badly.  We have all heard the stories of the signs in the windows of business premises proclaiming &quot;No dogs, no Irish&quot;.  Are we as a society prepared to stand over a system where people who come to our country to seek refuge are not properly respected but are instead made to feel humiliated, isolated and degraded?  That is what is happening in this country at this time.  It is a national scandal.  Coming generations will look back in shame at how we treated people in this situation.</p><p>An all-party Seanad committee has been establish to examine the system of direct provision, make some waves and, at the very least, give the people concerned a voice.  Various non-governmental organisations are doing good work in this area, but they have essentially been voiceless in so far as their efforts do not seem to have attracted the type of popular support for which one would have hoped.  I acknowledge the efforts of my friend and colleague, Senator Jillian van Turnhout, in this area.  She is a member of the Seanad all-party committee, as are Senator Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh and others.</p><p>As a start in terms of tackling this issue, and it is nothing more than a start, I am calling for a provision whereby elected Members of the Oireachtas would be able to knock on the door of any of the 30 plus centres, present their identification and be able to gain access to speak to residents and examine the facilities.  A model in this regard is the well-established prison visiting committee system in all prisons in this country.  Some of those committees work well while others do not.  Committee members can turn up, with their identification, and gain access to the facilities at any time of the day or night.  I propose that any new contract that is issued to providers of direct provision services - I understand these matters come under the remit of the Reception and Integration Agency - should include a provision whereby any Member of the Oireachtas, with proper identification, would be facilitated to perform random inspections of the premises and to speak in confidence to residents and hear their concerns.</p><p>As I said, our treatment of asylum seekers is an issue on which future generations will look back and be very ashamed.  I am not sure of the Minister of State's view on this matter, but I know she is a compassionate person.  It is a pity the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, is not here to respond.  He had a great deal to say on this issue when he was in opposition.  I would like to see him implement some of the proposals he put forward when he was on the other side of the House.  It is amazing how people who go into government seem to end up allowing advisers to mute their instincts and beliefs.  Sometimes in politics, as in life, hard decisions have to be made and leadership must be shown.  Sometimes one must throw caution to the wind and tell officials how it is to be done.  There is an imperative to do the right thing.  As a first small step in this regard, Oireachtas Members, on the basis of their mandate from the people, should be able to present at direct provision centres - which, after all, are funded by the taxpayer - perform an inspection and thereafter report back to Parliament as they see fit.</p></speech>

He is concerned that unrestricted access might not be appropriate for a number of reasons, not least the rights of asylum seekers resident in these centres to their privacy and the obligations placed on the service providers.  The centres are privately run, operating under contract to RIA.  Those contracts provide for unannounced visits in circumstances where these are both necessary and appropriate.  An example of such a circumstance would be where access to the centre is needed by RIA officials and by private independent inspectors under contract to RIA for the purpose of carrying out inspections.  Of course, all centres are equally subject to unannounced inspections by other State bodies, for example, environmental health officers and fire safety inspectors have a right to inspect RIA accommodation centres without notice.  All completed inspections carried out in RIA centres after 1 October 2013 will be published on RIA's website, <i>ria.gov.ie</i>.</p><p> Of necessity, unannounced visits would have to take account of RIA's child protection policies which require,<i>inter alia</i>, the need for prior vetting.  The Minister would be concerned that if Members were being accompanied by other interested parties, such as media or non-governmental organisations, NGOs, this requirement would have to be complied with.  Of course, these centres are publicly funded, but so are many other facilities to which access rights for Members of the Oireachtas would never be sought or contemplated.  These are people's homes and their privacy must be respected.</p><p> While the Minister has no doubt of the bona fides behind what is proposed in this Adjournment matter, he does not believe it would be appropriate to accede to it.  However, he is happy to deal with requests for visits in the same way as they have been dealt with to date, and he will continue to seek to facilitate any requests that are made to him, consistent with the need to meet other demands on RIA and on individual centres.</p><p> The Senator made his case very strongly.  Unfortunately, the Minister could not attend to hear it but I will convey the sentiments the Senator has expressed.  The point about privacy is valid, but perhaps there are other ways of meeting the residents without having to invade their privacy.</p></speech>

However, I believe the Minister has made the wrong decision on this.  There is nothing as powerful as transparency.  Of course appropriate protocols would have to be put in place to which people who participated in such visits would have to adhere, and of course there are child protection criteria.  Any Oireachtas Member with a keen interest in this issue would take significant cognisance of child protection and whatever vetting is necessary.  I would not envisage a scenario where an Oireachtas Member would show up at a centre and show his or her identification at 2 a.m.  That would be totally inappropriate.  It would also be inappropriate for a Member of the Oireachtas to turn up with a journalist.  The Member would probably be accompanied by another Member of the Oireachtas.</p><p>There is a significant issue of transparency involved here.  Many people and NGOs do not believe these centres are run to the highest possible standard.  Simple things can be done to make life a great deal easier.  Reputable journalists such as Carl O'Brien have written extensively about this issue.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand and pretend it does not exist.</p><p>I am disappointed with the reply, but I will continue to advocate, along with my colleagues on the working group.  We will meet to discuss this reply and an appropriate response will be made in due course.</p></speech>
