    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-22a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062200002#A00500"><p>The Minister of State is very welcome.  I wish to raise the issue of sickle cell disease and patients with the disease.  Last weekend, I attended a fantastic celebration in Malahide to raise awareness of sickle cell disease.  I have been to several awareness days in recent years.  The organisation in question is an incredibly positive one, even when it comes to dealing with such a serious condition.</p> <p>There are more than 600 people in Ireland with sickle cell disease.  More than two thirds of those with the disease are under 18 years of age.  The majority of those with sickle cell disease are treated at two centres of expertise, namely, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, and St. James's Hospital.  It is really important to get early diagnosis in order to prevent early deaths.  The team at Crumlin hospital have done incredible work over many years and have organised neonatal screening that is now carried out at the majority of maternity hospitals.</p> <p>The Minister of State is aware that the migrant population in Ireland has increased in recent years.  Many of those among the migrant population are genetically predisposed to sickle cell disease.  It is one of two major genetic blood disorders that affect red blood cells.  Those living with sickle cell disease experience many significant difficulties.  My priority in tabling this Commencement matter is to raise awareness of sickle cell disease within the migrant community and for migrants to be empowered to undergo genetic testing.  I very much welcome the fact that the national screening advisory committee has added sickle cell disease as one of its priorities this year.</p> <p>I know the Minister of State will have a comprehensive answer for me, so, rather than asking questions, I wish to highlight a particular family.  Esther Onolememen is the founder and CEO of Sickle Cell Society Ireland.  She is the mother of two children with sickle cell disease.  She has identified to me the importance of a registry of children at risk of this life-threatening genetic condition.  As a result of the lack of screening, there was a delay in finding out that her children have sickle cell disease.  One of her children suffered a stroke at eight months, prior to accessing adequate care in Ireland.  Her daughter suffered life-threatening multiple organ failures while accessing care and spent approximately nine months in hospital, with three ICU admissions.  She completed her junior certificate from a hospital bed in Crumlin.  Thankfully, due to the support of international experts and improved medical care within Ireland, she has recovered.  She is still accessing care in hospital, but more regularly than other cohorts.  Not all of the children with sickle cell disease are lucky enough to survive.  There was a terrible incident in 2019 when a young boy with severe sickle cell disease who fought a deportation order died from complications resulting from his ill health.</p> <p>I have a few asks of the Minister of State.  There is a need to work on awareness and a national screening database.  There is a need for awareness in direct provision centres because many people who come here are carriers of the disease but are unaware of that fact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-22a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062200002#B00100"><p>I thank Senator McGreehan for raising this issue and providing me with this opportunity to discuss developments in the area.  The Minister for Health and I fully appreciate that sickle cell disease can place a substantial medical, social and financial burden on patients, their families and their carers.  The Senator outlined exactly what Ms Esther Onolememen and her children had to go through regarding the lack of screening.  It is a lifelong, inherited condition that affects both children and adults.  At present, we have a two-centre approach to treating patients.  Children can access services provided by Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at Crumlin hospital, supported by a multidisciplinary team.  Adults can access the services of the haemoglobinopathy service at St. James's Hospital.  In support of these services, the HSE currently reimburses a number of medicines under the community drugs scheme for the treatment of both adults and children.</p> <p>I am advised a number of new therapies are in development for sickle cell disease.  The Minister hopes to see those coming on stream as soon as possible, if they are proven to be clinically effective, in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  The Senator will be aware the 2013 Act gives full statutory powers to the HSE to make decisions on reimbursement of medicines.  In doing so, the HSE takes account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion, as appropriate.</p> <p>The service at Children's Health Ireland has expanded rapidly since 2000 to cater for the increased prevalence of the disease.  In 2000, 20 children were undergoing treatment for sickle cell disease.  Last year, 385 children were attending the service, as well as 18 with the related condition of thalassemia.  I am pleased to advise there have been other positive developments in terms of services for children.  The centre at Crumlin is now designated by the HSE as an expert centre for haemoglobin and red cell disorders.  A priority for the HSE in 2022 is to further advance the non-malignant haematology service at CHI Crumlin.</p> <p>As regards adult services, St. James's Hospital has provided these services since 2014.  The scale of activity has also grown from 32 patients in 2014 to more than 220 patients attending the service in 2021.  Since the service was set up in 2014, service growth and development has been ongoing, including the following: the establishment of multidisciplinary outpatient clinics; the development of transition clinics involving regular collaboration and communication with CHI Crumlin; and the development of a maternity service in conjunction with the Coombe hospital.</p> <p>However, due to the increased demand, I am advised by the HSE the transition of patients over the age of 16 years to adult services is currently a challenge due to capacity constraints at St. James's.  In order to address this issue, a business case is under consideration with HSE leadership to further increase capacity at St. James's to meet the growing demand for these services.  The Minister hopes this business case can be considered by the HSE in as timely a manner as possible in order that we can begin to see improvements in access to services for adult patients at St. James's as soon as possible. </p> <p>I again thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I do not think many people are aware of it.  The number attending adult services has increased from 32 patients in 2014 to 220 patients in 2021.  Some 385 children attended the service last year, which was a major increase from 20 in 2000.  This is an emerging and very serous issue.</p></speech>

We must grow our medical intelligence to assist doctors to get the best research and care to be passed on to these patients.</p> <p>I reiterate the few proposals I would like the Minister of State to bring back to the Department.  I would like it to focus on the cohort of people who are genetically predisposed to this disease, particularly in direct provision centres, to make sure they have screening for sickle cell disease.  Like cystic fibrosis, it takes two carriers to have a child with sickle cell disease.  Children are been born in Ireland and their parents do not know that they have sickle cell disease.  I called for the setting up of a database and registry to examine the geographic spread and to consider the possibility of having satellite care clinics.   If one is based in Galway or Cork, travelling to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital or CHI Crumlin would involve a major financial cost and often those people do not have those financial resources.  Research in the area and an awareness campaign are needed, particularly for people who are genetically predisposed to the condition.</p></speech>

She spoke about those who are genetically predisposed to this disease living in direct provision centres and requested a database be set up and satellite care centres be provided.  That is a very worthy solution to a very difficult issue.</p> <p>There is no doubt with the growing prevalence of the disease, services for adults are stretched.  The services available for those with sickle cell disease faced capacity challenges in recent years as the demand for both paediatric and adult services have increased.  I am pleased to inform the Senator the HSE continues to enhance and develop these services in order to provide the necessary level of care to those suffering from this condition.</p> <p>It is encouraging that the centre at CHI Crumlin has been designated as an expert centre for haemoglobin and red cell disorders.  The good work of the HSE at the expert centre in Crumlin was reflected in the approval in 2017 by the European Commission for the inclusion of CHI in the European reference network, EuroBloodNet, and further developments at the centre have been prioritised by the HSE in 2022.  I again thank the Senator for raising this issue.</p></speech>

He does not need me to tell him about the difficulties that exist in our acute hospitals and the significant delays people have in getting access to bed capacity.  Much of the elective work is now delayed because of the crisis in accident and emergency departments.  Some of that relates to the inability of patients to move from the care facility, which is the acute hospital, into either a step-down facility or back home.  Therefore, there is a passage through the system for many.</p> <p>I have identified what I believe is one of the very considerable difficulties that exist.  It is the inability of the HSE or many of the other service providers to be able to hire home care assistants.  From his constituency work over the years, the Minister of State will have had people come to him seeking more home care hours to be made available by the State.  In order words, they want the State to put money aside to enable people to be cared for in their home and for them to allow them to live out their lives there.  That used to be a problem but that is not the problem any more.  The money is in place for the service but the problem is the service providers cannot get staff to fill those hours.  Many more people could be living out the latter days of their lives in their own home if there were care assistants available to them.  </p> <p>I have met many care assistants and I do so on a regular basis.  Some of them are now leaving the service.  The only reason they are doing so is that they are not being properly looked after financially.  The wages are poor but many of them are prepared to do the job because it is flexible work.  What is killing them in the current climate is the cost of travel.  The profile of the Minister of State's constituency is not that much different from mine.  A carer might care for a person who lives ten or 15 miles from where the carer lives and visit that person at 8 a.m.  By 11 a.m. the carer has to be with another person somewhere else.  By 2 p.m. the carer has to be with another person.  By 5 p.m. the carer has to be with another person and by 9 p.m. the carer might be back with the person he or she visited first that morning.</p> <p>Carers may travel more than 100 miles, or sometimes 200 miles, in a day depending on the profile of the people they look after.  It is not sustainable for those people to be asked to continue to do that work at the rate they are being paid for mileage.  It is abysmal.  They just about got by when diesel and petrol was somewhere between &euro;1 and &euro;1.12 or &euro;1.13 per litre.  It is now &euro;2.13 per litre.  These are people on very low incomes in the first instance.  They provide a phenomenally valuable service.  Without them many more people would be in the care of State, putting a further burden and pressure on the acute services, further lengthening the wait time in places like University Hospital Limerick, UHL.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We saw from the HIQA report the appalling display of service available to patients.  If we do not intervene at the home care assistant level, the problem is going to get worse.  As the price of fuel continues to spiral out of control, and we accept that is outside of our control, these people will not be able to keep their cars on the road and continue to travel and do the great work they are doing.  I am appealing to the Minister of State to look at every line item in the budget of his Department and try to find an appropriate amount of money to make it possible for these people to do their work.  Their low wages can be dealt with through the normal labour relations mechanism.  I have argued about this before and will again.  However, there needs to be an urgent intervention putting in place a few extra cent to make it possible for them to do their phenomenal work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-22a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1608" speakername="Frank Feighan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062200002#C00200"><p>I thank Senator Dooley for raising this issue which is raising its head all over the country.  I have seen it in my constituency as well.  As part of the broader Sl&aacute;intecare reform of our health and social care system, the Government is committed to reorientating the model of care towards primary and community care.  In furtherance of this objective, in budget 2021 my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, secured additional funding of &euro;150 million for home support.  This is supporting the development of a statutory home support scheme as well as the delivery of 5 million additional hours of home support.  The funding secured in budget 2021 to provide the additional 5 million hours has been maintained for 2022 and preliminary data indicate that at the end of April 2022, some 6,902,191 home support hours had been delivered nationally to 54,949 people.</p> <p>Against this background, the Minister of State is aware that some home support providers require their front-line employees to pay for the travel costs they incur in the course of their duties, and I thank Senator Dooley for raising the matter.  While the HSE pays for the travel expenses incurred by healthcare support assistants whom they employ to provide home support, providers in the voluntary and private sectors do not always do so, nor is there any obligation for them to do so when contracted to provide services on behalf of the State by the HSE.</p> <p>This is one of many issues currently being explored by the cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory group.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, established this group in March 2022 following a call for submissions from relevant stakeholders such as the Senator.  The remit of the group is to identify and formulate recommendations to address strategic workforce challenges in the home support and nursing home sectors.  Accordingly, the group is examining issues such as recruitment, retention, training, career development and pay and conditions of front-line carers in these sectors so that solutions can be found.</p> <p>The group's deliberations will be informed by an evidence review of the role, function and supply of home support workers in four European countries, which has been commissioned by the Department of Health from the Health Research Board and which will provide insight into home support workers' employment conditions internationally.  Stakeholder engagement is also central to the work of the group.  As part of a structured programme of consultative engagements with key sectoral stakeholders, a facilitated workshop was held on 23 May.  The group continues to liaise with these stakeholders to further explore the issues arising and will submit a report for my consideration by September 2022.  The report will outline the group's findings and recommendations as well as an action plan for the recommendations' implementation.</p> <p>Concurrently, the Department of Health is preparing a general scheme and heads of Bill to establish a licensing framework for professional home support providers.  Secondary legislation setting out the minimum standards with which providers must comply in order to be licensed and HIQA national quality standards is also being developed.  This will provide a robust regulatory framework for a sector which is at present unregulated, clarifying home support workers' rights and responsibilities.  A public consultation on the draft minimum standards is under way and will close on 28 July 2022.</p> <p>I think the Senator is looking for a stipend, effectively, for these great workers who are providing an incredible service.  I would think the sooner we can come up with some solution, the better.  Across the country we are all facing this.  It is an issue we need to address as quickly as possible.  It is not just a service these staff are providing but they are also saving a lot of extra hours in hospitals, nursing homes and so on.  I would like to get this raised.  I do not think Covid has helped.  A lot of people have looked for other opportunities.  We need to make sure this very important work is enhanced and continued.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-22a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1655" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062200002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State's response.  While I know what the Department is trying to do, I am concerned that the issue will be lost in reports and more bureaucracy.  The State has outsourced this service and does so with other services through section 38 and section 39 agreements.  Clarecare in County Clare is an example.  It was never given back the funding that was cut.  There were plenty of carefully worded responses from Ministers at the time stating it was a matter for the voluntary body to figure out how it paid people and what they did and did not do.  The truth is that when the cut came and the Department cut HSE staff, the cuts were imposed on the private sector operators as well but the money was never properly returned to the level it should have been.  That is a separate issue I hope can be addressed in due course through ongoing dialogue and debate.</p> <p>The issue I am raising now is the cost of travel, which has been exacerbated dramatically by the increase in the cost of fuel.  It has doubled in cost.  It is obvious that we do not have people to fill these positions.  They are not prepared and cannot afford to do it.  Immediate intervention is needed.  Otherwise there will be more people on trolleys in accident and emergency departments because we will not have the bed capacity to address demand.</p></speech>

For example, in March 2022 the Scottish Government published a national workforce strategy for health and social care to address the challenges they face in Scotland.  This Government is committed to addressing the strategic workforce challenges that exist in the home support sector in Ireland.</p> <p>It should be noted that, notwithstanding these challenges, progress is being made in increasing home support provision.  Overall service delivery has increased by approximately 17% year on year and the total number of people waiting for home support has fallen from over 9,000 at the start of 2020 to 5,068 by the end of May 2022.  In providing clarity on the roles of service providers, home support workers, service users and family carers, the regulation of the home support sector will ensure the quality of home support services and safeguard service users.  The work of the strategic workforce advisory group is progressing and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, is confident the recommendations of the group will be effective in addressing the workforce challenges that we face in the home support and nursing home sectors.</p> <p>Senator Dooley has raised the possibility of some stipend - I will not say a magic bullet - to address the increased cost of fuel.  This is happening in all sectors.  It is an emerging issue and we need to tackle it.</p></speech>

In December last, I tabled the exact same Commencement matter.  Before I list chronologically some of the delays and problems around this, I will refer to the Minister of State's response to my Commencement matter on 9 December 2021.  This is around the question of international students' health insurance.  The Minister of State said:</p> <blockquote> 	As outlined in my opening reply, this issue concerns international students coming to study in Ireland who are required to adhere to particular immigration visa requirements, one of which relates to having private health insurance.  I repeat that it is not within my policymaking role within the Department, as the Senator said.  Officials in my Department have been engaging with officials in the Department of Justice to see if this requirement should be necessary for these students at all.  It is good that those discussions are at an advanced stage and, in the coming weeks, I hope to have some positive progress to communicate to the Senator.  Perhaps in two months, or certainly at some time next year, this issue will be resolved. </blockquote> <p><!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I first raised this issue in 2020, not long after I came into this House.  The failure to address the question of health insurance for international students is potentially prohibiting a number of international students from coming here.  As I communicated to the Minister of State in December of last year, this is an issue that falls between a number of Departments.<br/><br/>On 24 September 2020, I raised this matter with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, and I have also raised it with him at Oireachtas committees.  I have also raised the issue with the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  Every time I raise it, I am told that negotiations are taking place between officials.<br/><br/>On 5 March 2021, I introduced the Health Insurance (International Students) (Amendment) Bill, with the aim of addressing this matter.  I engaged in discussions with the Department of Health and was told that discussions were taking place in other Departments.  I decided not to proceed with an amendment to the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2021 because I was assured at the time that this matter would be addressed.  As the Minister of State will recall, that assurance was given just a week after a Commencement debate taken by the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  In response to me, the Minister of State said:</p><blockquote>	I know this is causing a lot of bother for students from non-EEA countries studying in Ireland.  I understand the officials are engaging on this and that there will be a positive update in the new year. </blockquote><p>In February 2022, I raised this issue again on the Order of Business in this House.  I have regularly raised it with officials in the Department of Health.  Clearly, somebody in either the Department of Health or the Department of Justice is not doing his or her job.  This situation cannot continue.  For two years, I have been told that progress is being made, yet we are no further on since I first raised this issue in 2020.  It is the international students who are impacted and losing out.<br/><br/>Last December, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, gave me a commitment in good faith that the issue would be resolved within two months.  While I have no doubt his approach to this matter is genuine, it is simply not acceptable that a number of Departments are supposed to be sorting out this matter and somebody is clearly not doing his or her job.</p></speech>

I note his continued engagement with the Minister for Health and his Department on this issue.  The requirement for international students to have health insurance is a matter of immigration policy, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.</p> <p>I acknowledge the Senator's dedication to this issue and understandable frustration at a lack of response.  I, too, am frustrated that he tabled a Commencement matter on this issue on 9 December last, to which I responded, raised it again during the Second Stage debate on the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2021 when the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, was in the House, and raised it again on 15 December last.  On all of those dates, the Senator was informed that work was being done by officials in both the Departments of Health and Justice and a resolution was hoped for in a matter of weeks.  Unfortunately, it has not been possible to resolve this matter yet.  However, I have been informed that communication is continuing between both Departments on this issue.  My brief includes a statement that "I hope it will be possible to resolve in the near future".  That response is not good enough.</p> <p>As I have said, students are coming to Ireland.  They are required to hold health insurance as part of the conditions of securing a visa.   As immigration policy is a matter for the Minister for Justice, this seems to be an issue.  I will give an account of the rationale behind our community-rated health insurance market and where the regulatory mechanisms for it intersect with this issue, as this matter falls within the remit of the Department of Health.  I will also describe supports community rating gives to older and sicker people who decide to avail of health insurance.</p> <p>As the Senator will know, we have a voluntary and community-rated market in Ireland.  This means there is no requirement for any person to procure private health insurance under Irish health insurance legislation.  Community rating means that when people decide to purchase health insurance they are not risk-rated and, therefore, not discriminated against on the basis of age, gender or health status.  This is long-established Government policy and ensures that health insurance policies are affordable for everyone.</p> <p>In order to maintain a policy of community rating and under the Health Insurance Acts, any person who is ordinarily resident in the State and purchasing private health insurance must buy a community-rated health insurance policy from a registered insurer.  This ensures the products these consumers are buying are regulated by the independent regulator of health insurance, namely, the Health Insurance Authority.  Providers who sell health insurance to consumers must also comply with the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts relating to open enrolment, community rating, lifetime cover and minimum benefits.</p> <p>The current issue regarding international students and health insurance arose because travel insurance-type products were being sold to students who were here for longer than one year, in which case those buying health insurance should purchase a community-rated health insurance product.  This was the subject of court proceedings where the court found in favour of the Health Insurance Authority, which took an enforcement action against the company providing these travel insurance policies to students staying for more than one year.</p> <p>Irish health insurance legislation does not currently contain any reference to persons who are required to hold health insurance.  This requirement is a part of a person's visa checklist when he or she is preparing to come and stay in this country.  The policies and procedures around visas are not within the Minister for Health's policymaking remit.</p> <p>What is needed in this regard is cross-Department co-operation.  Many months ago, we said this matter would be resolved in the future.  It is not good enough that it has not been resolved.  I will bring this matter to the attention of my Department and the Department of Justice.</p></speech>

Is it possible for me to withdraw my Commencement matter?  With all due respect to the Minister of State, and I am not criticising him personally, his reply is the exact same as the one he gave me last December.  I know that because I compared the reply the contents of the two replies and they are almost word for word.  I am not satisfied with the response and for this reason, I seek to withdraw my Commencement matter and direct it to the Minister for Justice.  Is that possible?</p> <p>Officials in the Department have indicated there has been progress but the delay is with the Department of Justice.  No progress has been made for two years.  We have heard about talks and discussions but nothing has happened, despite Ministers in a number of Departments giving commitments that there will be discussion or engagement on this matter.  I ask that the Minister for Justice be invited to the House.  I appreciate that may not be possible with a Commencement matter.  I reiterate that the reply I received is not acceptable.  I ask the Minister of State, at a minimum, to give a commitment that I will get an answer in writing within the next week from the Minister for Justice outlining progress.</p></speech>

As outlined, there are issues concerning international students coming to study in Ireland.  They have particular immigration visa requirements related to having private health insurance.

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire st&aacute;it, an Teachta Madigan, freisin.  T&aacute; d&iacute;om&aacute; orm nach bhfuil an tAire Oideachais &iacute; f&eacute;in anseo, an Teachta Foley anseo agus ba cheart go mbeadh s&iacute;.  </p> <p>It is a shame that the Minister for Education has not seen fit to be able to be here today.  This is a matter I have put tabled on a number of occasions and the Minister of State has come to the House on a number of occasions to reply on issues relating to this school.  It is a shame that the Minister is not here as this is a direct responsibility of hers in the Department of Education, rather than related to the Minister of State's brief, which concerns special educational needs.  I want to put on the record the credit given to the Minister of State by the community of Gaelscoil Laighean for the work she has done in this area.  I recognise that she is supportive of what the community is trying to do.</p> <p>As she is very well aware, there is a major issue with Gaelscoil Laighean, a small Gaelscoil currently located in Kill of the Grange in Deansgrange.  It is currently in a two-room building and the school community is extremely stressed about the space available for it to grow.  The reality is that the inaction of the Department is preventing the school from growing.  Until it has the space to grow, it cannot take in extra classes and pupils, despite the fact that there is significant demand for that.  </p> <p>The Minister of State will also be aware that for a number of years the school has sought an alternative to the Kill of the Grange site.  One has now been found at Mount Anville and disposed of by the Department of Education, and is now in a position to proceed, although I recognise that there is a certain amount of time involved in creating a school on the site.  However, we also know that there is not enough room in Kill of the Grange for the school to grow in the way it needs.  At the moment, there are 75 students enrolled for September.  It has another class coming in and it does not have the physical space to accommodate it.  </p> <p>As far as I can see, the Department has done absolutely nothing to progress the fact that the school needs space for the new class.  The parents and community of the school identified the school site in Mount Merrion that would accommodate the school on an interim basis before moving to the site in Mount Anville.  The Department did not do that work; the parents did.  Notwithstanding that, permission was required to construct the tig&iacute;n, or prefab building, in Mount Merrion to accommodate the school on an interim short-term basis.  </p> <p>It was for the Department to make an application to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council under section 5 of the Planning and Development Act in respect of exempted development status for the site so that a building could be put in place.  As I understand it, that application has still not been made and there is no good explanation as to why that has been the case.  There has been talk about this for months.  It is a simple application.  Engineers have attended the site and examined it, and I understand the application is ready or will be submitted soon.  Why has it not yet been submitted?  </p> <p>As long as it is not in, all the parents, families and teachers connected to Gaelscoil Laighean are in limbo.  They do not know what is going to happen.  They cannot plan for after-school classes, which were to be made available on the Mount Merrion site.  They cannot plan for commuting to and from the school in the morning.  People living in Mount Merrion have taken their children out of local schools to attend the school in September and now do not know where it is going to be.  </p> <p>The interim proposal from the Department, which has been communicated to all parents and An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, is to have a site across the road in the community centre of Kill of the Grange parish.  That is not acceptable.  There is a busy road.  It is proposed that a small school be divided between two sites, which would involve children crossing the road at lunchtime, little or big break or whatever else.  More importantly, that will divide teachers and classes.  It is not a real solution.</p> <p>I hope the Minister of State will have some information on this.  I want to know why the building has not progressed and why we have not given parents some certainty regarding what will happen with the school in September, which is just a few months away.  I hope we can make progress on this issue.</p></speech>

As he knows, it is something of which I am acutely aware.  I have had numerous conversations with families whose children want to attend Gaelscoil Laighean.  As we know, we want a permanent building to be provided as soon as possible on the Mount Anville site.  I understand the Department lodged a planning application with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on Tuesday, 21 June, to provide interim accommodation on the Mount Anville site.</p> <p>I understand that, as a contingency arrangement, the Department has, as the Senator said, submitted a section 5 application to the council to determine whether a proposal to provide interim accommodation on the grounds of Mount Merrion community centre requires planning permission or is considered exempted development.  I understand it will lodge that application this week.  The interim accommodation, which can be installed on either site once permission is secured, has been procured and is available to the Department for installation.  I am not aware of the reason the application is only being submitted this week.  It would have been preferable for it to have been done before now.  </p> <p>I will bring the Senator's Commencement matter to the attention of the planning and building unit and the Minister to make sure that we can expedite the building of a permanent building as soon as possible.  I understand that heads of terms have been agreed and the Department is waiting on draft contracts.  It is expected that conveyancing will conclude shortly. </p> <p>That still leaves a gap, as the Senator said, between where we are now and when the children will attend school.  I note what he said about the fact that the interim accommodation in Kill of the Grange would not have the capacity to take in any more children or expand.  He mentioned after-school or afternoon classes and commuting.  </p> <p>I understand 39 pupils are enrolled and another 24 are expected to begin in the new the school year.  I believe there are two contingency plans.  One involves the Mount Merrion community centre and the second concerns the parish hall, as the Senator said.  The Department has worked with An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta to identify contingency arrangements.  </p> <p>The difficulty is that we know the permanent school building will not be built by September and, therefore, we need to find an arrangement that is satisfactory for the families, whether that involves the use of the parish hall in Blackrock or the Mount Merrion centre, which is near where I live.  Fire and disability access certificates will be required on whichever site is available first.  I understand applications are being prepared.</p> <p>The views of parents are critical in ensuring that we have adequate facilities for children and that the commute and after-school activities will not be unduly onerous while the school community awaits the building of permanent accommodation.  I hope the Department, which is listening to this contribution, will be able to provide some clarity on that in early course.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that the application will be made in short order.  It should have been made weeks ago.  The reality is that it is unlikely I will have an opportunity to raise this issue again before the end of this session, but I am not letting this go.  I may come back here in September.  So help me God, if the school community in Gaelscoil Laighean has been left in the lurch again there will have to be consequences in terms of the inaction of the Department.  This should have happened and it is simply not fair to the school community to leave it in the lurch like this, not knowing what is going to happen.</p> <p>Those living in Mount Merrion do not know whether they will have to drive to Deansgrange in the morning with children before driving to work, wherever that might be.  That is not fair on parents and households.  Action needs to be taken.  I dearly hope that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council will deem this to be exempted development so that matters can progress.  I hope the interim site in Mount Merrion will be in place in time for September.  It should be, and if it is not, we know who is to blame.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter.  Just months before the start of the new school year, we have heard that hundreds of children do not have appropriate school places.  AsIAm, the national autism charity, published a survey earlier this month showing that at least 267 children do not have appropriate school places for September.  According to the survey, at least 112 children aged between one and six are on waiting lists for an appropriate school place.  Just 20% of people who responded have a child with a school place in their locality for September.  It is believed that the actual numbers are much higher than this snap survey has shown.</p> <p>Last month, the Government proposed opening five special educational needs centres in Dublin as an emergency measure to respond to the shortage of suitable school places.  I add my voice to those parents and disability organisations who have said this is no solution to a very real problem.  </p> <p>The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has also raised concerns about this proposal.  IHREC monitors Ireland&rsquo;s obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and has called on the Department to take a human rights- and equality-based approach.  It has called on the Government to ensure mainstream educational provision that is fully inclusive of all people with disabilities.  This means making sure children have appropriate school places that meet their needs.  This is an education issue, a disability rights issue and a child&rsquo;s rights issue.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Autism, the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, I have spoken often on how we need to work towards a fully inclusive society that upholds the rights of all our people.  </p> <p>The Minister of State said that she plans to start issuing section 37A orders to schools, if needed, to make sure that spaces are available for children in special classes in schools but we know that is a lengthy process.  However, we also know the Oireachtas can pass legislation very quickly when the political will and pressure is there.  Is this not an emergency situation that requires an emergency response?</p> <p>My question is very straightforward.  Is the proposal to set up separate special education centres still being considered?  I am looking for a straight "Yes" or "No" answer if it is possible.  The children, families and their advocates deserve to hear that.  If that plan is no longer being considered, will the Minister of State use her authority to enact emergency legislation to make sure the additional special educational units needed in our schools will be there for September?</p></speech>

I have a budget of &euro;2 billion, which is more than 25% of the entire education budget and an unprecedented amount.  It has grown by 60% since 2011.  Due to that, we have been able to put in place many more special education teachers.  We have more than 14,000 of those and more than 19,000 special needs assistants, SNAs.  In addition, special classes and special school places are at unprecedented levels. but, clearly, there is still a gap for some children and we need to make sure that we provide for them.</p> <p>Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, my Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked over the past two years, since I have been in this role, on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process, which has ensured a targeted approach to meet the demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year.</p> <p>The Department and the NCSE have introduced a number of strategic initiatives to deliver the scale and quantity of special educational needs, SEN, provision required for our children and young people.  The Department has a geographical information system that is being utilised to support a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to the planning and delivery of SEN provision.  Some of the initiatives that are bearing fruit from that are: 269 special classes opened in September 2021, with a further 33 opening for 2021-22; 315 new special classes opening for the 2022-23 school year; two new special schools established in Cork and Dublin in 2021; and a new special school opening in Cork in the 2022-23 school year.  In addition, there is a new major policy departure in the Department where we got the fee-charging schools under the Spiritan Education Trust to agree to open special classes for the very first time.  It will open a new special school in existing accommodation at the Templeogue College campus in Dublin, with an overall objective to provide a modern permanent provision for the school to enable it to cater for up to 150 pupils when completed, adding very significant capacity for the south Dublin area.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned section 37A of the Education Act.  That process has been initiated for the third time by the Department and I triggered it.  The NCSE wrote to me and formed an opinion that there was insufficient special class capacity in Dublin.  At the moment, we have special class and special school provision completely covered outside of Dublin.  Dublin is the pinch point and that is what we are trying to sort out.</p> <p>The NCSE advice in May was that 80 special class places and 49 special school places were still needed for September this year.  Since then, due to much ongoing work, we reduced those places to 56.  We are making progress and we will continue to make progress during the summer.  I recognise how stressful it is for families who are working hard to get sufficient school and special class placements.  </p> <p>Stage one of section 37A is now complete.  The Senator will be aware that the process itself is under review.  It needs to be streamlined and truncated.  It is the only tool available to me at present.  However, we want to make sure that we review that properly and that it is more streamlined.  </p> <p>On emergency legislation, which the Senator mentioned as well, my Department is considering the need to bring in emergency legislation to assist us in securing additional placements where we do not have them in schools at present.  My officials are currently engaged with the Office of the Attorney General on that matter.</p></speech>

Is there any way she could give the children and parents a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; answer?  Is it still on the table to open five separate centres for children with special educational needs?</p> <p>I appreciate the &euro;2 billion that has gone into special educational funding this year.

The Department is working closely with stakeholders and the advocacy groups she mentioned to ensure that children with special educational needs can access educational places appropriate to their needs.  My Department and I are listening really closely to the voice of parents and those representing children with disabilities.  That is essential to ensure that what we deliver meets their needs.</p> <p>There is a shared determination to work intensively on the issues facing us.  We are doing that through the special education consultative forum I set up on which all the advocacy groups are represented.  We are focusing on addressing this need without having to introduce other avenues of support than those I have already outlined.  That has always been our first priority.</p> <p>Any additional supports that could be provided to parents of children who are availing of home tuition and which are currently being discussed, as I said, through our special education consultative forum would require the mutual support of the forum and the Department.  Engagement on this is continuing.</p> <p>I want to reassure Senator Flynn that I will continue to support children with additional needs in whatever way I can with the support of the advocacy groups.  Whatever way we move forward it will be in a united way with those representative bodies.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, although I am disappointed that of three Ministers of State and the Minister in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage not one of them could be here to discuss this matter.  Nonetheless I welcome Deputy Madigan.</p><p>I have been raising this issue for many years in various ways with different Ministers.  The issue is the perilous financial situation in Galway County Council in terms of its baseline funding.  Last year when the Minister contacted the county council and gave a very welcome once-off allocation of &euro;600,000, he stated the Department was reviewing the local property tax yield and once available allocations would be reviewed.  I now understand that is not going to be concluded this year.  The review will encompass all local authorities.  However, the Department stated that as previously discussed whether a financial plan specific to County Galway may be appropriate is something we can revisit.  Is that something the Department will now look at?  The Department also stated it was available to support and collaborate on this issue.  I certainly think that a specific case and a plan for Galway needs to be enacted prior to the coming budget, before the councillors have to make their decision in regard to local property tax.  </p><p>The baseline figures for Galway are as clear as mud in terms of the revenue budget and revenue <i>per capita</i>.  In the 2022 revenue budget, Galway County Council has a budget of &euro;143.9 million.  Comparable counties such as Mayo and Donegal have around &euro;162 million or &euro;163 million although they have lower populations.  That is basically the issue.  The <i>per capita</i>figure for Galway is &euro;802 compared with Donegal with more than &euro;1,000 and Mayo at &euro;1,256.  That is the crux of the issue that we are trying to address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-22a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062200002#G00500"><p>It just shows that there is a team of people here in the west fighting for funding for the population of the west.  We are the seventh largest population with 180,000 people living in County Galway.  We are the second largest county and that means a hell of a lot of roads in Galway.</p><p>As a Galway county councillor elected in 2019, I am fully aware of the devastating impact in terms of the roll-out of services to people and families who live in our towns and villages.  This is our rural future.  These are the policies we want to roll out at a local level.  We cannot do it because in my own municipal district of Ballinasloe, which goes from Ballymote, close to Castlereagh in Roscommon all the way down to Banagher Bridge, in one section we have more than three vacant positions out of nine for general operatives.  We are down an engineer.  Another technician was promised last year but is still not in place.</p><p>We need clear guidelines on core funding as Senator Kyne as mentioned.  We need to know as it impacts from housing and active travel to fire services and libraries on our ability to provide services in the county for enterprise, our planners, water services, economic development, our tourism and heritage officers who are trying to promote hidden heartlands and trying to bring more income into our area that is already suffering in terms of not being able to access these services that we should be seeing from local authorities.</p><p>Senator Kyne and I have been working closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  The Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will be fully aware that we have raised this a number of times previously.  Our budget is crucial.  As Senator Kyne mentioned it is &euro;802 <i>per capita</i>.  To break that down, looking at each section within a local authority, for example, in housing the national average is &euro;480 per person.  In County Galway, &euro;95 per person is allocated.  It is beyond time that we state that Galway County Council needs support now.  It needs exceptional support.  I look forward to the response from the Department.</p></speech>

At the outset, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has informed me that both Senators have been in constant contact with him about this issue and secured a package last year through their work, and that he will work closely with them again over the coming period of time.</p> <p>The local property tax, LPT, as we know was introduced to provide a stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue and associated expenditure decisions.  LPT allocations to local authorities for 2022 amount to &euro;523.9 million.  This figure includes the Exchequer contribution to equalisation funding of &euro;34.5 million.  Galway County Council was allocated &euro;14.5 million for 2022.</p> <p>In addition to the LPT allocation, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has also agreed a provisional allocation of &euro;4.44 million for Galway County Council in respect of the additional costs that will arise in 2022 as a consequence of the national pay agreements.  This allocation relates specifically to increases in rates of pay and public service pension reductions resulting from the unwinding of financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation and increases in pay and pensions relating to Building Momentum - A New Public Service Agreement 2021-2022.</p> <p>The overall aim of the allocation is to ease the burden on local authorities of the increased costs in 2022.  As part of the budget process the Department engaged with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the financial impact on the sector and secured the allocation which will assist local authorities to meet the costs arising.  Across all schemes and funding resources the Department has provided &euro;82.9 million in 2020 and &euro;85.9 million in 2021 to Galway County Council.  The payments in 2020 also included an allocation to Galway County Council of &euro;1 million, funding that was linked to the operation of municipal districts.  In 2021, Galway received an allocation of &euro;600,000 for additional discretionary income.</p> <p>It should also be noted that unprecedented support was provided for local authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic.  One of the earliest priorities was to secure funding to provide a waiver of commercial rates for businesses impacted by the pandemic while simultaneously supporting local authorities.  In 2020, Galway County Council applied a 100% commercial rates waiver to just over 3,500 businesses and recouped &euro;10.2 million in that regard.  In addition, in recognition of Covid-19 related income losses and additional expenditure incurred, funding of &euro;6.7 million was provided to Galway County Council in 2020.  This support continued in 2021 when the Government introduced a nine-month commercial rates waiver applying to the businesses most seriously affected by the restrictions, and a more targeted waiver for the final quarter of the year.  Galway County Council received &euro;7.3 million for this waiver and an additional &euro;1 million for Covid-19 related income losses and expenditure for 2021.</p> <p>The programme for Government commits to bringing forward LPT reforms, including providing for all money collected locally to be retained within the county.  The Government has signalled its intention that the move to 100% local retention of LPT will be introduced over the 2023 and 2024 budgetary cycles.  It is expected that the LPT yield will change following revaluation last November and the distribution model will be reviewed when the new yield per local authority is fully quantified.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Josepha Madigan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2424"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2424&amp;amp;pid=JosephaMadigan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->However, final figures are not yet available.</p><p>Given the need for timely information to be provided to local authorities for their budgetary process and the need for final local property tax figures to inform that, it is not expected that baselines will be reviewed in advance of the 2023 local authority budget process.  Each local authority position is complex and it is important that sufficient time is taken to analyse and assess potential options in that respect.  Preliminary census data will also form an important input to that deliberation.  The Minister will, however, be considering, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the potential for a move towards 100% retention for 2023.</p><p>I acknowledge the current funding pressures on local authorities and, as such, the funding for Galway County Council and other local authorities will be kept under review as part of the normal Estimates process for 2023 and in the context of the aforementioned final local property tax yield following the revaluation process.</p></speech>

There was mention of money to reverse the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, and the money used during the Covid-19 pandemic.  All local authorities were eligible for those and received them, and they were not particular to Galway County Council.  As Senator Dolan commented, this is about staffing resources to provide services the people of County Galway need, and we need better engagement than we get now.  It is clear now the local property tax will not be reviewed in time for the forthcoming budget and we need a specific plan for County Galway, the possibility of which the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, committed to last year.  I ask that the Department engages on that.</p></speech>

That is in regard of the local property tax.  It is important to recognise that core funding for Galway County Council is the issue.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, must engage with Galway County Council in this regard.</p> <p>There has been an increase in commercial rates within Galway County Council and this shows the executive is making commitments to raise funds.  We know income must be generated within the local area but we need to be able to have the resources to be able to do that.  If we do not have the resources to bring enterprise into our area, how will we get the commercial rates to deliver these services within the county?  We need the resources on the ground to do that for Irish Water and a myriad of other things.  We would appreciate the support of the Minister of State on this.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that Galway County Council moved to increase commercial rates for 2022 to increase the level of funding available to the council, which made an important contribution to the overall position.  Of course, Senators are aware that local authorities may also vary their local property tax rate by up to 15%.  Authorities that increase the rate retain 100% of the additional income, whereas local authorities that decrease the rate bear the full reduction in income.  Galway County Council has opted not to avail of this opportunity to raise additional locally sourced income since 2018.  I am told the council could have benefited from an additional &euro;2.2 million in 2022 if it had applied the additional 15% upward local variation in the same way as many other local authorities have.  That said, the funding position of Galway County Council will be kept under during the 2023 Estimates process.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has an interest in today's contributions and will work very closely with the Senators.  He recognises the work done to date for Galway County Council and will continue to support the Senators in their roles.</p></speech>

E. Stanislav Vidovi, to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery.  We thank him for his presence at our marking of the national day of Slovenia.  This year, we celebrate 30 years of international relations between Slovenia and Ireland.  Slovenia became an independent country on 25 June 1991, and Ireland, together with other EU countries, has recognised its independence since 15 January 1992.</p> <p>However, relations between our two countries go back much earlier than 1992, to the time when the wandering Irish saint, St. Virgil, or St. Feirgil, known as the Apostle of Carinthia, sent Irish monks to preach among the Slovenians.  Those links have strengthened over the centuries through our shared love of language and culture as a cornerstone of the survival of both our nations.  Slovenia became a member of the EU during Ireland's Presidency of the Council of Europe in the spring of 2004.  Slovenia can look back on the success of its Presidency of the EU in 2021, during which it led with great efficiency.  We are delighted by that success.</p> <p>Ireland and Slovenia work together in the United Nations and other international organisations to endorse and enhance international peace and security.  We respect international agreements, as the ambassador and I discussed earlier, and the rule of law and we promote multiculturalism and multilateralism.  Slovenia's support for Ireland during the Brexit negotiations and its ongoing support for Ireland as we work through the difficult issues around Brexit are greatly appreciated.  While we are many miles apart from each other geographically, that does not prevent us from having rich bilateral and cultural relations.  There are more than 1,200 Slovenians living in Ireland and many hundreds of Irish citizens have made Slovenia their home.  They share a love of literature and a passion for culture, including singing and dancing.  I welcome the ambassador to the Gallery this morning and wish all the Slovenians who are celebrating their national day a very happy 30th anniversary of the close relationship between our two countries.</p></speech>

It really is a beautiful country and I encourage Members to travel there if they get the opportunity.  I wish Slovenians a very happy national day.</p> <p>I raise the proposal by the British Government to introduce a new bill of rights.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->My concern is that, as the Leader will be aware, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British Government incorporated the European Convention of Human Rights into the domestic law of Northern Ireland through the Human Rights Act.  It would be of serious concern if this proposed new UK Bill of Rights that is being brought forward by Dominic Raab, would seek to in some cases ignore decisions of the European Court of Human Rights and in some ways may undermine the convention.  I ask, given that we hold the presidency of the Council of Europe, that this matter that would be treated as a priority.  I have serious concerns around some of the elements that we understand are being proposed in this new UK legislation.  I ask that the Leader would raise it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney.  </p><p>I also understand that the Department of Justice is about to engage in a consultative process around the use of facial recognition technology.  In this regard, it is my hope that we will have a national strategy on artificial intelligence, AI.  The strategy should be based on an ethical approach to the use of technology and particularly facial recognition technology.  I would like assurances.  We need to have a debate on the use of AI and facial recognition technology more widely.  I know that in the drawing up of the national AI strategy, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment engaged quite widely.  The approach has been human rights-based and ethically based.  It will be essential that any approach taken by the Department of Justice follows this method.  I would like us to have a debate on those issues.  </p><p>Finally, I want to raise an issue that the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, CTTC, will also raise again today.  We have raised this issue previously.  Approximately 300 scheduled bus services are operated by private operators.  They have not been able to avail of the very welcome 20% reduced fares initiative that public transport offer operators have been able to offer nor have they been able to offer the youth-adult travel card, because agreement has not yet been fully reached.  I ask that we work to ensure that customers of private and commercial coach operators are treated in exactly the same way as those who avail of the services of the public service operators.  </p></speech>

This has now been increased from &euro;4,500 to &euro;6,552 as a result of the decision by the Cabinet.  I raised this issue within our own Fine Gael Parliamentary Party several weeks ago.  Students and businesses on the ground in my own constituency of Waterford raised this issue with me.  It is a perfect example of the Government taking immediate action on a sensible proposal that came from the ground up, through our own parliamentary party.  The Cabinet implemented it yesterday.  It is good for students and for business.  It will mean that students will have more money in their pockets without that affecting their student grant.</p> <p>We need a wider discussion, and Senator Malcolm Byrne has suggested this previously, on the student contribution charge and on our grants structure.  From September, there will be an additional &euro;200 in the grants.  I personally would like to see a significant reduction in the student contribution charge.  This is because many families are just above the threshold to avail of that student grant.  They are being hard pressed as a result of the increases in the cost of living.  A reduction in the student contribution charge would assist all of those individuals and families.  That is what we as a Government need to look at.</p> <p>In terms of the coach and tourism sector, and I have not looked into this in any great detail, but I received a representation from a constituent of mine who attends college in Thurles.  She informed me that the Expressway services are not included in the reduction of the youth-adult fare.  That student leaves Waterford and goes to Limerick Junction.  She does not have a reduction in her fare until that point, when travelling on from Limerick Junction to Thurles, she can avail of the 50% fare reduction .  This is because the Expressway services are considered to be a private arm of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That needs to be addressed.  I would look for a wider discussion with the Minister for Transport in that regard.  </p></speech>

I have visited the country on many occasions.  I have attended a number of conferences for the European Liberal Democratic Reform, ELDR, party group in Ljubljana.  It is a truly beautiful city in a truly beautiful country.  I am delighted the ambassador is here.  He is most welcome.</p> <p>I welcome the Government's announcement yesterday of the ACRES scheme.  ACRES stands for the agricultural climate rural environmental scheme.  It is a nice name.  I presumed the Department decided on ACRES and tied the name into it.  It is good.  You can cite it quickly.  When I initially looked at it yesterday I was pleased.  It shows the Government's commitment to focus on climate as it relates to the agricultural and rural environment and how we can reward farmers.  We have said across the House, and we all recognise it, that farmers and their representative bodies are absolutely committed to playing their role in environmental protection.  They may need some financial assistance.  They will need additional skills and training and supports.</p> <p>This morning, a number of farm representative bodies issued statements saying they were grossly unhappy with the scheme.  It appears now that larger commercial farmers are excluded from it.  There may be a need for some work to be done on the communication of the scheme.  It was only announced yesterday.  To be fair to the Minister and to the Department, they are fiercely committed.  Yet, major farm organisations came out within a few hours to say that they feel left out and that there was a lack of consultation.  They made comparisons with other schemes.  This issue may just be around the communication of the scheme.  I want to feed that information to the Leader.  I know that Members of the Seanad who are involved in agriculture and who are on the agricultural committee will be aware of these statements.  I have no doubt that they will come up at various parliamentary party meetings. </p> <p>I also raise the issue of the general scheme for the remediation of dwellings that are damaged by defective concrete blocks.  This is a controversial area.  We have had no final decision on the pre-legislative scrutiny on this comprehensive legislation.  This may present some possible problems.  I do not want to go in too much detail on this, but I will say that we do not have plans for pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  There are some concerns, which I share.  </p> <p>I want to inform the House that there will be six hours of meetings tomorrow at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to deal with this issue.  The first meetings will be on the remediation of the dwellings.  They will be held between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. tomorrow.  They will deal with the MICA Action Group from Donegal, the Clare Pyrite Action Group and the Mayo Pyrite Action Group.  This will be followed by a meeting from 3.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., where chartered surveyors will be before committee, as will representatives from Engineers Ireland.  The chair of the expert working group will come in after that.  If that was not enough to keep us all going, from 6 pm. to 8 p.m. we will have officials from the Department before the committee.  These will be an extensive six hours of engagement.  It is important for people who represent those communities and for everyone in the country to be aware that this is happening tomorrow.  The politicians are always welcome in the committee, but people can go online and see these meetings.  It will be a lively and active interface.  It might become more obvious during these meetings that there is a real requirement for pre-legislative scrutiny, because this is a huge issue.  In fairness to the Government, it is taking on.  It is difficult to please everyone, but we have to get this legislation over the line.  We have to help people to rebuild their homes, to rebuild lives and to get on.  It is a terrible thing to be living in a house that is crumbling in front of you.</p></speech>

There are lessons we in Ireland could well and truly learn for our own cities and towns in this regard.<br/><br/>A shared island has to mean a shared Oireachtas.  I was dismayed when I read reports in the <i>Irish News</i>this morning that there looks set to be a vote at the Committee on Standing Orders and D&aacute;il Reform later this afternoon that would block MLAs and MPs from the North sitting on special Oireachtas committees.  I do not understand why these issues and this opposition to the proposal were raised at the very last minute.  No party on the committee expressed any concern or objection to the proposal during quite a prolonged period of discussion and engagement.  It is deeply unfortunate that Government parties look set to vote against the proposal this afternoon.  We see the strength of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement as a result of the addition of MPs from the North.  It is of great benefit to Irish life.  We must learn the lessons from the pandemic and Brexit that Ireland works best when we work together and work as one, when we are harmonised and pulling together and when we have joined-up approaches and joint aspirations.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement was established by a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, for very good reason.  He also gave the now long-standing promise to give MPs from the North speaking rights in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>In making this point I feel I am preaching to the choir.  The Leader would have a different approach to her colleagues if she were on the committee.  Let us look at what special committees do.  Autism is an issue that is very important to many of us in the House and we raise it regularly.  It is an issue that affects families throughout Ireland.  The all-Ireland autism centre is based in Armagh.  For special committees that do not vote on legislation, why would we not have elected representatives from the North and the rest of Ireland come to them to contribute?<br/><br/>If the Cathaoirleach votes against this proposal this afternoon, he will vote against the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and, most important of all, he will vote against Article 2 of the Constitution, which I often cite in the Chamber.  It states it is the birthright and entitlement of everyone born on the island of Ireland to be part of the Irish nation.  Let us give expression to this article in a most modest way this afternoon.  I encourage Government members of the committee not to vote against the proposal.  I encourage Government colleagues in the House to speak to the committee members.  We in the Seanad know the benefits of having all-Ireland representation.  For so long the Seanad has had it and it is a greater Oireachtas when it can be national, inclusive and representative.</p></speech>

A total of 50% received it under ground C, which is the 12-week limit, and 50% received it under ground D, which deals with terminations for medical reasons.  It is clear that the legislation is failing some people.  It is important in the review of the abortion legislation that we bear this in mind and we do not simply focus on narrow issues.  We should consider and take into account people who do not count in the Irish statistics.  These are the women who travel to the UK to access basic healthcare.</p> <p>I want to raise the issue of construction defects.  The group was meant to report on this last Friday.  I understand this deadline has been extended until July.  I understand there might be issues to be worked through but this will have an unintended consequence as the budget negotiations are ongoing.  Tens of thousands of people are living in apartments throughout this city and elsewhere with fire defects.  They are in danger.  Unlike mica, it is very difficult for people in this situation to speak out because it will have an effect on properties in urban areas.  It is important that provision is made in the budget and it is flagged with the Minister not to drag this on but to provide redress for these people.  They are not in the public mindset in the same way as other campaign groups.  This is for good reason.  They feel afraid and unable to speak out.  They are living in fire defective apartments through no fault of their own.  It is important that they get 100% redress and not the loans that have been suggested.  This should also be retrospective.  People need to be able to take action now to make their homes safe.  The longer this drags on, the more people will be afraid to take action because they will not be sure whether they will be able to get the money back.  It is important that the Minister makes provision in budget negotiations now to have redress for people suffering from construction defects in apartments throughout the country.</p></speech>

I follow some of the campaigns on ending direct provision as do many Members.  I raised this issue yesterday and the Deputy Leader said we will have a debate in the autumn.  A bowl of soup and cheese and ham sandwiches is the food that has been provided for a number of weeks in one direct provision centre.  This does not respect equality or the human rights of people.  Hotels in rural parts of Ireland are being sold for direct provision centres.  Hoteliers are making millions of euro off the backs of people's human rights and equality.  People are being treated as though they have done something wrong by fleeing for their lives and seeking asylum in our country.  I am against anyone buying these hotels.  It feeds into the problem and does not go towards ending the direct provision system, which is provided for in the programme for Government.  We are meant to be working on it.  Apart from the White Paper published more than a year ago, there has been very little.  I understand the effects of the coronavirus and the crisis in Europe with the war in Ukraine.  We have to think about these people and the food and services they receive.  They face human rights and equality issues every day.  It is not acceptable for the well-being of the children or adults involved that Ukrainian refugees are living in hotel bedrooms.</p> <p>An old man and woman in their 70s lived at No. 8 Labre Park for more than 50 years.  They were told that they would get great settled accommodation 1 km away.  In one way they were forced, although their arms were not twisted.  They moved out of Labre Park after 50 years.  Now that house is lying idle and the man and woman are trying to get back into that Traveller-specific accommodation.  No work has been done on it.  This man and woman want to return to it and give the other accommodation to a homeless family.  They are aged over 70 and they should be allowed back into the accommodation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would appreciate support from everybody in the House in the coming weeks as I try to support that family in trying to get back into the accommodation.</p></speech>

I congratulate Daire Feeley from Roscommon town.  He is an amateur rider who won the R&aacute;s Tailteann cycling race that ended on Sunday.  It is an amazing achievement for the lad.  I have not spoken to have him since he won, but he cannot believe what has happened.  No more than our boxers in recent times, we are proud of Daire&rsquo;s achievement and we wish him well for the future.</p> <p>The agri-climate rural environmental scheme, ACRES, was launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, yesterday on behalf of the Government.  We also had the fodder support scheme announced before that.  I urge all farmers to register online for both schemes.  Regarding ACRES, it is a &euro;1.5 billion scheme and it is going to be live over the four years from 2023 to 2027.  It will be worth &euro;300 million annually and it will benefit 50,000 farmers.  One of the most important points concerning this scheme, however, is that it has been funded from the EU and carbon tax.  Some &euro;740 million of the carbon tax, which, I admit, has been a bit controversial, is now being used to fund this scheme.  It is important to show the benefits of what can be done.  We have been unfortunate with the carbon tax because of what happened with the war in Ukraine.  It was difficult for people to accept it, but it is good to see that some of this money will now be used for this scheme.  This &euro;740 million is a significant chunk of the carbon tax money.  Some of the basic aspects of this scheme include that the maximum payment will be &euro;10,500 and the average payment will be &euro;7,000.  The scheme will not suit all farmers.  Dairy farmers are not happy.  It is, however, a good scheme, with many options.  I urge farmers to adapt to it and ensure they are registered for it and the fodder support scheme.</p></speech>

This issue has been raised already.  The 20% discount in fares has created inequality.  Senator Cummins mentioned the Expressway buses.  The private transport operators now find themselves in competition with public transport in some areas.  They are losing customers because of the cheaper fares available on public transport.  While competition is always healthy, it is not the coach tour operators that would benefit from cheaper fares but the people using the services.  The 20% fare discount should apply across the board for all transport users, whether they are using public transport operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann or the services of private coach operators.</p> <p>Many places in rural Ireland have services operated by the private coach owners.  It is not fair that people elsewhere should be able to avail of the 20% fare reduction.  In this House, we have been asking for the 20% fare reduction to be extended beyond the end of this year because it is encouraging people to use shared transport.  It also feeds into the Government&rsquo;s climate agenda in respect of people using transport and sharing services in this regard.  This should be done and I would like the support of the Leader in this regard.  I support the call made by Senator Cummins for a debate on the 20% fare reduction and public transport in general.</p> <p>I also welcome that Shannon and Knock airports were acknowledged by the World Health Organization, WHO, last week, at a ceremony attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, as being age-friendly airports.  I congratulate both airports on this achievement but especially Shannon Airport, which is in the mid-west region.  It is a very safe airport for older people to access.  There is great ease of access when entering and exiting the different terminals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-22a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1673" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062200002#N00400"><p>I heard what Senator Moynihan had to say about the latest British abortion statistics and the number of women giving Irish addresses.  What she did not mention, of course, is that the vast majority of abortions are now taking place in Ireland and that the figures for abortions taking place have vastly increased since abortion was legalised.  Thousands more innocent lives have been lost.  This is something we should think about.  There are children who would be alive today who are not because we legalised abortion in Ireland.</p> <p>The other aspect worth mentioning is that, as far as I am aware, of those British statistics concerning the couple of hundred Irish women giving Irish addresses, the biggest single reason in the context of disability was Down's syndrome.  This is something that proponents of abortion do not mention and it is something that should make us all think.</p> <p>The principal issue I raise with the Leader is the recent out-of-court settlement for &euro;70,000 which arose out of a child having had an accident in a playground.  It caused an injury, a scar, that Mr. Justice Simons said was just about noticeable.  Nobody begrudges anybody a settlement that they manage to get in the context of a personal injuries action.  The maximum award under the personal injuries guidelines agreed by the Judicial Council for an accident like this, however, is &euro;30,000.  When we think about this, that is &euro;40,000 less of Dublin ratepayers' money that is available for library services, housing, health, road repairs and all the other things the public and councils must fund.  It raises the question of liability and the consequences for schools if awards like this keep getting paid out.  Will playgrounds have to close?</p> <p>The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs heard a few years ago that one of the causes of childhood obesity may well be the new conservative approach being taken by schools towards play and playgrounds precisely because of the fear of litigation.  Some years ago, I placed the Civil Liability (Schools) Bill 2019 on the Order Paper.  It would have given added protection to schools and teachers, particularly in circumstances where school grounds were being adequately supervised, protecting them from large payouts.  I ask the Leader whether she agrees with me that in the light of the danger of excessive settlements, which ultimately cost the taxpayers, it is time to consider giving Government time to my Bill and to put it back on the Order Paper in order to afford some greater measure of protection to schools that are supervising play and playgrounds properly, protect them from excessive payouts and thereby facilitate play, which is a very important aspect of children&rsquo;s lives.</p></speech>

I would welcome if it would be possible for the Leader to arrange a debate on this subject.  It is widely accepted that older people live longer and happier lives when they are in their own homes and communities.  Home care packages are essential to facilitate this.  I understand that more than 5,000 people are waiting on a carer to call to their homes.  In my area of Cavan-Monaghan, 60 people are waiting on a carer and more than 300 people are waiting on additional hours.  Again, no carers are available to provide those hours.</p> <p>It must be acknowledged that the Government has increased the number of home care hours allocated and this is only right.  This year, for example, more than 23.5 million hours have been approved, an increase of 2 million hours on the previous year.  There is, however, a lack of carers, and this is a part of the problem.  This comes down to issues such as pay and conditions and these issues must be addressed.  I would welcome a debate on this matter.  Many people have argued that the solution to this problem is to allocate the moneys or hours provided for a carer to a family member, if one is available, to provide care.  In many cases, there are family members available.</p> <p>We need creative thinking on this vital issue.  As I said, older people live longer and more happily in their own homes.  Of course, at some point, they may have to go into long-term residential care, but until that happens, we must do everything we can to support older people in their own homes.  We need creative thinking in this regard.  I understand a working group is examining this issue.  I respectfully request that work be expedited.  I would also welcome if this House could have an input and Senators could give our thoughts on how we can address this important issue.</p></speech>

I will formally write to the Cathaoirleach on the matter today but I wish to propose on the Order of Business that we, as a House, set aside a sitting day or days to discuss disability issues.  We could take an approach similar to that of the Ceann Comhairle in bringing young people into the Lower House to discuss the very important and pressing matter of climate change.  The Seanad Public Consultation Committee did something similar a couple of years ago.  As a House, we should put together a series of meetings with organisations and people with disabilities across the whole spectrum so that we can have a strong debate to feed into a narrative to help the Ministers at the Departments of Health, Justice, Education and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to come up with a policy and policy implementations in respect of disability.</p><p>I know the House has no role in budgetary matters.  I accept that.  We in the Upper House have vocational panels and we are at our best when we speak about and represent people.  We saw that with the intervention of the Cathaoirleach in the context of Congressman Richie Neal coming here.  We saw it in the context of other matters dealt with by the Seanad Public Consultation Committee, which had to pause its work due to Covid.  In light of the contribution of Senator Clonan yesterday, the work being done by Ciar&aacute;n Delaney in Cork and elsewhere in Ireland and the contribution of the Ombudsman for Children this morning, I propose that the Seanad set aside time to hold hearings with organisations and people on disability matters.</p></speech>

It is because, ten years ago next year, a family in Duleek lost their daughter through cystic fibrosis.  Ann and Kevin Noone lost their daughter Kelley.  We come together every year for a run in Duleek in memory of Kelley and her cousin Cathy, who also lost her life to cystic fibrosis.  Both of them were teenagers.  This week, I have been contacted by four parents who told me that a new and potentially life-saving medicine for cystic fibrosis has been approved by the European Medicines Agency for use by parents of children between six and 11 years of age.  The treatment, Kaftrio, is an oral medicine designed to increase the quality and function of cystic fibrosis proteins at a cellular level, offering physicians a new treatment option for these young patients to help combat their condition as early as possible.  There have already been remarkable results for patients who have opted for this new therapy.  The manufacturing pharmaceutical company, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, has come to an agreement in respect of the supply of Kaftrio to Ireland for use by Irish children with cystic fibrosis, many of whom will be starting their course of treatment this summer.  However, some parents recently learned that their children have been excluded from access to this medicine.  Approximately 35 children with cystic fibrosis have been deemed ineligible.  Two of them live in my area.  Parents of the children have reached out to Vertex to avail of Kaftrio directly but, as it is outside the HSE scheme, such a supply would come at a steep premium.  I understand that Cystic Fibrosis Ireland has reached out to both Vertex and the HSE on the issue as a matter of urgency, but if we were to write to the Department of Health and the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, on the matter, we might be able to help these 35 children.  I would like the Leader to write to the Minister on this issue because he probably would not listen to me.  I will send this on to him but her word would probably be a lot stronger than mine.  This would be a huge benefit to these parents and children.  Children with cystic fibrosis, particularly young girls, are dying younger.  If we can save lives - this drug can do that - we should urge the Minister to allow those children to get this drug.</p></speech>

Drastic action is needed.  I have been appointed by the Government as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Autism.  We will start our public meetings next week.  We will meet with the National Council for Special Education, AsIAm and the Ministers of State, Deputies Madigan and Rabbitte, before the summer recess and we will bring recommendations for policy changes to the Government at the end of March next year.  I fully support the comments of my colleague Senator Buttimer.  To give an example in my local area, until recently we only had the equivalent of half a speech therapist covering the entire county.  I heard in the past 24 hours that the two occupational therapists there have now moved outside the area.  We have more than 240 kids waiting for assessments of need and more than 700 children waiting on services.  Things are at a drastic point within disability services.</p> <p>I call on the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to come to the House to discuss the allocation of home-school liaison officers.  In my home county, for example, there are six home-school liaison officers covering a large number of existing schools that are covered under DEIS, mainly in the town areas.  One of the schools has 534 pupils and one such position.  More than 60% of the population of the school is non-Irish, with 30 different nationalities.  Among all the schools in the county that are covered under DEIS, there is an absenteeism rate of between 18% and 20%.  The whole system in the county is at breaking point.  Several schools have been added in under the most recent allocation but the schools that were there previously are at breaking point.  Ballymahon Vocational School, which has 407 pupils, shares a home-school liaison officer with Roscommon Community College, which is located in another county.  The Minister needs to come to the House on this issue.  If we do not get the necessary intervention in education and get kids to school, we will pay in the long run.  I ask that the Minister be requested to come to the House to discuss this matter which is affecting schools across the country.  There is a particular issue in my county because there is a high percentage of non-Irish people living there, particularly in the county town, and that is leading to a very high absenteeism rate.  There are not enough home-school liaison officers to keep on top of it.</p></speech>

Many people will be travelling up from other parts of the country.  I refer to the important work being done by teams and people working within the Oireachtas.  A lovely Equali-TEA event was held this morning.</p> <p>I also wish to highlight LiveStock, a wonderful music festival that will be happening in Aughrim.  It is a fantastic festival that brings together bringing music, arts and crafts.  Independent musicians such as K&iacute;la will be appearing.  There will be trad music, alternative music and many craft workshops.  It is being run by Cormac Jennings, a local farmer, on his farm outside Aughrim, which is only a few miles from Ballinasloe.  It is taking place on 1 and 2 July.  I want to give it a word of support.  It is a chance for us all to get back to normal and enjoy outdoor festivals.  It is a family fun event and under-12s are welcome.  Many festivals are happening around the country but it is nice to see one happening in my local area.</p></speech>

Dennis was a very well-known guitarist who was probably best known for his partnership with Martin Hayes and The Gloaming.  I pay tribute to him and his work in popularising traditional music across the generations, but particularly my generation, in recent years.  I had the pleasure of seeing Dennis perform many times and his style was unique.  He was born to Irish parents in Chicago.  This is a sad week for traditional music.  May he rest in peace.</p></speech>

Now more than ever, given the impact of Covid, artists and creative people need the support they have heard us talk about for the last couple of years.

The Equali-TEA event in Leinster House this morning was our attempt to support Pride.  During this month, we must be mindful and recognise that there are people among us who do not enjoy the dignity of treatment that we all expect to get.  It is important for us all to be advocates for our friends, neighbours and family members.  We must ensure every month, not just during Pride month in June, that we act as allies for the LGBTQI+ community.  We will work and march in Pride - and with pride - this weekend to support our family members, friends and neighbours.</p> <p>Senator Carrigy asked me to contact the Minister for Education about the allocation of resources for schools, particularly DEIS schools, and raised the inconsistency in this regard around the country.  I will do that today and get back to the Senator.  The Minister was here this morning.  I will reflect on the Senator's request and contact the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Carrigy also supported the call made by Senator Buttimer that we set aside a Seanad sitting to discuss disability matters.  The Joint Committee on Disability Matters meets every Thursday morning but a Seanad sitting would shine a very large light on disability matters.  We could bring in representatives of all the focus and advocacy groups working in this area to talk about the many challenges.  Not least among these is the Government's disability capacity review published last year, which tells us in no uncertain terms exactly what is needed in the system as regards inputs between now and 2032.  We certainly do not come close to what is required.  As such, a debate in the House would be welcome.  I will ask for a special sitting, perhaps via the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.  We can have a conversation on what is the best way to proceed and invite all Senators to let us know who we should ask to attend.</p> <p>Senator Keogan asked me to write a letter to the Minister for Health and I will do that today.  I ask her for information on the reasons 35 children have been excluded from the scheme for the Kaftrio drug.  This welcome scheme gives enormous hope to hundreds of people, particularly young people aged under 18, who are suffering from cystic fibrosis.  They need to have hope and be able to aspire to a normal quality of life.  If the Senator provides that information, I will write to the Minister.  Hopefully, with the support of all Senators, we can get all of the children included in the Kaftrio scheme.</p> <p>Senator Gallagher asked for a debate on the home care sector.  It is a bizarre situation in which we find ourselves.  For the ten years I have been a Member of these Houses, we have sought more hours because there is always a need for more hours.  As the Senator described, we know that keeping people in their own homes allows them to live longer, healthier and happier lives.  This year, we probably have more hours than are required in the system but we do not have the people to provide all those hours.  That is better than the problem of having no money to fund the hours.  We certainly need to talk about staff pay and conditions and ensure we resolve the problem as soon as we possibly can.</p> <p>Senator Mullen asked me to find time to reintroduce his Bill and I can certainly do that.  As Members know, we have been using Thursday afternoons when there is no Government legislation to advance Private Members' legislation in the House.  That approach is working successfully.  Perhaps the Senator could restore his Bill to the Order Paper and I will happily facilitate it as soon as I can.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne very much welcomed the announcement that Shannon Airport and Ireland West Airport Knock were the first airports to be awarded age-friendly status by the WHO this week.  That is a very welcome announcement.</p> <p>Senators Marie Byrne, Malcolm Byrne and Cummins spoke of the need for equality for consumers.  At the end of the day, consumers rather than the question of who provides the transport are what are important.  We have an inequality with regard to coach tourism and Expressway services as they cannot avail of the extra 20% discount in fares announced by the Minister for Transport a number of months ago.  That also applies to the adult student card that has been introduced.  I do not believe a private versus public scenario was ever envisaged but the matter needs to be sorted out now.</p> <p>To respond to Senator Maria Byrne, last Wednesday night during the debate on a cost-of-living motion, I asked for the 20% reduction in transport fares to be made permanent.  I am pleased to hear, and I know these are only whispers but they are obviously whispers with a purpose, that the 20% discount will be extended for at least another year.  That is very welcome.</p> <p>Senator Murphy congratulated the R&aacute;s winner, Daire Feeley, who is from Roscommon.  There must be something in the water in Roscommon as the county has enjoyed so much success lately.  I, too, congratulate Daire.  His exploits in cycling are a real feat.  It was wonderful to see pictures of him and his family smiling yesterday.</p> <p>Senator Murphy welcomed the ACRE scheme announced by the Minister for Agriculture, his two Ministers of State and the Taoiseach yesterday.  An allocation of &euro;1.5 billion over five years has been provided for the new scheme.  Senator Boyhan referred to communication problems and I think they can be sorted out.  It is a worthwhile scheme.  Senator Murphy was right to encourage people to sign up to both the new scheme and the fodder scheme, for which I thank him.</p> <p>Senator Flynn asked me for a debate and yesterday, in my absence, she asked the Deputy Leader, Senator Chambers, for a debate.  It is likely that I will not be able to arrange a debate before the end of July but I will get her an update.  I will talk to the Minister's people today to find out exactly what the position is and update the Senator.</p> <p>Senator Flynn also asked for support for two pensioners who want to get back into the home in which they lived for 50 years.  I do not know all of the details but I will do whatever I can later today to help the Senator.</p> <p>Senator Moynihan spoke about the 206 Irish women who had to travel to the United Kingdom outside of the democratic decision Irish people made a number of years ago to introduce medical terminations in this country.  The review of the legislation will allow us all to have a proper debate and suggest changes.  Whether people are pro or anti the legislation and the way it has worked in the last number of years, everyone is entitled to a view.  That review must be completed sooner rather than later because some people still find themselves in traumatic situations.  We fought so hard for this and encouraged the Irish people to be as compassionate as they were.  This matter needs to be reflected upon.</p> <p>Senator Moynihan also mentioned something that is extremely practical.  The construction defects group will probably not have its report ready by the time we deliberate on the 2023 budget in September or October.  It makes sense, therefore, to make financial provision, as the Senator suggested.  I will pass on her suggestion to the Minister and get back to her.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile raised an issue that is news to me.  I am not a member of the committee in question and had not heard about the matter.  The Senator is right, and I am a little baffled.  I have tried to make inquiries since he raised the issue but I have not received a response.  I will follow up the matter.</p></speech>

If we wish to have some input, we must act quickly.  It will be the first thing I do when I leave this Chamber.  We are an island and we have the all-Ireland shared island unit, which was established with gusto by the Taoiseach.  It makes no sense for these Houses to exclude anybody's opinion, particularly when the issues for which a select or special committee has been established are not parochial but national and all-Ireland in nature.  It seems very regressive to do that.  I will follow up on the matter and get back to the Senator.</p></speech>

He acknowledged that there is no pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.

It is important but I do not think it is controversial, which may explain why there is not a strong Opposition presence here.  I am pleased to present this Bill to the House. While technical, it is important legislation.  The principal purpose of this Bill is to provide for members of the Military Police to take and use DNA samples and other evidence for the purposes of its investigations, including outside the jurisdiction when Defence Forces personnel are deployed overseas.</p> <p>The Military Police, a service corps within the Defence Forces headed by the Provost Marshal, conducts criminal investigations concerning persons subject to military law.  The investigative capabilities of the Military Police are currently compromised by the lack of a comprehensive statutory basis for the taking of evidentiary samples.  This Bill will remedy this situation and enhance the capability of the Military Police to carry out its investigations of serious offences.</p> <p>The Bill provides that DNA samples may be taken when a person subject to military law is placed in service custody by the Military Police in connection with a relevant offence.  The Bill also provides for the establishment of a DNA (Military Police) database system, to be administered by Forensic Science Ireland, to hold DNA profiles generated from DNA samples taken under this legislation. </p> <p>The Bill closely mirrors the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, which provides for the taking of DNA samples by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the establishment of a DNA database system with a view to assisting An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of serious crime.  Some necessary adaptations were required to take account of the military environment.  However, the safeguards provided for in the 2014 Act regarding the taking of samples from persons have been incorporated in this Bill.  In other words, we are simply giving Military Police the same powers that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already has and uses.</p> <p>The Bill also sets out the other powers of the Military Police when a member of the Defence Forces is placed in service custody. These powers, including the power to search and take fingerprints, are similar to the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to a person who is arrested and detained.</p> <p>A feature of the Bill is that DNA profiles generated from samples obtained under this Bill may be compared with DNA profiles held on the DNA database established under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014.  The comparison will be carried out by Forensic Science Ireland.</p> <p>I now come to the detailed provisions of the Bill, which is divided into 12 Parts.  Part 1 includes standard provisions relating to the Short Title and definitions and clarifies the application of the Bill to a person subject to military law, including when any such person is for the time being outside the State or on board a ship or aircraft.</p> <p>Part 2 deals with the taking of samples from persons in the custody of the Military Police for entry onto the DNA (Military Police) database system, as well as the taking of intimate and non-intimate samples.  Any samples taken under this Part may only be taken in connection with the investigation of what is called a "relevant offence".  For the purposes of this Bill, this means an offence for which a person subject to military law may be punished by imprisonment for a term of five years or more, for example, serious assault or murder.  In other words, this is only being used in serious cases.  The results of the forensic testing of a sample taken under this Part, and any DNA profile generated from any such sample, may be used in court martial proceedings.  Provision is made for the retaking of samples in certain circumstances, such as where the original sample proves to be insufficient or is inadequately labelled.</p> <p>Section 12 specifies the persons who are authorised to take intimate samples.  Due to the nature of an intimate sample, the consent of the person in service custody must be obtained before any such sample is taken.  Section 13 deals with the inferences a court martial may draw from a refusal to consent, or a withdrawal of consent, to the taking of an intimate sample.</p> <p>Section 15 allows for the use of reasonable force in the taking of a non-intimate sample.  In other words, we are asking people to co-operate with a process, and if they do not, then a judge will draw a conclusion for that.  However, the use of this power is subject to a number of safeguards as specified in this section.  Specifically, the use of reasonable force must be authorised by a member of the Military Police not below the rank of commandant.  In addition, the taking of a sample pursuant to this section must be recorded by electronic or similar means.  The provisions of this Part are similar to the equivalent provisions in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014, that is, they are the same standards the Garda applies.</p> <p>Part 3 deals with the taking of samples from Defence Forces personnel and other persons to ascertain whether such persons have contaminated a crime scene sample. </p> <p>Part 4 provides that the Military Police may request a person, referred to in the Bill as a "volunteer", to have a DNA sample taken from him or her for the purpose of generating a DNA profile in relation to the investigation of a particular offence against military law.  A volunteer may include a person who is a victim, or reasonably considered to be a victim, of the alleged offence which is being investigated by the Military Police.  The taking of a sample under this Part is subject to a number of safeguards, including a requirement to obtain the written consent of the volunteer.  Where a person subject to military law refuses to give consent to the taking of a sample under this Part, then that refusal shall not of itself constitute reasonable cause for a member of the Military Police to suspect that person of committing the offence concerned for the purpose of arresting and placing that person in service custody.</p> <p>Part 5 provides for the establishment by the director of Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, of a DNA (Military Police) database system.  The system, which will be similar to the DNA database system established under the Act of 2014, will be used to contain DNA profiles generated from DNA samples taken under this Bill.  The Part details the structure of the DNA (Military Police) database system, such as the various indexes which will be contained within the system.</p> <p>Section 30 sets out in detail the functions of the director of FSI arising under this Part.  Section 32 outlines the various comparisons that may be carried out by the director of FSI using DNA profiles entered onto the DNA (Military Police) database system, including comparisons with DNA profiles entered on the DNA database system established under the Act of 2014.</p> <p>Part 6 outlines the powers of the Military Police in relation to the collection of evidence, other than evidence collected under Part 2 of this Bill for the purposes of DNA testing, from a person arrested by the Military Police and placed in service custody.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Part 6 also has detailed provisions for the destruction, after specific time periods, of evidence obtained under section 34 and provides for the analysis of fingerprints taken from persons in service custody.</p><p>Part 7 deals with the destruction, after specific time periods, of samples taken for the purposes of the Military Police DNA database system and the removal from that database system of DNA profiles generated from such samples.  It also provides for the extension, in certain circumstances for the specific periods, of the retention period for such samples and associated DNA profiles. </p><p>Part 8 sets out the offences arising under this Bill and the penalties that may be imposed for such offences. </p><p>Part 9 provides that the Minister for Defence shall, not later than six years after commencement of this Bill, review the operation of certain aspects of Parts 6 and 7 of the Bill and thereafter conduct similar reviews at such times as the Minister considers appropriate.  Following any review, the Minister may, by ministerial order, reduce the period for the retention of evidence obtained under these Parts.  In other words, there are reviews built into this legislation.</p><p>Part 10 provides that the provost marshal shall, following consultation with Forensic Science Ireland, prepare a code of practice to provide practical guidance to members of the Military Police in relation to the taking of samples for DNA testing under this Bill.  This code of practice will help to ensure consistency in approach between this legislation and the 2014 Act.  This Part also includes miscellaneous provisions, such as the delegation by the provost marshal of the functions assigned to him or her under this Bill to members of the Military Police, the making of regulations for the taking of samples and procedures, and for the transmission of samples for forensic testing. </p><p>Part 11 sets out minor amendments to the Act of 2014 which are required on foot of this Bill.  The amendments have two principle purposes.  First, the functions of the DNA database system oversight committee established under Part 9 of the Act of 2014 will be extended to cover the Military Police DNA database system.  Second, amendments are being made to Part 12 of the Act of 2014 which implements, among other matters, the DNA and fingerprint data aspects of European Council Decision 2008/615/JHA, known as the Pr&uuml;m decision, into Irish law.  The Pr&uuml;m decision contains provisions concerned with the stepping up of cross-border co-operation, particularly in combating terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal migration.  These amendments to the Act of 2014 apply the provisions contained in that Act regarding the reciprocal searching of DNA databases and automated fingerprint identification systems maintained by states for criminal investigation purposes to any DNA or fingerprint data obtained by the Military Police in the course of their investigations.  This is, in other words, sensible data sharing.  </p><p>Part 12 sets out technical amendments to the Defence Act 1954 and the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1983.  The primary purpose of these amendments is to provide that a summary court-martial may deal with applications concerning various matters arising under this Bill. </p><p>In conclusion, I am pleased to submit this technical but important legislation for the consideration of the House.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p><p>In short, this is just about applying the standards that the Garda currently uses to the Military Police to ensure that they can efficiently conduct investigations that, of course, respect people's privacy, but at the same time use DNA and a DNA database to good effect.  It makes a lot of sense.  For what it is worth, we did not have any amendments in the D&aacute;il on this issue.  There was, in general, cross-party support for what we are doing.</p></speech>

My colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, who is the spokesperson on foreign affairs and defence could not be here, so I am covering for him.  As the Minister said, this is a technical Bill but, essentially, it is quite simple as well.  All we are trying to do is have the military and the Defence Forces be in line with what An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing with its colleagues across EU member states.</p> <p>When the Bill went through the D&aacute;il, as the Minister said, it received backing from all sides.  I think that will be quite similar here today.  I welcome the Bill.  It gives the Military Police the power to take DNA and other evidence for investigations to increase the capabilities of the Military Police that are compromised by the lack of structure to take evidence at the moment.  This Bill will bring the Military Police in line with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It also applies to where a member of the Defence Forces is placed in service custody, quite similar again to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In addition, it includes the sharing of information, DNA and fingerprints between EU member states.  As the Minister said, this is only used in serious cases.  It will enhance the structure between all the EU member states in fighting serious crime.  As has been said by many in the Lower House, this will be agreed by all sides and improve our capabilities to manage serious criminal activities.  On Fine Gael&rsquo;s behalf, I welcome this Bill.  We thank the Minister for the work he and his officials have put into this legislation.</p></speech>

He is a very busy man.  I just saw on the television this morning that he was in Brussels a few hours ago.  I join with the Cathaoirleach and Senator Ahearn in welcoming Senator Maria Byrne and her guests.  Senator Byrne is very well known for her hospitality.  I know her guests will be very well looked after on their visit to Leinster House.  I hope they have an enjoyable day.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive contribution on this legislation.  The principle purpose of the Bill, as he outlined, is to provide for members of the Military Policy to take and use DNA samples and other evidence for the purposes of their investigations, including outside the jurisdiction when Defence Forces personnel are deployed overseas. </p> <p>While technical, this is important legislation.  It is required to ensure there is a comprehensive statutory basis for the collection of forensic evidence by the Military Police to assist them in their investigations.  This includes investigations that may be required to be carried out in other jurisdictions where members of the Defence Forces are deployed overseas.  </p> <p>The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 does not, as the Minister outlined, provide for the activities of the Military Police.  Some adaptations were required to take account of the military environment.  The investigative capability of the Military Police is currently compromised by the lack of a comprehensive statutory basis for taking evidentiary samples.  This Bill will remedy this situation and enhance the capability of the Military Police to carry out its investigations of serious offences, similar to the power currently available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this regard, the Bill also sets out, as the Minister outlined, the other powers of a member of the Military Police when a member of the Defence Forces is placed in custody.  These powers, including the power to search and take fingerprints, are similar to the powers of a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to a person who is arrested and detained.  </p> <p>The Military Police are responsible for the prevention and investigation of offences, the enforcement of discipline and the general policing of the Defence Forces.  They also enjoy a very close working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other statutory agencies at national and local levels.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assists in providing specialist police training to the Military Police in the field of crime investigation.  </p> <p>This Bill was first introduced at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in October 2019, but unfortunately it lapsed with the fall of that Government.  I am glad that it has been re-introduced and passed through the D&aacute;il.  I wish it a speedy passage through this House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-22a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1667" speakername="Vincent P Martin" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062200002#T00600"><p>There is currently no external oversight of policing services within the Defence Forces, and no independent complaints process exists for the investigation of alleged Military Police misconduct or negligence.  In addition, regular independent review and assessment of the quality of policing services is not undertaken.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Vincent P. Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=VincentPMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This lack of structured oversight is in contrast to the numerous oversight and complaints mechanisms for other policing and investigative bodies in the State.  This is an unsatisfactory position.  The Minister said that the principal purpose of the Bill is to provide for members of the Military Police to take and use DNA samples and other evidence for the purposes of their investigations.  It will provide for the establishment of a Military Police DNA database system to be administered by Forensic Science Ireland to hold DNA profiles generated from DNA samples taken from persons under this Act.  It is the opinion of the commission that robust and independent oversight and periodic review would greatly enhance the military policing service, benefiting the victims of crime, safeguarding the rights of suspects and increasing trust in the wider system of military discipline and justice.  This Bill significantly enhances the powers of the Military Police and brings them in line with the powers of the Garda in respect of DNA collection and fingerprinting of suspects.  It should also be borne in mind that the Garda is operationally independent when carrying out investigations.  The Military Police, however, remains part of the military chain of command and cannot be considered truly independent.  The commission on the Defence Forces recommended that the Military Police become independent of the operational chain of command and that robust and independent oversight and complaints mechanisms be introduced.</p><p>I understand a couple of Government amendments were passed on Committee Stage limiting the purposes for which the DNA database can be used and to introduce a code of practice for the taking of DNA samples.  I welcome this technical Bill to the Seanad.  We all want crimes to be investigated properly and for those who have committed crimes to be brought to justice.  This Bill will help to ensure the Military Police is able to do that.</p><p>As always, there needs to be a balance between the effective investigation of crimes and respecting rights to data protection and privacy of those whose DNA is taken.  In respect of the threshold of the crime, according to the Bill, samples are only taken for offences for which a person subject to military law may be punished by imprisonment for a period of five years or more, for example, serious assault or murder.  The Minister moved that the Bill be read a Second Time and unreservedly commended it to the House.  If it is so good and since it is so non-controversial, why is there a cut-off point that it cannot deal with less serious offences as well?  There might be crimes that are serious in the eyes of a person but that fall short of that specified term of imprisonment of five years or more.</p><p>I have a question about one of the amendments made on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il in respect of the code of practice. One of the issues we have run into in some legislation is that codes of practice are non-statutory and have less importance than statutory codes of practices.  Will the Minister confirm this a statutory code of practice?  I acknowledge the code of practice would have to be approved by the Minister.  It may be useful if the code of practice were to be sent to the committee for comment before the Minister was to grant approval or refusal.  The main body for consultation on that code of practice is Forensic Science Ireland.  Would the Minister be open to including the committee as a named body to be consulted under this legislation?</p><p>I thank the Minister for making himself available.  I just learned a few minutes ago from Senator Wilson that he was in a different country this morning.  His dedication to coming into the Seanad is second to none.  We appreciate the presence of the senior Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Bill is technical and non-controversial.  I am pleased the Green Party is happy to support it.  My observations were not meant as criticisms.  They are just enquiries and the Minister might revert to me at a time of his convenience through his Department.</p></speech>

He will know from being at the Council of Europe that I am a few Senators down this week.  It is one of those days of running from one thing to the other.  We welcome the Bill.  In effect, it is the adoption of a code of practice with respect to the use of forensic evidence in the gathering of evidence in circumstances where military personnel are suspected of certain offences under military law.  It is also to provide for the establishment and operation by Forensic Science Ireland of the Department of Justice of a DNA (Military Police) database system.  It is an important development in the ongoing process of modernising the Defence Forces, the means it employs to gather evidence and the rules which govern this.  It is important the Minister is able to give an undertaking, because of the difficulties with recruitment and retention within the Defence Forces, that there will be sufficient resources available within the Military Police to ensure the detail contained in the roll-out of this Bill can be put into effect practically on the ground.</p> <p>My colleague, Deputy John Brady, supported this Bill on Committee Stage but he also raised concerns that there is no set period to cover arrests and detention periods within the Defence Forces.  This is an area of concern that requires attention in the time ahead.  There are currently no stipulations regarding the extension of arrest periods, or who has the authority to extend these periods.  There is a need for further amendments to the Defence Act to bring this up to the standard of other areas of military law.  While we are debating the Bill, will the Minister update us on the commission on the future of the Defence Forces and when he thinks he will be able to take it before this House?</p></speech>

This legislation is technical.  It is effectively ensuring investigations undertaken by the Military Police can be as comprehensive, using DNA samples in the way the Garda uses DNA samples in other criminal cases.  It would be extraordinary if there were investigations taking place under military law that could lead to a court martial that could not use modern forms of evidence gathering and so on.  Of course, there are limitations to that.  Certainly, the taking of intimate samples is only justifiable in cases of serious breaches of the law.  There is a voluntary nature as well in respect of willingness to give a sample in certain circumstances, as is deemed appropriate.</p> <p>Senators referred to other issues in respect of Military Police investigations around oversight, appeals mechanisms and so on, some of which were dealt with the commission report.  Those issues do not require legislation at this point.  This is about providing a legal basis for the taking of DNA samples, which at the moment we do not have.  That is why it is a specific technical piece that mirrors what the Garda can do and updates the various Acts that need to be updated in that regard.</p> <p>On the commission report, we are in the middle of discussions with other key Departments on ensuring we can bring a series of recommendations to Government that can be agreed.  That is not an easy process, as those Senators who have been in government before will know.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are proposing a significant increase in expenditure for the Defence Forces, which is absolutely justified and necessary.  We have the evidence base now to make informed, sensible decisions on the resourcing of our Defence Forces into the future.  We also have the extraordinary and tragic context of a war on the Continent of Europe, which unfortunately is seeing somewhere between 200 and 400 people dying every day.  Every country in the European Union is reviewing defence and security issues and we should be no different.  The fact that we are militarily neutral and non-aligned does not protect us from some of these threats, including cyberattacks, and we know that.  We are going to respond in a comprehensive way but consultation with other Departments is needed.  That is happening and has been happening for a number of weeks now.  I thank my colleagues for their co-operation because this is not easy stuff in terms of trying to accommodate a significant financial request, given the pressures on Government around the cost of living, healthcare, housing, disability services, education and so many other areas.  </p><p>In response to Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's question, I hope to have it done before the recess.  I gave a commitment that I would try to bring a memo for agreement to Government in the month of June and I would like to follow through on that if it is possible.  Whether it happens next week or the week after is not really the issue.  The main issue here is to get it right and to get a clear commitment so that we can set a course for the Defence Forces of reform, modernisation, recruitment, effective retention, growth, expansion and increased numbers.  Of course, increased resources will be needed for all of that and we cannot do this overnight.  We cannot do it in one, two or even three years.  This is about setting a course for quite some time into the future, hopefully with some certainty around the availability of resources so that we can map out the four- to six-year plans that are needed in terms of upgrading equipment in the Defence Forces within the rules and the law and so on.  This simply cannot be done overnight.  </p><p>As Minister for Defence, I do not want to create expectations but we are very close to the most strategic defence memo that I can remember coming to Government, in terms of its scope, scale and commitment.  I hope we will get agreement on that shortly so that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces can work together to bring about the modernisation and reform that is badly needed.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, the two amendments are similar in nature.  They are very similar to what was moved by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, in the D&aacute;il.  The purposes of the amendments are broadly similar.  They recognise the new powers that will be conferred on the commission on passing the legislation.  This will mean the workload will increase.  The concern is that unless money is provided to reflect the increased workload important work will not be done, to the point that it would affect the organisation's ability to carry out necessary functions.  We have tabled the amendments because we need to have a belt, braces and baler twine approach to ensure the commission has all of the resources it needs.  New powers are welcome but they are effectively useless without the capacity of the organisation to back it up.  The two amendments are broadly similar and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on both in his contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-22a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022062200002#CC00700"><p>I will address the two amendments together as there is considerable overlap between them.  They were proposed by Deputy O'Reilly during the Bill's passage through the D&aacute;il.  I gave them considerable consideration at that time.  I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy O'Reilly and the Senators who have proposed these amendments that it is important that any regulatory body be adequately resourced to coincide with any necessary legislative provisions that give it additional powers.  The Department and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, recognise that significant adequate additional resources will be required to implement this new legislation.  In the past two budgets alone, the CCPC has received an increase of more than 30%.  At present it has 146 staff and it intends to increase this to more than 200 by the end of this year.</p> <p>If the commission's assessment is that additional funding is required based on the structures included in the Bill, it can submit an increased Estimate bid as part of the budget 2023 negotiations.  Such a bid is subject to agreement by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  If approved, it would be incorporated into the overall departmental Estimates package that will be subject to negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for budget 2023.  The Senator's amendment would set an unusual departure from this process whereby past spending would have to be accounted for rather than projected spending.  If the budgets in 2017 and 2018 had been based on the past performance the CCPC would not have received the additional 30% for 2021 and 2022.  In fact, those budgets were based on future projections.  The Government is obliged under EU law to ensure its competition authorities are sufficiently resourced.</p> <p>When Deputy O'Reilly tabled these amendments in the D&aacute;il, I looked further into the matter, particularly on what options would be available to the CCPC if it were to find itself under-resourced at a future date and unable to carry out its functions.  I consulted with the commission and I have been advised that if such an event were to occur it has the ability to contact the European Commission's DG Competition directly.  The CCPC has direct contact with the Commission's officials in the appropriate unit.  This would be likely to be the first point of contact if it were to have concerns about future funding.  This means the CCPC has recourse if a future government were not to adequately resource the commission or, as Deputy O'Reilly said on Report Stage, if a future government decided to slash it.</p> <p>While I appreciate the concerns underpinning the amount and the importance of ensuring that the CCPC is able to effectively carry out its functions, I believe we have safeguards in place.  What is more, I believe we have demonstrated this in the past two years.  Even in advance of the legislation being enacted, in preparation for the new powers coming on board we have allocated an additional 30%.  We are supporting the CCPC to increase its headcount from 146 to in excess of 200 later this year.  I cannot support the amendments.</p></speech>

I too would like to acknowledge Councillor Dolan in the Gallery.</p> <p>At its heart, this Bill is about the need for fair and open competition for our businesses, economy and society.  We know the vast majority of businesses do not engage in uncompetitive practices, but there are some which do.  These practices drive out competition, drive up costs for ordinary citizens and undermine the dynamic nature of our economy.  That is why I prioritised this Bill as soon as I took office and was determined to bring it before the Oireachtas.  I sincerely thank the Senators for their overall support for the Bill to date and the time they have taken to engage in-depth with legislation that, by necessity, is long and legally complex.</p> <p>While enacting the Competition (Amendment) Bill involves meeting our obligations as a member of the European Union, it is about much more than just that.  It is about ensuring that Ireland's citizens are protected.  This Government is committed to taking a tough stance on white-collar crime and ensuring our regulatory bodies have effective powers and are effectively resourced.</p> <p>As I said, most businesses operate in a fair and honourable manner.  We have an obligation to those businesses to deal effectively and efficiently with anti-competitive practices in order that law-abiding businesses can thrive.  Competition benefits all consumers and drives innovation and efficiencies.  These efficiencies can be passed onto consumers in the context of competitive pricing.</p> <p>I thank Senators again for their positive reception of the Bill.  It is important that our businesses have certainty and consumers can reap the benefits of a dynamic and competitive economy.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity today to update the House on this matter.</p> <p>Climate change is one of the key challenges of this century and failure to address it effectively will result in major adverse impacts that will affect all countries.  The latest climate science has observed unprecedented changes in the climate system.  The challenges we face are stark.  Only recently, the World Meteorological Organization published a report showing that four key climate indicators - greenhouse gas concentration, sea level rises, ocean heat and ocean acidification - all broke records in 2021.  This is another clear sign we are observing planetary scale changes, caused by human activities, that are harming our land, seas and atmosphere.</p> <p>I am pleased to present this annual transition statement as provided for under section 14(1) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  This is the fifth annual transition statement, and it is being presented to both Houses in line with the requirements of the 2015 Act.  The statement includes an overview of Ireland's climate change mitigation and adaptation policy measures, including specific updates for the various sectors designated in the 2015 Act.  The 2020 Annual Transition Statement also sets out a record of greenhouse gas emissions from the most recent inventory prepared by the Environmental Protection Agency and projections of future emissions, together with a report on the State's compliance with its obligations under EU law and international agreements.</p> <p>While the 2020 Annual Transition Statement must predominately contain information in respect of 2019, it also records more recent policy developments in relation to climate mitigation and adaptation.  This strengthened climate governance framework provided for under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 means annual transition statements are now replaced by climate action plans and long-term climate strategies, supported by a system of carbon budgeting and sectoral targets with appropriate oversight by Government, the Oireachtas and the Climate Change Advisory Council.  Therefore, this will be the final annual transition statement.</p> <p>To give a brief overview of the various development and policy measures adopted to mitigate and reduce emissions, I will highlight some of the key items included within the 2020 Annual Transition Statement.  The above mentioned 2021 climate Act was signed into law in July 2021, setting Ireland on a legally binding path to net zero emissions not later than 2050, and to a 51% reduction in emissions, relative to 2018 levels, by the end of this decade.  To deliver on the ambition set out in the Act, the Government published the Climate Action Plan 2021 last November.  The plan includes policies and measures in every sector to bring about the significant changes needed to transform our society and to meet our climate ambition for 2030 and beyond.</p> <p>The 2021 climate Act establishes a system of carbon budgeting as a key element of a strengthened legislative framework.  In April, after an extensive consultation process, a programme of carbon budgets was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas and thus came into effect.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently preparing the sectoral emissions ceilings for Government approval in the coming weeks.  This process has included extensive engagement with all relevant Departments and agencies.</p> <p>Carbon pricing is a key pillar of Ireland's overall decarbonisation strategy.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 reiterates the Government's commitment to carbon pricing playing a key role in supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.  The 2020 Finance Act sets a statutory trajectory for carbon prices in Ireland, with these set to rase an additional &euro;9.5 billion in revenue by 2030.  This revenue is being allocated to programmes that support sustainability and those most vulnerable to rising costs.  This includes &euro;5 billion for energy efficient retrofits, &euro;3 billion to address fuel poverty and a just transition, as well as &euro;1.5 billion to promote sustainable agriculture practices.</p> <p>In terms of the electricity generation sector, the 2020 Annual Transition Statement highlights progress made while also noting our increasing ambition, with a target of 80% of our energy to come from renewable sources by 2030.  This fundamental shift will require major changes to the electricity generation mix, transmission and distribution grids alongside significant changes to our national demand profiles and storage capacity.  The statement identifies measures adopted and progress made across a number of areas including via the renewable electricity support scheme, the enactment of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021, ongoing work to develop a new offshore renewable energy development plan, and efforts to support microgeneration and small-scale solar.  The 2020 statement also highlighted ongoing work to enhance our electricity interconnection and upgrade our electricity grid, with &euro;4 billion allocated for capital investment over the period 2021 to 2025.</p> <p>With regard to the enterprise sector, the statement notes that approximately 68% of enterprise emissions are accounted for under the EU's emissions trading system, ETS.  Reforms to the ETS, such as those proposed in the 2019 European Green Deal, seek to ensure the ETS can effectively deliver reductions in emissions while addressing the challenges faced by sectors most exposed to international competition.  The statement lists progress made in the sector through a number of the measures to meet our 2030 targets.  These measures have included the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment engaging with representatives of the cement sector to identify opportunities for further introduction of alternative fuel sources, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland introducing strategies that focus on decarbonisation and sustainability, the launch of the ClimateToolKit4Business website, the extension of the accelerated capital allowance scheme for energy efficient equipment, and the introduction of the disruptive technologies innovation fund and the climate enterprise action fund.  Furthermore, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, continues to support the adoption of renewable heating systems by commercial and industrial heat users not covered by the ETS through the support scheme for renewable heat.</p> <p>In our built environment, the statement provides updates on progress made to decarbonise our commercial buildings with a range of supports and funding.  In addition, support was provided to our SMEs through the excellence in energy efficient design, EXEED, programme to provide energy savings and emissions reductions.  Our public sector is looking to lead by example in increasing the energy efficiency of its activities and buildings with the public sector energy efficiency programme, led by the SEAI, providing comprehensive support and engagement to guide public bodies to achieve their energy efficiency targets.  The annual statement also notes how the Climate Action Plan 2021 supports measures to develop our district heating potential and to ensure our retrofit ambitions align with the Housing for All strategy in areas such as compact growth, nearly zero energy buildings and retrofitting.</p> <p>The 2020 Annual Transition Statement details how our transport sector is playing a significant role in the national mitigation effort.  The decarbonisation pathway in transport is multilayered and will primarily focus on shifting to more sustainable transport modes, reducing the overall number of kilometres driven by fossil fuel-powered cars, accelerating the electrification of road transport, and an increased use of biofuels.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Ossian Smyth:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OssianSmyth&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=22"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A number of key public transport projects have been progressed to enhance and expand the capacity of the network and provide viable alternatives to private car travel.  This includes 261 new buses delivered in 2021, with progress also made on delivering BusConnects in Dublin and Cork, as well as the launch of the National Transport Authority's Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan, which will seek to provide better connections between villages and towns through enhanced and new local routes.</p><p>A low-emission vehicle task force was established to accelerate the deployment of low-carbon transport technologies and a national electric vehicle charging infrastructure strategy is in development to prioritise the delivery of fast and rapid-charge point infrastructure over the next five years.  Each local authority has been mandated to develop active travel routes that will improve the level of safety and attractiveness of using active travel modes in rural towns and villages.  An additional 248 staff were allocated across the 31 local authorities and national roads offices to assist with the delivery of the significantly increased number of projects.  The launch of the sustainable mobility policy in April set out the framework to deliver at least 500,000 additional daily active travel and public transport journeys by 2030 and a 10% reduction in the number of kilometres driven by fossil-fuelled cars.</p><p>The freight sector, which is critical to economic activity on an island economy, is heavily dependent on imported oil.  The Department of Transport is developing a ten-year strategy for the haulage sector focused on improving efficiencies and standards and helping the sector move to a low-carbon future.  In November 2021, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, published the Renewable Fuels for Transport Policy, which sets out the pathway for increasing the supply and use of renewable fuels in transport, including extending the biofuel obligation to 2024.</p><p>The 2020 annual transition statement highlights a number of developments in terms of how our agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, sector is committing to reducing its emissions.  The sector will also contribute by reducing land-based emissions through managing our soils in a better way.  Food Vision, launched in August 2021, is a landmark for the Irish agrifood sector and has the potential to transform the agriculture, food, forestry and marine sectors, with sustainability at its core.  The strategy is honest and upfront about the challenges ahead and, crucially, it proposes solutions and charts a pathway to sustainability in all its dimensions.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has overseen a number of programmes and initiatives to support the farming community in adopting and expanding sustainable practices.  This has included collaboration with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the nitrates action programme.  The most recent iteration of this programme will seek to contribute to a number of measures, including reducing chemical nitrogen use, establishing a national fertiliser register, reducing crude protein content of livestock feed and upskilling farmers and advisers to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to implement climate mitigation, biodiversity enhancement and adaptation practices.</p><p>Other initiatives and programmes to support cost savings and more efficient and sustainable farming have included: the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme to support a range of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies at farm level; the young farmer capital investment scheme; the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme; and the agricultural catchments programme, which will significantly enhance the monitoring of impacts of agriculture on our environment.  Further work is also ongoing on the promotion of protected urea fertilisers.</p><p>There has been significant improvement in grant and premium rates for the forestry for fibre scheme, which has been extended to the end of 2022.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is currently preparing a new forest strategy that will continue to take into account the important role forest biomass will play in climate change mitigation and adaptation.  Furthermore, in 2020, &euro;79.2 million of capital expenditure was invested in forestry development, including afforestation, the mobilisation of private timber resources, substantial investment in forest roads, continued support for knowledge transfer groups and the promotion of timber products.</p><p>The 2020 annual transition statement also highlights our ongoing work on climate adaptation to address current and future risks posed by a changing climate.  Ireland&rsquo;s robust adaptation strategies will also have positive co-benefits through fostering green growth, innovation, jobs, ecosystem enhancement and improvements in water and air quality.  Ireland&rsquo;s first statutory national adaptation framework represents Ireland's current national policy response to the challenges posed by the impacts of climate change.  It identifies 12 key sectors requiring sectoral adaptation plans, and these plans were approved by the Government and published in October 2019.  I will briefly mention some of these plans.</p><p>The agriculture, forest and seafood adaptation plan aims to reduce climate risk and build resilience through awareness-raising and integrating adaptation planning.  Progress on implementation has been made both within the Department and externally.  Work has continued to raise the profile of adaptation by aligning the mitigation and adaptation reporting processes together.</p><p>Actions within this biodiversity sectoral adaptation plan build on the foundations of the national biodiversity action plan.  These actions are aimed at  improving sustainable agriculture and fisheries, better soil and land management and, most urgently, the restoration of natural systems.  This adaptation plan will be reviewed on an ongoing basis with oversight by the biodiversity working group and the Minister.</p><p>Climate change can also cause major infrastructural damage to transport networks, as well as disruptions to operations and unsafe travel conditions.  The adaptation plan for transport infrastructure identifies key risks in the area and serves as a step towards building Ireland's long-term vision of a low-carbon, environmentally sustainable and resilient transport sector by 2050.  The energy and gas networks adaptation plan seeks to identify options that will help build resilience against the impacts of climate change and in assessing our vulnerability to likely climate impacts on our electricity and gas networks.</p><p>As noted by the Climate Change Advisory Council annual review of 2021, good progress is being made in implementing the sectoral adaptation plan for flood risk management.  The long-term goal for climate adaptation for flooding and flood risk management is to promote sustainable communities and support our environment through the effective management of the potential impacts of climate change.</p><p>The adaptation plan for the water quality and water services infrastructure presents an assessment of key future climate risks to the sectors.  The plan outlines the measures available to build resilience against the effects of climate change and weather-related events and other socioeconomic developments in both sectors.  Under the national adaptation framework, each local authority was required to make and adopt a local adaptation strategy.  Whereas implementation of each strategy is a matter for each individual local authority, a progress reporting template was developed by the climate action regional offices to enable local authorities to report on their progress.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is currently working with the regional offices, the Environmental Protection Agency and other stakeholders to develop appropriate guidelines for the making of local authority climate action plans, which are required under the Climate Act 2021.  Another key development noted in the 2020 annual report is Ireland&rsquo;s climate information platform, Climate Ireland, being introduced on a phased basis under the EPA research programme as a "one-stop shop" of information, data and knowledge to support those preparing for and adapting to the consequences of climate change.</p><p>The 2020 annual transition statement refers to the EPA's provisional greenhouse gases emissions report for 2019, emissions and projections for 2020 to 2040.  However, as there are now more up-to-date figures available, I will provide a brief overview of these.  In November 2021, the EPA reported that for 2020, total emissions in Ireland were estimated to have declined by roughly 3.6% compared with 2019.  This reduction was driven by a drop in the use of peat for electricity generation and Covid-19's impact on transport.  In this period our energy sector saw an almost 8% reduction in emissions while transport fell by almost 16%.  In the same period, agriculture emissions increased by 1.4% and emissions from the residential sector rose by 9%, highlighting the need for retrofitting to decarbonise home heating.  This relatively small overall reduction, given the substantial impact Covid-19 has had on our society, further highlights the transformative nature of the measures required to meet our 2030 and 2050 targets.</p><p>In May of this year, the EPA released its emissions projections out to 2040.  These projections estimate that in 2021, Ireland&rsquo;s emissions rose by 6% compared with 2020, in some part driven by our emergence from Covid-19 and associated restrictions.  The EPA also estimated that we were not on course to meet our 2030 targets, although its modelling could not fully factor in all actions and measures in our climate action plan, given further technical details are still to be developed.</p><p>We must consider how to accelerate the delivery of measures and actions that can not only reduce our emissions but also support new ways of conducting business and encouraging innovation.  Achieving these targets will provide numerous benefits to the country in terms of health, competitiveness, employment opportunities, biodiversity and climate impact.  To reverse the current trajectory of emissions and to meet our targets, a significant shift is required in the speed at which we roll out the measures and actions that will decarbonise our economy.  As part of the process to deliver the next climate action plan, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will engage with other Departments and State agencies to identify opportunities for accelerating our climate action.</p><p>As a party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, Ireland is required to report regularly on its implementation of the convention, preparing and submitting a national communication every four years and a biennial report every two years.  Ireland submitted its seventh national communication and third biennial report in March 2018.  Ireland submitted its fourth biennial report in February 2020.  We are currently preparing our eighth national communication for submission.</p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s national reports are subject to an in-country technical review process and a multilateral assessment process.  Ireland participated in multilateral assessments by the UNFCCC on its seventh national communication in Bonn in June 2019.  The technical review of Ireland&rsquo;s fourth biennial report took place virtually in April 2020 and multilateral assessment also took place virtually in June 2021.</p></speech>
