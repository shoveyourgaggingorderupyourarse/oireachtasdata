Obviously he has been here before and it is great to be back in the old Chamber of the Seanad.  I requested that the Minister attend today to discuss the national strategy of promoting viable trade routes between southern Ireland and the Continent, which is a major issue at the moment when Brexit is taken into consideration, and how connectivity and trade routes can be improved.  I am speaking specifically about such routes as the car ferries on the Cork-Swansea route, which left us many years ago, and the viability, in particular, of the French ferries, which are very important for our industries in both directions.  Brittany Ferries runs a fantastic operation but it is seasonal and operates at certain times.  It also operates another operation to the north of Spain which is also seasonal.  Such connectivity is a major issue for a growing economy such as in Cork and how we can promote this kind of interaction between both France and Ireland to ensure that the seasonal element of the ferries can be extended to a year-round commercial entity.</p> <p>This is one of the key issues for both tourism and connectivity.  Not alone will that promote the trade in vehicles but will also provide for the transport of containers.  At the moment if one has a container and needs to get it to the Continent, the Dublin Port scenario, unfortunately, comes into play.  With the potential we have in Cork, in particular, we need to be looking at viable options for promoting Cork and its port and to then drive on to ensure that we have these viable trade routes.</p> <p>This conversation is taking place  in the context of the Brexit debate.  The Minister is very up to date on that issue and has made some very keen statements in the last number of weeks on it.  I need that reassurance that we have that strategy, that potential and have those trade routes under way to ensure that, as we are going forward, they will be a real part of our strategy in promoting the southern region of Ireland, in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-09-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019092400002#B00400"><p>I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the House on this matter.</p> <p>I would like to confirm that shipping services to and from Ireland are market-driven and that the market offers a diverse range of viable maritime routes in and out of the State, both to the UK and continental Europe.  This is vital to facilitate both trade and tourism.  Nationally, Ireland is well-served by ferry links to the UK and continental Europe.  These links are frequent and competitive.  There are currently a total of 79 return sailings from the Republic of Ireland every week direct to Europe and there are 257 return sailings every week direct to and from the UK.  Shipping operates in a highly liberalised global market environment and the ongoing development of our shipping network has provided more competition, choice and frequency in accessing global markets.  </p> <p>Looking specifically at trade routes between southern Ireland and the Continent, the Port of Cork Company has been very proactive in seeking to establish direct routes to Europe.  A new route from Cork to northern Spain was announced on 16 January 2016 and the first service commenced on 9 May 2018.  This service is operated by Brittany Ferries, to which the Senator referred, and makes two return sailings a week from the Port of Cork to Santander.  In addition, the port has a well-established weekly return sailing from Cork to Roscoff in France.  The ferry can carry around 500 passengers and has space for 195 cars.  The service provides more choice for freight carriers which can bypass the UK landbridge and go directly to Europe, which is important as Brexit draws closer.  </p> <p>The Port of Cork is currently undertaking major development works, including the construction of a new container terminal at Ringaskiddy.  This work will enhance national port capacity and future increases in trade by facilitating larger vessels, increased tonnage and throughput.  </p> <p>In addition, the Port of Waterford has been very active in seeking to establish more direct links with the Continent.  This is in keeping with its long-term plans for growth and future development.  In July 2019, BG Freight Line, in partnership with Maersk, announced the commencement of new weekly lift-on, lift-off freight service on the Waterford-Rotterdam route.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Shane Ross:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1974"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1974&amp;amp;pid=ShaneRoss&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This acts as a deep-sea feeder route for businesses which are exporting or importing goods globally through Europe's largest seaport.<br/><br/>This service from the Port of Waterford provides a wider choice to Irish importers and exporters in the south east.  Last year, Irish Rail and Rosslare Europort, an important ro-ro port, completed a report on Rosslare and approved a &euro;15 million investment plan for the strategic development of the port.  Shannon Foynes port is also currently engaged in a major capital expenditure programme to increase capacity.  The port is actively exploring opportunities to develop new routes.  The port is talking to businesses in the catchment area, to shipping companies and to ports on the Continent about the feasibility of new routes.<br/><br/>Brexit highlights the importance of connectivity from Ireland to the Continent.  Shipping companies in the past have responded to economic developments and increased or decreased capacity in response to changing developments.  In preparation for Brexit, some shipping companies have already commenced providing additional capacity on direct routes to Europe.  CLdN launched a new &euro;234 million ro-ro freight ferry, the <i>MV Celine</i>, with a capacity of 8,000 lane metres, on the Rotterdam-Zeebrugge-Dublin route in October 2017.  CLdN has also introduced additional capacity on its direct route to Europe with its vessel, <i>Laureline</i>.  In addition, Irish Ferries' investment of &euro;150 million in its newest passenger and freight vessel, <i>MV W.B. Yeats</i>, provides year-round freight capacity between Ireland and France of 165 HGVs per sailing, or 60,600 HGVs per annum.  Another vessel of similar size to the <i>W.B. Yeats</i>is due to commence operations in the Irish Sea in 2020.</p></speech>

It is about capacity, as the Minister mentioned clearly in his response.  It is all about the capacity that will be provided, as well as the capacity that exists.  Some of this capacity is currently coming through the Dublin Port but I believe we need to look at the regional spread of the capacity, whether it is roll-on, roll-off or cargo itself.  The potential we have in southern Ireland in terms of geographical location and the manufacturing and pharmaceutical base gives us a real step towards building on that capacity so we can increase our trade links and, in turn, increase our capacity.</p></speech>

There is no intention to exclude any region in any way.  The more capacity we have in this situation, the better.  We will certainly consider the Port of Cork as part of that strategy.</p></speech>

The Office of Public Works is to be congratulated on a marvellous piece of work.</p> <p>Alas, that is not why we are here today.  We are here at the request of Councillor Paddy McQuillan in regard to St. Laurence's Gate in Drogheda.  To give some background to the issue, two and half years ago a committee was formed with the purpose of closing the historic and iconic St. Laurence's Gate to public transport and, instead, opening the gate as a tourist attraction for the town.  It is already listed on the Discover Ireland website as being widely regarded as one of the finest of its kind in Europe.  However, with increased traffic through the town, the gate was being damaged, particularly by trucks that were being sent through it by satellite navigation systems.  Indeed, I have some photographs of trucks stuck under the gate and the resulting wear and tear on its structure.</p> <p>There was great excitement when the newly-established committee got together in Louth County Council and a traffic management plan was designed and implemented, and the gate was closed to traffic.  Unbelievably, it is now two years on and the gate is still lying idle, and a very busy tourist season has come and gone without the gates being opened to the public as a visitor attraction.  The road markings have not even been removed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerard P. Craughwell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2402"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2402&amp;amp;pid=GerardPCraughwell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister of State's predecessor and our Independent colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, visited the gate and pledged to make it fulfil its potential as an open visitor attraction.  It was briefly open to the public during the two recent fleadhanna cheoil.  Those events were sold out each day.</p><p>It would appear that since the council owns the surrounding land and the Office of Public Works, OPW, owns the protected structure, the delay lies somewhere between the two bodies, but it has proven difficult for councillors and those involved in the campaign to have the gate reopened to get a definitive answer.</p><p>The gate was built in 1280 and has survived to the present day, but it needs careful work if its structure is to be protected.  This is particularly true regarding the south tower, which I understand is structurally damaged and needs repair.  Bringing the tower up to the standards required to make it a safe and sustainable visitor attraction will require investment by the OPW, but time is of the essence.  Given the work done in Leinster House, there is no organisation better qualified to bring a building back to its original standards than the OPW.</p><p>County Louth has an impressive tourism offering and an enviable built and natural heritage set in a unique location at the very heart of Ireland's Ancient East.  The council and its economic forum have a strong and achievable tourism plan with Drogheda as a gateway town at the centre, but, sadly, without its historic gate.  What plans has the Minister of State for the tower's renovations?  When can the people of Drogheda expect the gate to be fully restored and open to the public for tourism business?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-09-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019092400002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator for his welcome words for my OPW staff and colleagues.  I also thank the Houses of the Oireachtas, which have done a tremendous job.  People might complain about what it cost to do up Leinster House, but the damage was only visible after the plaster was peeled back.  The finished article is now a house for the future.  I wish Senators the best of luck in the year ahead.</p> <p>The St. Laurence's Gate building is an iconic structure in Drogheda and is instantly recognisable as a reminder of the ancient town defences.  It is a 13th century barbican and was one of the entry points to the town in medieval times.  It is a strong visual reminder of Drogheda's past.</p> <p>The major issue with the gate in recent years was the fact that the roadway through it had been used for ordinary traffic purposes until 2017 when the local authority decided that vehicles should be rerouted away from the archway.  It was the OPW's view at the time that this was essential to prevent further physical damage to the monument, as repeated vehicle strikes had given rise to serious alarm over the years and there was a genuine fear that it might be compromised or even terminally damaged.  The OPW was relieved when the difficult decision was taken locally to remove the traffic threat from the area.  I applaud the members and executive of Louth County Council for taking that decision.</p> <p>Having resolved the traffic issue, the question arises as to what steps are necessary to realise the full potential of the gate and how to reopen it to the public, thereby creating a new focal point and a tourism attraction in the town.  This needs the co-operation of the OPW, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, and the local authority, each of which has a role to play.  There is no doubt that this is a very challenging proposition, one fraught with difficulty.  Two major issues present: first, how to arrange safe access into the interior of what is a compact and confined space in a way that is suitable and enjoyable for visitors and, second, how to deal with the building's multiple serious structural issues in a way that preserves its stability and structural integrity.</p> <p>The gate building can actually be visited on special arrangement.  This option has been open to the public previously and was done on a number of occasions on foot of special arrangements made as part of the heritage week, recent fleadhanna cheoil, and the other local festivals that the Senator referenced.  I confirm that the building will continue to be available for opening on request for special events.  These limited openings have proven popular and serve as a direct reminder of the locals' pride in this landmark building and the potential it holds for visitor attractions in Drogheda.</p> <p>Bearing that in mind, the OPW and Louth County Council have co-operated since the traffic closure in trying to find a way to have the gate open to the public continuously.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2454"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2454&amp;amp;pid=KevinBoxerMoran&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The council has also prioritised proposals for creating a landscape plan for the surrounding area and developing a public realm project to improve the immediate vicinity of the building.  However, the single most serious and pressing issue that is causing difficulty and impeding progress is the structural condition of the building.  This has been prioritised over any other issue since it calls into question the continued stability of the monument.</p><p>As a result of a structural assessment in early 2017 by external consultant engineers working for the OPW, major cracks and structural weaknesses that have significantly compromised the building were discovered.  This means that in the view of both the OPW and the structural consultants the building is unsafe for unrestricted general access and, although the OPW can continue to open it under supervision for special occasions, it cannot be fully opened as a visitor attraction in its current condition.  The OPW has been working on the development of a scheme of works to counteract this problem with the assistance of its engineers and is aiming to advance a project at the site when this has concluded.</p><p>I must caution the Senator that this is a very complex and challenging works proposal.  The OPW is not in a position to say when it will be concluded and a stabilised building provided.  The OPW is conscious of the need to progress this project.  However, there are a significant number of urgent and pressing needs at other monuments in the Louth-Meath area and resources will at times have to be prioritised to deal with those.  I appreciate that this will cause some disappointment as I am sure that locals were hopeful that the gate would soon become a favourite destination for visitors.  I regret that this will not be achievable in the short term.</p></speech>

The important aspect here is that there is a possibility of payback by having it open as a tourist attraction in Drogheda.  When he returns to his Department the Minister of State might discuss with his officials how we could move the project forward.  I appreciate that the matter is complex.  The fact that it crosses three different organisations makes it even more difficult.  However, the councillors I met in Drogheda to discuss this issue are willing to work with the Minister of State in any way they can in order that the monument can be opened for Drogheda as the gateway to the Ireland's Ancient East.</p></speech>

It has a number of different issues on which I am working with it all the time.  This is a serious structural issue.  While the Department has consultants viewing it, we still have to find the money and resources to make it a proper attraction.  It is open from time to time for different events and I was influential in making that happen last year for the Fleadh Cheoil and local festivals.  I will continue to do that and make it as open as possible for the people.  I will also work to get the money to do what people want to be done with the building for the future.</p></speech>

Swords is the largest town in Ireland.  It currently has a population of over 45,000 and is expanding at a rapid pace.  However, there is a school placement crisis in the Fosterstown area.  Significant housing development is planned for this area of Swords, with over 3,000 homes planned in the coming years.  That will make the current bad situation in Rivervalley and Fosterstown even worse.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is what I want to talk about today.  There is an insufficient number of school places at this end of Swords.  Schools have been provided in recent years at the other end of the town but this particular area has a very high population of young people that is expanding and there are not enough school places.</p><p>A site for a school on Forest Road has been identified in the Fosterstown master plan.  Rivervalley community national school opened its doors a number of weeks ago and while the addition of this school to the area is very welcome and has given relief to some families, it is located in the Riasc Centre in Drinan, which is a 45-minute walk from Rivervalley.  There is no public transport available and there is severe traffic congestion in that particular area.  It is far from ideal to have the school located on this temporary site.  People are crying out for a permanent school building on Forest Road.  </p><p>This issue has been raised by my council colleagues on a number of occasions and council officials have told them that it is up to the Department of Education and Skills to issue a request to Fingal County Council to purchase the site and start the development.  It is essential that the school is built before all of the houses are developed in the area and before the crisis gets completely out of hand.  A permanent school building on Forest Road in Swords must be built.  There is a massive deficit in the provision of school places.  I call on the Minister of State to give a commitment to the people of Swords that the Department will go ahead and give the signal to Fingal County Council to purchase this site because the fear is that if it is not done now, the site will be lost to housing.</p></speech>

I wish to apologise on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, who, at the last minute, was unable to attend today.  Again, I thank Senator Clifford-Lee for raising the matter and am happy to clarify the position in respect of the delivery of permanent accommodation for Rivervalley community national school in Swords.</p> <p>As the Senator knows, following a nationwide demographic exercise, it was determined that a new primary school was required to be opened in Swords south in September 2019 to ensure that there was sufficient primary school places to serve the school planning area.  Following on from a patronage appointment process, the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board, DDLETB, was appointed as patron of this new school.  The final grant of planning permission was received on 30 August 2019 from Fingal County Council for the development of interim accommodation for the school at 85-87 Main Street, Swords, in order to ensure that the school would open in September 2019.  It was then necessary to seek alternative interim accommodation and the school opened in suitable contingency accommodation on a Department-owned site in Drinan on the south side of Swords, the area which the school was established to serve.  The school is located there at the moment but is moving to Rivervalley.  Once work has been completed on the site at 85-87 Main Street, the school will relocate to interim accommodation on that site in due course.  </p> <p>The Minister is committed to providing a permanent accommodation solution for the school at an early date but the acquisition of a suitable site is required to facilitate the delivery of this project.  The DDLETB, as school patron, is currently advancing a site acquisition process with the assistance of the Department of Education and Skills.  A potential site option in the Rivervalley area has now been identified.  Following on from initial engagement with the relevant landowners, a more detailed technical assessment of the site is now being undertaken.  The Senator will understand that this must be done before the site can be purchased.  That said, I believe that the site in question is more than adequate.  Of course the Senator will appreciate the importance of ensuring the technical feasibility of any proposed site to ensure that the required level of accommodation can be provided and to mitigate any potential planning risks to the project.  I can assure Senator Clifford-Lee that the Department and the DDLETB are working to progress matters as quickly as possible.  They have been in constant contact in recent weeks with a view to securing a permanent site for Rivervalley community national school at the earliest possible date.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Once a site for the school has been secured, the project to deliver its permanent accommodation can be progressed to the architectural planning process.

The Senator will appreciate the importance of ensuring that assessments of technical feasibility are carried out on the site to ensure that everything is in order.  I have been informed that the site is fine and grand.  I have asked for a timeline but I do not have it.  I am, however, assured by the Department that we will have such a timeline in the coming weeks.  I will make it my business to ensure the Senator is provided with that timeline as soon as possible.</p></speech>

T&aacute;im cinnte go n-aont&oacute;idh sibh liom go bhfuil obair den scoth d&eacute;anta faoi threoir Oifig an nOibreacha Poibl&iacute;.  A huge amount of work has been done during those two years, much of it invisible.  That is because the restoration project was mainly concerned with strengthening floors, improving fire insulation and rationalising the cabling that has proliferated under floors and behind walls over many years.  It was about ensuring that a 270 year old family home was equipped to serve as the home of our national Parliament for at least another century.  That said, anyone who has walked through the corridors and seen this Chamber will have been impressed by the magnificent job that has been done to enhance the presentation of Leinster House to the increasing number of people who visit the Oireachtas every year.  This is a building that we can be proud to show to the school children and community groups, the tourists and the foreign delegations we welcome daily to the Chamber.</p> <p>I am pleased that the project has allowed us to adapt the Chamber in order to ensure improved access for people with disabilities.  Proper provision has been made for wheelchair users, whether visitors or Members.  Camera points to facilitate Irish sign language broadcasting have been installed and the loop system for those with hearing difficulties has been upgraded.</p> <p>Many people have contributed to the success of this restoration project.  From the point of view of the Seanad, the restoration would never have been possible if we had not found a suitable place in which to conduct our business while the work was being carried out.  I have to express particular gratitude to the director, board and staff of the National Museum of Ireland who facilitated our sittings in the Ceramics Room and the Japanese Room.  Under the exemplary stewardship of the Ceann Comhairle and Chair of the Oireachtas Commission, Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, an excellent relationship has been developed with our next door neighbours in the museum, a relationship which, I have no doubt, will endure and develop further to the mutual benefit of our two institutions.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">An Cathaoirleach:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1988"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1988&amp;amp;pid=DenisODonovan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I commend, in particular, the Office of Public Works which oversaw the restoration.  An historic building that is nearly three centuries old presents considerable technical challenges and responsibilities.  The work the OPW has done in Leinster House speaks positively to its reputation for highly-competent and sensitive management of the State's stock of historic buildings.  The main contractor, Duggan Brothers, and the many subcontractors involved in the restoration deserve our gratitude for their sterling work, as do our own contractors who manage the electronic voting, sound and broadcasting systems.  Last but not least, the staff of our own facilities management unit have been immersed in this project for the past few years.  They have worked flat out, especially throughout the summer, to ensure the effective co-ordination and delivery of the many aspects of the complex project.  Special mention must be made of Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Brien, who has worked tirelessly to ensure Leinster House would be open for our sitting day.<br/><br/>I thank all the staff of the Seanad for their patient endurance and the staff of the Houses who helped us over the past two years in a different facility.  I acknowledge the presence today of acting Superintendent, John Flaherty.  I thank all the Leinster House staff, including the ushers, who have been so facilitating, courteous and kind not only to me but also to all the Members.  On behalf of all Members of the Seanad, I thank everyone involved for a job well done.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute;ibh go l&eacute;ir bheith br&oacute;d&uacute;il as an m&eacute;id agus an gcaighde&aacute;n obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta acu.  The fantastic work on the restoration of the building, which has been painted in colours similar to those of 1748 when similar colour patterns were used, represents a wonderful achievement for all involved.  It brings to mind a quotation that my father taught me around the fireside in west Cork when I was a child.  I am not sure if it is from Thackeray or Goethe: </p><blockquote>Do I sleep? do I dream?<br /><br />Do I wonder and doubt?<br /><br />Are things what they seem? <br /><br />Or is visions about?&quot;  </blockquote><p>Ar aghaidh linn.</p></speech>

I hope we have a very productive session.  I commend everyone who has worked on the restoration project.  We are all delighted to be back in here.  Many of us believed we would not be back considering how long the works were to take.  It is fantastic to be back.  I am particularly happy that the Leader is here with us and has not taken an extended holiday to the Rugby World Cup in Japan like his colleagues have.  I am glad he is here for the opening of business.  It is great to see him.</p> <p>It is now 37 days until 31 October.  Most of the media commentary and political discourse over recent months has been about Brexit, Boris and the budget.  Today's UK Supreme Court judgment was unanimous.  It is very striking.  It has been confirmed that Westminster is meeting tomorrow to discuss the ramifications of the judgment.  We all hope in this House that some common sense will prevail across the UK parties and that they will focus on what the majority have already said about preventing a hard and disorderly Brexit on 31 October.  While common sense has not been in abundance in the United Kingdom of late, it is crucial that Ireland not become a casualty of any premature, knee-jerk political reactions.  There has been a sense for quite some time that Ireland has not been ready for a hard Brexit and that there has been an all-right-on-the-night attitude seeping in.  This needs to change rapidly.  There were mixed messages last week after the UK Prime Minister visited Dublin.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2461"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2461&amp;amp;pid=LorraineCliffordLee&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There were descriptions of a positive mood music at the start of the week but these were dampened down completely towards the end of the week.  There has been some stop-start momentum building up.  The UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, says he is anxious to get a deal, yet he and his Government have still not produced any written papers for the EU as to how they believe the Single Market will be protected on the island of Ireland or how border checks will be prevented.  He said he would rather die in a ditch than apply for an extension.  We still do not know the impact of this morning&rsquo;s UK Supreme Court judgment on parliamentary motions.  These are not insignificant stumbling blocks.  Jean-Claude Juncker made this clear when he met the UK Prime Minister at the end of last week.  We all need to be wary of not falling into rhetoric and remain focused on protecting jobs, regions and trade in Ireland.</p><p>The budget, due in two weeks&rsquo; time, will be dominated by Brexit.  Some commentators are calling it boring as there have been no threatening redlines or demands from Fianna F&aacute;il that could cause instability.  Our sensible and pragmatic approach annoys them and some in Fine Gael.  Our party agreed to a fourth budget because of Brexit and nothing else.  We put the country first and foremost.</p><p>We are all used to Senator Buttimer hitting out at Fianna F&aacute;il regularly.  He rarely stands up in the Chamber without taking a pop at our party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin.  It is an interesting tactic when he knows Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is not here to defend himself against his many spurious accusations.</p></speech>

I intend to do that.  There is only so much space available on the high moral ground.  I do not intend to take that position from the Leader.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il has some priorities and demands in this budget with discussions in this regard ongoing.  These include prioritising sectoral protection measures in the agrifood, tourism and small and medium-sized enterprise sectors against the potential devastating impacts of Brexit.  We also want to protect the poor and the vulnerable by ensuring this is a progressive budget.  It was interesting to read the Taoiseach&rsquo;s speech to the UN about the introduction of a carbon tax.  Instead of a dividend being introduced, he announced a ring-fenced fund.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been calling for this for a long time.  We welcome this U-turn as it is the only way of protecting against fuel poverty.</p> <p>Outside of the bubbles of Leinster House and of Brexit, there are everyday issues, namely, housing, health and the ever-increasing cost of living, which are having a negative impact on people and cannot be ignored.  With rents at such a high level, a whole generation of people are being locked out of the housing market.  Today, we read of Kennedy Wilson boasting that it made more money on rents in Dublin than in Los Angeles.  This is a damning indictment of the Fine Gael Government.  The housing system is broken.  While there have been many announcements, the Government sadly lacks delivery.  The home ownership rate stands at 68%, the lowest since 1971.  Countries such as Germany and Austria have seen significant increases in home ownership while ours has fallen.</p> <p>People are struggling to pay childcare costs and even avail of it.  Our transport system is creaking.  Our quality of life is suffering.  Yesterday, we had the bizarre situation of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann being forced to ask passengers to stagger their journey times to reduce overcrowding.  This shows how out of control the public transport system has become.  I have constantly called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, to address overcrowding issues on the northern commuter line.  He promised that 28 carriages would be refurbished and delivered but this still has not happened.</p> <p>There are issues around the direct provision system.  We all know it was originally supposed to be a temporary measure.  Now, 20 years later it has not been tackled, is not sustainable and is completely inhumane.</p> <p>I look forward to discussing the several challenges which I have outlined.</p></speech>

I had the privilege of being shown through it when it was at a very raw stage of rehabilitation and the extraordinary skills that were shown in restoring the House and the extent of the task that faced the contractors was substantial.  I thank the members of staff of Oireachtas &Eacute;ireann and of this House for their courtesy over the past two years.</p> <p>I propose an amendment to the Order of Business in relation to the statements on the report of the Seanad Reform Implementation Group to delete the proposed time limits of eight and six minutes and to insert instead that all contributions, including that of the Minister, should be limited to 12 minutes.  This is an important issue.  It is a matter of constitutional importance on which Senators should be entitled to spend some time debating rather than be shoehorned into a very short period of time of six minutes.</p> <p>In that context, the practice in this House of limiting ourselves in our contributions but then inviting in a Minister who is free to deliver a lengthy tract, which we have the advantage of reading, seeing and hearing at the same time, is undesirable.  We run our own business here.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is proposing to come here this evening and he should be limited to the same period of time as the rest of us if he will contribute to this debate, especially in view of the absence to date of any proper response to the report, which has been in the hands of the Government now for so long.</p></speech>

As a result, we got 2FM.  If there are to be economies in Montrose as to what goes out, surely it makes sense that that which would not be broadcast were it not for the licence fee, in other words, Lyric FM, should be preserved, and if there is some sacrifice in service, 2FM might join the myriad other stations that are competing for that particular market.</p></speech>

If one channel hops, on Sky News one will see satellite channels with advertisements directed at the Irish market in significant amounts.  It makes one wonder if it is really the case that RT&Eacute; is being properly financially managed if it can devote all its advertising slots to warning about the dangers of not having a television licence, telling of the next programme the station will have, advertising its own merits as a news channel or whatever, or giving subsidised advertising to concerts and the like and stating that it is supporting the arts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The only alternative, in volume, in RT&Eacute; seems to be advertisements for road safety and other such advertisements.</p><p>The point I return to is that Lyric FM would not exist were it not for the licence fee.  It is for the licence fee and public service broadcasting that we are willing to pay that contribution.  We are not there to subsidise alternative stations to the pop music stations.  We are paying our licence fee to get something else over and above some form of public broadcasting that we would not otherwise receive.  The suggestion that we would sacrifice Lyric FM at this point and keep to 2FM in existence is deeply offensive and an indication of completely wrong priorities in Montrose.  I hope the Leader will bring in the relevant Minister to address this issue in the House and to justify any proposal to close down Lyric FM.</p></speech>

I very strongly agree with him about Lyric FM.  It is only a &euro;6 million budget, which is minuscule in terms of the global budget of RT&Eacute;.  The station is a real leader in classical music.  It is superb and I listen to it all the time.</p><p>With regard to the redecoration of the House, I congratulate those involved, particularly on the fact they left the ceiling in the original colours.  These are quite lovely and so much better than it was in the 1950s and 1960s, with those dull brown colours.  There are also the magnificent Waterford glass chandeliers.  We can all be proud of this Irish artwork.  I am a little surprised by the existence of what are, apparently, two mobile telephones on the ceiling.  There is a kind of blob beneath them.  I am also not quite so crazy about the mustard colour on the walls.  I would have preferred a lighter colour.  All in all, however, it is an absolutely superb job and we are delighted to be back.</p><p>I wish to raise a couple of issues.  The first concerns a man called Paul Graham, who is 80 years old.  Mr. Graham was born and raised in the Church of Ireland's Bethany Home in Dublin but he has been refused an Irish passport.  It is quite extraordinary that an Irishman, born presumably of Irish parents, although unknown, is being denied an Irish passport at the end of his days.  This is completely wrong.  The second issue is from a religious sister who contacted me about an article by Fintan O'Toole in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  The 27th Amendment states, &quot;... a person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have, at the time of the birth of that person, at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality, unless provided for by law.&quot;  While it is rather badly drafted, it does seem to rule out people.  I think this is completely wrong and it is totally against the position in America, for example, as anybody born in America is automatically an American citizen.</p><p>The third matter I want to raise concerns the qualification of an unbroken year's residence when applying for naturalisation.  This can create problems.  One person wrote to me and pointed out that his job involves travelling abroad to represent the company by which he is employed.  The qualification to which I refer would make this impossible.  The position in respect of this matter must be reconsidered.</p><p>I salute the very remarkable judgment of the British Supreme Court.  It is quite remarkable that the 11 judges on the court unanimously held that Johnson's proroguing of the UK Parliament was unlawful and that he unlawfully advised the Queen.  That is a significant finding and I welcome it strongly.</p></speech>

The Senator would know a lot about that.  I will bow to his superior knowledge.  The time extension would ensure a transition period of two or three years, which would be of great benefit to both countries.  We want to continue our good relations with the UK, given that we do so much trade with it, North and South, and to ensure that there will not be a border on the island of Ireland.  We are all broadly of the one view, regardless of our parties.  Matters continue to change by the day, but in light of the new development, perhaps the Leader will arrange for an early discussion.  Could we invite the Attorney General?  There are many legal aspects, and there are many Senators, apart from Senator Colm Burke, who would like to tease out some of these matters.  I will leave this in the Leader's hands.</p></speech>

We have seen cavalier attitudes being taken to the democratic process by leaders of two of the largest democracies in the world, namely, the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Boris Johnson, MP, and President Trump across the water in the United States of America.  Democracy might not be a perfect system, but show me one better.  If we let ourselves down at the top, then we are inviting people to reconsider alternatives, for example, failed systems like Marxism and so on.  Whatever we say about the British, their parliamentary system has in many ways been the blueprint for many other parliamentary systems, including ours.  In fairness, it is the mother of parliaments, flawed and all as it is.  It has afforded opportunities for Irish politicians, be it Parnell or Redmond.  Obviously, those politicians had no place of their own to speak, but they took their opportunity over there.  I invite Senator Conway-Walsh and her Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues to avail of the unique opportunity that is now afforded to them to do something practical in this Brexit debate instead of spending-----</p></speech>

I believe we can do something practical in this House.  The power-sharing Executive collapsed as a result of cash for ash and there has been no democratic voice in the Assembly since then.  Considering what has happened in London, it is now urgent to get the Assembly back up and running.  It would be helpful if we could have a debate with the Minister on what practical things can be done to get the power-sharing Executive back up and running at this dangerous period in Irish history.  Let us clearly recall the reason it collapsed.  Can we put a protocol in place in respect of cash for ash, set aside preconditions and get the Assembly back in place and focused on representing the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic and the dangers they face with a breakdown of negotiations on Brexit, which is where I believe we are going?</p> <p>I wish to raise another point with the Leader on which he might facilitate me.  He has heard me on many occasions raising legacy issues for apartment owners.  I quoted the figure of approximately 70,000 apartment owners who are facing legacy issues, with bills ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;52,000 to rectify their apartments.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, said that the State will not take on responsibility for this, but the State has stepped into other areas such as the dodgy cement blocks used in Donegal and Mayo as well as pyrite.  We cannot leave so many apartment owners swinging in the wind with huge financial debt and threats from fire officers that they will have to vacate their homes.  Before the recess I asked the Minister of State, Deputy English, to facilitate meetings and he said he would.  Unfortunately, that did not happen over the summer.</p> <p>Will the Leader use his good offices to contact the Minister on behalf of this House, as many other Members, including the Leader, have raised this issue as well?  We must work out a practical solution for people who bought apartments with legacy, fire and water egress issues.  Basically, they were poorly built apartments due to the lack of regulation.  There is an onus on us.  The legislation relating to self-certification was changed in this House and the D&aacute;il so there is a responsibility to work out a solution for the 70,000 families.  As I said, something was worked out with regard to dodgy cement blocks in Donegal and Mayo and in some circumstances in respect of pyrite.  Assistance must be given to people who own apartments and are in danger of losing their homes.</p></speech>

Just before the first school strike in March I invited students to the AV room for a discussion on climate action.  They were eloquent and passionate.

I have often said that we view Brexit as the British accidentally shooting themselves in our foot.  That said, there is goodwill in the Parliament of the United Kingdom and in this Parliament.  We are committed Europeans but we want to remain good friends with the United Kingdom.  We also want to ensure that the United Kingdom remains a good friend of the European Union.  Up to 80% of our colleagues in Westminster and the House of Lords do not believe that Brexit is good for the United Kingdom, for relations between Ireland and the UK or for the EU.  The fact that common sense appears to be prevailing must be welcomed.</p> <p>On another note, which may be related to Brexit, I was truly appalled by the depraved attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney, a Quinn Industrial Holdings director who is now dealing with life-changing injuries.  Last night, I watched the "Claire Byrne Live" programme on television and felt a chill as another Quinn Industrial Holdings director, Mr. John McCartin, a colleague and good friend, spoke about constant threats, including death threats, and the campaign of intimidation against company executives, including himself, over the past five years.  Both Kevin Lunney and John McCartin are married with young children.  What Kevin Lunney was subjected to, having been abducted by a criminal gang and tortured for over three hours, does not bear thinking about.  Some of the  newspaper reports of what the thugs reportedly did to Mr. Lunney were stomach-churning and raise serious questions about how close we are to the breakdown of law and order in parts of the Border region.  Indeed, the journalist Ms Dearbhail McDonald said on "Claire Byrne Live" last night that the campaign of violence and intimidation is one of the greatest challenges to the rule of law since we signed the Good Friday Agreement and it is hard to disagree with that analysis.  The warning signs have been there for several years.  </p> <p>I commend the good work being done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in investigating this incident.  It is imperative that not only are the foot soldiers apprehended but also those who paid the gang to carry out this brutal act.  Another question that must be asked is why these Quinn Industrial Holdings executives were not given sufficient protection against a background of sustained intimidation over the past five years.  If garda&iacute; can be posted outside the homes of at-risk gangland members, surely the state, North and South, can protect these citizens against loss of life?  Another worrying question is why threats posted on Facebook against company management have stayed up for years.  This hateful content was only removed by Facebook last Sunday night.  This is a question that Facebook must answer.  Last Friday, like thousands of others, I attended a peaceful protest in support of and solidarity with Quinn Industrial Holdings management and employees.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frank Feighan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some nine and half years earlier, I was part of a cross-party delegation that met Se&aacute;n Quinn and his management team in a bid to save jobs.  I could never have envisaged the events which have unfolded since.  We now have an obligation to do what we can to ensure the resources are in place to protect our citizens and 850 jobs in this country.  This is undoubtedly the feeling in the local community, which relies so heavily on Quinn Industrial Holdings to sustain employment and the economy in the north-west region and along the Border.  We must never lose sight of that fact.  I look forward to increased levels of cross-Border co-operation to put an end to this horrific campaign of violence and intimidation.</p></speech>

They show that the number on the waiting list increased from 6,238 at the end of March to 7,346 at the end of July, an increase of 18% in four months.  The list for the Cavan-Monaghan region now stands at 326 people.  It is important that we do not forget that behind these figures are vulnerable, elderly people and their families.  Older people want to stay in their own homes.  They are happier, healthier and more content there.  Unfortunately, in many instances discharges from our acute hospitals are delayed simply because there are no home care packages in place for the patients in question.  Beds are held up, which causes a backlog throughout the entire system.  Many of our vulnerable elderly are also forced into nursing homes as a result of this lack of home care packages.  The policy makes no sense either from the perspective of health or from a financial perspective.  Figures I recently came across highlight that very point.  To keep someone in an acute hospital setting for one week costs the taxpayers of this country &euro;6,000.  To keep someone in a nursing home for one week costs anywhere between &euro;1,300 and &euro;1,400.  A home care package of 6.5 hours costs the taxpayer &euro;165 per week.  Those figures say it all.  It is time that Government wakes up to this issue and treats our vulnerable elderly people with the respect they have earned.</p></speech>

It is important and timely that this has happened.  The factories are now free to return to slaughtering cattle and farmers who were under great pressure to get their animals slaughtered can now do so.  This will help to protect our meat industry and the jobs of workers who have been discommoded by the blockades and the inability of the factories to process meat.  I will, however, point out and highlight that the farmers who stood at the gates did so simply because they have no bargaining power when dealing with the meat processors.  They go to a factory to have their animals slaughtered and must take the price offered.  There is no negotiation.  The farmers who stood at the gates have succeeded in making the public and the mainstream media conscious of the fact that they are producing animals at a loss while the multiple retailers and meat processors in our food supply chain and beef industry are all making profits.  When the farmers run into difficulty they have to come to Government to bail them out and to assist them.  This is not sustainable.  There is more work to be done, but I want to acknowledge and compliment the farmers, who conducted themselves in a very fine manner in this regard.  It was a desperate act, but it is a desperate situation.  I hope all energies will now be focused on finding real, long-term solutions for the sustainability of our primary producers, our farmers, in the beef industry.</p> <p>I will refer to the beef exceptional aid measure, which received sign-off from the European Commission and the Minister, Deputy Creed, in July.  I welcome this &euro;100 million fund to assist farmers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When it was opened for applications in mid-August, take-up was slow.  Initially, just 20,000 farmers applied.  I understand that 34,517 farmers had applied by the closing date last Friday.  They will account for &euro;78.1 million of the &euro;100 million.  The money that is given is very welcome.  The farmers who are down on their luck are really down on their luck.  I suggest that the reference period during which farmers are given a subsidy for the slaughter of animals should be extended.  At the moment, it runs from 24 September 2018 to 12 September 2019.  I am asking for it to be pushed out to July to enable any farmer who presents with his cattle during the extended period to apply.  We should spend the remaining funds of approximately &euro;22 million which have not been claimed by farmers.  We will be going to the EU Commission again to look for money because of the uncertainty associated with Brexit.  Obviously, we do not know right here and now.  I do not think it would be good policy on our part to be sending any money back.  Farmers desperately need it.  There is scope to extend the terms of reference.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to seek to get the agreement of the EU Commission for this to be done.</p></speech>

A fantastic job has been done on the Chamber.  Like everyone else, I am delighted that we are back in this historic room.  I hope we will have a productive session right up until next summer, at least.</p> <p>I echo the comments of Senator McDowell and others about Lyric FM.  Lyric FM's budget is a tiny percentage of RT&Eacute;'s total budget.  It has been suggested that its budget is &euro;6 million, whereas RT&Eacute; has revenues of &euro;340 million.  We are talking about 1% or 2%.  It seems that RT&Eacute; has decided to deal with that.  If it had cut some of the top salaries, it probably would have found &euro;6 million handy enough.  This is something that could be looked at because Lyric FM provides a valuable service that would not otherwise be available.</p> <p>It is important that we focus all of our energies on Brexit issues.  We have seen what has happened in the UK today.  We keep saying it is unprecedented and it is not going to happen.  We cannot believe what is happening.  Every day, something new happens and we say the same things.  Dublin Port has 3 km of road available, but it will need far more than that in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I urge everybody on our side and on the UK side to try to keep cool heads and get some kind of a deal that works for us as well as possible.  Obviously, most of us would prefer if Article 50 were revoked.  I do not see that happening.  We should try to focus on the least worst deal that is available.</p> <p>We all need to play our part on the issue of climate change.  We need to bring in the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment on a far more regular basis to discuss what is happening.  It is great that young people and their families are concerned, but we need to look at everything from our settlement strategy to how we build our schools and hospitals, how we allow people to build houses and how we get around.  Irish Rail has told people to try to travel earlier or later because the Minister has not sanctioned enough rail carriages for them.  We need more public transport.  We need capacity on that public transport at the right times.  This is something that is in the hands of the Government, but it has refused to take action.</p> <p>We urgently need to do something about the cost of insurance, which the Seanad has debated on many occasions.  People are facing significant challenges.  Over the summer, play centres, playgrounds and adventure centres closed down because there had been massive increases in their insurance costs.  Work is being done, but it is happening at a slower pace than many people would be happy with.  It certainly needs to be tackled.</p> <p>We need to focus on the budget, which will be tabled by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, two weeks from today.  My party has facilitated the last three budgets and we intend to do so again in two weeks' time, subject to the parameters that we have outlined being agreed to.</p></speech>

Last Friday, the Central Bank issued a very stern warning.  It pointed out that in the event of a no-deal Brexit or a hard Brexit, the national debt could increase by &euro;22 billion in the next couple of years.  Corporation tax is incredibly welcome.  The more of it the better.  It went from &euro;4 billion in 2014 to &euro;10 billion last year.  If it had stayed at &euro;4 billion, we would have been &euro;6 billion short last year.  It is a hell of a lot of fiscal space to worry about.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We need to make sure that our national finances are being managed as best we can and to focus on the challenges.

At this stage, I suggest that Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade come to address the House on the latest Brexit developments and the preparedness of the Government in response to what is happening.</p> <p>On a separate note, I want to welcome the publication of the Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Elections) Bill 2019.  It is something I have called for on a number of occasions since coming into the House, along with my colleague, Senator Lawless, who has done valiant work with the Government and diaspora networks around the world to ensure that the first tangible step of the process has come to pass.  In welcoming the publication of the Bill, which is the first tangible step towards the realisation of this right and entitlement for citizens, namely, the right to vote for our President, I want to commend the relevant Ministers and their departmental officials who have worked diligently on what has been a complicated and complex set of proposals and legislation.  In appreciating that work, I am not diminishing it for a second.  What the Bill seeks to do is something very basic and simple, namely, to enfranchise Irish citizens no matter where in Ireland or the world they reside with that most basic entitlement of any citizen, that is, the right to vote.</p></speech>

To follow on from Senator Feighan's remarks, I wish to publicly and personally condemn the horrific and barbaric attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney from Quinn Industrial Holdings.  It is a shocking crime.  No matter who or what the victim was, it would be a shocking crime, but I know that the crime has been exacerbated by the fact that Mr. Lunney has a very young family and was a particularly civic minded and wonderful contributor to his community.  The crime is objectively horrible no matter what his job is.  He is a very good man and that should go on the record.  I commend the very courageous exposition by my friend and colleague, John McCartin, of the issues around this on "Claire Byrne Live" last night</p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to the House after a few weeks have elapsed.  He will best judge when he can come here, but I do not think he could come to the House during the early phases of the investigation.  I would like him to come to the House to provide assurance that a sufficient amount of Garda resources are going into the area and that things are being followed up.  This demands a Limerick-style solution, as was necessary with the Dundon gang.  It demands a similar solution to that which was necessary to deal with the gangland wars in Dublin.  It demands the kind of response that we had to the tragic murder of Veronica Guerin some years ago.  It is of that proportion and level of crisis.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to join in the condemnation and, in particular, impress upon the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, the nature of the concerns I have articulated about policing numbers, treating the situation as an emergency and giving it a Limerick status.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask that, at an appropriate time, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, come to the House to make an appropriate statement.  I have great confidence in the Minister, who has proven himself to be very capable in his Ministry, but it is my duty to know that this is transparent and is in front of this House.  We have spoken about the preservation of Parliament abroad and we need to preserve the dignity and importance of our Parliament by having the Minister respond on this horrific issue.  I am very saddened to have had to begin my contributions in this session on this subject.</p></speech>

According to a recent report from the Economic and Social Research Institute, an Irish woman's weekly income is &euro;153 less than that of an Irish man in retirement.  The report found that women were less likely to receive a contributory pension than men and that, among those who did, their average income was much lower than the average income received by men, while taking years out to look after children meant a reduction in contributory pension and this has affected women disproportionately.  They have generally worked for fewer years at retirement and this means they have also had less time to build up a private pension.  According to the report, over 90% of retired men had worked for more than 30 years compared with just 33% of retired women.  We need to look at how the contributory pension is allocated.  We were worth nothing for all the years of raising this generation and, for the benefit of that same generation, we now need to look at policies to enable a greater contribution in the workforce by women.  Policies which enable greater continuity in employment and encourage fewer gender traps are called for now.  We need to examine our policies to create more affordable childcare and long-term care services and to ensure those policies are robust enough to enable women to stay in the workforce.</p> <p>The report underlines how the Government's plans to look at private pensions as the saviour will do nothing to address the pay gap, because the numbers will stay the same.  Women are more likely to earn less and have less secure employment, meaning they cannot build a private pension in the same way men can.  It is high time we valued the work women do in raising families in their homes.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il are working hard to increase the home carer tax credit, but this measure is not enough of an acknowledgement of the savings delivered to the State by the women who stay at home to raise families.  While some dads do this, the majority are women.</p></speech>

I hope our intellectual prowess and argument can parallel it.  However, I do not particularly like the front door to the building.  It reminds of a funereal door, into a very modern undertakers.  We have lost the clink and clitch of the mahogany door and I have written to the OPW, and to the ushers, about it.  Our own room here is wonderful and I am glad to be back in it.</p> <p>I wish to raise an issue I raised in the last semester, and which is coming to fruition now.  It concerns healthcare workers.  The IMO has sent out statistics that are quite frightening, such as that we have the lowest number of medical specialists in the EU; 520 consultant posts not filled; outpatient lists exceeding 500,000; 50% of health specialists due to retire in the next five years; one quarter of GPs due to retire; and unprecedented levels of emigration among our newly qualified doctors.  This is extremely serious.  We can talk about Brexit all we like, and we can talk about what Boris Johnson is and is not doing at the High Court and the Supreme Court, but we have a serious problem in the health area, especially as we get older.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to come into the House.  We need to attend to a lot of these problems with our hospitals, not just in the great city of Dublin or urban areas like Limerick and Galway but all over Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2390"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2390&amp;amp;pid=MarieLouiseODonnell&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These are serious problems reflecting what is happening in our health sector.

Today's edition of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>reports on the publication of an audit of food offered in canteens in six schools.  The idea of food being available in schools was designed to promote healthy eating but the survey indicates food is being offered that does not represent health eating.  Items such as chips and muffins have been introduced partly because the companies providing the service are not making a profit from promoting healthy eating items of food.  This is a worrying trend when we want to decrease the level of obesity but we find it is increasing among our young people every year.  If schools are not able to deliver in this area, we face a major challenge.  The audit was carried out in six schools by the school of public health in UCD.  It is an interesting study and it sounds alarm bells about this issue.  We need to ask the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education and Skills to co-operate to ensure this trend does not continue and to work out a plan for healthy eating and encourage young people to buy into it.</p><p>There is a related issue concerning medical practice in that GPs are reluctant to raise the issue of obesity with parents whose children are clearly overweight.  We need to ensure this healthcare issue is not let drift and it needs to be dealt with immediately.  I ask the Leader to raise this matter with the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Health.</p></speech>

Lyric FM is based in Limerick city.  I met its staff yesterday and they are extremely concerned.  Someone set off a flare gun on "Prime Time" more than a week ago out of the blue.  The staff were not aware of the possibility of a threat to Lyric FM.  What is required is clarity about its future, both as RT&Eacute; Lyric FM and that it will continue to be based in Limerick city.  I have a letter dated 20 February 1997 in which the then Minister with responsibility for the arts and now President, Michael D. Higgins, approved the establishment of RT&Eacute; Lyric FM.  It came on foot of a Government Green Paper and RT&Eacute; actively pursued the setting up of Lyric FM.  It has been a resounding success.  It has retained it numbers.  It provides quality programmes.  It is branded.  Twenty three staff members are based in Lyric FM.  In terms of its cost, the licence fee goes directly to what its does, which is to broadcast classical music.  Its remit should be extended to the arts.  It covers snippets of the arts but RT&Eacute; in terms of Lyric FM has a wealth of experience.  I want the message to go out loud and clear from this Chamber that RT&Eacute; must give an uncategorical assurance that Lyric FM will be maintained-----</p></speech>

This is about the lives of real people, namely, staff who are living in Limerick and rearing families there.  They have bills to pay.  That is apart from the fact that Lyric FM provides a quality product.  It is based on Cornmarket Street in the heart of Limerick city.  A significant investment was put into the station.  The RT&Eacute; regional studios are based in the same building.  It is critical that the matter would be put to bed and that RT&Eacute; make a statement to the effect that Lyric FM will continue to provide the quality product it has been providing in the heart of Limerick city, particularly as the station was pioneered by RT&Eacute; and, in particular, the President, Michael D. Higgins.</p></speech>

I wish to be associated with welcoming everybody back to this magnificent Chamber.  I congratulate and thank everybody involved for the magnificent job they have done in refurbishing the House.  I wish to add to the long list of names the Cathaoirleach outlined of those who were responsible for bringing the work to fruition.  The former Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Barrett, played a leading role early on in the refurbishment, not just of the Chamber but the old part of Leinster House.  He was adamant that the work would continue after the work on the former National College of Art and Design was finished so that the contractors engaged by the Office of Public Works would not have to move out and then have to move back in again, that there would be a continuation and that the works would be completed.  The Deputy's name should be added to the Cathaoirleach's long list.</p> <p>Could the Leader invite in the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to come before the House for a debate on the leisure fishing industry?  The Minister of State has responsibility for natural resources and community affairs.  Leisure fishing is dying as a sport.  Something radical must be done to revive fly fishing, trout fishing, salmon fishing, etc.  We have the finest rivers and lakes in Europe but the art of fishing is dying.  We must do something.  It is the responsibility of the Minister of State's Department to do something urgently, whether involving the Inland Fisheries Ireland or whoever has the remit for it.  Something must be done.  We must bring the Minister of State before the House.</p> <p>I also want the Minister of State to address an issue affecting the lakes in the vicinity of Castlebar.  I do not know whether it has spread to other lakes.  Mink have killed almost all of swans on the lakes in the Castlebar area.  There is an infestation of mink which are doing unbelievable damage to the swan population.  Something radical must be done.  I ask that the Minister of State come to the Chamber to discuss both issues as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

A councillor from Wicklow contacted me to say that dogs had killed three swans.  The poor old swans are getting it tough this weather.</p> <p>I ask the Leader, a little belatedly, to respond.  I apologise to anyone whom I missed.  Some people were busy and perhaps have left the Chamber.  Everybody seemed to want to come in and I was trying to be fair to everyone.

As Captain of the Guard, he has been a wonderful friend to all of us here.</p> <p>That brings me very nicely to the restoration project and to join the Cathaoirleach and all Members of the House, in the words of commendation to all involved in the project that has now happily reached a culmination in the 270 year old home being restored.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->T&aacute;imid ar ais le ch&eacute;ile sa Seomra iontach seo.

Who would have thought we would still be here?<br/><br/>I will not rise to the by-election commentary from my colleagues and friends across the Chamber but Senator Clifford-Lee should remember the important point that we have 37 days left until the end of October.  This Government, led by An Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has been very much to the fore in ensuring the green jersey is worn across the world, not just in Europe.  That is evidenced by the solidarity we have received so far, which culminated this morning in the meetings which were held in New York.  We also had the unanimous decision of the UK Supreme Court today.<br/><br/>Senators Clifford-Lee, Conway-Walsh, Norris, Coghlan, O'Sullivan, Humphreys, Devine, Feighan and Horkan referred to Brexit, the UK Supreme Court judgment and Northern Ireland.  I want to make it clear, in case people have forgotten, that there have been no mixed messages from this Government.  There has been a consistent, clear line from this Government.  The Taoiseach has been emphatic, as have other members of the Government, regarding the binding assurances required that there will not be a hard border.  While the decision by the Supreme Court in the UK, which is a different jurisdiction, is a matter for the UK Parliament, all of us should celebrate the primacy of parliament being upheld in the UK today.  As Members of Parliament, Members of this House and the Lower House should be conscious of what they say and how they say it.  Part of our job is to hold the Executive to account but we must also hold public bodies to account and pass legislation in a manner befitting a parliament.  Our language and behaviour are important.<br/><br/>I welcome all Senators back and wish all of them a very successful term.  Whether we finish in November or May 2020 or whether we go on until 2021 is work for another day.  We are back and it is our job to work collectively to ensure that the public good is served in this House.  I assure Senators of my co-operation at all times in that regard.<br/><br/>Senator Clifford-Lee raised the issue of climate change.  To be fair, on one level a green tax should be examined.  The budget is coming up in two weeks' time and the Seanad will discuss it in due course. <br/><br/>I will not rise to the Senator's petty political comments regarding the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, whose record as a Minister in various Governments from 2000 to 2011, including as Minister for Health and Children, is well documented.  We can scrutinise that record at a later date if the Senator wishes.<br/><br/>Senators McDowell, Norris and Kieran O'Donnell raised the important issue of Lyric FM and its role.  In its considerations, RT&Eacute; must recognise that Lyric FM is a niche radio station which should be maintained.  I am surprised that the President has not commented on this already given that he was the Minister who sponsored the relevant legislation.</p></speech>

It is important that we recognise the importance of Lyric FM.  When RT&Eacute; was in a similar position in 1999, it closed RT&Eacute; local radio in Cork, which provided an important service to the people of Cork.  I join the Senators, as I hope other Senators will, in insisting that RT&Eacute; does not close Lyric FM and that it maintains regional broadcasting, including its presence in Fr. Mathew Street in Cork, but also in the context of Lyric FM and the service it provides.  RT&Eacute; should also consider what TG4 has done for the promulgation of the Irish language and its coverage of all things cultural.  By the same token, comments were made about pirate radio stations, which we all remember and listened to late into the night.  Many of those stations became local radio stations and many of the disc jockeys and presenters on them are now serving us very well on local radio.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will be happy to have the Minister, Deputy Madigan, come to the House to discuss RT&Eacute; and its management.</p><p>With regard to Senator McDowell's proposed amendment to the Order of Business, I propose, in keeping with my good humour this afternoon and my collegiality, that we allow Members 12 minutes each on Seanad reform and that we give the Minister 12 minutes in which to make an opening statement and ten minutes in which to reply.  I am very open to the idea of changing the time limits for Members' contributions.  Senator McDowell has made comments in this regard on a number of occasions at meetings of the Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I am open to the suggestion on examining speaking slots and speaking times.  Rather than dividing the House on a matter on which we have views in common, I ask the Senator to consider what I am saying.</p><p>Senators Conway-Walsh and Mulherin raised the issue of the beef industry.

I congratulate the ladies of Dublin on their victory.</p><p>Senators Feighan and O'Reilly raised a very important and sensitive matter, namely, the attack on Mr. Kevin Lunney.  All of us in this House, I am sure, join in the condemnation of the barbaric attack on a husband, father, community activist and decent person going about his business.  I also join the Senators in commending Mr. John McCartin on his courage last night on &quot;Claire Byrne Live&quot; for his articulation and the way in which he kept his dignity considering the provocation he has endured with his fellow directors in recent years.  The perpetrators of these crimes are of a community and they are known.  People have a duty to come forward and assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In due course, I will accede to Senator O'Reilly's request to have the Minister come to the House regarding the matter.</p><p>Senator Gallagher raised the issue of home care packages.  A related matter was raised by Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, namely, the healthcare workers.  We live in a society that is changing.  Our needs are changing and we are living longer.  We have a duty of care to senior citizens.  <i>The Irish Times</i>recently had a very interesting article referring to the re-institutionalisation of care.  The HSE is providing home care and home help supports worth &euro;176.5 million but it is important to recognise that there is a lot of work to be done, notwithstanding the amount of money and the number of home help hours being provided, which amount to over 7 million.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=09&amp;amp;day=24"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To be fair to Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell, she has raised the issue of healthcare workers and visas for them to enter the country.  It is an issue which we should pursue because there is a skills shortage and personnel deficit which needs to be addressed.  I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter in due course.<br/><br/>Senator Horkan raised the issue of insurance and the budget.  I am happy to have a debate on these in the coming weeks.  Senator Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell commended the publication of the Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Presidential Elections) Bill 2019.  As it becomes part of our discourse, we will have a discussion on the matter.  Next Tuesday evening, we will have a debate on Brexit with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney.<br/><br/>Senator Murnane O&rsquo;Connor raised the issue of the gender pay gap.  The 35% pay gap is too wide and needs to be addressed.  We must also recognise the importance of the value that women bring to society and the workforce, which I support.  Back in the 1980s, Doireann N&iacute; Bhriain and Marian Finucane hosted &ldquo;Women Today&rdquo;.  Nuala Fennell was appointed the first Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs.  I am not sure what the solution is other than we need to see the pensions committee set up by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, come back with a more comprehensive report.  I would be happy to have that debate in due course.<br/><br/>Senator Colm Burke raised the issue of school meals.  I have not seen the report in today&rsquo;s <i>Irish Examiner</i>.  I would be happy for the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to attend the House to discuss the Healthy Ireland programme which is promoting better eating.<br/><br/>Senator Paddy Burke raised the issue of the fishing leisure industry.  Issues such as the value of sterling and Brexit uncertainty are affecting the angling sector as many of our angling tourists are from the UK.  I am happy for the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, to come to the House to discuss the matter.<br/><br/>Mar fhocal scoir, I thank everyone involved in the Leinster House restoration project.  I wish everyone a prosperous term ahead.<br/><br/>If Senator McDowell will accept my proposal, I hope it will avert the need for a division on the Order of Business.</p></speech>

I have said at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that if one goes back to Senator W.B Yeats&rsquo;s speech about how we are no petty people, under our speaking rules, he would have got about a quarter of the way through it before he would have been told to sit down.  We should be slightly more generous to ourselves.</p> <p>The Attorney General has a right of audience in this House under Standing Order 56.  Perhaps he could exercise it in the circumstances.</p></speech>
