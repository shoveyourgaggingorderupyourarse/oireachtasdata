He is almost as familiar as I am with the subject matter we will deal with.  He opened the gardens of Killarney House, which are a tremendous asset, last year.  It is the St. Stephen's Green of Killarney.  A significant number of visitors have passed through the amenity.  The Minister of State is an annual visitor to Killarney.</p> <p>As the Minister of State has said, the investment in the house and gardens involves about &euro;8 million.  It is the foremost visitor attraction in Killarney and is capable of becoming the largest visitor attraction in the south.  Are we hiding our light under a bushel in not having the amenity open?  A year ago, the Minister of State and I thought the gardens would have reopened earlier this year, but that has not happened. </p> <p>It is the house of the Browne family, who were the Earls of Kenmare and very involved in the development of Killarney town over centuries.  Latterly, it has been the home of John McShane, the man who built the Pentagon and other famous buildings in Washington.  It is intended that it be the main visitor centre for Killarney National Park.  One can guess how important that is. </p> <p>The house has been involved in the development of the town over a long period of time.  It is one of the most, if not the most, valuable tourist asset in the south.  It has become a major attraction, but if the house is reopened it will become the main attraction in the south and south-west. </p> <p>I look forward to the comments of the Minister of State.  Mr. Pat Dawson, the regional manager for the area, and his staff are very good.  The Minister of State might refer to the governance and management that is in place.  I am sure his Department has sorted things out internally and is capable of doing good job.</p></speech>

The Killarney House project involves my Department, the Office of Public Works, as project managers for the construction, and F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  The Department first announced the project in 2011 with a budget of &euro;10 million.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has committed funding of &euro;5.2 million under its tourism capital investment programme and the balance is being funded by my Department.</p> <p>The National Tourism Development Authority&rsquo;s significant financial contribution to the project is a clear statement of its confidence that this project will make a significant contribution in the future to the south-west tourism offering. I am confident that the development will optimise the potential of Killarney House as a top class visitor and tourism centre.  It will do this in parallel to respecting its prime focus as a visitor centre for Killarney National Park and by developing its status as a heritage property managed by my Department. </p> <p>In 2016, it was decided to pursue the opening of Killarney House and Gardens on a phased basis.  The opening of the gardens occurred during 2016 and the completion of the historic rooms and the interpretative exhibition is being prioritised for 2017.  I recognise the significant interest at local level in opening the facility as soon as possible, and I assure the Senator my Department is working tirelessly to meet these deadlines.</p> <p>The house is being developed as the main visitor and interpretative centre for the national park, highlighting the beauty, richness and significance of the park&rsquo;s landscapes, habitats, flora and fauna as well as telling the story of human interaction with the park over the centuries.  Some of the formal rooms are currently being restored to their former glory.</p> <p>As the Senator knows, the original ornamental grounds and gardens immediately surrounding the House have been restored, creating spectacular landscaped areas that will merge into the natural areas of the park and provide vistas linking the town to the scenery of the mountain, woods and water.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The gardens were opened to much public acclaim in April 2016 and I formally opened them last August.</p><p>The visitor centre will have various aspects, including a newly built extension to the house.  It will be a visitor centre for the national park, explaining its significance and importance to the town and region, providing information on the major themes of the national park: mountains, woods, water and the human impact on the environment.  The final phase of building works to the house is now complete.  I intend to open the historical rooms element of the exhibition during the summer.  In this context, works in the restoration and refurbishment of the furniture collection for display are significantly advanced.  The exhibition phase of the project, to be located within Killarney House, is advancing and I expect the various elements of the works to be completed this year.  It is intended to open them to the public as soon as they are completed.</p><p>Visitors to Killarney usually stay in the town and visit other locations and attractions within the immediate area or the wider region.  The length of stay tends to be quite short and, in the case of bus tours, may be just one night.  Often a visit will be confined to Muckross House which focuses on cultural heritage and many tourists will leave Killarney unaware of the true extent and beauty of the national park that surrounds them.  When completed, Killarney House and gardens will explain the relevance and importance of Killarney National Park both from a cultural and a natural heritage point of view which will be to the benefit of tourists and local businesses.</p><p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to update him on what will no doubt prove to be one of the country's most significant assets from a cultural and a natural heritage perspective.</p></speech>

The significant line was: "I intend to open the historical rooms element of the exhibition during the summer."  I look forward to him doing so as early as possible in time for the main part of the season.  It seems, however, that there is a delay in opening the interpretative centre exhibition area for the national park.  The Minister of State will open the historical rooms and the rest will be opened on a phased basis.  Is there a problem, financial or otherwise?</p></speech>

I do not know whether the Minister of State can tell me anything about it, but it is a question that is on everybody's lips in the town of Killarney and among those connected with the tourism industry in the south west.  If the Minister of State can say a little about it and perhaps about management of the centre when it is opened, it would be appreciated.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte Ireland has provided &euro;5.2 million.  As I told the Senator previously in the House, I was Minister of State with responsibility for tourism when the decision was taken and believe it was the right one.  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is putting up the remaining funds.</p> <p>We agreed that we would open the centre on a phased basis.  We had a great day last year.  There was great community spirit when the gardens were opened.  Works to the house are now complete.  Works to the exhibition and historical rooms are taking a little longer.  We are putting pressure on the OPW to have them completed.  There is great interest in Killarney where people want to have the house open this summer.  I am putting pressure on the OPW to have it ready, with the exhibition rooms, if we can, but it is taking longer than expected to complete.</p> <p>There is no problem with funding.  My understanding is that &euro;10 million was the sum that was required.  Like every development that has ever taken place in the country, there may be a knock-on effect with people looking for more than they looked for at the beginning, but everything is being resolved.  I am confidence that the house will be opened and we are trying to have the exhibition and historical rooms opened as quickly as possible.  There may be some problems, but they are being dealt with.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1396" speakername="Robbie Gallagher" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#B01000"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire St&aacute;it go dt&iacute; an Teach.</p> <p>I refer to the provision of funding for two bridges in County Donegal, Tyrconnell Bridge in Donegal town and the nearby Fintra Bridge.  I acknowledge that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, met a delegation from Donegal municipal district at the end of February, for which I thank him.  Both bridges are in a poor state of repair and in need of immediate attention.  </p> <p>Tyrconnell Bridge is located in the centre of Donegal town.  It is an old railway bridge and its construction dates back to 1895.  It is vital in that it links one part of the town with the other.  Unfortunately, it is in a very dangerous state and deteriorating day by day.  Donegal County Council carried out a structural survey in 2000, at which point it reduced the load bearing capacity of the bridge to 7.5 tonnes.  Twelve years later, owing to ongoing concerns about the deteriorating construction of the bridge, another survey was conducted by the council, as a result of which the load bearing capacity was reduced to 3.5 tonnes.  It is probably the case that the construction of the bridge has got even worse since.  As I am sure the Minister of State can appreciate, trying to police vehicles traversing the bridge to ensure they are under 3.5 tonnes is a task in itself.  It is dangerous.  When the repairs are completed, there will be the normal load bearing capacity of approximately 40 tonnes.  The council has progressed the issue as far as it can from its own resources and is now seeking funding which could be spread over three years.</p> <p>Fintra Bridge provides a vital link between the towns of Killybegs, Kilcar, Carrick and Glencolmcille.  It is located on the Wild Atlantic Way and a vital piece of infrastructure.  It also provides a link with Slieve League, one of the country's premier tourist attractions which last year was visited by over 185,000 people, and with Glencolmcille Folk Park.  It is, therefore, of national significance.  It is, however, in a poor state or repair.  It is so narrow in parts that two vehicles cannot pass each other and numerous accidents have been recorded.  As a result, there are tailbacks which are a road traffic hazard and create their own dangers.  Using its own resources, Donegal County Council has advanced the project to the point where funding is needed to enable it to be put out to tender.</p> <p>For the two projects, a figure of &euro;2 million has been mentioned which, I understand, could be provided on a phased based over a three-year period.  These are two vital pieces of infrastructure, but, currently, they are hazards and a danger to the public.  The last thing we want to see happen is an accident on both.  I earnestly request the Department to seriously consider providing funding for both projects as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1334" speakername="Michael Ring" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#B01100"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, who answered an oral question on 22 March on the same issue.  I am happy to restate the position.</p> <p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, including bridges, in Donegal and other counties are the statutory responsibility of the local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Michael Ring:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1000"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1000&amp;amp;pid=MichaelRing&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Works on those roads are funded from the council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  Department officials and the Minister, Deputy Ross, met with a delegation from Donegal County Council on 27 February 2017 to discuss Fintra Bridge and Tyrconnell Bridge in Donegal.</p><p>Fintra Bridge is located on the R263 between Killybegs and Kilcar.  It is understood from Donegal County Council that the issue with this bridge is alignment related.  It is structurally sound but is restrictive in width and is located on a bend.  Part 8 planning approval is in place for a new bridge and associated realignment of approaches and the cost of this is likely to be in the region of &euro;1.5 million.  Given the challenging financial climate, the specific improvement grants scheme, under which this scheme would previously have been considered, has been curtailed in recent years in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work.</p><p>Tyrconnell Bridge is a four span steel bridge supported by cut stone piers spanning 29 m across the Eske River at Tyrconnell Street, Donegal town.  A number of structural reports were carried out on the bridge in 2000, 2008 and 2012.  A study in 2013 concluded that the bridge will continue to deteriorate and will result in the closure of the bridge in the coming years.  The council reported that a full-deck replacement is needed.  On 12 October 2016, Donegal County Council submitted its application to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for the 2017 bridge rehabilitation programme.  Tyrconnell Bridge was not among the bridges prioritised for funding in the 2017 application.  No application in respect of this bridge was received by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for either 2016 or for 2015.  Following the meeting with the council, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is awaiting further information from Donegal County Council in respect of both Tyrconnell and Fintra Bridges.

This is an issue which I, along with many other groups, have campaigned for over a number of years and which was recommended by the Constitutional Convention in 2013.  Too often in Ireland referenda have become debates about subject matters that have no relationship whatsoever to what the people are being asked to vote on.  It is very important that from the outset those of us advocating this change on behalf of Irish citizens living overseas do so armed with the facts, and use the opportunity to not only hold a national conversation about what place Irish citizens living abroad should have in our society, but also what the functions of the office of Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann exactly are.</p> <p>The President is a symbolic figure, but symbolism matters even more so for those citizens of this State who are Irish, who love this country and who want a meaningful place in our society even if they do not live within the territorial land mass that is governed by this State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Billy Lawless:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Immigrant voting has emerged as a global democratic norm.  While immigrant voting is not there yet, Ireland is relatively progressive in allowing immigrants the right to vote in local elections.  I recognise that an advance of the proposal for a referendum the Government needs to first decide which category of overseas citizens should have an entitlement to vote.  Other nations with very high levels of overseas citizens let their emigrants vote.  Of the top five nations in the OECD, by emigrant percentage, Ireland is the only one to disenfranchise its emigrant citizens.  New Zealand, Mexico, Portugal and Luxembourg all allow their emigrants to vote.  India, the nation with the largest absolute numbers of emigrants and a global leader in diaspora engagement is also in the process of enabling its emigrants to vote.  I welcome the options paper published earlier this month by the Government.  We will make our formal submissions in due course but I want to make the point to the Minister of State that this is a once in a generation opportunity.  I hope the Government objective is to enfranchise the highest number of citizens abroad possible, not to create further divisions through arbitrary controls such as criteria on the number of years living abroad.  We have to be bigger in our ambitions and not simply replace old barriers with new, albeit less restrictive ones.</p><p>I have great faith that citizens living in this State want to extend the franchise to their children, cousins and friends living overseas and give them a meaningful role as well as delivering a clear mandate to our next President, or at the very least the one after that, that he or she represents all Irish citizens at home or abroad.  The President will be as much their ambassador as ours which is something I truly believe Irish people living here would like to share in the recognition of.  What a celebration of modern Irish identity that would be - a nation of emigrants with a President who leads all of us and is elected by all of us.  I can think of not better way to remind the world that Ireland is a global nation.  Ireland is not exiting its relationship with its European partners.  We are not shutting down our borders but we are extending them.  I thank the Minister of State and look forward to debating these matters further.</p></speech>

Is ceist t&aacute;bhachtach &iacute;.</p> <p>I thank Senator Lawless for his own individual campaigning and as a representative of many groups down the years which have campaigned on this issue.  No doubt the Senator is in constant communication and liaison with them and he will pass on my message and the Government's message about our commitment to this issue.  </p> <p>The announcement by the Taoiseach at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia that a referendum will be held over whether Irish citizens resident outside of the State, including potential voters in Northern Ireland, should be allowed to vote in Presidential elections was a historic moment.  It recognises the importance that Ireland places on its relationship with all our citizens wherever they may be.  In times gone by, leaving Ireland meant a person severing their relationship with the State.  We now want to give Irish citizens where ever they may be a chance in choosing the person who represents Irish people at home and abroad.</p> <p>Many other countries give citizens resident outside the state a chance to vote in elections.  However, I acknowledge that in respect of our citizenship laws, Ireland has some unique features which make the policy considerations more complex here compared to other countries.  This is a timely development for Ireland given the ongoing and strong commitment of this Government and, indeed, successive Governments to deepening real engagement with our citizens who reside outside the State.  Ireland's diaspora policy, published in 2015, recognises the need to nurture and develop our unique and important relationship with our diaspora.  The issue of voting rights is of enormous importance to Irish citizens abroad who feel it is important that they have a say in electing the President who also represents them as Irish people living overseas.  We drew on the skills and support of our diaspora in recent times of economic crisis.  This initiative is a fitting recognition of the enormous contribution made by Irish people abroad historically and more recently to Ireland's recovery and development.  The Government's decision to hold this referendum is in line with the recommendation with the Convention on the Constitution in its fifth report.  Some 78% of its members were in favour of citizens outside the State having the right to vote in presidential elections.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, published an options paper which sets out how the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution might be realised.  That paper, prepared in conjunction with my Department, provides a detailed analysis of the legal, policy and practical implications of extending the franchise.  It shows the complexity of the issues but also that the various challenges which arise can be addressed with sufficient planning and resources.</p> <p>The options paper will inform public discourse on the proposal that will be put to the people at the referendum.  The upcoming Global Irish Civic Forum in May will further provide an opportunity to discuss the options paper with representatives of Irish communities abroad.  It is intended that this and wider public discussions will allow the Government to identify a preferred option to put to the people in a referendum.  As this House knows, I have had a strong and public personal commitment to extending voting rights to citizens abroad in Presidential elections.  I was pleased to be there with the Taoiseach at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia when he made the announcement.  I have seen the vibrancy of the Irish community during the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day parade and acknowledged the contribution of the Irish to the United States at the memorial to Commodore Barry and at Independence Hall.  I saw for myself the positive reaction from Irish emigrants and Irish Americans as the Taoiseach said there was "no more fitting time or no more fitting place."</p> <p>Article 2 of our Constitution requires us to cherish our special affinity with Irish people abroad.  I believe the Government&rsquo;s decision to hold a referendum on extending voting rights to Irish citizens abroad sends an important message to them on the value we place on them and their connection to Ireland.</p></speech>

I am disappointed we will not be able to hold a referendum before the next Presidential election.  When I mentioned this to our citizens abroad they were really delighted.  They were delighted also when I was appointed by the Taoiseach in that they felt they were being recognised at long last.  It is something of which all the parties are in favour, and of which the convention came out in favour.  However, we do not have a good record in referendums in this country.  I would impress on the Minister of State and the Taoiseach and all the Members of both Houses that when we have the referendum that everybody is fully behind it, and not half-heartedly.  It is a once-off opportunity and we are going to make it happen.  We owe it to our people abroad.</p> <p>Do not forget that even in the last five or six years, some 230,000 young people left Ireland.  There are about 500,000 parents of those people who want their sons and daughters to come back here.  I have brought this up with the Minister of State before and we have to make it easier for our citizens to return as this is their home and will always be.  We have to make it much easier, with things like drivers' licences, insurance and health care, that when they come back there is a welcome for them and that they feel like they are wanted back home.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his commitment.  We have to make sure that we really go at this wholeheartedly.</p></speech>

There will be opportunities in both the Seanad and the D&aacute;il prior to the referendum and proper, open and honest discourse, prior to the preferred option being chosen, will be important.  I know that Senator Lawless will be participating in the Civic Forum on 4 and 5 May.</p> <p>I want to make one point, which the Senator mentioned, about the symbolism of the office.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Joe McHugh:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2018"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2018&amp;amp;pid=JoeMcHugh&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are talking about votes for the diaspora in Presidential elections specifically.  I have seen the role of the office evolving over the last 20 years.  Look at the mark left by Mary Robinson and the imprint Mary McAleese left in the relationships with Northern Ireland and elsewhere and among our welfare organisations internationally.  Within 48 hours of getting this job as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, I was at a summit in Istanbul with President Higgins.  He was our President, but he was seen as an international voice; a voice of hope for a lot of people in humanitarian crises and development.  The international community looks to Ireland for leadership.  I have had a very positive insight into the symbolism of this role at both national and international levels and want to acknowledge the international role that President Higgins is playing.  When one sees African leaders giving the President of this country a standing ovation for his commitment, his words and his inspiration on the international stage, that is where Ireland is going and we should never forget that.</p></speech>

We are all concerned about the impact this will have on Ireland, especially the threat of a hard border.  Today it is easy to forget the problems our country faced before the Good Friday Agreement.  We take for granted free movement between North and South.  At only three Border crossing points, there are as many as 325,000 crossings per week.  In 2016 Ireland and the UK traded approximately &euro;39 billion in goods and services.  We are faced with a situation that could lead to job losses and have a massive impact on the economy at large.</p> <p>The Government has made some superficial moves to deal with Brexit, but mostly we have seen only rhetoric on the common travel area, preventing a hard border and protecting the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government has yet to appoint a Minister with responsibility for Brexit as Fianna F&aacute;il has advocated.  The Government seems to have completely ignored the impact Brexit will have on key sectors of the economy in which we trade most with the UK, for example, agriculture, food, engineering and manufacturing.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland the undisputed facts include we have had two Assembly elections in the past year, we have had parties refusing to serve in the Executive, and we have had Sinn F&eacute;in withdrawing from the Executive because of a refusal to establish an inquiry into cash for ash, which has actually been established.  Now, we have a standstill in the formation of the Assembly at the hour Prime Minister May is triggering Article 50, and at such an hour we need to be united.  We learned this morning a civil servant, David Sterling, has taken control of the Stormont Government budget in the absence of the establishment of an Executive.  All departments in the North, from health to education, may be affected by this action, as a civil servant's budget is a reduced budget.  This inaction by the leading parties in Northern Ireland is inexcusable.  We need to acknowledge the period of peace over the past two decades.  We need to work together to commit to continued peace in Northern Ireland.  Ultimately, we need to see a united approach to reducing the impact the triggering of a hard Brexit will have on our country and our island.</p> <p>Today is the sixth day of the bus strike and 2,600 employees have been on strike.  The Minister has gone to ground.  He will attend a committee hearing today to give us an update.  I understand he will not interfere in the bus strike and he will give some sort of acknowledgement there will be a review into transport services.  This is not enough.  We need to see action today.  Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann employees will support their colleagues at lunch time, which I support.  The Minister needs to take some action.  He cannot sit on the fence on every issue.  He needs to meet union members and sort out this crisis.  Traffic in the city is beginning to be massively affected and workers throughout the country are being discommoded because of his inaction.</p></speech>

Since the foundation of the State going back to the Geary case in Ennis in the 1920s, and a Fianna F&aacute;il Government in the early noughties compensated Mr. Geary for how he was hounded out of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is to be admired for it-----</p></speech>

In senior Garda management today there is somebody who knows what is going on and is afraid to speak.  I put out a call today and I hope the Leader will support me.  Whoever that person is, let the entire force not be tarred with a rotten brush.  Somebody knows what is going on and is afraid to speak.  It is just possible the Commissioner is under pressure from her management group and that she is not able to speak out.  If somebody there has something to say I am sure any Member of the House would be willing to meet him or her and assist with a protected disclosure.  We cannot allow this to go on indefinitely.  Hounding N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan out of office will not solve the problem at the end of the day.  There is something rotten and the ordinary garda&iacute; on the street need support at this point in time.

SIPTU and NBRU members will be outside the building today.  I hope that we can all go out and engage with them.  I would like to hear a clear call, particularly from the Fine Gael side, for the Minister to do more than just sit on his hands.  It is Fine Gael's Government.  As I stated yesterday, each day that it leaves these people out on strike is its responsibility.  It needs to stand up and be counted.  People know what needs to be done.  SIPTU has spelled out a means of resolving this dispute by establishing an employment regulation order, ERO, but I have not heard anyone in Fine Gael engaging on that point.  I invite them to engage and to do something constructive about the dispute.</p> <p>I wish to discuss community workers, who provide crucial support to many within our society - older people, people with disabilities, young people and vulnerable families.  Work is focused on areas such as providing child care, combating poverty, supporting those with mental health issues, human rights advocacy and family support.  The workers providing these vital services have endured years of cuts from the Fine Gael-Labour and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  That continues to this day.</p> <p>Matters have taken a dark turn.  A SIPTU delegation explained to us last week that, although a high-level forum had been established for the community sector, the civil servants are not engaging with the union and, worse, the Department of Social Welfare in particular is refusing to attend the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  I must be clear on this - that is unacceptable.  As a matter of urgency, will the Leader find out why his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, is refusing to attend the WRC?  If a Minister refuses to attend the industrial relations machinery of the State, what message does that send to rogue employers?</p></speech>

I asked how many similar cases there were and whether there were other cases in which the HSE, Tusla or the Garda had been made aware of sexual or physical abuse allegations against a foster parent but the child had not been removed from the home.  It is important that we know that no other children are living in homes against which abuse allegations have been made.</p><p>Today, I read in the <i>The Journal</i>that a woman was left in the care of a foster family for two years after allegations of sexual abuse were made against the foster father.  An intellectually disabled woman known as Mary was left with the family even though allegations were made in 2014.  Despite a decision being taken in September 2014 to remove Mary from the home, the order was not executed until February 2016.  However, because Mary was 18 years of age and deemed to be an adult, she was no longer in statutory care or under Tusla's remit.  How could this be allowed to happen?  How many other cases are there of children or vulnerable people who are still in foster care despite allegations of abuse being known to the authorities?  Are the cases of Grace and Mary just the tip of the iceberg?  We need to get assurances from the Minister to the effect that children in foster care are not in danger of being abused, that where allegations of abuse are known to one agency, this information is made known to other agencies with responsibility for the issue, and that action is taken immediately.</p></speech>

She will address the House of Commons on the issue within the next hour.  The Seanad's Brexit hearings are a welcome initiative, but we also need to consider raising the issue of Brexit in other debates in the House.  Yesterday, we in Labour published our detailed Brexit policy, outlining 20 concrete actions that the Irish Government should be taking.  We expressed our concern at the lack of detail from the Government regarding what it proposed to do as the Brexit negotiations got under way.  What positions will it take?</p><p>The Government needs to ensure that adequate money - &euro;1 billion from the rainy day fund - should be deployed for the capital investment likely to be needed as a result of Brexit.  A &euro;250 million Brexit trade adjustment fund should be set up to support directly Irish businesses that suffer because of trade upheaval with the UK.  New transport connections will be needed, in particular at major ports and airports.  Others have pointed to the instability in Northern Ireland.  The prospect of Brexit negotiations is not helping that situation.  A special status for Northern Ireland needs to be incorporated in the negotiations.  At a minimum, a new Irish protocol to the EU treaties recognising the common travel area, the Good Friday Agreement and the unique situation of the Irish Border must be negotiated.</p><p>There have been disturbing signals about what might happen because of Brexit.  In an article in today's <i>The Irish Times</i>, Ms Patricia King points out the downward pressure likely to be applied as a result of the UK no longer having to observe minimum terms and conditions of employment as set down in EU treaties.  The concern is that there will be a race to the bottom among Irish businesses.  Pressure will be placed on Ireland and other EU countries to reduce the quality of workers' terms and conditions.</p><p>On behalf of Labour, I express solidarity with the Bus &Eacute;ireann strikers, who will be protesting outside Leinster House today.  We have called for the Minister, Deputy Ross, to take a stand on this matter.  He has been absent, as others have stated.  He needs to be engaged on this and convene a stakeholders forum.  The Government must commit to increasing subvention for public transport to EU levels.  A sectoral employment order must be introduced for all transport workers in order to ensure the protection of their terms and conditions.  Given that this issue is crucial, will the Leader arrange for the Minister to attend the House to discuss it?</p><p>Like others, I am worried about the new executive order from US President Trump - not on immigration this time - reversing environmental protections, many of them put in place by former President Barack Obama, and thereby causing immense concern among environmental groups, NGOs and the UN that there will be a serious encroachment on international measures to prevent climate change.  It is a retrograde step by the US Government and we may need to debate it in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

There is a need to recruit 850 people to the Army.  There is a colourful exhibition and attendees get to hold the various machine guns and equipment that the Army uses.

Charges represent a major cost for many cancer patients at a time when they are going through physical and psychological stress, not to mention financial pressure.  The Irish Cancer Society is to be commended for its work on highlighting this matter through a campaign that encourages the HSE to have a national policy on the issue.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Robbie Gallagher:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2471"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2471&amp;amp;pid=RobbieGallagher&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The society called for free parking or subsidised parking.  Unfortunately, the campaign has fallen on deaf ears to date.  I appeal to the Leader to urge the Minister for Health to implement a national policy so that cancer patients undergoing hospital treatment can park free of charge or avail of subsidised parking.  Some cancer patients have spent up to &euro;16 per day just on parking charges, which is unfair on them while they are under the pressures that I have outlined.  I appeal to the Minister to instruct the HSE to adopt a national policy to tackle this issue.</p></speech>

The funding is welcome.  As much as &euro;226 million will be spent on the critical roll-out provision of essential infrastructure for the development of new homes.</p> <p>The scheme will cover 34 sites and 15 councils.  I would like to ask the Minister why the scheme will only be rolled out to 15 councils.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister to come in here to answer my question.  There are 31 local authorities yet funding has only been allocated to 15 of them.  I am open to correction but I think 22 councils applied for the funding.  </p> <p>Both Galway city or county local authorities applied for critical infrastructure funding for social housing, private housing and affordable housing.  I am disappointed, following yesterday's announcement, to learn that neither authority received funding.  The scheme will cover 34 sites around the country and will produce 70,000 new homes.  There is a 10% gain for social and affordable housing, which is a plus.  The scheme will lead to a win-win situation.  I want to acknowledge the work done by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Government.  I thank them for funding this scheme, which forms part of the Rebuilding Ireland initiative.  </p> <p>I suggest to the Leader that it would be appropriate for us to invite the Minister to the Chamber to explain the rationale behind the scheme and to keep us up to speed on what is, perhaps, one of the single biggest problems facing everyone at the moment.  I am referring to access to a home be it social housing, affordable housing and to purchase a house at a reasonable and fair price.  I acknowledge yesterday's good news story.  I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to come to this Chamber in the next few weeks to tease out how the scheme will be rolled out.</p></speech>

I ask that the Leader communicates with the Minister for Social Protection and his officials and ensures that every effort is made to get the website, <i>welfare.ie</i>, up and running.  People have had to resort to using the Citizens Information's excellent website called <i>citizensinformation.ie</i>for all of their queries.</p><p>Senator Boyhan mentioned the activation fund.  Two worthwhile projects in Limerick will receive &euro;15 million.  Housing is a huge issue but Greenpark racecourse and Mungret College in Limerick will receive funding to build distributor roads to ensure lands can be developed for housing.  Affordable starter homes must be a key element.  If the State is stepping in to assist by providing the infrastructure to enable houses to be built then it must ensure that the people contracted to build these houses provide affordable starter homes.</p></speech>

Many of us have not looked forward to this event.  We have anticipated and waited for it because we want to hear about the proactive response this Government will make to the move made by the British Government.</p> <p>I do not need to tell anyone that Brexit presents a very dangerous situation for Ireland, both North and South.  Brexit actively undermines and usurps the integrity and the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, which was overwhelmingly voted for by the electorate in this State and, indeed, in the North.  Last February, a D&aacute;il motion was passed that called on the Irish Government to make a case for special designated status.  That is the most responsible and logical position, alongside other necessary positions, that the Irish Government can adopt not just to protect the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement and the democratic expression in this State but also for the economic, social and cultural well-being of this island. </p> <p>The Leader will know that the Tories have no mandate in Ireland either for Brexit or other policies of theirs.  The Taoiseach has received the clearly expressed mandate from the people in the North, and on this island, that we want to remain in the EU.  In the immediacy of the period that we are now in, which is against our will, it is critical that we hear from the Taoiseach.  I appreciate his earlier stance but we no longer wish to hear aspirational intentions and what the Government hopes to achieve.  We must now hear the practical steps the Government will take to negotiate the best deal.  The best way for the Taoiseach to do so, and I offer him my sincere suggestion, is for him to work with all of the parties.  We are all unified in seeking to have Ireland's national interests defended.  Therefore, we all want the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement to remain sacrosanct.  We do not want a return to a hard border and we want Ireland's interests defended.  We need to hear about these matters from the Taoiseach as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Leanann an obair go st&oacute;ch&uacute;il agus D&eacute; Domhnaigh seo caite tugadh isteach corp Captain Mark Duffy.</p><p>The dignity with which Captain Mark Duffy, from Rescue 116, was borne ashore on Sunday last is something that will stay with me forever.  He gave his life so that others might live.  Along with his colleagues, he was a hero and somebody to hold up as a role model to our children.  Heroes do not arrive out of nowhere.  They are the embodiment of their family and often their communities.  Captain Mark Duffy will be laid to rest tomorrow in his home village of Blackrock in County Louth.  It is striking that his funeral notice reads: &quot;Mark's wish would be for you to carry an organ donor card.&quot;  It is very fitting that this notice by the Duffy family comes just at the start of Organ Donor Awareness Week that has been organised by the Irish Kidney Association.  Many people here in the Seanad have done great work to promote the importance of organ donation, including my colleague, Senator Mark Daly.  Approximately 700 people in Ireland await life-saving heart, lung, liver, kidney and pancreas transplants.  Thanks to the gift of organ donation over 3,000 people in Ireland enjoy an extended life.  Just like the thousands rescued by the Irish Coast Guard, they too have been rescued and given a new lease of life.  </p><p>While the focus of Organ Donor Awareness Week is to raise awareness, I was heartened to hear what the Minister for Health said yesterday.  He said:</p><blockquote>[He has prioritised] the development of legislation to provide for an opt-out system of consent for organ donation.  My Department is currently working on this in the context of the work required to develop an overarching human tissue policy and legislative framework.</blockquote> <p>He also said that he intends to bring a memorandum to Government shortly on this matter.  I urge the Leader and his Government colleagues to keep the pressure on so that this can happen as it will save lives.</p></speech>

That fact does not surprise me.  The first time it happened was in the D&aacute;il in the 1920s when Austin Stack and others made unjust remarks about District Inspector Kearney who was due to be made the Commissioner of the newly-formed Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2014"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2014&amp;amp;pid=FrankFeighan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Why I am interested in disrespect of Kearney is that he was the man who arrested Roger Casement.  He was the man who left the door open for Austin Stack, and many others, to release Roger Casement.  It was at their ineptitude that they made these scurrilous remarks.  District Inspector Kearney moved to Boyle and saved my grandfather's life from a Black and Tan assassination squad.  Those allegations were made and he and his family had to high-tail it to London because of the remarks made in this Oireachtas by Austin Stack and many others.  </p><p>I have now seen the way Alan Shatter was treated.  I have seen many Garda Commissioners.  My grandfather was one of the first garda in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na stood for this State and defended it and I will have no truck, as a politician, with other politicians using parliamentary privilege to make comments about the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If it is true, make the comment.  There is a frenzy out there.  We need to reflect that, sometimes, if we make remarks in the Chamber, we do a disservice to men and women, and to the Garda reputation.  Perhaps we should draw the line at the men who held the line in setting up, and saving, the State.  If it is true, then say it, but Alan Shatter did not get many apologies from the press or from Members of the Oireachtas.  I think we should be strong enough and mature enough, if we make a mistake, to say that we made a mistake on the record of the D&aacute;il or the Seanad.</p></speech>

I would like to put on the record that since last week it has reversed that decision and realised that it was a negative move.  I would like to congratulate it for reversing that so quickly.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Skills to the House to discuss the issue of discalculia, which is the maths form of dyslexia and which can be really debilitating for anybody who suffers from it.  I have personal understanding of the suffering that is involved in trying to access third level education.  Currently Trinity College Dublin is, I believe, the only college offering a maths waiver.  The problem is, if a person accepts this maths waiver, they drop maths from the leaving certificate.  That is a positive for someone that has this disability, but the problem is that if a person drops maths from the leaving certificate the other institutes of higher education, HEIs, do not operate the same waiver system, so if that person has applied to other universities on the CAO and they drop maths, they will not get into any other university and their only option is Trinity.  That is something we need to look at.  </p> <p>We have moved really far in the area of dyslexia but we have not moved very far in recognising the disability of discalculia.  This is something that we need to discuss with the Minister.  He has outlined many areas on which he wants to work in respect of numeracy but unless we address disability attached to numeracy, we cannot address numeracy as a whole.</p></speech>

The first issue is that of Jadotville.  As the Leader knows, a motion, signed by the majority of Senators, is ready to be submitted that deals with the injustice that the Jadotville veterans and their families have faced for all these years.  It calls for a medal ceremony in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;n to recognise the scale of the injustice that they have suffered.  I know he has raised it already, but I ask the Leader to raise it with the Minister and his Department officials again.  I want to avoid submitting a motion and dividing this House, though I will if necessary.  It is important that we unite together and address this issue in a dignified manner.  I ask the Leader again to raise this.  If necessary myself and Senator Craughwell, who co-sponsored the motion at the outset, would be happy to meet with the Leader and the Minister to try to resolve this issue.</p> <p>The second issue has been raised with me by members of the fire services and was news to me.  I knew that members of the Defence Forces were presented with 1916 commemorative medals last year to mark the centenary.  I am led to believe that all members of the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the National Ambulance Service were presented with commemorative medals last year.  The only front-line emergency service that were not is, apparently, the fire services.  Clearly this would be a very serious omission.  The firemen who have raised this with me are understandably aggrieved as to what has happened.  I assume it is because of the structure of the fire services under the management of local authorities but I ask the Leader to raise that with the relevant Minister, who I assume is the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to address this anomaly and to ask her to, even now, belatedly ensure that they are presented with a medal to mark that commemorative year.  It would be important.</p></speech>

In my view, what has emerged is disgraceful.  A systematic pattern of cover-up, procrastination, deception and facade-keeping has characterised the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>The issues with the fixed charge penalty point system have been known for a considerable period of time.  The people who knew about it did nothing about it until it came into the public domain.  To say that they instituted an audit within the force to examine it is wholly unacceptable.  When it is found out that there is a problem, the Minister is told.  There is a really big problem here.  It looks to be in the region of 10,000 to 15,000 miscarriages of justice.  We are on the ball now.  We are going to do something about it.</p> <p>This same applies to the mandatory alcohol tests.  The problem was known about.  Even Gay Byrne signalled the alarm on the basis of a former Garda reservist who had resigned in disgust on the basis of a letter sent to him two years ago.  Nothing was done about it thought there were signals everywhere.  </p> <p>The third point I want to make is that we do not need a Patten Commission or a root and branch reform of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na based on some lengthy process.  We need action now.  We need the Minister with responsibility, that is the T&aacute;naiste, to institute the changes that are necessary in a matter of weeks.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to be led by somebody who the force has faith and confidence in and who the public has faith and confidence in.  That situation does not exist now.</p> <p>There is an idea that we can kick the can down the road and that we can have another major inquiry, which might take two years.  How long did the Patten Commission take for that matter?  We cannot wait.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must be reformed now.  There is one person who has ministerial responsibility under the Ministers and Secretaries Act to ensure that reform starts now and that is the T&aacute;naiste.  She must put in place a leader of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who commands public respect now.  Not later, now.</p></speech>

The &euro;200 million that has been announced will, it is hoped, open up 32 sites for housing, which will be very important for the housing strategy.  There is a local dimension to that.  There are moneys for roads in Cork, but they are very positive and it is a very positive project.  There were independent audits regarding which projects got the go-ahead.  The independent factor is very important and should be duly noted.</p> <p>One of the key issues I would like to raise here is in regard to Garda vetting and where we are going with that programme.  I note from the newspapers that there are 721 teachers who have still not been vetted and that there is work ongoing towards a resolution of that process at the moment.  The entire way we carry out Garda vetting has to be looked at.  A person could be vetted four or five times regarding different institutions or organisations they are involved in.  That is inappropriate.  There should be one vetting and then a person should be on the list.  That should be the routine.  </p> <p>I came across an issue in the last few weeks where an under-21 team in a GAA club had minors, that is 17 year-olds, on a team.  Given that they were under 18 years of age, they were informed that the rest of the team would have to be vetted because they are in the same dressing room.  There has to be logic in this.  Someone has to say that Garda vetting is important, but that it makes no sense that there is a need to vet all the 21 year-olds because there is a 17 year-old in a dressing room.  Work needs to be done here.  A complete reform of the system is required.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That needs to happen in order that something can be done speedily about this issue.</p></speech>

Members of the various unions involved in this strike will protest outside the House later while the Minister addresses the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport.  He should not only address the committee; he should address the unions and the company.  While acknowledging that the company is loss making in its present guise and that the workers have a right to strike to protect the rights they have earned over many decades, more than 100,000 people, mainly in rural Ireland, depend on bus services, which are a vital part of the infrastructure of rural Ireland, and they are the real victims of this strike.  This is day six.  How many more days are workers going to have to endure the picket line?  How many days will ordinary commuters, who depend on the bus company to get to and from various locations throughout this island, have to wait because eventually this will have to be sorted?  There are those who say the bus company is waiting until it is such a dire financial position that it has to go into examinership.  If that is the motivation behind what the management are at, that is disgraceful and a stop needs to put to that immediately.  I call on the Leader to use his good offices to impress on the Minister, who has an opinion on every Department except his own, to intervene in this dispute before it gets too desperate for the workers, the company and the more than 100,000 people who depend on bus services to go about their daily business.</p> <p>Yesterday, Senator McDowell raised the issue of judicial appointments.  The former Minister has a great opinion on this.  I endorse everything he said in that regard.  The Judiciary has served us well since the foundation of the State.  It is a function of whichever Government is in power to appoint judges and there is a system in place to vet those who apply to become judges before the nominations are put before the Minister and the Cabinet for appointment.  While the process should be left as it is, I would like the Leader to impress on the Minister for Justice and Equality the important point made by the director general of the Law Society.  He said that since it became possible for solicitors, who comprise 80% of the practising legal profession, to become judges of the superior courts, less than 8% of appointments have gone to them.  That needs to be addressed.  Senator McDowell used the word "excellence".  There is excellence among that 80% and they should be given credit for that.</p></speech>

The Cabinet discussed the Mary case yesterday and the horrific abuses wrought on young women.</p> <p>The latest revelations regarding Garda misuse of funds and tax avoidance seem like they are part of tsunami of allegations, abuses and criminal activity all rolled into one and it has been going for a long time.  When Martin Callinan was dismissed a number of years ago, we all thought an external appointment was needed in order that there would be someone with a new broom and an independent eye to oversee the running of the keepers of the peace in our society.  That did not happen but there have been more revelations about phantom breath tests, phantom checkpoints and tax avoidance.  N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan needs to step down and Sinn F&eacute;in has asked for that.  She needs to take responsibility for the good of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and allow an external investigation and an external appointment to the Commissioner position.  The force is in need of a root and branch overhaul and cultural reform.  These scandals are bigger than individuals and the reform must happen now.  I have spoken to garda&iacute; on the beat in my locality of Rialto and Kilmainham and they are absolutely despondent.  They are embarrassed and the embarrassments are piling up.  They are more disrespected and more prone to ridicule and many of them do not want to turn up for work.  We have always prided ourselves in this country on our honest and integrity but we are no longer the island of saints and scholars.  There are far too many somethings rotten in this State and we need a clean sweep with integrity at the heart of what we do.</p></speech>

The upgrade is vital because a ranking hockey match has not been played in the national hockey stadium since 2015.  I call on the Leader to raise this with the Ministers for Education and Skills and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Ireland has had huge success in this realm in recent years with the men's team qualifying for the Rio Olympics.  The fact that our national hockey stadium is no longer certified to host international hockey matches is an absolute disgrace and this stand-off has to be resolved as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The GAA does so much good in the country and it is part of the social fabric that makes Ireland unique.  I am surprised by a diktat issued by GAA headquarters in recent weeks.  They wrote to county boards and asked them to reduce the minute's silence to 20 seconds silence.  It is one of the most bizarre requests I have heard of in quite a while.  The GAA is very much a roots up operation as opposed to a branch down operation and I was disappointed to hear about this coming from headquarters.  I was delighted that when this proposal came before the delegates of the Westmeath County Board, there were strong voices in opposition.  Billy Foley and others told those in the higher echelons that Westmeath would not carry out this diktat.  A minute's silence does not happen too often.  Those who have played for the county or have been heavily associated with the county set up are acknowledged with a minute's silence before a game if they died recently.  It is the very least we could do for people who have borne colours for the GAA, filled cars with kids, marked pitches and travelled the length and breadth of the country to facilitate games for nothing.  It is a poor day if we cannot even given them one minute to say, "Farewell".</p></speech>

During the Celtic tiger era, the majority of these parks were set up for manufacturing industries or offices and not for retail outlets.  They have had a huge effect on town centres.  A legal challenge has been taken in my county relating to why retail units were allowed into the business parks.

There has been debate about the lack of trust but one issue that has not been highlighted is that there will now be a difficulty accepting the evidence of garda&iacute; in courts.  It is important to resolve the Garda's current difficulties at a very early stage, in particular, where judges accepted the evidence of garda&iacute; that the fixed charge notice had been served and there is now clear evidence that it had not been.  A number of legal colleagues were on to me over the weekend about cases in which people went into the witness box and gave evidence under oath that they had not received the fixed charge notice.  The doubt was created but they had to go through all of that and it is an issue we need to address.  We need to build that trust not only in the Garda, but in the garda&iacute; presenting their evidence in court.</p> <p>I join my colleague, Senator Lombard, in thanking the Minister, Deputy Coveney, for the announcement yesterday that a major infrastructural development will take place to assist the building of new houses.  In my area of Cork North-Central, over &euro;30 million has been allocated which will enable more than 1,600 houses to be built.  It is a welcome development which could yield over 3,600 houses in the long term.  It is important that the infrastructure is put in place to fast track all the requirements for housing and that there are no further delays outside the planning issue.  Once planning permission was granted, there was always a delay in trying to put in the infrastructure.  It is important it is now done.  I welcome the announcement that was made in the past number of days.  It is important that all local authorities around the country identify projects that can assist the building of new houses.  It is the biggest expense people have in their lives and, therefore, the State must do everything possible to make it affordable for people.  The important part about the development is to make sure we have all the necessary infrastructure such as roads, water and sewage systems.  I welcome the development and the need for it to be fast tracked.</p></speech>

No conversation about tobacco is complete without mentioning the 700,000 people who die unnecessarily across Europe every year because of this product - 6,000 of those people are in this country.  It causes misery for tens of thousands of others who suffer with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancers and various other ailments that would be utterly avoidable if they did not smoke.  Plain packaging is a major initiative and one that is very important.  It does one of the most important things we can do, which is protecting children from ever taking up smoking.  Children are not stupid.  The Irish Cancer Society did a little survey where they showed children the current cigarette packets which they thought were nice and lovely to play with and they wanted them.  They were then shown the plain packs and they recoiled in horror.  Who would ever want to smoke?  This measure will save tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of lives in the future.  It will save the State a huge amount of money, some &euro;10 billion annually, that we spend on health and as a result of lost productivity.  This is a great day for children and for all smokers because these packs will remind them of the damage they are doing to themselves.  The House will agree we are all trying to support smokers to stop smoking.  We are not anti-smoker, rather we are anti-smoking.</p></speech>

Members may recall that I raised certain questions last week about wages and conditions in this House.  As a trade unionist, it is perfectly legitimate to do so.  I will add one final thing to show how utterly ludicrous the notion of making us fob in is - a majority of Fine Gael Members in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann do not fob in.  They are Ministers so they do not have to do so.  A majority of the Government party is not fobbing in.

Senator Gavan is saying we should get rid of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is the Sinn F&eacute;in policy.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to get rid of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  That is fair enough.  I posed the question to the Members opposite.  Let me make it quite clear that the Taoiseach, as the head of the Government, is leading a whole-of-Government approach to Brexit.  I agree with Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile that we must be united as a country, North and South, in our approach to Brexit.  It is one of the most important decisions that will face our country for a generation.  Its impact is profound.  I reassure Senator Ardagh and others that the Government is under no illusions about the task ahead.  I agree with Senator Bacik that perhaps the Seanad, notwithstanding the good work that has been started by the Seanad Brexit committee, should have a debate in the House.  I would be happy to have it but it is important to dovetail with the Seanad Brexit committee.  I am happy to have that debate here.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be here tomorrow for statements on the North.  The Government is committed to protecting and advancing Ireland's cause across Europe.  Nobody wants the return of a hard Border.  As the Taoiseach says, nobody wants to see the creation of a new border in the future.  The Government will defend the Good Friday Agreement as we have always done.  We are working with Mr. Juncker and Mr. Tusk and if one reads their recent comments, one cannot but be heartened by the importance Ireland has been given in their remarks.  The position paper will be published by Government before 29 April.  We will have a very strong case across Europe but it requires the support of all parties.  I commend the Labour Party on its position paper.  Deputy Donnelly is Fianna F&aacute;il's newly created spokesman on Brexit.  I am sure we will all work together to ensure Ireland has a united voice.  We should all wear the green jersey.  We should not put naked political partisanship up the pole but should all stand to fight for Ireland.</p> <p>Senators Ardagh, Gavan, Bacik and Wilson raised the issue of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  I reiterate the remarks I made yesterday.  Nobody is winning in this dispute.  Nobody wants to see an all-out ballot of any union - in this case the bus workers - or of Dublin Bus or Irish Rail.  It is in no one's interest.  As Members have said, it is not in the interest of the workers, the company or the travelling public.  There is an absolute certainty here.

Funding was increased in the past two budgets and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is examining the provision of funding for the free travel scheme.  From my reading of it, the core of the issue is efficiency.  Such issues are best resolved at the WRC.  Everybody wants the dispute to be resolved.  I agree with Senator Diarmuid Wilson in that I do not want management in Bus &Eacute;ireann to keep the dispute going to the point where a solution cannot be found.  I appeal to it to be the first, if necessary, to accept the need for talks and re-engage.  The pillorying of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, will not solve the problem.  He might be a very handy-----</p></speech>

Craughwell, Frank Feighan, Michael McDowell, M&aacute;ire Devine and Colm Burke referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government is committed to resolving the matter and an independent review is to be carried out.  I agree with Senator Michael McDowell that it is about governance and that the issue must be rectified immediately.  It amuses me when I hear Members of both Houses, in particular, Fianna F&aacute;il Members who were in government for 14 years in a row and appointed many of those in management in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, look for a head to roll.  The removal of the Garda Commissioner in itself would not lead to the cultural change and reform needed.  Let us not race to the bottom in politics to get someone sacked.  The substantive issue is the way in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is operated and how it is viewed by the public.  The challenge presented by the change of culture and regime requires serious political consideration and debate.  We all need action in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is awful and nauseating in waking up every morning and listening to "Morning Ireland", or whatever programme one listens to, to hear a new story emerge about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which does nothing for the morale of rank and file garda&iacute; who are doing the very best they can.  As the party that founded An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which has always held it in respect and that stood up for law and order when others did not, we will stand by it and see a new force emerge.  We need a Patten-type report.  I agree with Senator Michael McDowell that it should not take two years, but we need to see reform which must happen now.  I am very committed, as are the Minister for Justice and Equality and members of my party, to standing by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and bringing about regime change.  There is a need for a regularisation of affairs with the Revenue Commissioners and significant reform.  It was the Fine Gael Party in government with the Labour Party that changed the appointment method for Garda Commissioners and promotions to other senior positions.  Let us be clear: it was not the parties opposite but my party that changed the regime.  What we must also do is restore public trust and confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which, regrettably, are at an all-time low.  I am a member of a number of policing fora in Cork city and county and pose the question to myself every time I attend a meeting as to whether the statistics read out are correct.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must re-establish the trust and confidence of the public, an gn&aacute;th dhuine.  There is a need for a forensic review of operations to put in place a new An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We should all look at the Garda Inspectorate's report, Changing Policing in Ireland, which contains some very good information and which will result in action.</p> <p>Senator Paul Gavan referred to community workers and the Minister involved attending the WRC.  I am not aware of the matter.  If the Senator wishes to send me an e-mail, I will be happy to take up the issue with the Minister.</p> <p>Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Frances Black raised the cases of Grace and Mary.  Senator M&aacute;ire Devine also touched on the issue.  It is important that there be accountability and transparency in the protocols between Tusla and the HSE for persons in care and those involved in fostering because it is a specialised area in which so much joy, relief and comfort are brought to people.  However, there is an issue that must be addressed and I will be happy to have the relevant Minister come to the House to discuss it.</p> <p>Senator Ivana Bacik referred to President Trump's new executive order.  It is absolutely baffling to have a President reverse the environment policies of President Obama because, as the Senator rightly said, the issues of global warming and climate change are very important.</p></speech>

We were due to have a debate on them in the House prior to St. Patrick's Day.  I hope we will have it soon.</p> <p>Senator Robbie Gallagher raised the issue of car parking charges for cancer patients.  I know that there is a protocol in some hospitals whereby cancer patients and their families are given a derogation.  I hope it can be applied universally across the country.  I will be happy to talk to the Senator about the matter.</p> <p>Senators Victor Boyhan, Colm Burke and Tim Lombard mentioned the very good news yesterday about funding for and investment in local authority housing.  I cannot indicate why councils in Galway and one other county, the name of which I cannot remember, have not yet received funding.  A total of 34 sites have been unlocked, while 15 councils have been allocated funding to the tune of &euro;226 million to be invested in infrastructure.  It is a good news story.</p> <p>Senator Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill indicated that the website of the Department of Social Protection was down.  I will be happy to ask the Minister to address the matter.</p> <p>Senator Keith Swanick raised the issue that was raised yesterday by Senator M&aacute;ire Devine about organ donation.  I join him in hoping the very fine report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children will be implemented and that we will have a soft opt-out system.  I will not get into a debate with him on the role of certain people in helping the cause of organ donation, but what we must do is ensure that we collectively change the policy in order that more people will assist in organ donation.</p> <p>I congratulate Senators Lynn Ruane and John Dolan on the reversal of the decision on DIT access students.  The issue of discalculia and the waiver for maths is important.  In the short term perhaps Senator Lynn Ruane might table a Commencement matter to which the Minister for Education and Skills would come to the House to respond.  I accept that it is an issue that must be addressed.</p> <p>As Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn is aware, I am endeavouring to broker an agreed motion on those who were involved at Jadotville.  I agree with him that it is a motion that requires the support of all of us to give the members of the Defence Forces who were involved justice at some level.  I know that what is being sought is not much in terms of change and the Senator and I are on common ground in that regard.  I am trying to make progress on the issue.  To be fair to the Minister of State, he is very amenable but work remains to be done.  I am happy to work with the Senator on the issue.  As regards front-line service personnel, I am surprised by what the Senator said that fire brigade personnel do not receive commemorative medals, given that other first-line responders do.  Perhaps we might raise the issue as part of our discussion with the Minister of State.  The current arrangement does not make sense to me.</p> <p>Senator Tim Lombard raised the issue of Garda vetting.  The Minister for Justice and Equality was in the House last week to respond to a Commencement matter on the issue.  It is important that we address it.  It is an area in which improvements have been seen, but we must ensure transparency and uniformity of approach.</p> <p>Senator Diarmuid Wilson also raised the issue of judicial appointments.  I reiterate what I said yesterday, that we all recognise the importance of having an independent judiciary.  We accept the excellence of the Judiciary in the work it does and the role it plays.  I will be happy to have the Minister for Justice and Equality come to the House to discuss the issue in the context of the judicial appointments Bill.</p> <p>Senator M&aacute;ire Devine referred to children in care.  She raised the issue of access to HSE disability services in the context of the memo to the Government yesterday.  We all accept that it is an important step.  We are aware of what was said in the debate yesterday on the health Bill about free GP care.  We have some distance to travel in the provision of disability services and I hope the Government will be able to put together a package in that regard.</p> <p>Senator Neale Richmond referred to the stand-off between the Irish Hockey Association and Belfield.  I have seen the new national hockey stadium at Belfield.  It beggars belief the last game played there was in 2015, given the investment made in what is a fine stadium.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There was a world cup there in 2014.</p></speech>

I was in P&aacute;irc U&iacute; Rinn last Sunday at the Cork-Tipperary game and to the best of my knowledge, a minute's silence for the late Michael Maher and Tony O'Mahony, two fine former officers of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael at Munster and Cork levels, was held.  I agree, however, as a member of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael on the question of the minute's silence being reduced.  It is important we acknowledge and pay tribute to the work of volunteers and players.  Senator Feighan said the FAI had a round of applause, which is a nice way of acknowledging the role of deceased persons.</p></speech>

He raises a very good point because many businesses have moved to the periphery of our major towns.  Retailers in the towns are competing with these business parks as well as with online shopping, and parking is also an issue.  There is a need for a common-sense approach to planning and I encourage him to set up a cross-party delegation with the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Reilly raised the issue of plain packaging.  I commend the respective Ministers, Deputies Corcoran Kennedy and Harris, on signing the Bill, which was passed in the previous Oireachtas, into law today.  It was commenced under the leadership of Senator Reilly as Minister for Health and he deserves credit and our congratulations for the role he played in standing up to big tobacco and for taking to fight across Europe.</p></speech>

In city and county councils members attend 80% of the time and that may be the way to proceed, though how we would work it out is  a different matter.

Unless Senators or the Minister have any additional contributions to make on these amendments, I will put the question on amendment No. 1h.  On the last day there were Second Stage speeches and a total rehash of the same thing.  We are not making any progress on any side and I am trying to be sensible.

People who live on canals and local authorities which administer them should be made aware of any canal closures.  This amendment will ensure that happens.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1m is also crucial as it sets sensible limits on the rate of increase of the costs of permits and licences.  It will ensure that all cost increases must be appropriate to the intended use and linked to the rate of inflation in the economy.  The incremental increases in costs are also vital to ensure that houseboat owners are not put into precarious positions regarding the cost of maintaining their homes. </p> <p>Amendment No. a1w is also crucial, as it speaks to the issue of fixed payment notices that we will debate more fully as we progress through the Bill.  I do not think it is appropriate that Waterways Ireland should be able to issue fixed payment notices without any formal appeals process and this amendment will delete the ability of Waterways Ireland to do this.  It works in conjunction with the more extensive amendments we have tabled relating to fixed payments notices, which will be taken later.</p></speech>

Something we have hardly mentioned is the question of moths and butterflies.  There has been no screening or report to the House on the impact of this proposed legislation on them.  I would welcome a screening, but there is not much point in having a screening unless it is published and made available to those with concern about this area.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some 27 out of the 35 butterfly species breed on hedgerows and hedge banks.  Of the common hedgerow plants, a total of 115 moth species breed on willow, 62 moss species breed on common hawthorn, which is also known as the whitethorn plant, 49 moth species breed on common blackthorn and 46 moth species breed on common hazel.  It is important that we take into account the impact on these often neglected species of insects.</p><p>Roadside hedges, in particular, for example, because of the traffic that is passing and the fumes of the cars, are often warmer than internal hedges and that means they provide better quality breeding grounds than internal hedges for butterfly and moth larva which need warmth to develop.  Roadside hedges are beyond the range of chemicals used in agriculture, also making them more suitable.</p><p>Upland areas often hold populations of more specialised rarer butterflies, such as the legally protected marsh fritillary butterfly.  The sociable caterpillars of this butterfly emerge from hibernation in late February-early March feeding on grassland containing its food plant.  Burning destroys this species by burning the larva.</p><p>These are the kind of issues that need to be considered in any screening and assessment and it is important that not only are these screenings carried out, but that they should be published.  For that reason, I am happy to strongly support the amendment in the name of Senator Kevin Humphreys.</p></speech>

We do not want to see by-laws published where there is a 90 period and there is information missing.  We would expect that if Waterways Ireland is publishing by-laws, it would have already ensured that all of the necessary screenings and checks are taking place.  We certainly should not be relying on members of the public to express concern, to ask for a review or to ask that these obligations would be met because in many cases it will not be feasible within a 90 day period to get the necessary information.  It is a practical amendment.  If the Minister, for example, indicated that she wanted to include it anyway, I am sure we might not even need to press it.  We will have the opportunity to see if that is the case.  That would be useful.</p> <p>I recognise my colleague has a similar amendment in respect of birds.  This may be an area where the Minister can indicate that she would plan to ensure that this is a necessary prerequisite on Waterways Ireland before it brings a proposal to the public and opens a 90 day period for consultation.  I recognise and appreciate that the Minister indicated she is open to that 90 day period rather than the previously proposed 21 day period.  It is an improvement.</p> <p>I will not speak to all of the amendments in this area.  I recognise there has been some engagement.  We will be watching closely and hoping that many of our other amendments will be reflected by the Department on Report State due to the Minister's contact now with groups such as the canal users, but there are a few amendments which may need to be pressed because they are important points of principle.</p> <p>In respect of amendment No. a1z, Senator Craughwell has a proposal, which I strongly support, which states that it is not enough that notice of a proposed by-law should be published.  It is important that a local authority should be directly communicated with in writing to be informed that a by-law will impact on its local area.  I imagine there will be support across the House.  Many of us across the House have contact with local authorities.  It is a reasonable request that if Waterways Ireland is bringing in a by-law, it would write to the local authorities in the area which will be affected by the by-law and simply notify them of it so that they have an opportunity to act in the 90 days.</p> <p>I will skip through to another one, which is amendment No. 1ad.  Given the new authorities and the creation of new by-laws, if persons are approached by an authorised officer and informed that he or she is in breach of by-laws or laws in respect of the canals, the persons should be immediately informed of and shown what by-law they are in breach of or in danger of breaching.  These are pragmatic requests.  The reasons they are the ones we intend to press, unless of course the Minister indicates to directly absorb them into the Bill, is because they are important principles.  The amendment states that an authorised officer should be able on request to offer or show physically the by-law - it may be as simple as a booklet.  They should be able to show somebody the by-law which he or she is in breach of.  It is a simple and appropriate amendment.  In terms of any due process of law, it is very reasonable that a person who is told he or she is breaking a law be told what law the person is breaking and that the person is able to see it.  It is simply that they would present a hard copy of the by-law.  It is not enough to be told one is breaking a law and to go and check it on the website later.  One needs to be able to see it, there and then.</p> <p>In terms of amendment No. 1ae, this is another crucial and important point.  It is in respect of the new by-laws.  There are considerable powers in respect of by-laws being given to Waterways Ireland.  We have a reasonable proposal here - we would be happy to work with the Department if it has a counter suggestion which is similar and achieves the same policy intent - that Waterways Ireland should, every 36 months, review its by-laws with a specific focus on the new by-laws that have been introduced in the past three years.  They should review how these new by-laws are working and whether there are any unintended consequences and they should hold a public consultation so that they can assess the effect, positive or negative, of the by-laws introduced, and that public consultation should take place during the open season.  Of course, what nobody here wants is a situation whereby a by-law is brought in in October, November or December and it is only in the following summer season, in June, July and August, that is the peak tourism season, where we see the effect of the by-law and maybe some inadvertent consequences.  This ensures that we are able to ensure that by-laws that are put in place are reviewed and tested and that we all can learn and benefit from assessing their impact.</p> <p>One last amendment is important.  Proposed by Senator Norris, it is amendment No. 1af.  Waterways Ireland can, in addition to producing by-laws with the 90 day provision that we have heard, add ancillary provisions it deems appropriate.  We do not want to see a by-law the interpretation of which extends at great length to mean all kinds of different things and that we have one by-law with seven subsections that get added at a later stage.  Every new proposal should come through with the same kind of robust public engagement - the 90 day consultation for which the Minister has rightly allowed.</p></speech>

This requires that by-laws be communicated in writing to each local authority.  There is no way that we can allow organisations to operate on the hope that the message will get through at some stage or other.  We have to put it into the legislation to ensure that local authorities are aware of them and are communicated with at every stage.  Given that the waterways cross several local authorities, we do not want in five years' time to find out that somebody thought somebody else was doing something.  We need to ensure that it is enshrined in the legislation.</p> <p>Under amendment No. 1ab, the Minister will see that I am looking for an extension for public consultation, from 21 to 60 days in most cases.  I note, from the Seanad Special Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, that 21 days is not enough notice to get an organisation in to give a presentation.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for facilitating the helpful consultation period in the AV room with Waterways Ireland staff.  However, I was deeply disappointed by their level of interaction.  There was none, and we felt as if our views did not matter.  I can relate to the experiences of residents and others along the Barrow line, given that Waterways Ireland, which is a North-South body, seems determined to proceed irrespective of democracy or the wishes of local users.  I was disappointed with the consultation.  Perhaps we can touch on that issue later.</p> <p>Regarding amendment No. 1x, Waterways Ireland must comply with screening and assessments under European legislation.  I would appreciate clarification on the matter.  Any planning process should cover this, but I would like to hear the Minister's comments on the by-laws in terms of this amendment.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1y refers to 21 days, but the Minister indicated that she would increase the period to 90 days, which we welcome.  Will she clarify how she will implement that?  Presumably, a departmental amendment will be submitted on Report Stage.  If so, that would be good.  Not just local authorities, but all stakeholders and users should be covered by the 90-day period.</p> <p>In light of the recent presentation given by Waterways Ireland in the AV room, an element of local democratic accountability must be brought into the mix.  I do not mean "consultation" where people are told what will happen.  That is not consultation, it is dictating, and it is what has happened to date.  Consultation has to be prescriptive and there must be a statutory obligation on Waterways Ireland to engage with the element of democracy closest to the people, namely, the councillors and officials of local government.  This must be done so that the interests of local stakeholders are protected.  That is why the 90-day period is so important.  While I welcome the period, there may be a requirement to follow up with additional measures, and I would be interested in the Minister's comments on same.  Amendments Nos. 1aa and 1ab are linked to the matter of 90 days and I welcome that the initial amendment is being accepted.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1ad refers to "Authorised Officers", a matter discussed by Senator Higgins.  The amendment seeks to require authorised officers to present copies of the by-laws.  This is only right.  If there is an enforcement issue, at least the individual on whom it places a requirement knows which by-laws are being enforced.</p> <p>I have lost the number of the next amendment, as they are confusing.</p></speech>

Senator Norris and I have submitted an amendment to the effect that there should be a wider publication of the by-law.  According to subsection (2)(a), the by-law shall be published on Waterways Ireland's website and in newspapers circulating in the vicinity, but Waterways Ireland is not required to notify all registered users of the canal.  That should occur.  For one reason or another, people who utilise a service might not have access to the website or read the local newspapers.  Most people have moved away from reading newspapers and do not buy them.  There should be a mechanism requiring Waterways Ireland to notify all users of when it makes by-laws so that people can be aware and engage in the 90-day consultation period.</p> <p>I am sorry, but I have lost the amendment's number.

When we got involved in politics, we used letters and telephones.  Now, we use e-mails or engage through Facebook.  When users register, they must provide their e-mail addresses for notifications.  Many of the canal's users come from other parts of the country, so advertisements in local papers will not be sufficient.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for taking on board the extension of the consultation period.  Regarding the review of by-laws raised by Senator Higgins, will the Minister revert to me on a query?  The amendment reads "36 months", but sometimes there must be common sense about the capability of Departments to conduct reviews.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kevin Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2289"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2289&amp;amp;pid=KevinHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->When such a comprehensive review is taking place through the Heritage Bill 2016, we should come up with an achievable date for review of the by-laws being introduced.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#V00300"><p>As I outlined previously, officials from my Department had a very positive meeting with the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland to discuss some of the concerns over the canals provisions.  Many of the issues covered in the amendments were discussed along with other canal-related issues.  There was a shared understanding on both sides of the importance of the canals to rural areas for tourism development and local communities.  The Inland Waterways Association of Ireland recognised the rights of the regulator to regulate and that legislation should cover regulators, user requirements and by-laws.  The importance of having regular engagement was acknowledged and my officials are happy to work with the IWAI on any issues of concern it may have.  My officials also had a very good meeting with Senators for which I thank them.</p> <p>The proposed amendments Nos. 1x and a1y are not needed because any provision in the Canals Act that makes or may make provision for land use must comply with the obligations under the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  As with everyone else, Waterways Ireland is subject to habitats directives.  If we keep repeating it in legislation, it becomes very cumbersome.  It is given that it has to comply with them so there is no need to put that in.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1y is about notifying identified users.  Waterways Ireland automatically notifies all registered boat users, representative groups and local authorities as part of the process.  My problem is that there is no such thing as a registered user of a canal.  It would be very hard to identify them.  This public consultation or notification would be run on the same basis as a local authority would do it, by advertising in the newspaper and publishing it on the website.  It is incumbent on those using the canal to make themselves aware of any changes that might be made.</p> <p>As I have indicated, I am happy to introduce an amendment on Report Stage to extend the consultation period for making the by-laws to up to 90 days.  That gives people with an interest in the canals and waterways 90 days to make a submission.  By stating registered users, someone could be left out and we would not even know who had been left out.  It is very hard to do that.  However, there is a register of boat users and we will advise them.</p></speech>

I believe I have addressed most of the issues there.</p> <p>On the consultation with Waterways Ireland, it must be remembered that Waterways Ireland works very closely with local authorities.  I have a number of examples where it has worked very well on a collaborative basis on projects.  On the Shannon-Erne Blueway, from Ballyconnell down to Carrick-on-Shannon there have been a number of projects that have worked extremely well.  There is a good working relationship between local authorities and Waterways Ireland.  In my county, Waterways Ireland was the lead partner in an application for funding in conjunction with the local authority that actually produced &euro;5 million in indirect money to develop the blueway along the route of the Ulster Canal from Smithborough to Middletown on a cross-Border basis.  They work very collaboratively.  I have complimented Waterways Ireland on how it works with local authorities in introducing good projects with tourism benefits for the local community and the wider public.</p></speech>

While it is not my amendment, I would be quite flexible in that regard.  I would like to see a review mechanism built into the legislation.  No precedent is being set in this regard.  When I brought legislation through the House in the past, I accepted amendments to introduce a review mechanism.  Given the number of amendments in the Heritage Bill, it would be good practice to have a review mechanism.</p></speech>

We thought that 36 months seemed like a reasonable period.  The Minister might like to consult with Waterways Ireland, but we need a review mechanism.</p></speech>

That must be done through consultation.  We have the full consultation period if something needs to be changed.  They are not left sitting for the next three years with nothing happening to them.  If something arises that needs to be addressed, a consultation process will take place and changes made if necessary.  I take the Senators' point.  Perhaps we could examine the possibility of reviewing all the by-laws every five years and put that in.  I will look at that.  It is just about getting the right wording for an amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

He will obviously tell the person the by-law under which the offence has occurred.  However, having to bring a book of legislation around to show somebody the by-laws could be quite cumbersome and not something I would like to impose on them.</p></speech>

We cannot expect all officers to have all by-laws in their heads.  It might not be a book; it might be in online format or perhaps it is commonly accessed by-laws.  If people could be told, "It's X by-law and here's where you see it", that would be something.  It is still not enough.  We do not want people being told they are breaking the law without being shown what law.</p></speech>

I accept the Minister's point that by-laws are organic.  We are dealing with legislation today and what I am asking to be reviewed is the legislation we are putting through the House today.  The Bill is an enabler for by-laws.  The purpose of the amendment is to review that mechanism.</p></speech>

It seems to me that the fundamental basis of democracy is that one knows with what one is being charged.  One has to know the offence with which one is being charged.  It should be referenced.  It need not necessarily be an enormous book.  I do not think the by-laws would necessarily be an enormous book.  Presumably authorised officers would have a satchel of some kind.  It is not an unbearable duty on them to carry these things.  They could also do it through their telephones.  Most people have telephones that show these things.  All I am saying is that the principle of the amendment, with which I am sure the Minister will agree, is that an individual member of the public should be placed in a situation where they know with a degree of exactitude absolutely with what they are being charged.  People are entitled under law to know the offence with which they are being charged.  It is a fundamental principle of democracy.  I am sure the Minister will agree.</p></speech>

This amendment states that they have to have "for reference purposes a hard copy of the bye-laws".  That means they have to go around with a hard copy of the by-laws and show it to people.  It appears to be a bit cumbersome for an officer out there enforcing the by-laws on the canal to have this book and have to show it to people when he or she wants to outline to them what they are doing wrong and that a prosecution may follow.</p></speech>

Over the years, we have all worked through the local authorities.  There was always confusion over local authorities, OPW and Waterways Ireland.  Who will implement the by-laws?  Are there extra jobs involved?  Where will the money come from?  Like with everything that is set in writing, we must ask where the funding is coming from.  Will this be an extra charge on the users of the canals?  I have massive concerns.  Unless by-laws are controlled and implemented, they are absolutely a waste of time.  The by-laws are mentioned but there is no further information about how it will happen and how it will work apart from the public consultation, which I understand.  Everything has to be controlled, which the Minister knows.  Over the years, my biggest issue has been that nobody takes full responsibility in their areas, for example, through local authorities.  We are always trying to find out who will take ownership and control of it.  Can the Minister give more information on what is happening and the bigger picture?</p></speech>

It allows the body to decide what provisions may be necessary and expedient to include in the by-laws for the management of the canal and the canal property.  This basically gives flexibility to Waterways Ireland to change the by-laws, which is exactly what the Senator was speaking about.  If something comes up that needs to be changed, this provision gives the flexibility to change it, notwithstanding the fact that it has to go through the full process - the 90 days consultation and all of that.  The purpose of this is to allow necessary changes to be made to the by-laws if deemed necessary.</p></speech>

The class D fines, at the moment, are in the financial bracket from &euro;501 up to &euro;1,000.  I am not sure if Senator Humphreys's amendment meant a class E fine instead of class B, because  class E is below &euro;500.  Perhaps that was what was meant or maybe it is a misprint.</p> <p>On the fines, this is a contentious issue within the fishing sector at the moment and has been for some time.  I introduced legislation in this House which would introduce fixed penalty notices for minor offences for small fishermen instead of convictions in court and fines.  That is what is proposed here as well, a fixed penalty notice with a reasonable limit.  If the only recourse here is a class D fine, then the person or persons convicted are looking at paying out between &euro;501 and &euro;1,000 per offence.  There could be additional offences as well.  There are consequences here and the risk of major financial liabilities.  There should be a staggered system, if nothing else, and not just the option of a class D fine.  If someone is in contravention of, for example, four or five different by-laws it could stack up.  There should be some sort of a staggered system introduced which would include fixed penalty notices.  I would be willing to withdraw the amendment if the Minister had another look at this.</p></speech>

On occasions a fixed penalty fine, or a lower one, may be correct but the penalty for major offences has to reflect the damages that could be done to Waterways Ireland and to our water systems.  The breaching of serious by-laws can be detrimental and costly.  I would be happy if the Minister would engage with the Senators to ensure that the fines reflect the crime.</p></speech>

Class D fines are only prosecuted if the fixed penalty notice of &euro;150 is not paid.  There is a fixed penalty notice in place there.  That will cover the concerns the Senators have.  It is when the fixed penalty notice is not paid that it moves into the more severe fines.  I think that answers the Senators' questions.</p></speech>

That seems to me, again, to be reasonable.  If a person is charged with something, the person charging needs to have some degree of credibility, proof and evidence.  Another amendment, No. 1al, would insert the term &ldquo;determining reasonable proof&rdquo;.  This is, as the wording says, reasonable.  It is reasonable that there should be a requirement for proof.</p></speech>

I do not want to get into it, because I know we are all keen to move forward, but there is a fundamental point and it came up in the previous section.  It is very unusual that we would look at fixed payment notices without an appropriate appeal mechanism and so forth.  There are many other areas where fixed payments are due.  The reason that there are so many of these amendments is that we are looking at a situation whereby somebody is effectively being charged, judged and paying the penalty all in the same moment, as it were, because it is a fixed payment notice.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is why there are these complications.  Normally one would not have to go through the whole process there and then, but if we do not have an appeals mechanism which is something we need to examine overall in respect of fixed payments, it all has to be done there and then.  If there was an appeals mechanism, a fixed payment notice could be issued and the mechanism would be available to the person in the rare cases where it was contested.  They should be able to contest it and ask about evidence, etc.  Some of these issues arise from that core aspect of the Bill.</p></speech>

It would future proof the Bill as the section allows for lower amounts to be specified for contravention of canal by-laws.  A sum of &euro;150 is a little low.  Will the Minister reflect on the matter and consider increasing the figure?  It might mean not having to amend the legislation quite so quickly?</p></speech>

Fixed penalty notices are the way to go.  They make sense.  The justice system and the courts are clogged up enough without having to deal with minor offences such as these.  The comparator would be fixed penalty notices for driving offences such as speeding which start at &euro;80.  In this instance, they start at &euro;150.  Presumably the system is staggered, depending on the nature of the offence involved, and that there is not just a flat rate of &euro;150, irrespective of the severity of the offence involved.  I am not even sure what the offences could or would be.  Will the Minister give examples of offences and tell us whether she believes a sum of &euro;150 is appropriate?  Should lower sums be specified staggered upwards according to severity?</p> <p>Amendment 1ak relates to increasing the payment period from 21 days to 30.  This is a reasonable request as most people are paid monthly.  These are new financial times in which people are in mortgage distress and have bills to pay and so on.  In the financial calendar credit cards, etc. work on a 30-day period.  Would it not be reasonable, therefore, to increase the period to 30 days?</p> <p>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor will speak on this issue in more detail, but I agree that there should be some appeals mechanism at the fixed penalty notice level.  It is most likely that the only way to appeal it will be to not pay it, meaning that the person concerned will end up in the courts.  There should be some internal appeals mechanism similar to the appeals system in the Department of Social Protection whereby individuals could within 30 days register their grievance or appeal.  Within a further 30 days, Waterways Ireland would issue a response.  Perhaps there might be some such mechanism.</p></speech>

Will a new appeals system be set up?  What are the offences?  We are passing legislation that concerns offences and appeals, yet we do not know what system will be in place.  This is crucial.  I agree that many people do not have &euro;150, which is a lot of money.  There should be some system in place to help with an appeal.</p></speech>

I was trying to make things simple.  We can assume that most of the people involved are actually breaking the law.  The authorised officers will not be stopping people to make false accusations against them.

It seems to be a fairly rational provision.  We need people who know what is going on on the canals and who have a good knowledge of the life of canals.  They need to know exactly what they are implementing.  Without this amendment, people who lack the knowledge and understanding of the canals required could be appointed.

It would be simple to state such officers need to be appointed from within the staff of Waterways Ireland.  For example, we do not want a scenario where this work might be contracted out to a private security firm.  Hospital security services and so on have been contracted out.  We do not want a scenario where a private security firm would have the power to issue fixed payment notices and enforce by-laws.  These officers need to be appointed from Waterways Ireland staff.  That may mean the organisation will decide to hire additional staff, but that is for it to determine.  Accountability is important and we do not want a situation down the line where Waterways Ireland states the company it contracted to enforce the by-laws did X, Y or Z.  There is a need for direct accountability.  Similarly, it must be ensured that the officers are suitably qualified because they are being given a new series of powers.  I am happy to engage with the Department on the detail of the amendments, but the Minister will understand they are about taking seriously the powers, accountability and training of authorised officers.</p></speech>

We did not have an opportunity to discuss the previous section but it dealt with allowing people to board boats.  Amendment No. 1aaf refers to search warrants.  My colleague and I are concerned that the current legislation allows authorised officers to get search warrants to enter and search boats accompanied by anyone whom they believe to be appropriate.  My colleague and I believe this aspect must be clarified.  In ideal circumstances search warrants should only be issued to a garda, a customs official or a Revenue official.  The ability to grant search warrants to authorised officers is quite a considerable power.</p><p>We are concerned about the provision which states: &quot;A search warrant under this section shall be expressed and operate to authorise a named authorised officer, accompanied by such authorised officers or other persons as the named authorised officer thinks necessary.&quot;  We believe that if an authorised officer is issued with a search warrant, he or she should be accompanied by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a customs official, a Revenue official or health and safety inspector.  We also believe that they should be the determinants.  Perhaps authorised officers from Waterways Ireland could also ask for a search warrant.</p><p>The power I have alluded to is very considerable.  My colleague and I will probably not push the amendment.  We urge the Department to review granting a considerable power to search and enter people's private properties and homes to authorised officers as stipulated in this legislation.  This is particularly important given the fact that we have not been reassured about the accountability of authorised officers.  I do not plan to press these amendments at this point but I want to discuss the matter.  The granting of search warrants is quite a considerable power and the persons who use search warrants must be accountable.  I am concerned about this power and ask the Minister to address the matter.</p></speech>

I also agree that it would be well worth our while examining the matter to ensure that the appropriate person is used.  These are very wide powers.  They include the power to enter the personal property and home of an individual.  Let us remember that some people live on houseboats.</p> <p>Amendment No. 1aah deals with the presentation of a warrant.  As the legislation stands, persons must request the presentation of a warrant.  They may neglect to do so, or may not know they have the right to do so, or may not do so for one reason or another.  It is important that a warrant is presented to the person who is alleged to be guilty of an offence.  </p> <p>Amendment No. 1aai extends the provision from merely covering a boat to include other canal properties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Norris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1758"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1758&amp;amp;pid=DavidNorris&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not restrict it to the question of a boat.</p></speech>

We need to be very careful about search warrants and so on.  We need to recognise that we are talking about people's homes, and people should have the same rights and protection under the law as any one else.  I understand that to be the intention of the Minister.  The community to which I refer has a fear around that.</p> <p>The community in Grand Canal Dock in Dublin is in the middle of the silicon dock.  When the pricing structure is set, I ask that we make sure we do not price ordinary people out of the area.  I ask the Minister to consider that the homes of many people in the area will be affected by the search warrants we are discussing.</p></speech>

The officers executing a search warrant have to go to court to get a search warrant before they can execute it.  That will allay some of the fears around search warrants.  They will go to court to ask for search warrants on the basis of breaches of the canal by-laws.  A judge would have to be satisfied, based on the sworn information of an authorised officer, that there are reasonable grounds granting a warrant.  That is what this section is about.</p> <p>Senator Norris said that if an officer does not automatically produce a search warrant that would invalidate the search.  At that stage, he or she probably should have known that there was an issue and it should not come as a surprise because he or she would have had to go to court to get a search warrant.</p> <p>I refer to amendment No. 1aai.  It suggests that Waterways Ireland would need a search warrant to enter its canal property.  That does not make sense.</p></speech>

The Minister is putting the cart before the horse, in respect of the suggestion that the season for burning hedgerows and upland be extended.

It is absurd for a Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to come in here and blather on about hedges.  What have hedges got to do with heritage?  It is a complete and absolute nonsense.  The absence of scientific evidence on the part of the Minister has been underlined throughout the debate.  No survey has been done and this is disastrous.  It is appalling that the Government would introduce policy based on no scientific research whatsoever.</p><p>The Heritage Bill proposal to allow burning in March would have a very serious impact on upland breeding birds.  Birdwatch Ireland, a professional body engaged in this area, presented the best available data to the Minister but the science is being totally ignored.  It might as well not have been done.  We need Irish data so we need a proper pilot study, not a mass implementation of a policy which is unsupported by science.  The necessary research must take place before this is implemented.</p><p>What science underpins the proposed changes to ensure birds are not impacted?  What evidence has the Minister got for this?  She has presented none to this House.  If a pilot study shows that nesting birds have been impacted what will the Government's policy objectives be?  Will this alter the situation?  Can we have the details of what secondary legislation is envisaged by the Government?</p><p>According to Derek Mooney, a well-known populariser of natural history, modern farming practice has taken its toll on wildlife and the destruction of hedgerows has greatly reduced the cover of mammals and birds.  He said seed-eating birds will decline drastically in numbers and the shortage of insect larvae will make it difficult for birds to raise their young.  Three quarters of an hour ago in this House I adverted to the impact on the moth and butterfly population so I will not regurgitate it.</p><p>We do not have much scientific evidence in Ireland as it simply has not been done.  I would, however, like to put on the record the results of a survey conducted by the University of Leeds on the impact of peat burning on the chemical composition of the landscape.  It states that p<font color="#231F20">rescribed burning on peatlands was shown to have clear effects on peat hydrology, peat chemistry and physical properties, river water chemistry and river ecology.  It is a substantial impact.  It also states:</font></p><blockquote><font color="#231F20">Burning reduces the organic matter content of the upper peat layers.  The net result is that the peat is less able to retain important particles known as exchangeable cations.  In other words, the peat in burned sites is deprived of chemicals which are important for plant growth and for buffering acidic rainfall.  [By burning peat we are creating conditions that are adverse to important plant growth.]  Lower concentrations of nutrient elements found in peat soils in burned river basins do not support the idea that burning enriches the peat with nutrients from ash.  [We are often told that by burning on grassland, gorse and scrub areas one gets a fresh growth of grass but this does not appear to be the case with regard to peatlands.]  Rivers draining burned catchments were characterised by lower calcium concentrations and lower pH relative to rivers draining unburned catchments.  Rivers draining burned sites had higher concentrations of silica, manganese, iron and aluminium compared to unburned catchments.  There was no difference between burned and unburned catchments in peat nitrogen concentrations or in carbon to nitrogen ratios (high C/N is considered unfavourable to microbial decomposition of peat) ... Water-table depth is very important in peatlands for maintaining their stability and function as a carbon store.  Water tables were found to be significantly deeper for burned catchments than for unburned ones.  Deeper water tables would suggest a greater scope for degradation of the peat and loss of carbon to the atmosphere.</font></blockquote> <p><font color="#231F20">In other words it is carbon negative.  The report further states that sphagnum is an important peat-forming species.  Sphagnum grows on the bogs and in historical times it was used as a dressing for wounds as it has powerful medicinal properties.  The report goes on:</font></p><blockquote><font color="#231F20">Changes in the hydrological properties of the peat after fire make the peat less conducive to Sphagnum moss growth.  River flow in catchments where burning has taken place appears to be slightly more prone to higher flow peaks during heavy rain.  However, this was not a conclusive finding.  Burning vegetation alters the natural peat hydrology in the upper layers of the peat affecting the balance of where water flow occurs.  Recovery of many hydrological properties appears to be possible if a site is left unburned over many years.  [This means the site shows a capacity to recover.]  Thermal regimes appear to recover as vegetation regrows.  This recovery was also seen in soil hydrology data from burned plots of different ages.  Macroinvertebrates play a vital role in aquatic food webs by feeding on algae, microbes and detritus at the base of food chains before they themselves are consumed by birds, fish and amphibians.  The research found that river macroinvertebrate diversity was reduced in burned sites.  [This means there is a reduction in the small fauna in burnt areas.]  In burned sites, river macroinvertebrate populations were dominated by groups that are commonly found in higher abundance in disturbed river systems, such as non-biting midge larvae (Chironomidae) and burrowing stonefly larvae (Nemouridae).  Increases in the abundance of disturbance-tolerant taxa counteract declines and/or losses amongst some groups (e.g. mayflies) which are typically sensitive to reduced pH, increased aluminium and deposition of fine sediments.  These changes show that burning increases the effect of biological stressors compared to unburned rivers.</font></blockquote> <p><font color="#231F20">All these things suggest a dramatic impact on the chemistry and ecology of peatlands.  In addition, section 8 extends the burning period which would affect a significant proportion of our most threatened species.  Upland burning has been shown to have some positive aspects but it is essential that threatened species are not wiped out.  Among those species are curlew, which used to be a very common feature of the Irish landscape.  Now one hardly ever hears the curlew's call, or the golden plover.  This section needs to vigorously opposed and then rethought.  I ask the Minister to do so.</font></p></speech>

When Senator Alice-Mary Higgins tabled amendments which would have greatly improved the road safety aspect of dealing with hedgerows her proposals fell on deaf ears.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Norris that the measure must be opposed.  I call on Members to support the amendment because at the very least one must support good science, which is what it is.  One must investigate and carry out a proper baseline study and then one can move forward.  Our neighbours in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland moved in that direction but they have moved back.  Recently, Northern Ireland voted to ensure that August was still included.  It is important to acknowledge that was done.  I support the amendment.  I will possibly table an alternative to the baseline study on Report Stage in terms of time, area and distance in kilometres.  We need good science.  What is proposed today relates to the Twenty-six Counties.  The Minister asks us to trust her to do it by regulation.  We would be failing citizens if we were to take it on trust.  This is primary legislation and the baseline study must be outlined in detail in terms of what counties are covered and how many kilometres of hedgerows will be taken into account.  Let us kill off the notion once and for all that the issue relates to road safety.  Let nobody in this House try to justify the argument because that is not the case.</p></speech>

I wish to be clear that sometimes I do not always get the opportunity to speak.</p> <p>I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed by a number of Senators on the impact the provisions might have on biodiversity.  I share the views of Senators that hedgerows are a very important wildlife habitat that provide food, shelter, corridors of movement, nests and hibernation sites for many native flora and fauna.  The changes in timing of cutting which are set out in the Bill will not interfere with any of those functions.  As I stated previously, my intention is that any hedge trimming in the month of August may only take place on road sides or on land where reseeding or tillage is being carried out and that the trimming may only be of the current year's growth and should not involve the use of heavy flails or grubbing.  If a person needs to carry out heavier cutting of hedges such as grubbing and flailing they must do so during the existing permitted period between September and the end of February.  I wish to be clear; it was never my intention to allow the grubbing, heavy cutting or destruction of hedges in August.  The text reflected the wording in the original legislation and I now propose on Report Stage to delete the words "grubbing" or "destroying otherwise" from section 8(2) of the Bill.</p> <p>To be clear, this is a pilot scheme for two years, subject to regulations and guidelines and there will be monitoring of the pilot phase.  After two years it must come back to both Houses of the Oireachtas, which must pass a resolution &ndash; that means it will not be a nodding exercise &ndash; for the pilot period to continue and if it is not passed the pilot scheme will fall and the scheme will cease.</p> <p>Section 8 also allows for the controlled burning in certain areas to be specified by regulation during March should it be necessary, for example, due to adverse weather conditions.  Members are all aware of the illegal burning that takes place.  What I want to do is allow flexibility to work with landowners and to do that in a managed and safe way.</p> <p>Section 8 also provides for managed hedge cutting to be allowed under strict criteria during August to help ensure overgrown hedges impacting on roads can be tackled.  The sunset clause of two years provided for in section 8 can only be extended by separate resolutions of the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  It is good practice for the provisions to be reviewed during the two-year period in order that we can assess the works in practice and determine if there are any lessons to be learned or if any improvements are needed.  We must also ensure that the new provisions should not adversely impact on wildlife.  That will be a key aim of mine, taking account of my responsibilities for natural heritage.</p> <p>I am aware of some concerns surrounding scientific data to underpin the nesting and breeding periods for wild birds.  I am satisfied that the provisions to be put in place in section 8 fully respect the requirements of the nesting and breeding seasons for wild birds.  Furthermore, Senators will note that the provisions in the section provide that the cutting of hedgerows in August will only be possible if it is done in accordance with regulations which I will make in relation to hedgerow husbandry and to ensure that wildlife and other flora and fauna are protected.  No cutting will be possible in the absence of the regulations.  The provisions in the Bill are for a pilot phase of two years.

However, if a hedge is blocking the view of road users or where land management requires, the landowner will have the option to cut back one season's growth in the month of August if he or she so wishes.  That is a serious issue on local byroads in rural areas where hedges grow out on roads in particular in the month of August following heavy rain.  I know because I live there and I have experienced it.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Heather Humphreys:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2308"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2308&amp;amp;pid=HeatherHumphreys&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It damages cars, it restricts the view of motorists and it is dangerous for cyclists.  People prefer local authorities to have the power to cut hedges.  There is a provision whereby local authorities can cut hedges in the interests of road safety.  However, the reality is that local authorities simply do not have the manpower or resources to be out on every byroad in the country inspecting and trimming hedges.  They just do not have that capacity.  Anyone who lives in rural Ireland will be aware of that.</p></speech>

This has been warmly welcomed by groups such as BirdWatch Ireland.  Similar funding has been provided by my Department to support important conservation projects, such as the red grouse management plan in Boleybrack Mountain in County Leitrim.  That project, which involves a collaborative approach by farmers, gun club members and wildlife groups has brought about an increase in grouse numbers locally.  That shows what can be achieved when there is a collaborative approach with local landowners.</p> <p>I want to replicate the approach in my county, Monaghan.  We have six nesting curlews in the Sliabh Beagh area.  I arranged an information evening some time ago to raise public awareness about what we can all do to work together to protect the curlew.  There were many farmers at that meeting and they genuinely want to protect the curlew.  It infuriates me when accusations are thrown around that all farmers are looking to destroy our wildlife.

This represents only a small percentage of the overall hedgerows in the country.  Furthermore - I have said it before and will say it again - I will prohibit grubbing and flailing in August.  If farmers and others need to carry out heavier cutting of hedges such as grubbing and flailing, they must do so during the existing period between September and the end of February.</p></speech>

I will not go extensively into amendment No. 3, which I believe we will be debating together.</p> <p>I need to correct two key points for the record.  We have had this debate and I do not think it is constructive.  As a Minister for all of Ireland, the Minister needs to be very clear that it is not constructive to suggest or ascribe comments to the Seanad.  Nobody here has cast any aspersions about farmers.  That has been clear.  We spoke as custodians.  My colleague spoke as her father is a proud member of the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA.  We have spoken about the interests of farmers, for example, horticultural farmers, those growing crops who are deeply concerned about the impacts of this legislation on pollinators.  We need to be very careful and appropriate and not try to create division where division has not been sown in this House.</p> <p>I would also like to make a technical correction.  The Minister said "as all who would live in rural areas".  All who live in rural areas and many of us who now live in urban areas are aware that the legislation is currently that councils can issue a permit which will allow the landowner to cut the hedge.  The Minister suggested that councils can cut hedges but do not have the capacity to do so.  The section 70 order allows a landowner to cut the hedge.  I do not believe in this context that this was accurate.  Let us be accurate about what the legislation provides.</p> <p>That said, I believe there is a resource issue.  It would be useful, as we have often said before, if we looked at places like County Clare and others where resources have been given to county councils to allow them to support the hedge cutting in issues of road safety.  I acknowledge that my colleague, Senator Kevin Humphreys, kindly acknowledged the amendment I put forward along with my colleague Senator Grace O'Sullivan, which would have strengthened road safety.  Our amendment is the only amendment to this legislation that is explicitly set out to strengthen road safety.  It was to ensure that not only landowners would be allowed to cut hedges where they feel there is a road safety concern, but that individuals could do so too.  We heard passionate testimony from persons with a disability about the obstructions for them.  Any person who is a road user or a path user could ask for a section 70 order to be issued.  It was a strengthening provision to allow road users who are concerned about road safety to ask for an exception.  Where road safety is a concern, section 70 allows for cutting at any time of year, 365 days a year.</p> <p>I wish to speak on amendment No. 2 and my other concerns around gorse-burning and hedges.</p></speech>

We are speaking only on amendment No. 2.  Those were simply clarifications of the Minister's speech.</p> <p>On amendment No. 2, unfortunately, the Minister did not comment on her views on baseline data.  We have been hearing at length that this is a pilot.  We have been hearing ideas as to what might be done.  We need to be very clear on the messages the Minister has given today with regard to one year's growth, what is or is not included and where it will be targeted.  None of this is currently in the legislation.  At present, the legislation gives clear and wide permission, and none of the constraints or the concerns on which we have heard very welcome suggestions from the Minister are in the legislation before the House.  We need to be very clear.  It is imperative that the Minister puts what she is saying here in the Chamber into the legislation.  We have a very wide divide at the moment between stated policy intent and the legislation that is before the House.</p> <p>There is also a concern when we talk about a pilot.  We have not really heard what is the intention of the pilot.  Why are we doing a pilot on cutting?  What is the urgency?  We know that road safety can be addressed elsewhere.  What is the driver?  What is the Minister's perspective as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs?  What is the major heritage concern in rural areas that is driving this intrusion into our wildlife legislation?  It is a template that has stood for a long time and has been copied across Europe and in the UK.  We need to know why we are doing this pilot, and the case for doing it needs to be strong.  There is a key concern.  The Minister talks about science and such, but she is still talking about assessing the impacts.  If we do not have a baseline, we do not know how to assess the impacts.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->At present, there is no provision for baseline data gathering.  If, in two years' time, we simply say here is the situation now for whatever species may have expired or still be there, there will be no indication as to from where we have come or what we may have lost.  As I have said before and I will not repeat it in the Chamber, we know from the people who write to us and who monitor nature in their own areas that they have seen what has been lost already.  What about a baseline?  The Minister has not made provision for a baseline or indicated for a baseline.  Amendment No. 2 is separate to our general provision.  We have put forward very reasonable and appropriate scientific terms under which a baseline could be conducted so we know what is the biodiversity in our hedgerows right now, what is the nature of our hedgerows, what is there and what species are there.  We have information from the UK, which has done this research, and it is very interesting that when the UK conducted research on its hedgerows and looked at its baselines and impacts, it decided to change and copy our legislation because it was better.  It decided to remove August from the period of cutting and burning.  We also need to be clear that there needs to be freedom.</p><p>The Minister mentioned assessment.  At no point in the legislation do we have clarity on what assessment will be published, where it will be shared and how we will all be able to talk about what has happened during the two year period.  There is no plan for the pilot at present.  There is no specification.  It is not simply enough for the Minister to ask for blanket permission to invent a pilot.  The pilot cannot be all of Ireland and the Minister needs to set out what proportion of Ireland will be covered and not covered.  The Minister is giving assurances which, sadly, I do not believe she is in a position to give, that no wildlife will be affected.  We just do not know this unless we have the data and the science.</p><p>I welcome the Minister's comments on grubbing.  That is dealt with in amendment No. 3.  I imagine the Minister plans to accept our amendment on grubbing and destroying.  I also welcome the Minister's comments on flailing.  I note we will have an opportunity in this regard, if the Minister is genuinely serious about addressing issues of grubbing and flailing, as amendments to section 10 look to strengthen and set out regulations in respect of both of these practices.</p><p>I will not speak to the substance of section 8 until we come to the next group of amendments.  Will the Minister indicate whether she will accept the amendment on a baseline?  Will she put forward her own amendment on a baseline on Report Stage?</p></speech>

This is no surprise because in essence it is quite clear this section is designed to pre-empt any measure such as section 8 without a baseline data study being put in place to justify it.  There are a few points we must consider on what is being proposed.  The Minister has indicated road safety is an issue which concerns her and motivates the legislation.  If this is the case, I would like to see some mention of road safety as one of the criteria for making regulations in her section when we come to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#GG00300"><p>Hear, hear.</p></speech>

In a spirit of genuine conciliation in this debate it seems to me the Minister should indicate she is open to accepting the introduction of road safety as one of the constraining factors in section 8 if her section 8 is to proceed.</p><p>The second point that occurs to me is there is a distinction between section 8(1) which is a burning section and section 8(2) which, at present, is a cutting, grubbing or destroying section, but the Minister now indicates it is purely to be cutting.  It is very notable from the wording of section 8(1) it is proposed it should apply to such part or parts of the State as the regulations may permit.  When we look to the regulations envisaged by section 8(2) no such geographical criteria are there.  If we were considering a genuine pilot study to evaluate whether this should take place on scientific grounds, and bearing in mind the implications for wildlife and flora and fauna, one would expect, even from the point of view of having control studies and the like, that any scientific approach to a pilot study would look at areas where it was permitted and areas where it was not permitted, and see whether there was any significant difference between the two.  I was interested that Michael Viney in an article on this subject in <i>The Irish Times</i>pointed out there are particular species which produce second clutches of eggs and chicks in August each year.  The beekeepers of Ireland have come forward and their objections are based on the needs of bees with regard to cutting back that year's growth.</p><p>This brings me to the next point the Minister mentioned in her contribution.  She mentioned the regulations she had in mind would deal with roadside hedge cutting and non-roadside hedge cutting where it was necessary for land management in a tillage context.  Why is this not mentioned in the section?  I am worried by a particular point in all of this.  I do not doubt the Minister's good faith for a minute, but it is all very well to say that cutting would be restricted to that year's growth, whatever that would mean for bees and animals dependent on berries, but if somebody brings a machine into a field and starts cutting, afterwards who will say the person cutting went further than this year's growth?  In the real world what inspector will be sent out, and by whom, to crawl along the hedges and state that cutting has gone a bit further than this year's growth and it is 4 inches into last year's growth?  Where will the line be drawn?  People will not be out with secateurs and measuring tapes.  Either a hedge cutting machine will be deployed on a hedge or it will not.  In the aftermath, there will be nothing to show how far into last year's growth the cutting actually went.  There will be no person whose job it is to state the cutting went further than this year's growth because that person would have to prove he or she was there last year and saw the state of the hedge last year.</p></speech>

If the Minister is actually saying this is the justification for this, how will anybody control it?</p> <p>I come back to the point about the provision on cutting, grubbing and destroying being a nationwide operation as section 8(2) stands.  There is not the mechanism, machinery, resources or capacity on the part of any wildlife agency or conservation body to do anything effective to stop widespread cutting of hedges in August once an order is made under this regulation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Nobody will be able to police any regulations effectively.  I do not see why we have not been shown the draft regulation.  We pass referendums and we see the draft Bill.  The child adoption Bill was put before the people, the abortion Bill was put before the people, divorce legislation was put before the people in draft, various pieces of legislation are put before the people on occasions so they could work out what they were actually voting for.  On this occasion no attempt has been made to produce a draft regulation which has the limiting factor such as tillage and land management and this season's growth, all of these issues are just absent from the legislation.  It occurs to me that if this season's growth is to be a genuine criterion, there is absolutely no reason it should not be mentioned in the legislation in respect of off-road hedge cutting.  I presume the Minister would tell me before we go much further that she would accept an amendment on Report Stage to do that.  If she is not willing to say that, and put it in the legislation that it is intended to have that minor effect, there is no point in making a speech justifying it in this House by reference to something she is not willing to commit to in legislation.  <br/><br/>Likewise, if it is required for the purposes of reasonable land management, what do we mean by that?  If it is to be in a tillage context, let us see what is actually meant by all of that.  What I am coming down to is this - that the amendment proposed is effectively putting in place a standstill until some scientific basis for a change in this area is established on scientific grounds.  That is the precautionary principle that we are supposed to follow in environmental matters.  It worries me that this seems to be a very unscientific, broad-brush approach and one which gives a free licence to all farmers to attack any hedge.  Even if the Minister took out grubbing and destroying, as long as there is something left at the end of the operation the possibility of proving that any particular landowner had infringed the legislation would be very small indeed as would the the chance of enforcing it.  <br/><br/>Lastly, I do not want to reignite the controversy that we saw some moments ago.  This is not a question of the townies versus the farmers.  This is not about idealists.  Some of us are very conversant with rural Ireland, and know what it is like when a bramble grows out of a ditch and it forces bikes out into the road and such like.  No one needs to have a particular background to know what growth occurs and what the road safety implications can be of roadside hedges growing out onto the road in summer.  By the same token, although some people may get hotheaded on social media and use broad-brush language about this particular proposal, the Minister should not underestimate the feeling that there is on this issue.  It is not just that <i>The Irish Times </i>wrote an editorial on this and praised this House for querying what the Minister is doing.  There is a huge amount of people in Ireland who object to this, they object to its unscientific basis, the manner in which it has been done, the absence of draft regulations, the unthought-out way that this has been done; they object to what they suspect is just a deal done with farmers' organisations and that it why it is being pushed forward with such vehemence.  We live in a very uncertain world but I do believe that if by any chance the Minister manages to progress this into legislation she should bear in mind that this Government has a lot of problems - we only have to look around at what has been happening in the last week - and this is going to alienate a very significant area of votes from it.  They are not just people who sit on beanbags thinking about San Francisco in the 1960s </p></speech>

There are an awful lot of people outside this House who would say she should get on with her Bill and leave out section 8.  Those people would be well disposed to the Minister if they felt that she had listened to a debate in this House where considered opposition to section 8 had been voiced.  I do not think that it would do any harm to her electorally or to her ministerial standing.  As one of the people who admires many of the things the Minister does, I do not believe that it would detract in the slightest if between now and Report Stage, she were to reconsider her support for section 8.  I do not think that the farming organisations would go mad if she modified section 8 along the lines that she says she intends to do and could do by restricting its application.  I do think that with so many political problems around her neck, this is not a case of her taking the hard decision in the national interest.  It does not fall into that category and the Minister should not think of herself, or the Government of itself, as taking the hard decisions with a whole lot of intemperate, ill-informed critics voicing half-thought out opposition.  This is something where most people, I think reasonably, come down against section 8 if they consider the issue.  Most independent commentary comes down against section 8.  I ask the Minister, between now and Report Stage to consider whether this Bill would not be a far better Bill if she walked away from section 8 and said that she had listened to the debate in this House.  That is what the Seanad is for.  She has not tried to push it through on a whip.  The balance of opinion in society is against it.  There is not a very good scientific basis for enacting section 8 at this stage; in fact there is none.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Minister is not merely a Minister.

I am very supportive of the Irish farming community.  We would not have the landscape we have without the farmers.  They have cared for the environment.  We have what we have because of them.  In this House, we have actually listened to each other.  We may have started from different places but we have moved closer together.  At a very early stage, I made the same suggestion that section 8 be shelved, and that we look at the signs and develop a logical approach.  If we want to deal with the road safety element, Senator Higgins's road safety amendment could be adopted by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, when he gets around to doing something.</p> <p>I doubt anyone is happy with the idea and taking it on trust.  We have to understand what the baseline is.  The baseline cannot be Twenty-six Counties.  If we are asking for a study to be done, or a change in legislation to allow a study or a pilot project be carried out, it cannot be on a Twenty-six County basis.  I said earlier that this is a place to start from, if we insist on going forward.  This is not a townie versus rural Ireland.  It is actually the opposite.  The vast majority of e-mails I have received on this issue come from outside the Dublin area from the agricultural community and from people who live and work in rural Ireland.  I was accused earlier of just being a Dublin 4 person.  Hedgerows are an important part of our environment.  I thank the Minister for the indication that she is removing the words "grubbing and destroying".  I also notice she has changed her language.  In the Bill the word used is "cutting" but she is using the word "trimming".  Does that refer to a different length or distance?</p> <p>A job well done would be to allow the canal section of this Bill to progress, and possibly send section 8 into an Oireachtas committee.  Let us invite everybody in to discuss this in depth to ensure we are doing the right thing.  It is not just the birds, bats and hedgehogs.  It is about farmer's livelihoods as well.  There is REPS and payments are made to the protection of the environment.  That all has to be considered.</p> <p>Rural Ireland is facing great problems with Brexit.  Its economic viability is going to be threatened in the coming two years, and as a country and a nation we need to stand together.  To build trust between the communities we should remove section 8 and send it to an Oireachtas committee, perhaps the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

I certainly support the previous Senator's position that we should drop section 8 completely.  If we do not, I will vote for this amendment too.</p></speech>

I have sat here or in my office for most of the day listening to the contributions, and many Senators mentioned the amount of communications we have received.  We have received communications by e-mail, on Facebook and on Twitter, and I have read most of them.  I have also met people.  I went to Bantry a week ago last Monday night, to the Cathaoirleach's home town.  I met 500 people.  Rarely have I gone into a room with 500 people.  There was an unfortunate feeling, as other Senators have mentioned, that it was them against us.  That was an unfortunate feeling to get from that room.  Entrenchment has become an issue in this debate.  That has been the unfortunate thing in this debate.  Rural people feel that they have been driven into the ground on this.  I am not saying that is on purpose, but they do feel that it has become "them" and "us".  That has been the unfortunate outcome of this very important debate.  </p> <p>There is an issue.  Everybody in this House who understands rural Ireland is aware that when one goes to the local council one of the key issues is cutting hedges.  Anyone who has served on a rural county council knows it is one of the key issues with the engineers at the area roads meeting.  As most of us here who went through the local authority system will be aware, the first thing that the engineer will say is that they do not have the money and that it cannot be done because it is against the law.  It is an issue.  In many ways, this legislation is trying to put something to bed.  Let us look to see what will work and what will not work.  Let us look at a two year pilot study and at trimming back hedges for two years where they must be trimmed back.  Some Senators have said that maybe we will cut every hedge in Ireland.  We will not.  A small percentage of hedges will be cut.</p></speech>

I live in a place called Minane Bridge.  I will not be cutting a hedge in August because I do not need to.  I am a grassland farmer.  I do not need to cut those hedges.  I can cut them when it comes to the appropriate time that is in the legislation at the moment.  However, I have neighbours who have grain farms and when it comes to winter cereals, which is a huge issue further south from me near Kinsale, they need to cut their hedges back because they are doing their tilling and their sowing and their setting in August.   They cannot do it at any other time of the year.  At the moment, they do it afterwards.  The weather goes against them and it affects their crops.  It just does not work.  The use of phrase "land management" by the Minister is such an appropriate one because that is exactly what it is.  In many ways, it is helping the environment because at the moment they are doing double the work.</p> <p>This legislation is looking to see if there is a better way.  It will come back to this House in two years' time if it is not a better way, and we can take that into consideration then.  This legislation allows for the results of the information to come back to these Houses.  Then the Seanad can look at the results of what we have seen.  That is appropriate, and is what the farming community wants.  It has been an unfortunate, damaging debate.  This is our third day in the Seanad.  I have seen it in the e-mails and text messages I have received from my own part of the world and it is unfortunate how entrenched people have become.  That is something that I am deeply conscious of.</p> <p>This legislation set out to do two things.  One was to help the farming community manage certain conditions when it comes to land use regarding re-seeding and winter cereals.  That was the idea of it from an agricultural point of view.  The other issue was to help road safety for the month of August, for the 31 days required.  That is what the Minister has proposed, and if she brings the information back from this two year pilot study to these Houses, we will have a say.  That is important and appropriate and is what people want to know, namely, that the reports will come back to these Houses when we will know exactly what is happening.  How many hedges will be cut in August?  Will it be everywhere?  I would say less than 5%.  In major grassland areas, there will be no hedge cutting done in August.  That is why it is limited to such a small area.  There are parishes further south from mine which have nothing but dairy cows.  There will be no hedges cut there.  There are parishes near Kinsale where they will be cut because that is where grain is grown.  It is location, location, location.</p> <p>I commend the Minister on this good legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are working towards a system wherein we can see what will and what will not work.

The legislation is appropriate and the Minister has done the right thing by bringing it forward.  I am afraid that an unfortunate side effect will relate not to hedges, birds or bees but the relationship between rural Ireland and urban dwellers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1392" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#KK00500"><p>The debate has certainly moved on.  In the last Parliament, I was the only Member of the Seanad to oppose section 8.  I could not get another Member to stand for me to get a vote or to act as a teller.  It is really terrific that we have had such a diverse expression of opinion.</p> <p>We have to take into account what the facts are.  The Minister has pretty much accepted that a large number of birds are under threat of extinction.  She instanced six pairs of nesting curlews.  How fantastic.  It is hardly overcrowding on a grand scale.  Many birds and small mammals are actually getting very close to extinction, including the curlew and the corncrake.  When my mother was in central Africa, she used to ache for the sound of the corncrake.  Now, one can travel the length and breadth of Ireland but one will not hear one.  The cuckoo was another bird one used to hear regularly but it is practically gone.  Small mammals such as bats, hares and stoats are also endangered.</p> <p>I will not rehearse the whole debate but I will put a few established scientific facts on the record.  Yellowhammer, linnet and greenfinch nest well into September.  As a result, hedge cutting is damaging to them when it takes place at this time.  At the other end of the season, curlew and other upland breeding birds have begun their nesting in March and they will also be impacted.  They require tall vegetation in which to nest.  Burning in March will destroy this kind of habitat.  Other wildlife animal areas have also been affected.  I have already mentioned butterflies, but moths, hedgehogs, bats and so on are also affected, not to mention bees.  This is at a time when we are just beginning to roll out the all-Ireland pollinator plan.  One policy contradicts another.</p> <p>As has been said before, there are six months in the year when they can already cut the hedges.  I did not quite understand what my colleague from Bantry was saying when he set out that he was one particular kind of farmer whereas there are others.  Perhaps it is a lack of information on my part.  I do not see why being a tillage farmer sowing seeds means one has to rape the hedgerows.  I do not see it at all.  I will leave it there for the time being except to say in conclusion that reviewing legislation from other member states demonstrates that we are quite out of kilter with what is happening there.  They are far more conservation conscious than we are.</p></speech>

Managed hedge cutting will be allowed under strict criteria during August to help to tackle issues such as overgrown hedges on roads.  Controlled burning will also be allowed in certain areas around the country to be specified during March should it be necessary due to adverse weather conditions such as those we had this month.  I had announced a review in late 2014 of section 40 of the Wildlife Act which relates to hedge cutting and burning.  These measures are being implemented as a result of the review.  Over 200 submissions were received in that regard.  I am trying to strike the right balance.  Hedgerows and scrub are important wildlife habitats, but they have to be managed in terms of biodiversity and land management.  I am not changing the closed period.  What we are doing is permitting cutting and burning in a managed way within the current closed system.  I want to collect more information on the impact, if any, of these changes.  I will collect that information on bird life and different hedgerow types during the pilot period.</p> <p>To provide some extra information to the House, my Department is monitoring 59 habitats, 175 NHAs, 100 animal species and 180 bird species.  I have issued a call to experts in the area to get a baseline.  We need to set a baseline as that is important.  We will then monitor the impact of the pilot.  To be clear, the Wildlife Act prevents the disturbing or destroying of nests and, as such, it is incumbent on land owners to ensure that they are not damaging wildlife if they decide to cut or trim back within the specified time of 1 to 31 August during the pilot period.  That law is still there and land owners must be mindful of it.  A two year study to track the breeding outcomes of individuals from several bird species, with particular attention on the yellowhammer, will include hedges that are uncut as well as those subject to cutting in early August.  Additional focus will be given to estimate the bird use of the hedgerows in the study areas outside the breeding season and the linear extent of hedges necessary to provide robust data will have to be estimated as part of the study.  There is also a hedgerow monitoring project aimed at providing robust contemporary data on the extent, timing and intensity of hedge cutting at sample sites around Ireland including but not confined to August.  As such, the Department will consider interested parties contributing to data collection and the use on a pilot basis of the nature conservation web address.</p> <p>I do not want to put these regulations into primary legislation because this is a pilot project.  The legislation remains and this is just giving me a degree of flexibility to carry out the pilot project.  Concern was raised about enforcement.  I will launch a public awareness process for all stakeholders, including local authorities, land owners and members of the public, so that they are fully informed about the restrictions on hedge cutting and trimming.  Enforcement is the job of the authorised officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  They enforce the law and will continue to do so.  I have already advised the House that I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage to align section 70 of the Roads Act on hedge cutting for road safety purposes with section 40 of the Wildlife Act</p></speech>

Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill tabled the amendment 3b, to delete "land" and substitute "roadside" which meant that internal fields could not be cut.  I want to mention that I have an amendment which would mean that 10% of hedgerows in the State.  A huge quantity of hedgerows grow onto the roadside.  It would concern me that it is limited cutting in relation to road safety, a much abused term here.  I want us to be careful that it is limited and I hope that Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill can support my further amendment to that.</p></speech>

I have listened with great interest and intent.  This is our third time here to discuss this Bill.  If nothing else, as the Minister told a previous contributor, she may not have commented on everything but she has been listening and has come today with a lot of information and new points which unfortunately would have been very beneficial had they been in the Bill we received and have now spent over 12 hours discussing.  With a view almost to compromise, we will pursue our amendment, that while we support the main objectives of the Heritage Bill, we will examine any further proposals or amendments at the subsequent legislative stage.</p></speech>

I agree with a great deal of the sentiment expressed around the fact that the section is not relevant to the Bill.  Certainly, it is not relevant to the work of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  It is more akin to the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I read the submission of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the public consultation process on this issue.  It submitted that hedge cutting could have been more comprehensively addressed through reform of section 70 of the Roads Act.  That course of action was not pursued, however.  The eight submissions on hedge cutting by local authority members all focused on roadside hedges as did those by local authorities themselves.</p> <p>There has been condemnation of people who have raised issues on this section because they were perceived to be people who are based in the city.  I have reservations about this element of the Bill and I consider myself a small farmer as someone who grew up on a small farm.  At this time of year, I often work on the family farm at home at weekends as it is the lambing season.  Many of my neighbours who are members of farming organisations are not supportive of a universal permission to allow everyone to cut hedges for an extended period.  There is an agenda among some to open this up as proposed in the Bill, but it is the wrong approach to take.  Arguments have been expressed here today which are balanced and reasonable on introducing legislation based on scientific evidence.  That should always be the backdrop to legislation and changes of this nature which have the potential to affect our natural habitats, wildlife and, indeed, farmlands.  This element of the Bill requires further scrutiny and I support very much the suggestion of Senator Humphreys that the section be referred to committee to undergo further pre-legislative scrutiny before entering D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann so that every interested stakeholder has an opportunity to express an opinion.  It is my understanding that many of the stakeholders who wanted to engage with the Department were not afforded the opportunity to do so, including some of the key interested stakeholder groups.  I have some written correspondence to that effect which has been sent to me.</p> <p>Further scrutiny is required.  In an effort to restrict cutting to roadside hedges, we have submitted an amendment that would have the effect of reducing hedge cutting by more than 81% in circumstances in which 19% of hedgerows intersect the public road network.  That figure came from a consultant who is a hedgerow manager living in County Leitrim.  He gave an excellent presentation in Buswells Hotel prior to the Bill coming before the Seanad.  I have received, as has every Senator, very reasonable, balanced and well-thought-out e-mails and phone calls.  I have met many people, including farmers, to discuss the Bill.  The farmers I know are in receipt of Common Agricultural Policy, or CAP, money.  In the previous Seanad, I was Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson for agriculture and I advocated for a fairer, more balanced payments mechanism under the CAP so that moneys would be taken away from the east coast and provided to the west coast of Ireland.  In other words, it should be removed from the larger intensive farmers, such as the Larry Goodmans of this world, who are in receipt of over &euro;500,000 of CAP money and transferred to rural areas in economic decline where it would be better spent.  In those areas, people are leaving because the family farm is no longer viable and people are struggling, particularly elderly farmers, to maintain the farm enterprise.  The money could have been better spent but that did not happen.  Some of the farming organisations opposed that proposal, which I fail to understand.  They had no credible justification apart from the protectionism that exists for the bigger intensive farmers.  In any event, there are conditions attaching to the money available under the CAP and those conditions relate to greening, GLAS, REPS and environmental protections to protect natural habitats.</p> <p>While farmed animals are farmed, other animals also exist on our landmass which I understand comprises 6.9 million ha and they are protected under legislation underpinned in the Minister's own Department.  That is why I fail to understand why legislation is being introduced which is in stark contrast to the legislation protecting those species within the Minister's Department, which is without scientific justification and which will result in the widescale destruction of habitats, including hedgerows.  Unfortunately, the scientific evidence is lacking in Ireland for this.  However, my attention was drawn to scientific evidence from our nearest neighbour, Britain, which shows that widescale cutting of hedges destroys natural habitats, including flowers.  We have even had the beekeeping community contacting us on this, because they are being affected.  The honey bee is affected.  There are many implications which I am not qualified to go into in detail, but we should listen to all of the concerns that are being raised.  The best mechanism to do that is the committee system.</p> <p>In the meantime, we will press the amendment to restrict this to roadside hedges.  It was said in previous debates that road safety was the driving force behind the introduction of hedge cutting.  If that is the case, I am sure the Government parties will have no hesitation in accepting the amendment.  It deals with that issue.  If there are particular issues around tillage farmers who may require a special dispensation, that can be dealt with also.  However, it is something that should be teased out at the relevant committee where all stakeholders have an opportunity to express a viewpoint.  I concur with my colleague Senator Mark Daly and put the Minister on notice that we will press this amendment to restrict hedge cutting.</p></speech>

We also need to make sure we are supporting the two issues that are before us today.  I am very disappointed that Fianna F&aacute;il has brought this amendment before us today.

Second, we will ensure we are supporting farmers with regard to tillage and reseeding and, third, we will ensure we have better visibility on our roads.  They are the objectives of the Bill before us.  I am very disappointed by the proposed substitution of the term "roadside".

It is disappointing.  We deserve better than this.  With this amendment, Fianna F&aacute;il is telling farmers who want the opportunity to reseed or grow winter grain that there is nothing that can be done about it, that it is their issue and Fianna F&aacute;il will not step in.  Fianna F&aacute;il is blatantly stopping this from going ahead.  It is appalling.  This is politics on a different level than I ever thought I would see.</p> <p>At the end of the day, these people are trying to make a living.  They do not want to go out and spend money cutting hedges.  They do not want to spend time cutting hedges.  They do not have an agenda about cutting hedges.  They want to survive in rural Ireland.  It is damn hard to survive in rural Ireland at the moment.  It is damn hard to survive.  We are putting another impediment in their way today.</p> <p>We have the opportunity to amend this legislation.  I appeal to Fianna F&aacute;il Senators not to press this amendment.  I realise they might be under pressure from above but at the end of the day the farming community will not thank them if they push this forward.  This is a common sense proposal.  We are on about trimming hedges.  We are not on about cutting them back.  We are on about 31 days and it is logical all the way through.  The Minister has explained the logic.  It is a pilot scheme for two years with reports to come back to the House for due consideration.  What more can we do?  We need to look after our communities.  We need to look after everyone if we can.  This amendment will not take care of the farming community.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill said the public will not be thankful when it comes to the polling booths.  I assure the House, when it comes to the polling booths, Fianna F&aacute;il will not be thanked for what it is doing to the farmers here today.</p></speech>

What kind of eejits does the Senator think there are in Seanad &Eacute;ireann?  Sowing seeds underneath the hedges - I never heard anything like it.  It is absolute rubbish.  I hope Fianna F&aacute;il will press the amendment.  It refers to public roads.  It seems to be a very sensible amendment.  I wonder if the Minister will consider accepting it or it might be put back in on Report Stage.  It has a very beneficial effect of removing over three quarters of the hedgerows.</p></speech>

President Michael D. Higgins has said, "Democracy is always and must always be a work in progress, and how we use the independence we have been gifted will continue to challenge us morally and ethically."  These words were spoken by him during a speech in the RDS on 26 March 2016 at a State event for relatives of those who participated in the Easter Rising.  I think about the context in which President Higgins spoke of independence in the centenary year.  The independence of a nation, the journey into the future is a collective journey, and I am mindful that a recent announcement by the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, to extend Presidential voting rights to the global Irish diaspora and to citizens in the North of Ireland.  That is a welcome and a positive development.  Ireland extends far beyond the border that divides us and the coastal boundaries of our islands.</p> <p>Four years after the Constitutional Convention proposed Presidential voting rights, movement and initiative have now followed.  Now, more than ever our collective response to a fractured world must be truly inclusive.  Ireland as a model republic that facilitates a collective journey in which the Irish at home and away truly identify, partake and take ownership of the narrative, where citizen engagement is cherished and where active citizenship can thrive.  That is the essence of republicanism.  A positive outcome in that the upcoming referendum on the extension of Presidential voting rights will be transformative.  This Electoral (Amendment) (Voting at 16) Bill 2016 will be equally transformative.  </p> <p>If we choose to widen the electoral franchise to include citizens who have reached the age of 16 years our society will reap rewards and profit from the inclusion of our young people in the part of the political process that is most local and most international, elections to local government and to the European Parliament.  This is achievable through legislation alone, legislation that will energise and bring dynamism unique to both elections.  </p> <p>Why should we follow the example set by Norway, Austria, Scotland and others?  Why should we draw on the experience of our young people in constructing the foundations of that model republic, a model republic as a beacon of hope for people everywhere?  In Scotland 75% of 16 and 17 year olds cast their vote when afforded the opportunity.  That right is now afforded them in all Scottish elections and enjoys a high level of public support.  When addressing the Seanad in 2016, First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, reiterated her support for voting rights for those who have reached 16 and 17 years.  The voting age in Norwegian local elections was lowered to 16 years in 2011 as a trial in 21 municipalities.  Some 58% of 16 and 17 year olds cast their vote.  That number was far higher than the turnout of regular first time voters between the ages of 18 and 21.  In 2007, Austria lowered its legal voting age in all elections.  Turnout among this age group was over 65% and research into this case study shows a high level of political maturity when casting a vote for the first time.  </p> <p>Another reason to support the Bill today is because the proposal was supported by the Constitutional Convention.  This legislation is recognition of the wishes of citizens as expressed and set out through the structures of this State and of Government.  A majority of the Constitutional Convention members in March 2013 favoured a change to the Constitution to lower the voting age and, if making such a change, a majority opted for a reduction to 16 years of age.  The Constitutional Convention was not established to just explore optional extras.  Today is our chance to realise its demand.  Let the Seanad be the House that does so.  </p> <p>When addressing the State event for relatives of those who participated in the Easter Rising, President Higgins went on to say, "We must ensure that our journey into the future is a collective one; one in which the homeless, the migrant, the disadvantaged, the marginalised and each and every citizen can find homes, are fellow travellers on our journey which includes all of the multitude of voices that together speak of, and for a new Ireland born out of contemporary imagination and challenges".  It is my firm belief that young people must no longer be left out of the national conversation.  Young people are at the cutting edge of change; 16 and 17 year olds must be facilitated in channelling that desire for change, in channelling their contemporary imagination.  Cannot we Senators do better in facilitating young people in holding the representatives to account or would that be a dangerous move, a bold move, and create problems for the established norms or backfire on some of those involved in the political system?  Ideally, yes, because certain things are so much more important than private self interest.</p> <p>Some 165,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 have left this State since Fine Gael took office in February 2011.  One in six young people born in this State now live abroad.  At 14.5%, youth unemployment between the ages of 15 and 24 remains stubbornly high and has only decreased by 0.8% since I tabled this Bill in June 2016.  Youth unemployment is more than double the overall unemployment rate.  Activation schemes such as JobBridge and Gateway have fostered attitudes that young people and graduates are a cheap form of labour at a time when young people are vulnerable in work places relative to the arts, to retail, to care and hospitality sectors.  Young people are tired of hearing how Ireland can be the best small country for this and that.  That is not the language of hope, it is not the language of optimism.  We can be world leaders in everything that we do.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We can achieve that by drawing on the experiences of the old and young, by doing less and listening more, and drawing on the experiences of the homes and homeless Irish abroad and the old homes of the new Irish.

I was also involved in a campaign to change loads of different school policies.  As a young person, I believed I was well capable of making a political decision regarding where my vote should go.  I knew at the age of 16 after I left the room having met local Deputies and other public representatives in An Cos&aacute;n at a voting workshop who I would vote for and would I would not vote for, and who represented my voice and who did not.  That has not changed to this date.  People think one will vote one way when one is so young and somehow one is not mature enough, and that view that one has then will change as one gets older.  There is not much difference between being 16 and being 18.  The majority of the research for my contribution was carried out under the lead of Eoin, a 15 year old work experience student in my office.  He is present in the Visitors Gallery.  He has worked for me all year and he has led the research on the voting age and engaged with approximately 600 students from 28 DEIS schools.  He will be 16 when the next election is held and he is well capable of making a decision on where his vote will go.</p><p>What we are seeing today is fear on the part of establishment politicians that the youth vote will not go their way and that is why the amendment is designed to stall the legislation.  There is fear of a shift because the views of young people are no longer represented in politics.  That means Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are standing in the way of the democratic process.  They fear for themselves in respect where these votes will go.  The DEIS students had significant knowledge about this field.  A total of 418 out of 600 students who filled out a survey said they would vote if they were given the chance.  They highlighted issues such as LGBT rights, the eighth amendment, homelessness, the rise of right wing populism, the exit of the UK from the EU, hospital overcrowding, mental health services, Irish unity and reunification.  They know their politics and they are engaged.  It is an awful shame to see politicians getting in the way of that.  When asked if they would vote, 75% said they would.  That reflects the turnout in Scotland when it lowered the voting age.  When asked what influenced their voting decision, they mentioned friends, family, speeches by politicians, debates between politicians, one's own political beliefs, the traditional media and political advertising.</p><p>I was sent a few messages regarding a document Fine Gael issued in respect of the amendment.  These show that there are no solid reasons to oppose this legislation.  One of the reasons given by Fine Gael was that &quot;Minister Coveney needs time to consider the issue further&quot;.  That is ridiculous.  We are on Second Stage in this House.  There are three more Stages in this House followed by five in the D&aacute;il.  This is a long process and there is plenty time for consideration.  Another reason given by Fine Gael, which is supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, was that &quot;The Bill would create a divide between those who can vote at EU-local elections and general-presidential elections&quot;.  There is already a divide between who can vote in those sets of elections.  We have legislated for non-EU citizens to vote in local elections and deemed them ineligible to vote in general and presidential elections, and referenda.  It is not a new, radical or unusual idea in Irish politics to set different eligibility criteria for different elections and I cannot see how Fine Gael can justify blocking that.</p><p>Fine Gael have stated that &quot;It is not clear there is public support for reducing the voting age; therefore we need to have a referendum on the issue&quot;.  Again, this is a weak argument.  We make decisions all the time in the Oireachtas for which we do not seek full public support.  Sometimes we just choose to do what is right.  According to Fine Gael:</p><blockquote>Lowering the voting age needs to be accompanied by a civic education programme to prepare and inform 16 and 17 year olds for being able to vote.  The new Politics and Society class needs to be given time to better inform students.</blockquote> <p>This is also a Fianna F&aacute;il argument.  It is an extraordinarily offensive idea that only through a formal education programme can a young person become informed enough and engaged enough to be able to vote.  Young people are in the Gallery.  They are ready and we should listen to them.Politics and society is a new leaving certificate subject.  Should we all give up our vote and return to school to sit this subject?  All of us have voted since we turned 18 and none of us took that subject.  We were influenced by our parents, families, neighbours and our environment.  I have a 16 year old who is at work all day today.She has worked and paid tax since she was 14, but she is still not eligible to vote.  The State says that young people like her can contribute to society but they will not have a voice in saying who will represent them.</p><p>Fine Gael also said that &quot;There is ambiguity around the constitutionality of amending the voting age&quot;.  I would be curious to read the details of the Government&rsquo;s legal advice on this issue.  I just had a quick read of the Constitution.  Article 16 sets 18 as the age for D&aacute;il elections, with other parts of the Constitution linking eligibility at presidential elections and referenda to D&aacute;il eligibility.  Nowhere does the Constitution make any reference to eligibility for other elections and, indeed, Article 28A, in the section relating to local government, states that the right to vote of persons in local elections will be determined by law.We are debating a law.  The Government&rsquo;s response is contradicted by the text of our own Constitution.  It is very important to get involved in local politics.  Local councillors are involved in youth clubs, schools and GAA clubs, and their offices are at the end of the road.  If young people become engaged at local level when they are aged 16 with the person they can recognise in their own community who is accessible to them, they will remain engaged by the time they turn 18 to become involved in national politics.</p><p>The Fianna F&aacute;il manifesto states that the party wants to trial lowering the voting age to 16 in local and European elections in 2019, yet it supports the amendment, which does the opposite and pushes the date for lowering the age back.  By the time we get through the process proposed at the end of the year, it will be too late for 16 year olds to register.  I am looking to Fianna F&aacute;il to change their minds in the next hour after we have heard everybody else's contribution.</p></speech>

It is probably out of context but I thought it was a good line.  He said, &quot;Children are not stupid&quot;.  He was referring to the choices people make when it comes to tobacco legislation.  When it comes to this legislation, my comments might seem a little out of kilter with the Government and I will explain that later.  At the end of the day, when people are aged 16 and 17, they are old enough to work, pay tax, drive, join the Army and, God forbid, die for their country, but yet we still rob them of the right to participate fully in our democracy.  This issue has been a journey for me.  When I was involved in youth politics, I firmly opposed ever changing the voting age from 18 to 16 and the flimsy excuse I used at the time was that we did not have proper political education in schools and that civic engagement.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Neale Richmond:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a rubbish excuse because you do not need that formal political and civic education to know what your community and society is all about.  Despite this, I am delighted to say that subject is being brought in by the Government.  It is a very positive thing and should be embraced as such.  </p><p>As I have explained, I am on a personal journey.  The party of which I am a member, and of which I chose to be a member at the age of 19 while having no family ties to it, is also on a journey when it comes to this issue.  I accept that the vast majority within my party, and probably within Government as the Minister of State himself can address in due course, are not where I am on this issue.  I remind the House that when I joined Fine Gael the party had just about gotten its head around civil unions, let alone marriage equality.  When I joined Fine Gael it had quite different positions, particularly in social areas, than it does now.  Parties need time to change and unfortunately we cannot always push that change as fast as individual members would like.  I admit, as I said throughout my seven years on the county council, that if I agree with Fine Gael 75% of the time, I am doing well.  </p><p>I chose to join a party, however, because I believe in party politics.  While I fully respect those who are representatives of other parties or none, for me the party system is the best way to actually achieve things and get things done.  In turn, one has to make personal sacrifices, put one's pride aside and, although I hate to say it, put one's principles aside and accept that one's colleagues are not necessarily there yet or that one's full opinions are not exactly those of the party.  That does not mean that a person must stop believing in something and cannot keep pushing for something internally.  I could have very easily stood up here and read the excellent notes prepared by our press office and our Government office about why the amendment is being pushed, exactly what the Minister of State will say in due course.  I will not do that.  I will be frank because I fully respect-----</p></speech>

Most of us in this Chamber have been someway involved in politics.  Voting is crucial to us, whether it is part of our life or whether it is part of a tradition that we have been brought in.  People fought and died for their vote.  They fought so hard for their vote and I believe it is crucial that we remember that.</p> <p>I am here as the Fianna F&aacute;il Senator.  The Bill seeks to amend the Electoral Act 1992 to lower the voting age for the European and local elections to 16 years.  We support the principle of the Bill but we believe that the proper scrutiny should take place before it goes to Committee Stage.  There are many models around the world, as we have been told.  In Australia one can vote at 16 years, although it seems one has to have a job before one can vote.  There are also the Estonian, Scottish and many south American models.  EU citizens have to be 18 years of age before they can vote.  Fianna F&aacute;il supports a referendum on lowering the voting age to 16 years as we believe this is truly an issue for Irish people to debate and decide.  That is crucial.  When I think of it, originally the abolishment of the Seanad was a massive issue and it went to the people in a referendum.  They made that correct choice.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il have stuck by the Seanad.  We are all here today because Fianna F&aacute;il delivered on what we said we would do.  We went out, against all other parties I might add,-----</p></speech>

Again, however, it is up to the Irish people in a referendum.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.  I feel people need to learn about voting and money needs to be put in to educate people on how crucial voting is.  I do not care what age one is, from 16 up to 90, to vote is such a privilege.  Statistics show that there has been a massive downwards trend in the turnouts for European and local elections.  I believe, that by giving younger people the vote, that will change.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il are going to work to make sure that young people of 16 will be able to vote.  We want it to go to a referendum.</p> <p>I ask the Government and the Minister of State to introduce a voter education programme in secondary schools to promote awareness of voting, but also a voting awareness campaign.  There is not point in holding a referendum to allow younger people to vote, although that would be very welcome, if we do not make sure that the other Irish citizens, that are not coming out to vote, are encouraged to vote.  Going forward from here, we need a referendum, we need our young people to vote, we need the Irish people to stand up as they did for the Seanad.  We also need to make sure that this Government, or any other Government, delivers and that everybody should know how important it is to use their crucial vote, whether in local, European or general elections.  People need to get out and use their votes.</p></speech>

As has been noted on the record of this House countless times, including earlier today, I have been very supportive of extending voting rights in Presidential elections to the Irish living abroad.  I would also like to lend my support to giving the youth of Ireland a voice at a local and European level.  Both will go towards implementing the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention of 2013.</p> <p>Giving a vote to 16 and 17 year-olds in local and European elections presents a unique opportunity to better educate the youth of Ireland in politics.  Research has shown that a vote in a person's first election leads to an increase in active citizenship.  This is a time in young people's lives, before they go to college, when they can still be contacted in their home constituency to educate them on politics.  It allows parents the opportunity to educate their young adults on democracy and the functions of both our State and the European Union.  A vote in these elections will not only encourage young people to vote in the future, it will also encourage them to register to vote, as most 16 and 17 year-olds are still in second level education.  Logistically, it would be easy to assist them in registering, again having a knock-on effect for future elections.  Scotland, since giving 16 to 17 year-olds a vote in their independence referendum, which saw a turnout of almost 75% of their young voters, has seen increased involvement from young people in politics, which shows clearly that the evidence is there.  </p> <p>This could help change the agenda of local politics.  Too often we hear that there are not enough amenities for young people, that they are not represented adequately and that they are left out of the community.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Billy Lawless:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2485"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2485&amp;amp;pid=BillyLawless&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Giving them a vote at this age would encourage local politicians to look at the issues facing young people in their communities.  Perhaps we might even see more young people become involved in politics at local level.  In 2015 the European Parliament passed a recommendation that the voting age in EU elections be reduced to 16 years in all member states.  From what I gather, we will still be in the European Union.  As Article 50 has been triggered by the United Kingdom and arguably with growing euro-scepticism across Europe and even further afield, there has never been a better time to educate the youth of Ireland on the work done by our MEPs and the benefits of Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the European Union, particularly in these turbulent times.  As such, just like Irish citizens living in the United States where I live, giving them a would greatly enable the young people of Ireland to truly engage with the political system.  Thus, I will be giving the Bill my full support.</p></speech>

Sorry about my personal feelings, but I will put them aside because the Whip states they cannot have it."  Lesson No. 2 in politics is: "Kick it to a referendum if we do not want to do it and we might get to it in about 25 years time".  It is absolutely outrageous that Senators are going against the Bill.  We are talking about bringing the political system to 16 year olds.  Having worked with young people for 25 years, I can guarantee the House that they will vote.  What is wrong?  Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have not yet had the chance to infiltrate them to ensure they will get their votes.

I was a member of the Constitutional convention when this issue was debated and we heard evidence from experts and so on.  Anyone, like me, who has dealings with young people in visiting schools to talk in CSPE classes, dealing with members of Young Fine Gael and seeing D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g in action could only but be impressed by them and think there is a great future for the country; they just have to be captured, cultivated, supported, nurtured and encouraged.  Nowadays there is no point in telling a young person, &quot;This is it.&quot;  More dialogue and conversation is required.  In many respects, it is more empowering for young people and puts us so-called adults on our toes more.  It is a different dynamic and very much part of our times.  Parents, teachers and youth workers, in particular, know this.  However, I do not agree with the proposal and I will tell the House why.</p><p><b></b>We are all entitled to our views, but I have a concern.  I have worked with young people and do not wish to diminish any young person, his or her potential or capacity.  At the end of the day, however, are we way too much in a hurry to make a young person an adult or an older person?  This would expand the age of voting to include younger people who are becoming sexualised at an earlier age and so on.  Our job as adults is to protect, nurture and cultivate young people.  They will come to a point which in many societies is called a rite of passage.  In this country the age of majority is 18 years.  To my mind, in general, this is the point at which one passes into adulthood.</p><p>We know that there are young people who are very clued into politics.  I am speaking about people younger than 18 years who cannot vote.  I do not seek to diminish their interest, but I was a member of the Constitutional Convention when this topic was debated and it struck me that reducing the age <i>per se</i>would not be an assurance of participation.  This is also shown in the research.  For ourselves and young people who will come after us, we must encourage people to be more aware in a constructive fashion.  In this time and era we are very concerned about individuals having their rights.  We speak about the rights of the individual daily in this House, but we are connected to a community.  There is a civic connection that sometimes involves the horrible term &quot;self-sacrifice&quot;, which is part of what parents do for their children.  It is about giving.  We pay our taxes, although we may debate how they are spent, in order that we will have services.  This is tied intrinsically to the age of majority.  Young people work and pay taxes but, equally, we have regulations that protect them and give them special treatment when they are working.  They are not treated in the same way as adults in that regard.</p><p>On the age of criminal responsibility, a person under 18 years is a minor and treated differently from someone older.  The juvenile system focuses on the rehabilitation of young people who commit even serious crimes as opposed to the full thrust and implications of the criminal justice system.  One has to be 18 years of age to get married.  There are exceptions, but an application has to be made to the Circuit Court or the High Court.  In December 2015 the Government announced that it was looking to do away with this exception and that everyone would have to be 18 years of age to marry.  In the area of social services the State is responsible for the welfare of a minor until he or she reaches 18 years of age.  It can be argued that historically this has not been done very well in many cases, especially in cases involving those with disabilities which have come to light in recent times.  Nonetheless, that is the law. </p><p>There are restrictions on enforcing contracts with minors.  The most clear-cut case of a contract that is enforceable against a minor is a contract for necessaries, that is, something a minor actually needs.  If a minor, that is, someone under 18 years, gives a gift, it can be taken back while he or she is still a minor or he or she can have a change of heart on reaching the age of majority.  If a minor signs something related to a land transaction, it can be voided within a reasonable period once he or she reaches the age of majority.  In tort, the civil side to wrongdoing, minors have protections in their actions and activities.</p><p>Until the 1980s - I forget the year - the age of majority was 21 years.  The Law Reform Commission examined what this meant and why it should be reduced.  I agree that there is room for further debate.  This issue is bigger than any political party.  However, there is nothing wrong with acknowledging a young person's interest but noting that, for various reasons, he or she is still not an adult.  I am sure Senator Lynn Ruane and others might query why the age is 18 years.  However, what is wrong with telling young people that they have to wait until they reach 17 or 18 years of age?  We can hope that at that point people will be sufficiently engaged.  There is much more scope to expand the abilities of all young people to engage in a meaningful way and realise the power of their vote.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michelle Mulherin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2309"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2309&amp;amp;pid=MichelleMulherin&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The concept of one person, one vote is the most powerful thing.

It is an equaliser.  Whether I am President, a teacher or a person voting for the first time at 18 years of age, my vote has the exact same value.  It is a very beautiful concept.</p><p>We are pushing people towards becoming adults earlier and earlier.  We should be nurturing young people and encouraging talent, interest and participation.  I am not convinced that equates to extending the franchise to a 16 year old.  I have an open mind, notwithstanding what I have said.  They are my general sentiments.</p></speech>

The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act almost collapsed the Government, if memory serves.</p> <p>It is, therefore, of no surprise to me or members of my party that a very progressive and innovative change to the voting law proposed by Senators Warfield and Ruane would be objected to by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  I am wondering of what they are afraid.  Are they afraid of young people? </p> <p>Imagine the dynamic in a local or European election when a candidate knocks on a door and a young person wearing a school uniform answers it.  For the first time, the candidate will not ask if the person's mammy is in because he or she would have to listen to somebody who is in school and possibly going through all of the horrendous things that Senator Mulherin related.  How are we supposed to learn about the lives of 16 or 17 year olds if we do not have to act on their opinions?  Would it not be fantastically engaging to have a line of local election candidates in a secondary school or a youth club answering questions from young people as to what they are going to do with the property tax and what services would be improved?  </p> <p>I hate to tell the House this, but I am a guy with a mortgage and when one has a mortgage one gets a bit weird and begins to worry about stuff that will happen in one's area.  One becomes a little bit more conservative when it comes to halting sites, injecting and drug treatment centres and social housing.  Would not it be wonderful if a generation of young people without mortgages could stand up for decency, equality, public services and the things in which they fundamentally believe before they are beaten into the ground by our obsession with living in a capitalist society that chains them to mortgages and holding onto their castles for the rest of their lives?</p> <p>I spent 11 years as a teacher and learned more from the children I taught than I ever taught them.  I am fully behind this suggestion.  I remind everybody in the Chamber that when the Constitutional Convention decided, in its wisdom, that we should do such radical things as removing suggestions that women belong in the home from the Constitution and one should have the right to marry the person one loves, it was also asked whether it wanted to reduce the voting age to 17 years of age.  It said "No" and instead recommended that it should be reduced to 16 years of age.  We do not need a referendum to do what Senators Warfield and Ruane are suggesting.  What is actually needed is legislation.</p> <p>Everybody has spoken about the Scottish experience when it held a referendum on independence and the number of young people who finally engaged in the democratic process.  I believe in the idealism of youth.  It would be wonderful to allow younger people to vote.</p> <p>When people turn 18, they have their first chance to vote and are more likely to be disconnected from their home because they may in college and are living away from home.  If the buses are on strike because the Minister concerned does not want to know about it, young people will find it difficult to travel back to where they are from in order to cast their votes.  If young people were still living in the area where they could vote for the first time that would provide a fantastic opportunity for local politics and councils to engage.  They are very much part of the lives of young people, in terms of local facilities and infrastructure.</p> <p>I am not surprised by the opposition of Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il to the proposal, rather I am disappointed.  In fairness, they have said they are willing to work in order to make this a reality but, to be honest, if they fundamentally believed in it and young people, they would back the proposal.</p></speech>

I was interested to hear that people died for the vote.  If they did, they were complete bloody fools because we have had universal suffrage in this country since I do not know when.</p> <p>The Bill should be referred to a committee or some other forum.  It is a one-page Bill with three single sentence sections.  I do not see anything terribly complicated about referring it to anywhere.</p> <p>I laughed when I heard Fianna F&aacute;il claiming credit for saving the Seanad.  Let me tell Senator Murnane O'Connor that three Independent Senators turned around the campaign within the last three weeks when the political parties were losing it hand over fist.  I can say that from personal experience because I was here at the time.</p> <p>It is wonderful for young people to be involved in the political process.  They should be involved at as young an age as possible.  I would stop a hell of a lot of old men and women from having the vote if I possibly could.  There should be an intelligence test. </p> <p>I do not believe any large group of people, whether young, old or half-baked, should be sucked up to in a populist fashion.  Voting for people is a real responsibility.  Apart from other speakers, I honour Senator Richmond for speaking his mind.  It was very good that he said his political conviction was that young people should be able to vote and he will argue that within the party.  If one is in a party, that is what has to happen.  That is why I never joined a party in my life.  I wanted the freedom to say and do whatever I liked.</p></speech>

I got it on despite the fact that it was a highly managed event.  It was actually micro-managed.  There were Government officers going around the place focusing, organising, selecting items for the agenda and all the rest of it.  Despite them, I managed to table a motion to extend to the general public the right to nominate candidates for the presidency.  It was passed by 97% of the vote.  It was by far the highest vote yet it has been completely and utterly ignored by the political parties.  That is an important issue.  By the way, one of my political colleagues got into a terrible temper about this and said it was because I was going to run for the presidency again.  I have not the slightest intention of going near it again.</p></speech>

Somebody younger and who is vital is needed in that role.  As the highest office in the State, it should not be managed by the political parties.  In a presidential election, everything is controlled in the interests of the political parties, including the funding regime, the propaganda and the nominations process.  Absolutely everything is held tight in the grip of the political parties and that grip should be loosened.  Young people should be given the opportunity to participate fully and the general population should be allowed to nominate candidates for the office.</p> <p>I support the Bill and compliment Senator Warfield for putting it down.  It is a highly imaginative proposal and a perfectly simple Bill.  What is all the fuss about?  It is one page long and contains three single sentences.  I am going off to have my tea.</p></speech>

I have listened carefully to many points from all sides, including differing perspectives from within my own party, Fine Gael.  Senator Richmond outlined his views while Senator Mulherin outlined her opposite view.  I will be frank and open at the outset that my position is more aligned with that of Senator Mulherin as I will explain in the next few minutes.  Before doing so, I note that we need more civic engagement and activism.  We need to encourage that at local level whether people are young, old or in between.  It is through that engagement and experience of activism in community groups and through general life experience that people form views and values in terms of where they stand politically and where they would like to see their country and their people going.</p> <p>My fundamental belief is that at 16 years of age, young people are developing those formative views.  They are very open to influence but they are also of their own mind.  I listened carefully to Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in who said that after 11 years as a teacher, he had learned a great deal from the children he taught.  Certainly, I believe that and over 24 years as an uncle and 14 as a parent, I too have learned a great deal from the young people in my close-knit family.  However, I am simply not convinced that they are ready to formulate views that will impact substantially in the electoral process.  Those are their formative years and they should be given the time and space to develop their views.  It is a responsibility that some of them may not even want.  Having said that, I acknowledge that I have received considerable correspondence from 16 year olds who want this change.</p> <p>While I do not want to politicise the debate, I note to Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in that Fine Gael is not afraid of young people.  I have been a Fine Gael representative for over 18 years but I was never a member of Young Fine Gael.  I was more active in my community.  I remember when there was no youth club in my area engaging with other young people to form one.  I became a chairman of that youth club at 15 years of age.  I have been involved in scouting, the GAA and many more local youth groups which I continue to support in their activism.  That does not mean that activism should extend to voting at that age.  There are other issues which are exercising their minds and taking up the energies of young people to a far greater extent at that age.  Fine Gael's position this evening is to respect that there are quite a number of people who feel the legislation should change and that people should be allowed to vote at 16.  We are saying that to decide on it here is, however, premature.</p> <p>Perhaps we should widen the debate.  I am one of the many politicians here that visit schools regularly and invite them to the Oireachtas.  Rather than just have pre-organised statements, questions and answers, I always take the opportunity to organise with teachers beforehand to engage in real debate.  I sometimes bring little plebiscites into a school and that creates a bit of excitement and engagement.  One of the questions I always ask children is whether, if they had a vote in the morning, they would like to have six months off and six months on at school.  A lot of the time, they vote to have six months off.  I then ask whether that is in their long-term best interests.  In the same session, they then disagree with what they voted for.  We are developing the debate and the mindset and when one throws out a question, it is easy to give a populist answer.  It is often the case here.  It is just an example of some of the engagement I have had with young people.  They thoroughly enjoy it and so do I.</p> <p>I respect all views, as do we all.  Certainly, I will not attack anyone who believes we should have voting at 16.  Personally, I consider it to be premature and I remain to be convinced of why the age should be reduced.  Having said that, if I hear something from future debates or there is a groundswell among young people in school and among the general population that this should change, I will be open to changing my view also, as any democratic should be.  However, it is premature now and it places a responsibility on young shoulders for which they may not be ready as they develop in their formative years.  They have enough to bother and worry them than subjecting them to influences of all kinds.  I understand where Senator Norris was coming from when he spoke about political parties and others who might try to influence.  If we are honest about it, they might utilise means which are not fair to young people to influence them to express a vote in a certain way.  I do not want to be part of that.  Adults have that responsibility and that is where it should remain.</p></speech>

I rise very much in support of the Bill.  I rise very much in support of the mechanics of it but also very much in the sentiment of it as well.  While, to be fair, elements of the debate have been very fair up to this point, it is also the case, as we have heard this afternoon, that politicians sometimes fall into the trap of showering young people with platitudes.  There is this notion of "Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;".  We have the opportunity to do something to respect, embolden, empower and enfranchise young people today so why would we not take it?  Why would we not want to give young people a say in how the State is run?  They are impacted by it.  As many have said, young people can be taxed at 16 and do a whole range of things.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A Fine Gael contributor made a point about how much the State impacted on the lives of young people, be it through the courts system, education or so on.  The State permeates every aspect of their lives, yet they do not have a say in the Government's policy direction.  That is a shame and runs contrary to broader popular opinion, which wants young people to be entrusted with something.  That would inspire them to get involved in civic and political life.  We cannot teach people how to get involved.  We must entrust them.</p><p>We have heard much today.  We are all visited by schools and in turn visit them, youth clubs, etc., but it is not the case that young people only exist in schools, do not have lives beyond the classroom and do not have emotions, experiences, working lives, etc.  We are doing young people a disservice if we only see them through that prism.  I do not view them that way.  The bulk of young people whom I meet are political activists.  They were involved in the election in the North a few weeks ago.  They were getting dressed up as crocodiles and demanding their rights as Irish speakers.  They took to the steps of Stormont two days ago because they wanted a positive, equality-driven resolution to the talks process.  They are the young people whom I see.  Why would we not trust them with a vote?  That is the core question today.</p><p>Since entering this institution, it has been my experience that Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il do not like giving people votes, be those people who are 16 years of age, the diaspora, Irish citizens in the North-----</p></speech>

Maith th&uacute; for trying.</p> <p>I have a great deal of respect for Senator Richmond's position.  He was honest and forthright when he said that he wanted to back this Bill but was unable to because of the view of his party.  However, he did not explain why his party had that view.  That is not good enough.  The Senator does young people a disservice by simply saying that he would love to do this but cannot, certainly if there is no credible or reasonable argument for that.  Senator Ruane touched on how some of the establishment parties are afraid of young people because their policy decisions of recent years have punished young people the most, forced them to emigrate and left them unable to find jobs or homes and lingering on housing waiting lists.  That is the crux of the matter.  Fianna F&aacute;il tells us that it saved the Seanad, but what has it done in the Seanad?</p></speech>

Here we have an opportunity to do something that is positive, engaging and enfranchises our younger citizens, so why would Fianna F&aacute;il not take it?  What is the point in saving the Seanad if Fianna F&aacute;il is just going to come in here and nod the head at everything that Fine Gael tells it to do?  That is not the kind of Seanad that I want to see.  I want a Seanad that plays a pivotal role and tells young citizens and citizens in the diaspora and the North that it cherishes and values them and will enfranchise and make them a part of the political life of this country.  That is what we should be doing.</p> <p>I wish to touch on a final point before splitting my time with Senator Gavan, who only wants one minute.  Senator Norris made a fair point about young people voting in general elections.  He was spot on, but it would have required an amendment to the Constitution, which is something that the Seanad is as yet unable to commence.  One never knows what we can do down the line.  This Bill is about utilising our power to effect and implement change.</p> <p>A Bill was introduced by Deputy Adams in the previous D&aacute;il concerning an issue that I raise regularly, namely, voting rights in presidential elections for the diaspora and citizens in the North.  Alongside giving the vote, that Bill would have lowered the voting age to 16 years.  The parties that are now kicking this Bill down the line voted for that Bill.  What has changed?  They trusted 16 year olds in the previous D&aacute;il, but they do not trust them now.  New politics, same old story.</p></speech>

It was in 1973 after a referendum was conducted in 1972.  The proposal was passed by over 300,000 votes.  In May 2015, a proposal was put, by way of referendum, to reduce the age of persons deemed eligible to stand for a presidential election from 35 to 21 years of age.  The proposal was overwhelmingly defeated by a vote of almost three to one.  I am not at all convinced that if we put this current proposal to the people, by way of referendum, that it would be carried.  I agree with what my colleague, Senator Murnane O'Connor, said that we need to educate the people positively towards the reasoning behind affording 16 year olds an opportunity vote.</p></speech>

Senator Norris is right that the Bill consists of three paragraphs on two pages.  Let us be clear what this Bill is about.  It states:  "An Act to reduce to sixteen years the age at which a person is entitled to be registered as a European Parliament and Local Government Elector, and to provide for related matters."  That is simple. </p> <p>It is possible on this very day for the Taoiseach to nominate a 16 year old to be a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  </p></speech>

They bring a vast energy, enthusiasm and commitment to their own communities and to life itself.  We have seen the track record of young people engaging in environmental issues and in many referenda and we have seen them actively participate in communities.  I was been a councillor for many years so I know how young people engage, particularly as advocates for their community, sports facilities, etc.  Things have happened in my county that would never have happened if young people had not engaged.</p> <p>There are local youth parliaments in 31 local authorities.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs gave &euro;20,000 to each of those last week and on that occasion she asked them to engage and use the funding to address issues relating to inequality, homophobia, bullying and IT.  She spelled out different areas that she would like them to pursue in youth parliaments.  She is another Minister who has recognised the capacity, capability and commitment of young people.</p> <p>Many young people want to be involved in various facets of life.  It is interesting to learn what the law permits 16 and 17 year olds to do in this State.  Let us remember that we are in a republic so at all times we must advocate the principles of a true republic.  The law allows consent to medical treatment at the age of 16.  They have an absolute right at the age of 16 to consent to it if they so wish.  They have the ability to leave school and enter work or training at 16 and 17 years of age if they so wish.  They pay income tax, PRSI and USC in many cases and I spoke to a 17 year old today who pays all three of them.  They can obtain tax credits and welfare benefits in their own right.  The common age of consensual sexual consent, whether heterosexual, homosexual or any other orientation, is 17 years of age.  I checked that fact today.  Like anyone else, they are entitled to enter into meaningful, loving relationships.  That happens all the time, and why not?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They can also become a member of a trade union.  I rang Congress today to clarify whether there were any restrictions on persons aged 16 or 17 working in a union house and was told that yes, they are entitled to pay their union dues and to participate if they choose freely to do so.  It is important that we tap into the energy, vibrance and enthusiasm of young people which they can bring to any walk of political life, be it D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, Seanad &Eacute;ireann, a local or municipal council or a State agency.<br/><br/>It has come to my attention recently that the MRBI commissioned a very substantive poll on the issue of voting for 16 year olds and 17 year olds.  The poll was never published and I am calling on all members of <i>The Irish Times</i>political staff who may be listening to check this, to confirm if the poll took place and to explain why the outcome was never published.  Who was it going to upset?  What political organisation felt most under threat because of the results of the poll?  I ask <i>The Irish Times</i>to tell us if it paid for such a survey to be carried out and, if it was carried out, to publish it as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>This is a brave, courageous, simple but good piece of legislation.  It is very important and has my absolute support.</p></speech>

I hope we also have time to allow Senator Alice-Mary Higgins to speak.  I warmly welcome this Bill and praise Senators Warfield and Ruane for bringing it forward.  I also congratulate the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Irish Second-Level Students Union and the Union of Students in Ireland who have campaigned for this day for well over a decade.  After their long battle to get this issue onto the political agenda it is up to us to make good on the promises we made and support the Bill.</p> <p>Since joining the Seanad last summer, and through my role in the public petitions committee and the Seanad public consultations committee, I have been voicing my concerns about the future of democracy.  It is not an exaggeration to state that, across the Western world, parliamentary democracies are under strain.  To our east, the UK Government will today leave the European Union while, to our west, President Trump continues to attack the media, women's rights, LGBTI rights, migrant rights and the basic freedoms and protections on which America was built.  In Ireland, 21st century citizens operating in a digital age increasingly feel disconnected from the political system and there is a growing awareness that the voices of many marginalised groups have historically been ignored.  To overcome these challenges we need to fundamentally reassess how we best engage with citizens.  One of the changes we need is to expand the franchise to ensure that everyone is truly heard and that is why I am supporting this Bill.</p> <p>Let us remember that the people who will be given new voting rights if this Bill passes are in many cases already old enough to drive, to get married, to join the Army and pay income tax.  If we reflect on the decisions made in these Houses in the past decade it is abundantly clear that the voice and input of young people were absent and that young people bore the brunt of the great recession and others before that.  The ESRI states that one quarter of young people suffer from at least three of the following: income poverty, inability to afford basic goods, financial strain, poor health, mental distress, poor housing, overcrowding, neighbourhood problems and mistrust in institutions, including this one.  We can understand that when we hear of what is happening with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Tusla and the HSE.  One institution after another is failing us so it is important to extend our franchise to younger people.</p> <p>In 2012 youth unemployment was over 30% and while the Government has made great progress, today the rate is still twice what it was in 2007.  Some 16,000 young people are long-term unemployed and, to add insult to injury, jobseeker's allowance for young people was cut from &euro;188 to &euro;100 in an act of unforgivable, blatant ageism and age discrimination.</p></speech>

Those in work face the exploitation of zero-hour contracts, JobBridge and unpaid internships, even in this House.  Those who wish to study now pay the second highest fees in Europe, with pledges to freeze fees having been shattered.  Care leavers have been left to drift with no supports and 250,000 young people emigrated during the economic crisis.  Millennials are the first generation to be poorer than their parents since the Great Famine of the 1840s.  Politics have not protected young people and the least we owe them is a say, a vote and a voice.  Reducing the voting age could be truly transformative.  This is real political reform which would lead to meaningful change but if it is to be in place for 2019 we need to act now and reject any attempt to delay.</p></speech>

I spoke previously about the work of Reimagine Cork and another group, Mad About Cork, comprising young people who are painting vacant properties, planting flowers on neglected quays and cleaning up alleyways that have long been forgotten.  Young people have a powerful curiosity and fresh eyes to probe and examine and once they get the chance to flex their electoral muscles they will breathe new life into local and European democracy.  We need to believe in young people, trust young people and undo some of the harm that has been done so that we strengthen democracy for the future.  That started today.  It starts in this Chamber with voting for this Bill.</p></speech>

Robust voter participation is fundamental to a healthy democracy and 16 and 17 year olds voting would increase voter engagement across the entire electorate.  There are a few reasons the voting age should be lowered to 16.  First, 16 year olds voting build lifelong voters.  Second, 16 year old voting will increase voter turnout over the long term.  Third, 16 and 17 year olds are prepared to and deserve to vote.  Research in the USA has found that, in practical assessments, 16 year olds function at about the same level on cognitive, moral and legal reasoning tests as adults and these are the very qualities needed to evaluate candidates and issues.</p> <p>At 16, people are still at school in their own areas and not at college or work so they can discuss issues affecting their communities from personal experience.  Political discussions at school would be more relevant as young people would feel they would have a say in legislation that affects them.  Democracy is precious and it is important that all eligible voters participate.  At 16, young people could be encouraged and assisted to register to vote as most are still at school.  Students may actually be more frequent and thoughtful voters because they have the space in school and at home to engage in discussion about civic issues.  Many 16 year olds are living at home and this could help to involve parents, teachers and community members in the process of learning to vote.  There could be a trickle-up effect that translates to larger voter turnout among older family members across the entire electorate.</p> <p>The evidence is clear from European countries that have extended suffrage to teenagers that voters who start earlier in life will vote longer and more consistently over their lives.  In June 2015 the Scottish Parliament officially extended its franchise to 16 and 17 year olds after a remarkable 75% of that age group turned out to vote in the 2014 Scotland independence referendum.  In 2007 Austria lowered its voting age to 16 and from 2004 to 2008, the first year in which students voted, young people's interest in politics jumped by approximately 23%.  People aged 16 and 17 have some form of voting rights in countries such as Germany, Norway, Argentina and Brazil.</p> <p>The earlier we engage young people in democracy and politics the greater the chance that we will promote and sustain a lifelong interest in and commitment to voting and participation in the democratic process.  The introduction of a new subject, politics and society, at senior cycle level in September 2016 is to be welcomed as it is important that young people are taught about democracy and their duty to participate.  The extension of the right to vote, alongside the introduction of this subject, will help young people not only to learn about participation in the electoral system but to experience it through voting.  I support my colleagues, 100%, with this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1400" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#YY00100"><p>I will deal first with a couple of points in response to some of the comments that have been made.  Some argue that young people aged 16 and 17 years should not have the right to vote because they are not fully aware of all the issues.  Unfortunately, it is clear in listening to some of the comments made in the Chamber that some Senators are not aware of all the issues.  This legislation has been drafted by Senator Fintan Warfield and I am very honoured to co-sign it with Senator Lynn Ruane.  Intentionally, it would not require a referendum to be held.  That is why it was designed for local and European elections.  As such, it would be in keeping with the practice across Europe, including in such countries as Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Malta, Norway and, most famously as far as people in Ireland are concerned, Scotland where, in the case of the independence referendum, it was so successful and uplifting.  In all of these countries, it was introduced on an incremental or trial basis to see how matters progressed.  That is the spirit of the legislation drafted by Senator Fintan Warfield.</p> <p>I was at an event in my home town on Monday evening which had been organised by For&oacute;ige.  A number of young people had consulted fellow students in their schools and come to put to us the issues of importance for them in the area in which they lived on the Inishowen Peninsula.  It was a tremendous meeting.  They listed all of the issues that mattered to them having consulted democratically in their schools and in dialogue with their communities.  For me to go to that meeting, at which all of us, as public representatives, gave our responses, listen and talk to those young people about the importance of what they had to say and then to come here and say they are not ready to vote would be downright patronising.  Some of the parties which will deny 16 and 17 year olds the right to vote were represented at that meeting too.</p> <p>The other point that was made was about populism.  Without a proper debate on the issue, it is likely that the majority of Irish people would, unfortunately, deny younger people the right to vote.  As such, it is not popular to bring forward this legislation, but it is the right thing to do.  It is the leaderly thing to do.  I received an e-mail from a young person during the week.  We all received lots of e-mails pushing for our support on this matter, which was great to see.  It was clear that the person concerned was very socially aware in raising issues of public concern, including the current humanitarian crisis.  The phrase in the e-mail that stood out was, "All I can do is hope my parents vote for someone with the same compassion for these people as me".  They have to hope all of these issues of concern will be addressed by their parents.  That is not right; it is wrong.</p> <p>Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, the National Youth Council of Ireland, For&oacute;ige, the Young Voices programme and the future leaders programme are some of the organisations and programmes calling for 16 and 17 year olds to have the right to vote.  We already have the infrastructure in place.  I met the young people mentioned under the auspices of For&oacute;ige and most public representatives have met youth councils or For&oacute;ige in their areas in recent years too.  If we believe, having met them, that they should not have the right to vote, we are patronising gits.  That is all we are if we think they do not have the right to vote.  We want to listen to their concerns, but will not give them the right to vote.  It is the most basic, fundamental issue of democracy.  The Proclamation in the foyer of Leinster House was in large part about extending the franchise to everybody, male and female, regardless of class.  It was the core component and core battle in our democracy.  Somebody said this was a republic.  While it is a republic, the battle continues to extend the franchise to everybody.  It is not popular for us to say it and it is not a huge vote winner, but it would be the right thing to do.</p> <p>The Constitutional Convention was established and one can argue that, like a lot of reports and committees, it was done to kick things down of the road.  However, it was a good forum which made recommendations.  Not only are Governments kicking cans down the road, the structures they establish to do so are dismissed.  They are taking it even further down the road to deny, in this case, citizens their say and chance to be involved in a real and tangible fashion.  We all read the information provided by the independent Library and Research Service of the Houses in preparation for debates.  It conducts tremendous independent research and analysis.  What stood out in that research was that in all of the European countries to which I referred where this measure has been introduced the evidence was clear that the younger people engaged in the voting process, the more likely it was that they would continue to vote.  We complain about the low turnout at local and European elections.  This legislation has been designed to increase turnout and create energy.  It addresses even 18 to 24 year olds and perhaps those who are older by saying, "Here are all these 16 and 17 year olds who are energised and excited about the ability to vote and perhaps they can be excited too."  We saw that happen in Scotland where it was very uplifting to see young people involved in the debates.</p> <p>Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael really need to reflect on what they are doing and the phrase "new politics" because all I see when it comes to anything that means leadership, debate and a difficult decision is the kicking of everything further down the road.  It is kicked to a committee or a fine-spangled forum and decisions are not being made.  The parties are working together again and again.  Look at the issue of Seanad reform and the legislation Senators are trying to put together to ensure Members would  be elected directly by the people to the greatest extent possible.  It would not require a constitutional referendum, yet the debate on the legislation is dragging on and going nowhere.  Even in the reform of the House we are going nowhere.  We had another committee which was tasked to look at an issue.  Not only did it make recommendations, it drafted legislation.  There are Senators who are trying to advance that Bill, but they are being stymied.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael need to look at themselves in terms of the credibility of the Houses.  There comes a moment when one must make a decision and stop kicking everything down the road.  The young people in the Visitors Gallery have observed it again today.  I hope, when they are older, have the franchise and are perhaps in these Houses, they will do politics in a very different way.</p></speech>

It is both excellent and necessary.  In the limited time we have available I will address some of the points made.</p> <p>We heard a great deal of talk about education.  The Government has, rightly, been commended for the introduction of civic, social and political education in schools.  I also commend the work of Mr. Eoin Gilroy who has led a great deal of the effort in this regard, as well as some of the messages and testimonies we have heard from the secondary school union, the National Youth Council and the USI.  Anybody who has engaged with these groups will know how ready they are and of the depth of their analysis.  I will not be able to get across the strength of their arguments, but they are many.  They cover the most practical points in terms of the registration process and how we ensure people get into the system and do not fall out.  For example, there is a huge issue where people do not register because they may have temporary addresses when they reach 18 years of age.  </p> <p>One of the points raised about civic, social and political education concerned the need to learn through doing.  The Bill provides an opportunity to ensure civic, social and political education is partly about doing.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People will have the experience of voting, discussing their vote and engaging.</p><p>Senator Coffey spoke about short-term thinking.  I assure him that the dangers of short-term thinking are not an age related issue.  He spoke about having six months off school.  Unfortunately, the Irish public will often say "Yes" to tax cuts.  I would hope that after longer reflection they might decide to look to long-term interests.</p><p>A further benefit is the message this proposal sends.  It presents an opportunity for collective debate and engagement of students while they are still in secondary school in a system and a country that too often individualises people.  People are moving to a period of individualisation.  They are thrown out on their own into the world.  That is a time of collective engagement when people can learn from each other.  There can have peer-to-peer exchange on, for example, how to analyse and scrutinise fake news and messages.  This is crucial.</p><p>Let us look at the actual proposal.  It relates to local and European elections.  We have heard about young people being connected to the community.  What more meaningful connection to the community than their participation in local elections.  The message would be that they shape their environment, beginning outwards from their most immediate environment.  They could vote, have a say and shape their community.  It is crucial that people get that message in terms of local elections.</p><p>The other elections are the European Parliament elections.  Lest this House were considered to be over-reaching, the European Parliament has requested that nation states would endeavour to give the opportunity to vote to 16 year olds.  The European Parliament wants 16 year olds involved in the decision of who sits in it.  It realises the future of Europe is crucially changing all the time.  If the amendment is accepted, there is a real danger that young people will not be enfranchised in the next elections in 2019.  Those elections will be at a time of rising right-wing populism and talks of a multi-speed Europe and may shape the future direction of Europe.  In the case of Europe, in particular, it is not only that 16 year olds need the right to vote but we as a society need 16 year olds to vote.  It is crucial that they are engaged.  We heard the messages from Scotland.  No one could not be inspired by young voters such as Eva O'Donovan.</p></speech>

The centenary of suffrage for women will be in 2018.  The same bad arguments as to why women should not vote were thrown about.</p> <p>The way to make this case is to introduce the legislation for the EU and the local elections.  It is a legislative change contained in a one-page Bill.  People will see it in practice and then we will have the referendum for the D&aacute;il elections.  I appeal to those in Fianna F&aacute;il.  If they are passionate about this in terms of D&aacute;il elections, they must not block the Bill.  This is like everything else when we have progressive change.  If we introduce the vote for 16 year olds in EU and local elections and people see it happening in 2019, I assure those in Fianna F&aacute;il that the public will get behind giving a vote in D&aacute;il elections to 16 year olds.  That is how we make it happen.</p></speech>

There is a genuine concern or conservatism which must be respected.  If the banks were a bit more conservative, 16, 26, and 36 year olds would not be in the kind of trouble that they are in now.</p> <p>For young people, things are black and white and there is no harm in our getting a dose of black and white when considering matters.  The two elections about which we are speaking occur every five years.  Therefore, not every 16 or 17 year old will get a shot at this.  There is a balancing and a weighting already in it.  The point made by Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and others is important.  When people are at home and still in their normal environment, if one likes, before they move away, it is easier for them to get involved in social activities.  We have spoken about new politics.  It is important that we all discipline ourselves to address the issue rather than the people or entities making the points.  Can we please play the ball and not the man or the woman in this debate?  That would honour the importance of this for young people and our future.</p> <p>The behaviour of this House at times is not something that would compel the young or not so young to take a greater interest in politics.  I have been involved in the disability sector for most of my life and I have seen people give up their summers, holidays and weekends to get involved and to work and support people, be they young or not so young, who have disabilities.  We are talking about 16 and 17 year olds but I know 12, 13, 14 and 15 year olds who are acting as family carers and taking on responsibilities they should not have to carry on their young shoulders.</p></speech>

I would have been in earlier only for a little oversight, but not to worry.</p> <p>I am in my 14th year as a member of the board of management of a secondary school and my eighth year as chairman of a school board.  They are two different schools.  I was a member of &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il, one of the largest political youth movements in the country.  It is probably the largest in terms of membership numbers and has been for many years.  It was set up by S&eacute;amus Brennan in 1975.  UCD, the largest third level institution in the country, was a part of my local electoral area in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown every time I ran in the local elections.  I ran in 1999, when I was a lot younger than I am now, as well as in 2004, 2009 and 2014.  I was made an honorary life member of the Kevin Barry cumann in UCD, which is the largest Fianna F&aacute;il cumann in the country, have chaired their AGMs for the past ten years in a row and have been invited to chair my 11th one next month.  I was very lucky to be proposed as a vice-president along with the founder, Gerry Collins, at the AGM last year.</p> <p>I will not be lectured to by anyone about my involvement or that of Fianna F&aacute;il in representing young people over many years.  I have listened to the debate and would love to be in a position to propose accepting the Bill as is and allowing 16 and 17 year olds to vote at local and European elections immediately.  I was a chair of &Oacute;gra Fianna F&aacute;il and the youth officer in my area.  I helped out in elections when I was nine years of age by packing envelopes and doing various other tasks that nine year olds were able to do.  Fianna F&aacute;il, during its participation in the constitutional convention, supported the idea of reducing the voting age and Fianna F&aacute;il, according to various recent polls, is as popular as any other party and more popular than most in the 18 to 24 years bracket.  As a party, we have nothing to fear by allowing the voting age to be reduced to 16 years. </p> <p>I canvassed people in their houses during my four local election campaigns and while campaigning for other people in general elections and found 22, 23 and 24 year olds who were not on the register and had no interest in voting.  I would like to see more information being provided.  The marriage equality referendum got young people on board, but this proposal would not do anything.  In recent days, I have received e-mails from people stating that they wanted to vote in the marriage equality referendum.  In time young people might be able to vote in referendums, but this Bill will not address that problem.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Gerry Horkan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2476"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2476&amp;amp;pid=GerryHorkan&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If it is passed or introduced, the position in respect of referendums or D&aacute;il elections will not be any different from the current position, unfortunately.  Although my party and I are very supportive of the thrust of the legislation, we want to ensure whatever concept is passed has the support of the majority of the population.  The general public needs to receive a level of education in order that voters will understand what is at stake.  When I attend various events in schools such as transition year musicals and prize giving nights, I see great ability and talent.  I would be delighted if every 16 and 17 year old in my local area had the right to vote.  Like Senator Diarmuid Wilson, I think I would have done even better if they had been entitled to vote when I was running in local elections.  There is a great number of young people involved.  We need to make sure 18 year olds are on the register.  Perhaps we might have registration campaigns within schools.  I have forms to give to people.  I know that others have done likewise.  Many students in sixth year are 18 years of age.  Sometimes there are 18 year olds in fifth year.  It is most important that we get them involved.  We are, therefore, supportive of the thrust of the Bill and  I commend Senators Fintan Warfield and Lynn Ruane for its introduction.  I think Senator Padraig Mac Lochlainn mentioned that his name was on it also.  I am absolutely supportive of the concept.  I do not want anybody in this Chamber to say Fianna F&aacute;il is not in favour of implementation of this proposal in the fullness of time.  We absolutely want it to happen.</p></speech>

I am conscious that Senator Fintan Warfield will wrap up the debate.  We will split the remaining time between us as best we can.  Perhaps we might take four or five minutes each.  </p> <p>I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in the Second Stage debate on the Electoral (Amendment) (Voting at 16) Bill 2016 on behalf of the Government.  The purpose of the Bill is to reduce to 16 years the age at which people are entitled to vote in local government and European Parliament elections.  While this is a relatively short Bill, a proposal to reduce the voting age for any election is of fundamental importance to any modern representative democracy.  With this in mind, I welcome the opportunity provided to hear the views of the House on the matter.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, has asked us to take time out to hear more views on it.  In the months ahead we will take the time to have this conversation and debate and make a genuine attempt to act on the views we will hear.</p> <p>As a Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and a member of Fine Gael, I am totally in favour of the principle of extending the vote to 16 and 17 year olds.  I will explain why I think it is right to do so.  I entered politics at quite a young age.  Like Senator Fintan Warfield, I became a member of my local council at the age of 20 years.  I was first elected to the D&aacute;il at the age of 24 years.  I must have been part of the cr&egrave;che.  I understand young people can make a major contribution to politics.  All of the young people who are watching us and many others want to have their say in the polling booth because they have a contribution to make and we have to find mechanisms to make that possible.  It is important to give young people an opportunity to have their say.  I agree with Senator Lynn Ruane that if we give people a chance to vote at a younger age, they might become involved in politics and stay involved in decision-making.  People generally are living at their home address as part of their community at the age of 16 years.  This means that they will be around to vote in a couple of elections before leaving school to go to college, travel the world or find a job.  People who get into the habit of voting at a younger age like 16 or 17 years might stay with the habit.  I have a major problem with people of all ages - 20 or 30, 50 or 60, or 80 or 90 years - who do not take the time to vote.  Anything we can do collectively to increase the number of people who vote and participate is to be encouraged.  I understand we have to talk through and work on practical issues around the Bill and this process.</p> <p>The Minister has made it clear that he is not against the Bill, but he has asked for more time to debate it thoroughly.  It is important for those who are watching the debate to understand that it is not the case that someone will not be listened to just because he or she has entered politics at a young age.  When I entered politics at the age of 20 or 21 years, I was convinced that no one would listen to me.  I was wrong.  When I became a member of my local council, politicians of all ages and from all parties were prepared to listen to me, even though I was just 20 years old.  When I was elected to the D&aacute;il as a 24 year old, Ministers and T&aacute;naist&iacute; - one of them is present as a Senator - were prepared to debate with me and allow me to have my say.  It must be understood it is wrong to suggest politicians are not interested in young people's views, do not want to hear from them or are afraid of them.  I think we all have a desire to bring the proposal to extend voting rights through the system and the process.  The Minister has made it clear that there should also be a wider debate about extending voting rights, not just for one or two elections but across the board.  That is a conversation we want to have and the Minister wants to facilitate it.  I ask the House to provide time for such a conversation before the Bill is pressed or ended.</p> <p>I take issue with those Senators who have claimed that my party is afraid of young people having the vote.  It has been suggested that because of the decisions we have made in government, we have something to be afraid of or concerned about.  I remind some of the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators of the most common conversation I had on the doorsteps with the parents of young people during the 2011 general election campaign.  Every day of the campaign the parents of children aged eight, nine or ten years or school students aged 15, 16, 17 and 18 told me they thought the country was bunched.  They did not see any future for young people.  The parents of children in primary or secondary school or college at the time said they did not believe their children had a future in Ireland.  That was the conversation in 2011.  It is now over.  We did not have that conversation during last year's election.  We debated social problems in areas such as water provision, health and education.  We had a different set of discussions about a different set of problems.  The conversation about there being no hope is over.  People now believe the country has a future and young people of Senator Fintan Warfield's age do have a future.</p> <p>I ask Sinn F&eacute;in Members not to suggest those of us in Fine Gael who were involved in the last Government have anything to fear from young people in having a say.  We have nothing to fear.  We are proud of our record in restoring the country to give people of all ages a future.  I understand 16 year olds are very intelligent and have a great deal to contribute.  I know that they will make wise decisions when they vote.  Therefore, I do not need to be lectured or told that my party is afraid of allowing them to vote.  We are not.  We will work with this legislation, where possible, as the debate evolves in the months ahead.  The Minister has made it clear that he wants to do this for genuine and the right reasons.  When we had the same conversation about extending the vote for presidential elections, he asked this House for more time to consider the matter and make proposals.  That is what he did and he has brought forward proposals.  He delivers on what he says.</p></speech>

My full contribution, setting out the other reasons the proposal is just not right at this time and mentioning other practical issues that need to be debated, has been circulated.

I thank every citizen and resident who has taken the time to engage and get in touch with Senators on all sides.  Some of them are present.  Their input is welcome and deeply appreciated.  I thank the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Irish Second-Level Students Union and all the other organisations that support young people for their work on the issue.  The Bill has been on the Order Paper for nine months, since 12 July 2016.  We were given notice this morning that Fine Gael had tabled an amendment that, frankly, slobbered all over the Bill.  The amendment which was moved during the debate proposes that the Bill "be read a Second Time on 31 December 2017", nine months from now.  The Bill has been in the public domain for nine months, but the Government wants another nine to consider it.  At no stage during the debate have we heard what the additional nine months will be used for.  I assure the Government that we will raise this issue in the corridors every day for the next nine months.  I want to know what it has done in the nine months since the Bill was published.  Why does it need another nine to review the matter?</p> <p>The question of the value citizens and residents should place on the manifestos of political parties also arises in this context.  I urge Fianna F&aacute;il to stand by its election manifesto and its document, Engaging the Future, which proposes to "reduce the voting age from 18 to 16 for the 2019 Local Elections".  Fianna F&aacute;il knows well that by supporting the Fine Gael amendment, it will quash any chance of engagement by 16 and 17 year olds in elections in 2019.</p></speech>

It was for that reason that we reached across the House to Senator Ruane and asked for cross-Chamber support on the issue.  As I said, it has been my pleasure to work with her and those in her office.</p><p>At some point Senators must take responsibility for the public office they hold and not kick stuff down the line.  This has to go through now.  It is a one-page Bill.  We have not debated a shorter Bill in this House.  We can make the decision this evening.  I plead with Senators to live up to their responsibility.  We are here for to legislate.  Young people listen.  Those in the Visitors Gallery are listening.  All organisations supporting our young people are listening.</p><p>Should this legislation be delayed, dragged through the mud and walked over, youth organisations and young people know that a delay of nine months will ensure that young people will not vote in the 2019 local and European Parliament elections, which as Senator Higgins said are likely to be the most important European Parliament elections in my lifetime, determining the future of the European Union and perhaps its very existence.</p><p>Sixteen-year olds do not just need the vote.  Their communities, society and Europe need 16- and 17-year olds to vote.  They need their contemporary imagination.  I plead with Fianna F&aacute;il Senators in particular to vote against the Government's amendment and support the Bill.</p></speech>

With the greatest respects to my colleagues who put forward the amendment, there is an inherent illogicality in the amendment.  There is an inherent wrongness or lack of soundness in the amendment.  If the Senators argue that it is subjectively wrong on biodiversity grounds, on ecological grounds, etc., to permit the cutting of hedges in the month of August, if that is their opening premise, then surely it is illogical to isolate roadside hedges on that basis.  There is an illogicality in the motion.  If it is logical to cut the roadside hedges, why would it not be logical to extend that facility to tillage or reseeding farmers?</p> <p>The problem with the amendment is that it is neither one thing nor another, that it makes no sense.  Let me explain briefly.  It makes no sense to this degree.  If the Senators' contention is that one should not cut hedges in August, then one should eliminate all.  If the Senators' contention is that in certain instances it is permissible, then it should be permissible in the case of reseeding, tillage and the roadside.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I appeal to my colleague to see reason and to think it through logically.

Assuming the amendment passes tonight, I have anecdotal evidence to suggest there will be amendments in the D&aacute;il to restore the <i>status quo</i>.  I have heard anecdotally that will happen.  It could well be proposed from the Fianna F&aacute;il benches.  Do Senators realise that will mean a 90-day delay?  It will be three full months until it returns to the Seanad and we begin the merry-go-round again.  It is a total waste of the House's time and resources.  We should address the question forthrightly when it is before the House.  Senators must go completely against it or make no illogical amendments.</p></speech>

What happens in the D&aacute;il happens in the D&aacute;il.  We have a responsibility to make sure we pass the best possible legislation here.  The Fianna F&aacute;il amendment is an improvement.  If we are talking about a pilot scheme, amendment No. 3c, which is in my name, proposes that it be "in such part or parts of the State as specified in the regulations, but covering an area no greater than 10 per cent of the hedgerows in the State".  That allows a pilot scheme.  It covers 10% of the nation.  We could call that a pilot scheme.  We cannot call a scheme in the Twenty-six Counties a pilot scheme.  Amendment No. 3c gives the Minister the option of doing a proper pilot scheme in a small part of the area of the country.</p></speech>

We should have a pilot project and should then come back and consider new legislation to reflect what we learn from the project.  I still do not believe we will have a pilot project in front of us on Report Stage but, were we to have one, it would need to have an expiry date.  The practices in the project should not continue on an ongoing basis.  We should either delete the point that it could be renewed or insert a limit, of perhaps no more than three more years, after which we would need new legislation reflecting the experience gained from the data gathering and impact assessment of which the Minister has spoken.  I ask the Minister to indicate if she is open to an expiry date in the legislation to avoid allowing for ongoing indefinite renewal.  In such a case, I would be happy to withdraw my amendments and come back on Report Stage to discuss what an appropriate expiry date would be.</p><p>I will also speak to amendment No. 4c.  These are valuable points.  I do not need to press them now and I will bring them forward on Report Stage but I am hoping that the Department will take on board these and other more nuanced amendments.</p></speech>

I have been listening to Senators for 16 hours, I have provided extensive briefing and I have engaged constructively.  The Chair put it to the floor that I be allowed to speak and Senator Norris said "No".</p></speech>

It is not funny.  I have been here for 16 hours and will stay for as long as it takes.  I have been very co-operative and I am disappointed.</p> <p>I will outline my position on amendment No. 3b.  Grubbing and flailing would not be permitted in August but if a farmer wanted to trim he or she should be allowed to do so for one season's growth, in the interest of land management and when reseeding or tillage is being carried out.  This is an issue of trust.  Do we trust our farmers, the custodians of the countryside, to act in a responsible manner?  I trust them.</p> <p>As regards amendments Nos. 4a and 4b, the Bill proposes that the provisions in section 8 on burning and hedge cutting will be in force for a pilot period of two years, to allow my Department to monitor activity under the provisions and to gather the necessary scientific data.  However, I am prepared to accept the Senator's amendment to extend the pilot period to three years, which should allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the provisions.  Section 8(4) states that I must seek the approval of the Oireachtas, by way of resolution, for the extension of the two-year pilot phase.  I am of the view that the period of the extension will be influenced by the various studies undertaken during the pilot phase so I cannot accept amendments Nos. 4a and 4b.  </p></speech>

It will not be a case of being nodded through.  A resolution has to be passed to say it can be extended for another period and if it is not approved it will revert to the old legislation and the pilot period ceases.</p></speech>

I will withdraw the amendments for now but I will seek engagement across the House on what more appropriate renewal processes might be put in place.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know that others have mentioned that it would be appropriate for an Oireachtas committee to examine the results of what happens after the pilot period expires.  I believe clear limitations and terms for the pilot scheme must be stipulated in legislation.  If we do so it would be hard to see how a pilot scheme with such scientific provisions could be renewed on a resolution base.  We need to give an opportunity to amend and change rather than simply extend.  With that said, I shall withdraw my amendment but will resubmit it on Report Stage.  </p></speech>

The Minister asked the direct question of whether we trust farmers.  Yes, I do.  Do it trust the vast majority of citizens?  Yes, I do but we still passed legislation to stop people breaking into our homes.  We still need to pass legislation that will protect the environment.  Do I trust the vast majority of farmers?  Of course I do.  This is not a them and us situation.  We simply want to protect the countryside.  I suggest that people stop trying to create division between groups.  The vast majority of farmers are good, honest and hardworking people that protect the environment.</p></speech>

I had indicated previously, before the debate broke to go to Private Members' business, that I intended to speak and I, too, did not get an opportunity to speak.  I regret that the Minister did not get an opportunity to respect either.  I imagine we will get to speak on Report Stage.</p><p>In terms of these amendments, I have two key amendments in section 9 that relate to when we had the debate and conversation opened up by this Bill.  Interestingly, many people have contacted us about this matter.  Many of them are concerned, and the Minister has expressed her concern, at the way hedgecutting is carried out throughout the year, including the six months when hedgecutting is permitted.  Numerous people have spoken, as has the Minister, about the use and inappropriate use of the flail.  There have been clear messages about times when machines are used but there has been a lack of proper supervision and engagement.  </p><p>My amendment a5a is quite reasonable.  Again, I have been in no way prescriptive and have left it to the Minister to proscribe.  My amendment suggests that the Minister may make regulations and she had indicated a desire and willingness to do so.  I add that my amendment refers to overall regulations and not simply regulations for the pilot scheme.  My amendment states:</p><blockquote>The Minister may make regulations to set out the permissible use of certain machinery or certain classifications of machinery which may or may not be used for the purposes of cutting or maintaining hedgerows.</blockquote> <p>I tabled my amendment in ensure that we have good practice when it comes to cutting hedgerows.  Interesting, we have heard quite detailed debate on good and bad practices.  There can be good ways to cut hedges and we need to make sure that they are the predominant model.  </p><p>If there is an opportunity to engage with the Minister then I shall not press my amendments.  I am keen, as others are, to see this Bill conclude this Stage.  I want an indication.  This issue arose from the debates, communications and education that I have received on the practices used for hedge planting and hedgecutting. </p><p>Amendment No. a5b shares a similar concern.  The amendment relates to something that we heard today.  We have heard the emerging argument being made by tillage farmers.  It is a fact that large scale tillage farmers make up a small fraction, and I apologise if my exact percentage is incorrect, but I believe it is under 5% of current farmers and I have heard that it may be 3.5%.  It has been made very clear, certainly during this debate today, that they are clear and strong advocates for this Bill.  In many cases they seem to drive this legislation.  Some tillage farmers may not be in the GLAS scheme so they may not have the same vulnerabilities as other farmers.  The following concern was expressed to me and I hate to think that it was a threat.  What if these tillage farmers decide to use the six months where it is permissible to grub hedges and dig them up?  Is that concern being considered?  I am aware that regulation already exists that stipulate that where hedgerows are grubbed and removed they need to be matched by planting.</p><p>My amendment goes a step further.  When we have large scale removal and grubbing of hedges at any time of year then we weaken the case for all farmers when we go to Europe.  The farming sector is struggling now.  I have been surprised by how strongly the IFA has lobbied about this matter because it has other serious concerns to tackle.  Along with others, I have championed its concerns in respect of agribusiness and the threat from Brexit.  At this volatile time the IFA should seek to make allies rather than divide people.  I imagine that many in the IFA will see beyond this single issue and consider the bigger picture of Ireland's agricultural well-being and future on which a large part depends on the CAP payment.  As we know the Irish nominee to the European Commission, the agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan, is actively proposing to further green the common agricultural payment.  Ireland is strongly advocating for greening to form part of the common agricultural policy.  We need to increase it because greening only forms one third of the payment that many farmers receive.  We argue for that proportion to be increased because we know that other parts of farmers' productivity will come under pressure from British exports.  That is a fact.  The common agricultural policy and rules are very important.</p><p>The one greening measure that tillage farmers must comply with is the protection of hedgerows as an ecological focus area.  That aspect is a condition that tillage farmers must comply with in order for them to receive the single farm payment.  If persons grub hedges on a large scale they will diminish Ireland's overall case, as well as their case, to receive the payment. </p><p>My amendment may seem small but it is important.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The requirement is already there but it simply states that the Department should be notified, that the Minister would set out regulations as to when, and there may be valid reasons from time to time, the grubbing of more than 1 km of hedgerow would be allowed, and that those who grub more than 1 km of hedgerow without the permission of the Department, or whatever body under its aegis the Minister deems appropriate, would be committing an offence because they would be undoing the common agricultural good of our nation and other farmers.</p><p>I recognise my amendment may not be perfect and I am extremely happy to work with the Minister on it.  I am trying to strengthen Ireland's case and the interests of all farmers in this respect.  It is very important that large-scale tillage farmers who may choose to remove hedgerows on a large scale during the six months permitted do not do so without some due process, oversight and regulation.  I am happy to withdraw the amendment if the Minister indicates she can engage with me on this issue between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

Under other international nature conservation conventions and the Aarhus convention on access to information on the environment it would not be normal practice, and I outlined this earlier, to list these various directives or conventions in legislation.  EU directives are binding on member states so there is no need to separately provide for them in legislation.  Accordingly, I do not consider it is necessary to list the various directives, conventions and plans in the Bill.</p> <p>On amendment No. a5a I do not feel it is necessary for me as Minister to make regulations on cutting equipment for hedge cutting.  I take the point, but it is very prescriptive.  I can look at it.  On amendment No. a5b, the current provisions in section 40 allow the grubbing and destruction of hedgerows from 1 September to the end of February.  I will propose on Report Stage an amendment to prohibit the grubbing and destruction of hedgerows in August.  I cannot see the point of requesting landowners or public bodies to obtain my consent to grub or destroy hedges of a certain length during the open season for cutting from September to the end of February.  It appears like overregulation and I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I will come back to it.</p> <p>I apologise - I neglected to mention my other amendment, to which the Minister has responded, on the statutory requirements.  A serious concern that emerged in the meetings we had on the Bill, and I appreciate the Department meeting me, was that the all-Ireland pollinator plan is not regarded as statutory or a binding concern.  This is one of the areas I have asked the Minister to list.  The Minister mentioned that the list of directives and obligations is already there, but unfortunately what I have learned is that the all-Ireland pollinator plan is not something that will automatically be considered.</p> <p>I will withdraw the amendment for now, but I put the House on notice that I intend to put forward an amendment explicitly on the all-Ireland pollinator plan.  Will the Minister indicate that she intends to take its recommendations very seriously even though they are not, as I have been told by the Department, on a statutory basis?  This is something of very serious concern to me.  We heard from the beekeepers, from those in the butterfly movement and with regard to birds that pollination is absolutely crucial not just for the flourishing of our nature and wildlife, but also for the horticultural business and for food production in Ireland.  Pollination is not a whimsical notion.  It is the core of how we actually have thriving agriculture.  It is green Ireland and it is what we put out there.  Will the Minister indicate she takes the plan seriously?  I will withdraw the amendment for now but I will table an amendment on Report Stage explicitly on the pollinator plan.  I will probably also table Report Stage amendments on further tightening regulations on gorse fires and how they are managed because this is the section of the Bill into which they are likely to go.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2017-03-29a.946" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2017032900002#KKK01500"><p>I will not speak at length on section 8.  The case has not been made for section 8.  The amendment tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il somewhat improves and ameliorates the damage in the section.  I will still oppose the section even though it has been amended.  The message was sent out on the idea that people would vote on a single issue.  I believe people very much have been listening and I commend Fianna F&aacute;il because although it did not agree with us on large parts of section 8, nonetheless it engaged with all stakeholders respectfully on it.  It has not come to the point of being able to support our amendments, and I regret this, but respectful engagement with the full farming community and the full community of rural Ireland and the rest of the population of Ireland is very important and I commend it in this regard.  This is why I supported the amendment although I oppose the section.</p> <p>This is our last chance to speak on section 8 and I must highlight this point.  The section on gorse fires has not been addressed.  Anybody who read the newspapers this week would have seen stories about burning gorse in March.  In my part of the country in Connemara, the electricity supply cable to the Aran Islands was damaged by uncontrolled gorse fires in Carraroe.  In Donegal, the primary water source for Donegal in Lough Fad was endangered by gorse fires.  In County Louth, fire crews battled overnight to prevent the spread of gorse fires to forestry land.  The EPA has raised serious concerns about the damage done by gorse fires.</p> <p>If there is anything on which we need to gather statistics it is certainly this, but we know that in Cork, where statistics have been gathered, from 2012 to 2015 the cost of responding to illegal gorse fires to the fire services was &euro;750,000.  This is huge public expenditure.  We have heard much talk about pilot programmes.  I am very concerned that the section allows burning, and I know the Minister says part or parts of, but there is real concern that we could see a further escalation of this burning in March. We could see the incidents which have happened and got out of hand here multiplied further because there will be a sense of greater permission for burning in March.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2017&amp;amp;month=03&amp;amp;day=29"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would also point out, to those who would speak to the wet February that we had, that we had one of the driest Octobers and Novembers in history.  In Scotland, where they have sought to engage with this same issue, significant regulation around this has been brought in.  Burning in Scotland is done in October and November.  It is done in autumn.  There is no reason we cannot have controlled burning taking place in October or November.  It is the practice elsewhere.  It is a more appropriate practice.  There is no need to extend this into March.  </p><p>We have already heard about the nesting seasons.  On some further interests we have heard, the EPA and other groups have raised concern, in particular, that there is an issue with burning in February already, which many people believe should not happen.  This is of concern because when there is burnt ground in February or March, it does not simply endanger nests and fledglings that may already be on the ground there, but it also damages the habitat.  We have heard that many species will not nest on ground that has recently been burnt.  A whole habitat, which is relied on for nesting, is destroyed.  There is a real concern.  </p><p>I am conscious that I should signal that we may table detailed amendments on section 8, because we did not specifically put amendments forward besides our general opposition.  We would be remiss if we said that this was somehow okay or fine.  There are massive issues in this area and it is something that needs to be looked at very seriously.  As I said, I will certainly be seeking to tighten the regulations.  I know the Minister has said that these are illegal fires in many cases but there is a concern that, if we open the season further, the danger, jeopardy and cost to the public will be increased.</p></speech>

We should acknowledge the progress we have made in the Seanad in respect of the debate.  Unfortunately, I am not convinced about the pilot scheme.  I just do not see it there, across the 26 counties, so I cannot in honesty vote for this section of the Bill.  As Senator Higgins has pointed out, we have not even touched upon upland burnings in March.  In respect of climate change, things are moving so rapidly.  We have seen the change of seasons already and we have seen nesting patterns change.</p> <p>I believe that this Bill could be improved and strengthened if it could go to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to allow the different stakeholders to come in and give evidence at that stage.  It could inform the Bill further and possibly strengthen it.  We pretty much just get soundbites in here, which is not meant as a criticism of anyone, but by carrying out pre-legislative scrutiny we could allow those stakeholders to come in and talk honestly and openly about their concerns.  I think the Bill would be better for  it.  That gives both sides, the farming community and the environmentalists, their say.  It is a way we can move on.  Like many other Senators, I have been doing my own research, but it is not as comprehensive as what we could find out through pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Bill should go ahead without section 8.  Section 8 should go for pre-legislative scrutiny where we can have a really positive engagement to make this as strong as possible.  </p> <p>I thank all the Senators here for their co-operation and hard work in improving the Bill.  I would also like to acknowledge that we have often killed off that divisive language, townies as opposed to urban or anything like that, and that we are actually working for the betterment of our environment, both for the farming community and the urban community.</p></speech>

It is a simple tidying-up exercise which updates the collective citations for fisheries legislation and replaces the reference to the Central Fisheries Board, which is now Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Following further consultation with the Attorney General's office however, I have been informed that the changes proposed in section 9 were already included in the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, therefore I will bring an amendment on Report Stage to delete section 9 from the Bill.</p></speech>

The other repeals relate to provision penalties in both the 2000 and 2010 wildlife legislation, which are updated in this Bill, and consequently the repeal stands.  I also wish to advise the House that I will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to section 44 of the Wildlife Act, which includes provisions on the unlawful hunting and entry onto lands.  The amendment that I will propose will involve a small technical change to the text of the section, clarifying the powers of authorised officers of my Department or a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to bring prosecutions for unlawful hunting with animals.</p></speech>

It could inadvertently repeal the legislation which makes an assault on a National Parks and Wildlife Service officer an offence.  I imagine that is not intended and I recognise that the Minister has recognised the potential inadvertent consequence.  We are happy to work with the Minister to ensure that is addressed.  We have to value our very important National Parks and Wildlife Service officers.</p></speech>
