    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1664" speakername="Sharon Keogan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#A00300"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  This is an issue known to every employer in the construction industry in the country.  Safe Pass has become the quintessential example of bureaucratic red tape.  It is a system that has become engorged on self-importance and is now treated as a prerequisite for even thinking about entering a building site.  The Safe Pass system was introduced at the turn of the millennium and was championed by trade unions as something that will save lives.  This has not proven to be the case in the past 20 years.  Since its inception the programme has largely been run by retired trade unionists who organise day-long courses that teach basic on-site safety.  It is content that all apprentices know a week into their course.  It is content such as lift from the knees and not from the back, do not do a two-person job solo and do not walk under machines.  It is the stuff most people would not even need to be told.</p><p>The course costs approximately &euro;200, which is paid by the employer.  At this price we would expect the administration to be top notch but apparently it is not.  I spoke to an employer who said the cards are printed in eastern Europe and some workers sit around for months waiting for the plastic rectangle that will allow them to get on the job.  Of course this would be much too handy a gig to only get one shot at each worker so SOLAS put an expiry date on the card of four years, after which people have to do a retraining course.  It is a constant money mill.</p><p>Employers are exempt from the requirement to have a card but almost all of them get one anyway.  Otherwise they are subjected to too much hassle trying to get past security on sites.  Sometimes the security staff are not aware of the exemption for the employer.  These men and women running our construction companies end up sitting through the course just to save time in the long run.</p><p>If it were just the Safe Pass perhaps it could be let slide but it seems that every year new safety courses are dreamt up and new cards are required to do anything on site, from manual handling certificates to aerial lift training, green business certificates and American Concrete Institute certificates.  One employer told me he saw a young worker with so many cards he needed to carry one of the old-style American fold-out wallets that flip down.  He had reams of them.</p><p>This system has barely been updated since its inception.  There is something very wrong with it.  It is simultaneously the laughing stock of the construction industry and the bane of its existence.  To think a seasoned construction worker needs to be reminded of safety fundamentals every four years is absurd.  If the Minister insists on testing these workers at least let them take it online where a pass would automatically refresh their card, rather than having the nation's workers march off to a function room every few years to watch the same old PowerPoint as on the previous occasion.</p><p>In a case taken by Mr. Fergal O'Connor we saw that infinite reassessment was never the plan for the construction industry.  What is being done to implement this ruling?  When can we expect to see the meaningful change needed in this area for quite some time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#A00400"><p>I thank Senator Keogan for raising this important and timely matter.  Before I get into the substance let me be very clear that we do need an overhaul of the construction licensing system.  We intend to bring forward legislation on this matter shortly.  It will give Members of the House and the Senator an opportunity to contribute to ensure we have a modern fit-for-purpose safety system when it comes to licensing of the construction sector.</p><p>The Government recognises that changes are required to the broader construction safety arrangements.  This is under way and relates to the construction skills certification scheme, the quarries skills certification scheme and the Safe Pass.  Safe Pass, as the Senator has said, is a one-day health and safety awareness programme delivered by SOLAS-approved training organisations and tutors.  These are delivered by private providers.  Under the construction safety, health and welfare at work regulations of 2013, all construction workers in Ireland, including apprentices and trainees, are legally bound to hold a valid Safe Pass registration card.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The aim of the programme is to raise the standard of safety awareness in the construction industry and to ensure all site personnel undergo basic health and safety awareness training to enable them to work on site without being a risk to themselves or others who might be affected by their acts or omissions.  Candidates who successfully complete the programme will receive a Safe Pass registration card, which is valid for four years.</p><p>As the Commencement matter relates to, in April 2017, Mr. Justice Richard Humphreys granted a declaration that SOLAS was not entitled to impose certain conditions of the renewal of construction skills certification scheme, CSCS, and-or quarrying skills certification scheme, QSCS, registration cards.  Safe Pass was not encompassed in this specific order and related to the other two registration cards.  The key distinction between Safe Pass and the other two cards is that the latter two carry Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, certification.  As such, Mr. Justice Humphreys ruled that they were not dependent on post-award ongoing experience, self-certification, auditing or continuing assessment.  They already had an accredited qualification.</p><p>Later this year, we will move the Safe Pass renewal process online for the first time.</p></speech>

Moving the process online will make a significant difference to people and will be a practical way to help them to go about their business.  We want people on-site as quickly as possible and we all know that is important.  We need to do so in a safe manner and I think that having an online renewal process will help in that regard.</p> <p>I believe the Senator will also be pleased to know that I intend to bring to Government a new planned licensing model for construction, quarrying and related activities in Ireland within the next two weeks.</p> <p>On enactment, the proposed licensing of construction activities Bill will replace and amend present legislative provisions, in particular elements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Quarries) Regulations 2008, and the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 as regards the technical competence and safety awareness of personnel performing regulated functions.</p> <p>The new licensing model intends to replace the current qualification system that exists for the QSCS, CSCS and the Safe Pass schemes.  This proposed licensing model will put a formal renewal process in place to ensure workers in construction, and construction-related disciplines, are continuously kept up to date with their health and safety practices.  It will provide a very useful opportunity for the Senator, Seanad &Eacute;ireann and the sector to have an input, thus making sure that we get fit-for-purpose modern legislation to achieve the right balance between making sure that safety at work is paramount but also making sure that it is done in a way that is not overly bureaucratic, overly administrative and uses new technology to provide courses online.</p> <p>I look forward to bringing these proposals to Cabinet within the next fortnight.  I also look forward to myself and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, engaging on this matter in the House in the coming weeks and months.</p></speech>

They are probably the two finest Minsters in their respective portfolios and I congratulate them.</p> <p>Today, we are discussing an important matter as we try to get the construction industry back up and running.  Encountering bureaucratic red tape stifles the construction industry.  Can the Minister confirm when the courses will be online?  I await the legislation on this issue that he proposes to bring before the House.</p></speech>

She has shown a great interest in this matter, apprenticeships and the like since becoming a Member.</p> <p>My best guesstimate is around the month of October but certainly before the end of the year.  We are working to make sure that the Safe Pass registration process fully transitions online by the end of the year.  I know that the initiative will be very welcome having spoken to representatives of the industry, education providers and people undertaking these courses.  In addition, we will bring proposals to overhaul the legislation to Cabinet in the next two weeks.  Subject to the timetable of committees in these Houses, we will begin to move through that legislation later this year.</p> <p>There is an opportunity to modernise by moving the current system online this year and starting to overhaul the legislation this year.  We look forward to working with the Senator on the matter.  Once we have published the legislation in two weeks, we will be very pleased to give her a full briefing and engage with industry partners on this matter.</p></speech>

I commend him on the changes that he has brought forward, which mean that from September all student grants will increase by &euro;200 and the non-adjacent rate will reduce to 30 km, meaning that many students will see their grant increase by 30%.  He has also increased the income eligibility thresholds to ensure that more students qualify.  It is this very point that I want to elaborate on as part of my  Commencement matter.</p> <p>Under the current rules for assessing income from employment for a SUSI grant, students can earn a maximum of &euro;4,500 holiday earnings for outside of term-time employment.  However,  the hotel, tourism and hospitality sectors face acute staffing challenges, particularly this summer.  The anecdotal evidence that I have received from these sectors reveal that students are telling employers that they cannot work additional hours during the summer for fear of losing their SUSI grant for the 2023-24 academic year.  That is a perfectly legitimate fear for students who rely on the grant to assist them to get through college.  With the arbitrary income disregard for students being set at &euro;4,500, we have created a perverse disincentive to take on additional work this summer when the survival of many businesses rely on these very same students.</p> <p>Rather than penalise students who take on additional working hours during holiday periods, we should reward them by exempting income earned during college holiday periods like summer and Christmas.  At the very least, the income disregard should be increased considerably from &euro;4,500 to take account of the wage increases that have happened in recent years, inflation and the acute staff shortages in the economy that I have referenced.  Students should not fear taking on additional work during the busy summer period because it may affect their grant in subsequent years.</p> <p>I genuinely believe my proposal is realistic and sensible, and I was delighted to bring it to a recent meeting of our Fine Gael parliamentary party.  I thank the Minister for his work on this matter and for taking my proposal seriously.  He has engaged widely with students' unions and business representative organisations around this matter.  I also know that he is actively working with his officials on this proposal.  However, I stress the importance of not only an early decision but a communications and PR campaign around changes that may be made so that students, and employers, are aware of them now because today is 1 June 1 and the summer is upon us.</p> <p>I believe that flexibility on this matter would be a win-win for all concerned.  It would encourage students to take on additional work that, in turn, would support the tourism and hospitality sectors.  Most importantly, the initiative would put more money in the pockets of students without them having to worry about how additional work would affect their eligibility for a SUSI grant in future academic years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#B00800"><p>I thank my colleague for his work on this matter.  It is a good example of common-sense politics where one identifies an issue and bring forward proposals to fix the issue.  I thank him for tabling this proposal at a meeting of our parliamentary party and for engaging with me on same.  The proposal is good for students, local businesses and families.  In addition, there is the concept that one should reward work and never penalise it.</p> <p>As the Senator rightly said, the main financial scheme available to students is the student grant scheme.  We have made a number of improvements to the scheme that will kick in from September.  We have increased the amount of the grant for the first time in ten years, we have increased the income threshold for the first time in ten years and we have also changed the adjacency rate for the first time in ten years so more students will qualify for a higher rate of grant.</p> <p>This is a scheme where household income from all sources, including the income from a student&rsquo;s employment, is taken into consideration.  However, as the Senator stated, income from a student, which represents holiday earnings outside of term time, can be deducted up to the sum of &euro;4,500.  The rationale for this approach is to mitigate against students working so much during their tertiary education because full-time students want to focus on their education.  The approach also recognises that students work during the summer, and they often need to work as well.  This balance was highlighted by a recent review of the student grant scheme.</p> <p>In 2016, the holiday earnings deduction amount was increased from &euro;3,809 and is now &euro;4,500.</p> <p>I wish to clearly point out something to students who are following this debate.  When applying for a SUSI grant a person is assessed on his or her previous year's income and we will make the change this summer.  The provision will mean that students who work this year will be able to deduct any income against the grant in 12 months.  Therefore, a grant is calculated based on the income 12 months previously.</p> <p>The world has changed quite significantly.  The cost of living has obviously increased.  The situation is a real challenge for every student, family and person in this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Harris:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2338"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2338&amp;amp;pid=SimonHarris&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Also, we have pubs, hotels, restaurants, shops - you name it - right across this country in need of people today to help them out in their work.  In that context of the cost-of-living crisis and the acute labour shortages in towns and villages throughout this country, I am working closely with my officials to see how we can amend this scheme so that students could have a higher level of holiday earnings deduction.  As I say, we increased it to &euro;4,500 in 2016.  I believe it should now be increased further.</p><p>It is now evident from independent research, although independent research is not needed to tell you this, that many students work throughout the year to meet the rising cost of living.  I want to see whether there is merit in tweaking that so that it is not only holiday time, that we recognise a student might a have job in a bar, a hotel, a restaurant or a shop at the weekend as well during term time, and whether that income could be disregarded as well.  That is something I will look at.</p><p>We all accept we need to strike a balance between recognising the reality of students working while also making sure any change in policy does not in any way disrupt a student's full-time academic work.  As I have said, given the rising cost of living, the measures proposed by Senator Cummins would be progressive.  They would be student-friendly and business-friendly.  They would be welcomed by many sectors of the economy and by society.  They would also be welcomed by many families across Ireland.  I intend to bottom-out on this issue over the course of the next few weeks and then communicate these changes loudly and clearly to students.</p></speech>

We are now in the summer, and notwithstanding that it has no impact on the next academic year, 2022-2023, students look forward to the academic year of 2023-2024, on which this summer's earnings will have an impact.</p> <p>Striking that balance is important.  We cannot disrupt the education of full-time students but at the same time we must recognise that students should work during the summer.  As a State, we should reward them for doing so and not put a penalty in place, in effect, for taking up employment.</p> <p>I welcome the changes the Minister is to make and I stress the urgency of bringing them forward as early as possible.</p></speech>

When it was set as the income level in 2016, &euro;4,500 was worth a different amount in real terms.  The world has changed, including in the context of inflation and in terms of minimum wage changes.</p> <p>This is a common-sense proposal the Senator is bringing forward but I often find common sense is not that common.  It is important when we have a good idea that we recognise it and try to move on it.</p> <p>I have yet to work through with my officials and with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the appropriate level at which to set it but it would have to be at least at a level that recognises the change in terms of the real value of &euro;4,500 and what that would be today, and any minimum wage changes that have taken place.</p> <p>I appreciate the urgency of doing this quickly and I am endeavouring to do so as quickly as possible.

This is not the first time I have raised this issue of the Energy Charter Treaty and the modernisation process, Ireland's position is on that treaty and when Ireland will cut its losses and walk away from it.</p> <p>The Energy Charter Treaty was ratified in the 1990s by Ireland with no debate and it has been lingering around like a bad smell ever since.  It is an international treaty that protects fossil fuel companies from any risk to their profits or future profits.  The investor provisions in the Energy Charter Treaty are of the most archaic form of investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS.  ISDS is a legal system that is based on the neocolonial mindset that we cannot trust new democracies or foreign countries for investors and, therefore, investors must have the protection of a private court system for corporations.  This is despite the fact the OECD and another academic meta-analysis of all of the investment protections within treaties found that the effect of ISDS in promoting investment into countries is so small as to be considered zero.</p> <p>What we have seen in recent years is a significant escalation in the number of ISDS cases that are being taken by corporations, especially since 2013.  What is most concerning is the use of ISDS in the Energy Charter Treaty to stymie climate action, so much so that the Energy Charter Treaty was flagged in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, Working Group III report.  That report could not have been any clearer.  It stated that agreements such as the Energy Charter Treaty with their investment protections are being used by fossil fuel companies to block national legislation aimed at phasing out the use of their assets.</p> <p>So far, fossil fuel companies have commenced or threatened legal action to the value of &euro;2.15 trillion against countries and their governments for taking climate action.  For example, the Corrib gas field is one of the ones that was flagged as most likely where companies have threatened legal action against Ireland in the past but, that we know of, we have never been taken to court.</p> <p>In 2018, the then EU Commissioner for Trade, Dr. Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, declared that ISDS was dead, and yet under the current modernisation of the Energy Charter Treaty the EU has not even put ISDS on the table for reform or modernisation.  This is despite the fact an EU court ruling found that ISDS and the Energy Charter Treaty is contrary to EU law.</p> <p>The last time I asked the question of a Minister, we were over in the convention centre and I was told the modernisation process was ongoing and we would wait and see how it went.  To be honest, we know it is going nowhere.  The fact the most insidious part of the agreement is not even on the table for reform means we are wasting valuable time in tackling climate action by remaining a party to this dinosaur agreement.</p> <p>Climate change has fundamentally changed the world.  We woke up only this morning to hear the news that not only will Ireland not meet its climate emission targets this year but they are actually going up.  My question for the Minister of State is, at what point do we face the reality that the Energy Charter Treaty cannot be reformed, it is not fit for purpose and it does not belong in a world system where we are facing planetary breakdown from climate change?</p></speech>

It was signed in 1994 and entered into legal force in 1998.  Since then, the Energy Charter Treaty has provided a multilateral framework for energy co-operation.  It promotes energy security through the operation of more open and competitive energy markets, while respecting the principles of sustainable development and sovereignty over energy resources.</p> <p>The treaty's provisions focus on four broad areas: the protection of foreign investments, based on the extension of national treatment or most favoured nation treatment, whichever is more favourable, and protection against key non-commercial risks; non-discriminatory conditions for trade in energy materials, products and energy-related equipment based on WTO rules, and provisions to ensure reliable cross-border energy transit flows through pipelines, grids and other means of transportation; the resolution of disputes between participating states and, in the case of investments, between investors and host states; and the promotion of energy efficiency and attempts to minimise the environmental impact of energy production and use.  The treaty is, therefore, designed to promote energy security through the operation of more open and competitive energy markets while respecting the principles of sustainable development and sovereignty over energy resources.</p> <p>While the treaty has worked well for many years, situations and circumstances have changed over time, as they always do.  It has been recognised for a number of years that it is necessary to update and modernise the treaty, in particular to take account of the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  In 2017, therefore, the Energy Charter Conference decided to modernise the treaty.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Hildegarde Naughton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2395"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2395&amp;amp;pid=HildegardeNaughton&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The modernisation of the treaty aims to address developments in the energy sector, especially in light of the rapid changes that have occurred in recent years and that have brought new opportunities and challenges for the sector.  Its modernisation is key to ensuring the treaty fulfils its potential to strengthen long-term co-operation in the energy field and to contribute to enhancing energy security.</p><p>The negotiations for this modernisation, when concerning more than 50 different countries, have naturally taken time.  I am pleased, however, that they are reaching their conclusion.  The most recent round of negotiations, held in May, indicate that the contracting parties are close to reaching agreement on the key reforms.  Following a final round of negotiations planned for next week, it is possible that an agreement, in principle, can be announced at the ECT conference at the end of this month.</p><p>Ireland's position remains to support the treaty and the benefits to international energy security that it can provide, especially at a time energy security has been threatened, while also supporting the modernisation process to align the treaty with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  Ireland, therefore, awaits the outcome of the final rounds of negotiations planned for this month, while reserving the option to support a co-ordinated withdrawal from the treaty, should these efforts ultimately fail and if such a course of action is considered appropriate by Government to achieve our national renewable energy and climate ambitions.</p></speech>

The only thing this treaty protects is the profits of fossil fuel companies.  They are looking at ways to bail themselves out before the transition to a decarbonised future.  The ISDS is not part of the modernisation process and no matter what conclusions are made next month, it will not address the biggest issue with this treaty.</p> <p>Ireland is looking at introducing seven temporary gas-fired power plants and there is potentially planning permission in for an LNG terminal in Shannon.  They will all be protected by ISDS for years.  These are huge projects and they are not temporary.  If a future Government decides that it wants to phase out those fossil-fuel facilities, it will be on the hook to cover the profits of those fossil fuel investors.  That is exactly what happened to the Dutch Government when it tried to phase out temporary, coal-fired power stations.  It now faces litigation in a private corporate court for billions of euro because the court found that it was not doing enough on climate action and it chose to try to close down coal-fired fossil fuel plants.  The fact that we are four years into negotiations and still trying to fix this treaty is deeply disappointing.  It does not bode well for us meeting our climate targets.</p></speech>

That is essential.  The Government's position is, therefore, that the best outcome of the treaty-modernisation negotiations is to align the treaty with the Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal, while maintaining the energy security framework provided by the treaty.</p> <p>While the option to withdraw from the treaty is reserved, the Senator will be familiar with the sunset clause that would apply in this case, recent CJEU rulings notwithstanding.  Given the agreement, in principle, is now considered possible at the ECT conference at the end of this month, considerations of withdrawal should be deferred until at least this event has had the opportunity to deliver agreement.</p> <p>Recent rulings by the CJEU have determined that the arbitration system under the ECT cannot be used to claim compensation in intra-EU disputes.  The court confirmed that despite the multilateral character of the ECT and the fact that it also governs relationships with non-EU countries, the preservation of the autonomy and specific character of EU law precludes the ECT from being able to impose the same obligations on the member states among themselves.  Since the ruling would likely not preclude the use of the treaty arbitration process in intra-EU cases held elsewhere in the world, there have been further calls from several member states for a co-ordinated withdrawal from the treaty.  It should be noted, however, that in terms of a 20-year sunset clause under which treaty terms would continue to apply, a co-ordinated withdrawal would, therefore, need to manage this risk.</p></speech>

A proud Limerick woman, Mary was a teacher by profession spending her entire career at Presentation College.  As a member of Limerick County Council, Mary was a dedicated public representative for almost 30 years.  She gave three decades of service to the people of Limerick city and county.  Not only was she the first female chair of Limerick County Council but she was also the first female Senator to represent Limerick.  Mary was one of the longest serving public representatives in her local community before she retired in 2014.  She served two terms in Seanad &Eacute;ireann and was well known as a very warm, kind and engaging person who offered support and guidance to everybody she met.  At this sad time my thoughts and the thoughts of Seanad &Eacute;ireann are with her family, her husband Nicholas, daughter Nicola and her extended family and friends.  We express our sympathies on their sad loss.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

The Portuguese National Day is a moment when the country celebrates one of its heroes who is not a warrior as the ambassador pointed out, but a poet.  We have had some famous poets in our Seanad, notably W. B. Yeats.  The poet is Lu&iacute;s de Cam&otilde;es and the anniversary of his death in 1580 is the grounds for the celebration of the national day of Portugal.  His epic poem, which is a bit like Homer's Ilead, recounts the voyage and journey of the discovery by Portuguese sailors in the 15th and 16th centuries.  It unites all the people of Portugal around the world, its many citizens who live outside Portugal and many who live here in Ireland.  Of course as we are both located on the edge of Europe our countries have a common and shared heritage in terms of the Atlantic Ocean and the wider world as two seafaring nations.</p> <p>This year is the 360th anniversary of a Kerryman who played an important role in the story of Ireland and of Portugal, Daniel O'Daly, a Dominican friar originally from Kilsarkan, founded Corpo Santo seminary and a Dominican college for students in the centre of Lisbon in 1630.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">An Cathaoirleach:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2246"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2246&amp;amp;pid=MarkDaly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Subsequently, he went on to found an Irish Dominican convent in Lisbon as well.  The nuns in the institution only departed in 2016 and it still operates as a school under the auspices of the Irish Dominicans.</p><p>This year also marks the 80th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Ireland and Portugal, in respect of Ireland having a presence in Lisbon.  I am delighted to say we have an Oireachtas friendship group and Senator Gavan is the convenor, along with Senators O'Donovan, Conway, Craughwell and Byrne.  I extend a particular welcome to our new Portuguese ambassador, who has not yet presented his credentials on behalf of his country and his people.  Ambassador Bernardo Lucena is very welcome and we extend our best wishes to him and to all the people of Portugal on their national day.  I thank the ambassador for being with us today.</p></speech>

I have had the good fortune and luck to avail of wonderful hospitality in his country over many years and I look forward to doing so again.  On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, I would also like to be associated with the condolences the House has offered to the Jackman family and to the Fine Gael Party on the passing away of Mary Jackman.  I had several meetings with her about 19 years ago.  She struck me as a warm, kind and compassionate lady.  Those meetings were in connection with Limerick getting ready for the 2003 Special Olympics World Games and the Senator was also involved in that regard.  Ms Jackman came to all the meetings we had and she was keen to ensure that Limerick was a part of the vibrant experience and that the athletes, their coaches and their families would have a positive time in the city.  I have many happy memories of a special lady.</p> <p>I support the Order of Business as outlined.  Turning to the issues I wish to raise today, I spoke many times about the need for dedicated day care for those suffering from Alzheimer's disease in County Kildare.  I am pleased that we have sourced a place.  The Alzheimer Society of Ireland has been organising day care of this kind in County Kildare, but there have been five temporary locations.  For the last three years, however, there has been no provision in this regard, apart from what could be offered in homes and online.  We have now sourced a custom-built area and this development is going to be positive for the people of County Kildare.  I thank the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, especially the Kildare branch of the society, chaired by Marie Conlan, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and the HSE.  It strikes me, however, that we need to map areas in the country where there are no dedicated Alzheimer's disease services.  These services are greatly important to the people living with dementia and to their families.</p> <p>Regarding the strategic housing development project that has started, and indeed that is now nearly completed, in Newbridge, this involved a decision where the county development plan was ignored.  I always thought it was the wrong thing to do.  In this case, however, it is a large housing estate and in the associated planning stages, Kildare County Council stipulated that there should be a pedestrian link between the Liffey linear park in respect of connectivity and school safety.  These aspects are important.  It would now appear that this condition has been revoked and, instead, that walkers and children going to school will be forced to go back out onto a busy road and to use two pedestrian crossings there.  Something like this is completely wrong.  We must ensure at the highest level that we place a focus on these types of linear walkways in nature.  We all used them during the earlier stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Equally, emphasis must be placed on their role as safe routes to schools.  This is a situation where a provision specified in the planning permission, that was relevant, and to which people did not object because they thought it was the right thing to do, all of a sudden seems to have been renegotiated.  There is something wrong with this.</p></speech>

I paid my own tribute to former Senator Jackman yesterday, but I am thinking of her husband, Nick, her daughter, Nicola, and her sister, Ursula, who are watching this morning.  I pass on my sympathies again.  I thank my colleagues and I am sure many more will be contributing further kind words regarding the passing of the late Mary Jackman.</p> <p>The CEO of Age Action Ireland was on "Morning Ireland" today speaking about senior citizens and the withdrawal of Ulster Bank and KBC from Ireland.  I am on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, and this issue was raised at our last meeting.  We have had several meetings where we have brought in representatives of the banks.  The spokesperson for Age Action Ireland today echoed the point I had made at the meeting of the joint committee last week.  Many of us are computer-savvy or adept at email.  People are receiving letters and emails about these bank changes and they must go online to change their direct debits and similar services.  While the representatives of the banks who appeared at the finance committee said they were going to have people on hand to provide help in the banks, several technological aspects must still be surmounted.  </p> <p>Many older people are afraid because they are not computer savvy.  This is causing them stress and strain.  We should have a debate here regarding how best to advise people in this situation.  Perhaps representatives of the banks could be brought in.  While they have come to the joint committee already, we should communicate our reservations now concerning what older people are going through because of these changes.  It is not a nice place for older people to find themselves.  Banks have become all about computers now.  This suits some people, but not all.  This is one of the main reasons that I raise this issue today.  </p> <p>I may sound like a broken record when I bring up the topic of University Hospital Limerick, UHL, but it has been reported today in the newspapers that a family's loved one, who was in UHL, disappeared from the hospital.  That person was missing for several hours before being found by the Garda.  I am aware as well of another family whose members encountered a similar situation recently, but they did not go public about what happened.</p> <p>Given this type of issue, as well the overcrowding in the hospital and the number of people waiting on beds there, it is evident that there is a serious problem at UHL.  I asked the Deputy Leader yesterday if she would contact the Minister's office in this regard.  I asked the Deputy Leader to do that because I wrote to that office seeking clarification regarding what is going to happen with the independent review.  To date, I have received no correspondence in response on this issue.  I am concerned for the health and safety of not only families and their loved ones who are using the hospital, but also for the staff.  In the article where the family I mentioned gave details about their loved one going missing from the hospital, they said they would never go back to the hospital again.  It is a terrible indictment of a hospital for a family to state they are afraid to take their loved one back there.  Therefore, I would like the Acting Leader's support regarding this issue.</p></speech>

I also join my colleagues in extending my sympathy on the death of former Senator Mary Jackman.  I knew her well personally.  She engaged with me in respect of her own election to the Seanad.  She was a Member of this House for two terms and, of course, spent 30 years as a county councillor in Limerick.  Ms Jackman was the first female cathaoirleach, or mayor, of Limerick County Council and she was very proud of that.  How things have changed and how we have progressed regarding women's access to politics from the time Ms Jackman was there.  She was a person who was committed to the work of the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, and the General Council of County Councillors, GCCC, as it was then, prior to the advent of the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG.  Ms Jackman toured around the country advocating extensively and strongly for local government and its members, and particularly for women in local politics.  I acknowledge her contribution in that regard.  To her family, she was, as people said, an absolute lady, and a pleasure to know and an exceptionally warm, stylish and bright person.  I will always remember her for those reasons.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I wish to extend my condolences to her family and to Fine Gael.  She was at the centre of Fine Gael and terribly proud of her connections with it.  I thank the Leader's office for arranging the extended time to debate the Birth Information and Tracing Bill.  It is important legislation.  There will be a number of amendments and I hope we will have a full House.  It is among the most important legislation to come before us in the past few months.  Very few people have been here to engage with it in the past.  I personally have a stake in it and have been down this road.  Perhaps I am biased.  It is important legislation.  I thank the Minister, who is engaging with it in the extended time.</p><p>I note the earlier comment about strategic housing developments.  The strategic housing development process was a failure on the part of the last Administration.  I have sat in here year in, year out, hearing Government Members be rightly critical of it, but it was Government policy.  It changed and we have a new policy now, which is about time.  Yesterday, yet again, the High Court overturned a major strategic housing development in Monkstown, County Dublin, at a site called Dalguise.  Citizens, residents and communities cannot always be wrong, when the High Court is vindicating them and upholding the objections.  We need a debate on An Bord Plean&aacute;la, its functions and its processes.  I want a debate on its processes.  I am not calling into question its decisions.  Ultimately, the processes will take care of it.</p><p>Finally, as I did last week, I yet again call for the senior counsel, Rory Mulcahy's, report on the investigation into corruption in Donegal to be published.  It has been sitting on the Minister's desk for five years.  It should be published at some point.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Sinn F&eacute;in group, I extend my sympathies to the Fine Gael Party on the loss of former Senator Jackman.  I begin by welcoming the significant step forward in the Belfast High Court yesterday relating to the redevelopment of Casement Park, which has been wasted for far too long.  It has the potential to be a transformative economic driver for west Belfast, Belfast as a whole and indeed the wider province.  It is a great shame that a number of generations of Gaels have not had the opportunity to play on the pitch and enjoy the spectacle of Casement Park.  I look forward to seeing workers on site and to seeing colleagues from across the rest of the country come back to Casement Park to enjoy a thrilling experience.</p></speech>

I turn to the issue of passports.  I will make a number of political points and observations but I assure the Acting Leader that they are not directed at him.  They are more for his colleagues at the Cabinet table.  I welcome the growing cross-party support and recognition of the need for additional passport offices to try to help to deal with the issues, which we are all aware of, especially a new, dedicated office in the Six Counties.  Derry City and Strabane District Council recently passed a motion tabled by my colleague, Councillor Emma McGinley, calling for an office in the North.</p> <p>I know other councils across the Six Counties will debate similar motions in the coming days and weeks.  The reality is that the second highest concentration of applications in Ireland is in County Antrim.  That increase from the North has been evident and consistent for some years.  If people in this Chamber were not aware of it, they should have been, because I have raised it consistently in recent years.  Senators can imagine my dismay when I read reports on RT&Eacute; and subsequently heard in news bulletins that the Government would consider it "politically tricky" to open an office in the North.  How would it be politically tricky and for whom?  As the Acting Leader knows, politics is the art of the possible.  When the T&aacute;naiste, who was Taoiseach at the time, said that an Irish Government would never again leave citizens in the North behind, I do not remember there being a caveat of "unless it is politically tricky".  Article 2 of the Constitution states it is the birth right and entitlement of everyone born on this island to be part of the Irish nation.  I have never read an addendum stating, "unless it is politically tricky".</p> <p>The Government has grade A office space in Belfast.  It also has a significant residence in Belfast.  They are both used for positive engagement with people and I respect the workers there, doing that work.  Though the darkest days of conflict, F&aacute;ilte Ireland had an office in the centre of Belfast when it was a much more volatile and dangerous city.  We cannot deny citizens services they are paying for simply because it is politically tricky.  More than 27,000 people have signed my online petition calling for this.  Political parties are calling for this.  It makes sense.  Can we get on and do it?</p></speech>

I offer my deepest condolences on the death of former Senator Jackman.</p> <p>I support Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile about having a passport office in Belfast.  Belfast is the second city on this island and it should have a passport office.  I have supported this for many years.  I concur with all the Senator's comments.</p> <p>I want to highlight rural Ireland at its best, especially the farming community.  I draw attention to the agricultural shows being organised all around the country.  Dundalk Agricultural Show will be on 12 June.  It is always a wonderful day.  I urge Senators to support their local shows.  I commend the committees on these shows.  It is so important to communities to showcase what they have and what we have as a rural community, including everything from livestock to chickens to brown bread.  There is much talent and pride on show on these days.  These days do not happen by accident.  There are many emails, arrangements of sponsorship and time spent organising the day.  Dundalk Agricultural Show goes back to the 1890s.  It shows the long, proud tradition of agriculture in our county.  I want to highlight the strong support for the Government for our agricultural shows, announced by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, last week, and in previous weeks by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.  It is important that we support rural communities, farmers and businesses.  I urge everyone to attend them and the Dundalk show on 12 June.</p></speech>

For those of us who have been involved in politics for a long time, Mary Jackman epitomised all that is good about politics, with her sincerity, her warmth of personality, and her genuine interest in her city, Limerick, her people, her community, and indeed in the Fine Gael Party.  She was the champion for many issues, but it was her warmth of personality, her genuine concern and sincerity, and her wonderful smile, laugh and roguery that I remember her for.  I sympathise with Nick, Nicola and her sister Ursula on their sad loss today.  May she rest in peace.  I know we will join again to pay tribute to Mary.  She was a wonderful person.</p> <p>I am tempted to table an amendment to the Order of Business but I will not do that to the Acting Leader.  It is time for the Minister for Education to come to the House to explain and outline the date for the issuing of the leaving certificate results for 2022.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This leaving certificate class deserves better than procrastination and obfuscation from the Department of Education.  I know as a teacher that there are many different pieces and parts to the exam results that are to be issued.  However, the CAO, the higher education institutions and students are asking for clarity, which means being able to offer places for the new academic year.  That also has an effect on rooms being available for student accommodation and planning for the new year.  It is incumbent on the Minister, the political leader of the Department of Education, to come into the House today to give clarity to the leaving certificate class of 2022.  We are on the eve of the leaving certificate examinations.  This day next week, we will be in the second level exam season.  For this reason, I ask that the Minister come to the House.  When we come back after the recess next week, I will propose a motion on this if clarity is not given.</p></speech>

It highlighted pressing concerns facing the industry here and called for Government intervention in key areas in need of reform.  Top of that list is the need for the overhaul of the dental treatment service scheme, the HSE-managed scheme which offers medical card holders free routine dental care from contracting private dental practitioners.</p> <p>Leading practitioners have said the current scheme is not fit for purpose and does not reflect modern dental practices and standards.  As few as 30% of the dentists operating in the country remain in the scheme, which is testament to the issues that remain unresolved.  Chief among these is the red-tape rules which dentists must follow to treat medical card patients and the limited materials they can use while treating medical card patients.  Removing these restrictions would allow dentists the freedom and autonomy to treat patients as necessary according to their needs and offer medical card patients the same standard of care as private patients.  While the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has been made aware of this and has implemented some changes, the Irish Dental Association maintains that these will be no more than a band aid for the current scheme which must be wholly reformed if it is to meet the needs of dentists and patients alike.  This is a very serious issue which we need to raise with the Minister to get clarity for the Irish Dental Association.</p></speech>

I am sure the Acting Leader will join me in welcoming the delegates and I am sure they will have a good time and a very productive congress in Dublin.  Our affiliation with European political parties is important, especially given Ireland's continued desire to be at the heart of the European project.</p> <p>I also ask that the House have statements on school transport.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, has initiated a review of the school transport programme.  It would be useful before we rise for the summer to invite the Minister to the House to outline the progress made on school transport, which becomes a challenge every summer, particularly in rural areas.  The Minister has very much committed to reforming the scheme and it would be useful to have her before the House.  We should facilitate as many children as possible to use public transport to get to school, first, because it would make it easier for parents and put less pressure on roads and, second, for environmental reasons.</p></speech>

She was a very distinguished public representative for many years.  This is a very tough time for her family.  Not many people will know that Mary Jackman was originally from Tipperary and was a member of the Furlong family from the Cappagh White area.  I pass on my condolences to them.  She was a colleague of my mother's at one time when there were very few women in politics.  They were quite good friends.  I want to let the family know that we are thinking of them.</p> <p>I ask the Acting Leader to join me in acknowledging the very positive news about postmasters and the &euro;30 million that has been ring-fenced over the next three years to support that important sector.  Today's statement is significant by the Government, and Fine Gael in particular, is highly significant.  I acknowledge our colleague Senator Carrigy who has done stellar work on this in recent months in reaching out to the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU.  We have had many meetings with representatives of the IPU, including Sean Martin, about finding a solution to the very serious prospect that in the next six or seven months a couple of hundred post offices would close on the basis that they were not financially viable.  </p> <p>I have spoken to postmasters at home who are thrilled with the news.  They say this Government decision will save post offices in Tipperary.  That is a fact.  This is the first time that a Government has provided direct funding to postmasters to recognise the role they play in communities, including in Tipperary.  It would be terrible had this not been done as post offices would have had to close in January.  I acknowledge the decision made today and the impact it will have on rural towns and communities across Tipperary.</p></speech>

She was somebody people looked up to, as a woman politician at a time when it was not as popular to be a woman in politics.  I got to know her very well more recently because she spent much of her time in Fanore.  She chose well where to relax and spend time.  I share with others in passing on my sympathies and condolences to her family.</p> <p>Recently, a councillor asked me why we do not have retirement villages zoned within towns.  The towns that have retirement villages are fantastic.  People can downsize into them and make a more substantial property available to those who need them.  We need to incorporate that into our housing plan.  We could have a debate on housing needs of older people.</p> <p>I also welcome the Government's decision to fund An Post by &euro;30 million.  It is a substantial amount of money invested to ensure post offices are viable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For many years now we have all debated the importance of post offices.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has stepped up to the plate and provided the funding to at least give a guarantee that the post offices will remain open, I call now on the public to use those post offices because it is a problem in particular parts of the country that the public simply does not use the post office.</p><p>I call on An Post to step up a little further with the services being in post offices.  We need to have more thinking outside the box about what can be done through the post office.  We have often heard it described as a potential one-stop shop so let us make it a one-stop shop.  Let it be a place where tourists can go for tourism information, for example.  There is so much that can be done but the Government has honoured its side of the bargain.  It is now time for the public and An Post to honour their sides of the bargain as well.</p></speech>

It is crucial to support our postmasters and post offices all over the country but especially in the west.  A report done by the Irish Postmasters' Union with Grant Thornton states that 1.3 million people access services weekly from the post office.  It is where people do their banking, pay their bills, save money and collect pensions and social welfare.  There is a commitment from An Post to sustainable communities, which means that An Post has stated it will ensure access to a post office in communities with more than 500 people.  It is crucial that this supports remote working and environmental action as there will be more reasons to work remotely and fewer reasons to travel long distances.  It will also help us shop local because when there is a post office in a town or village and it will increase footfall in a town, with people coming in to make collections.  If they collect a pension, for example, they will spend it locally.</p> <p>I also note an announcement earlier from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, on the carer's allowance.  It is absolutely crucial for carers all over the country.  The eligibility criteria are changing and the capital disregard will increase from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000.  It is really significant.  They are also looking at changing the disregard for single people to &euro;350 for single people and &euro;750 per week for a couple.  This means more people will be eligible for the full amount of the carer's allowance.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of meeting Mary on a couple of occasions.  She was a very dedicated local and national representative and a fine person as well.</p> <p>It is said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.  For the past six years I have had the privilege of being here, I have raised the matter of University Hospital Limerick and each time I have done that, nothing has changed.  Each time the result has been the same, which is no change.  It is interesting to note the way Leaders in the Chamber have changed over the years, however.  Initially, the Leader would have argued with me and said things would get better.  Then another Leader would have stopped arguing and expressed concern.  Most recently, the concern expressed by the Leader seems to have changed to bewilderment.</p> <p>The reality is that yesterday UHL set a new record.  In April, it had 1,735 people on trolleys and in May that has increased to 1,823.  The number has increased by nearly 100 in what are supposed to be summer months.  My question is simple; after all these years of raising UHL in this Chamber, and each time seeing the position get worse and worse, where is the political accountability?  That is what is missing.  We have not had a Government act in the way it should.</p> <p>I say very clearly that we need fundamental change at the top of UHL.  The people of Limerick and the mid-west have suffered for far too long and I am sick to the back teeth of raising this matter.  I would much rather raise others.  I am in despair.  As has been mentioned, the hospital even lost a patient the other day.  My colleague, Deputy Maurice Quinlivan, highlighted that case yesterday in the press because the family expressly asked him to do so.  When will we see fundamental change and, by extension, when will we see political accountability that we need to see from this Government?  The people of Limerick have been waiting for more than a decade to see fundamental change at the UHL and each time this Government has failed them.  We need a different result and we need it now.</p></speech>

I thank all of them for their warm tributes to the late Mary Jackman; I know her family is listening.  On behalf of the Fine Gael Party in particular, I thank her for her dedication and service to County Limerick and here as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>Senator O'Loughlin began by relaying the good news about a dedicated centre for people with Alzheimer's disease in Kildare.  She made a valid point about the need to map the gaps in services across the country.  It is a worthy initiative and something I will ask the Leader's office to contact the Minister for Health about.</p> <p>She also spoke about strategic housing development, as did Senator Boyhan.  Strategic housing developments were initiated to try to improve the flow and processing of new housing applications because there was a view that housing developments were being held up within the planning process.  The legislation has been amended and that is important.  The Senator spoke about connectivity issues relating to walkways at the Liffey Linear Park and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>It is something I have come across and An Bord Plean&aacute;la must really engage on these matters.  If it makes a decision to overturn a planning permission or refusal by a county council, there must be a process that would allow the board to say to the council that it is going to overturn the decision but where it can take on board specific issues that it might have.  For example, one development needed an area for buses to pull in outside.  The council refused the application and An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted it, meaning there was no bus shelter in the finished project.  There really should be joined-up thinking on that.  The Senator spoke about connectivity and it is very important.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la must be aware of that and a debate, as suggested, is a good idea as well.</p> <p>Senator Maria Byrne mentioned Age Action Ireland and the elderly in Ireland.  It is a valid point.  Banks are looking out for people who will have to change their bank from Ulster Bank in particular, which is exiting the market.  It is encouraging people to join the relatively small number of competitor banks.  It is a valid point because there is much work in changing direct debits and all of that.  By God if you miss a payment you will know about it.  People get the phone calls and human contact when a payment is missed for insurance or whatever else.  The banks look for that money.  It is an important matter and hundreds of thousands of direct debits across the country will need to be swapped over from Ulster Bank and KBC to other banks.  I know the committee has worked on it, and a debate on banking competition, as well as the matters raised by the Senator, would be worthwhile.  I will inquire about that.</p> <p>The Senator also mentioned the reports of the person who went missing from UHL.  Senators Byrne, Gavan, Conway and Ahearn have raised on numerous occasions issues around UHL.  As a member of the health committee, together with Senator Conway, we requested that certain hospital groups, such as those in the mid-west and the Saolta group, where there are particular issues relating to overcrowding, need to be accountable.  As politicians we are accountable to residents in the area and the Minister is accountable to the D&aacute;il and, sometimes, to this House if he or she comes in.  Senior Ministers tend not to do so.  The management of hospitals must also be accountable and I have requested that they be accountable to the health committee.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan mentioned strategic housing developments, as I said.  He also asked for a report into alleged planning irregularities in County Donegal to be published.  I will ask the Leader's office to contact the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage about that.  It is the report commissioned by Mr. Rory Mulcahy.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile commented on the welcome news around the Casement Park redevelopment.  I have not had the pleasure of being there but I have seen the pictures over the past number of years.  Rewilding is positive now but not in that case because flowers and everything were growing in it.  I think I saw sheep in some of the pictures.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The redevelopment of Casement Park is very welcome for Belfast, but also for the GAA and the island as a whole.  I certainly welcome it.</p><p>I refer to the passport issue.  Senator Wilson has a tabled a motion on the matter and a number of other Senators have indicated their support for the opening of a passport office in Belfast and the west or north west to provide that face, if you like.  As Members of these Houses, we have access to a hotline.  However, we have all heard from constituents, particularly in recent times, that it is very difficult to get through.  The ability to have face-to-face meetings and make appointments for emergency applications in one's immediate area would be very welcome.  I am not sure when the motion will be before the House but it is important that we look at these initiatives.  </p><p>Senator McGreehan also commented on the Passport Office.  She referred to the agricultural shows, which are a mainstay of the rural countryside.  They have been missing for the past couple of years because of Covid, so it is great to see they will be back this year.  The Government has supported these events under various Departments.  We will all enjoy going to the various county and local shows in the coming months.</p><p>Senator Buttimer asked that the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, come to the House to discuss the issue of leaving certificate results day.  I will ask the Leader&rsquo;s office to write to the Minister to request such a meeting.  I hope a date will be announced soon and there will not be a need for a special debate.  Hopefully, a decision will be made soon to give peace of mind to students who will be sitting exams from next week.  It is obviously very important for all those sitting their exams to know when the results are coming out.  The CAO will also want to know, as will the third level institutions, as others have said. </p><p>Senator Keogan spoke of the need the overhaul the dental treatment services scheme.  I welcome that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has committed to a review of the scheme and recommended improvements in an announcement in April.  This is an area where there have been failings.  A number of dentists have exited the scheme for a variety of reasons.  Certainly, if something is not done and more dentists exit the scheme, it will no longer be effective.  Perhaps the Senator will table a Commencement matter on the issue to get fuller details.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne welcomed members of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe who are soon coming to Dublin.  He mentioned that up to 1,000 delegates will arrive and that his party, Fianna F&aacute;il, are part of the alliance.  I welcome those delegates coming to Dublin.  It is certainly a coup to get that group to come to here for its convention.  The European People&rsquo;s Party, of which Fine Gael is a member, was in Dublin in the convention centre, I think, seven or eight years ago.  That was welcome at the time as well.  The Senator also called for statements on the school transport scheme before the recess.  It is a staple of the political diet in the month of August for people who do not get bus tickets to inquire about them and ask if they will get concessionary tickets.  Any improvement to that scheme would be welcomed.  I will request a debate on it.</p><p>Senators Ahearn, Conway and Dolan discussed the &euro;30 million grant for An Post.  I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and our colleague, Senator Carrigy, who has pushed for years for support for a sustainable nationwide post office network.  I am told the monthly footfall in post offices is more than 1 million visits.  That is indicative of the service the post office provides and its importance.  There is &euro;10 million each year for three years to protect the post office network, ensuring that it can continue to provide the service it does.  I hope that can be continued after the three-year period because it is hugely important.  I acknowledge all involved in that.</p><p>Senator Dolan also commented on the changes to the carer's allowance made by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  An increase in the threshold was announced in the budget.  I know the Minister also wants to see carers receive pensions.  That is hugely important.  I welcome the changes and initiatives the Minister outlined yesterday as well.</p><p>I think I have covered all of the matters raised by Senators.</p></speech>

The amendment strengthens the language in the subsection by specifying that a relevant body ought to provide a relevant person with a statement setting out birth information obtained within the records it or the Child and Family Agency holds relating to the applicant upon written application.  The Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth's report on pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill recommended that the use of the word "may" throughout the heads of the Bill ought to be addressed to strengthen its provisions.  This amendment acts on that recommendation.</p></speech>

It is similar to a number of amendments that have been put forward.  We debated the issue of the language of "may" versus "shall" on a number of occasions.  As we know, the Bill places obligations on relevant bodies to provide a summary of all relevant records they hold, including information to which the application does not relate.  This amendment, in my view, is unnecessary as the relevant bodies will already be providing a statement in all cases where it makes sense to do so.  As I said, that will be in the vast majority of cases.  There may be situations where one document is being released where a statement is not necessary, but otherwise it will always be the case that the supporting statement is forthcoming.</p> <p>The open approach to the provision of information will be reiterated through the guidelines which will empower the Minister.  They will stipulate that an enabling approach should be undertaken, whereby bodies should release any information over and above the categories of information set out in the Bill, except where they would be prohibited by law from doing so.  In light of that, I do not believe this amendment is necessary.</p></speech>

The applicant will be kept informed and will be<br /><br />consulted throughout the course of the investigation.&rdquo;.   </blockquote> <p>The amendment inserts a new subsection into the Bill, that is, where there is no entry present in the register of births, the authority shall seize all records relating to the relevant adoption and open an investigation into what transpired.  The applicant will be kept informed and will be consulted throughout the course of the investigation.  Section 6 currently provides that relevant persons may apply for a copy of their birth certificate.  This amendment is intended to ensure the State takes responsibility for establishing what transpired if an adopted person's birth was not registered.  This could relate, for example, to establishing whether he or she was registered as the natural child of his or her adoptive parents or if that person's birth was not registered at all or if, perhaps, that person was born outside of Ireland.  The AAI is the regulator of adoption in this Bill, so it is entirely fitting it should seize all records where there is a suspicion of wrongdoing.</p><p>The absence of information in the birth register falls into the realm of illegal adoptions.  This amendment aims to strengthen the power of the Oireachtas to legislate to ensure access to birth certificates and protects a large cohort of adopted persons who were subject to illegal birth registrations or adoptions with no records.  This was noted in the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny report, with one recommendation highlighting the need for an oversight process or accessible appeal mechanism and a recommendation that the Bill provide for recourse to an ombudsman or other process to ensure oversight of the application process's support for adopted persons and others in using the provisions of the Bill.</p></speech>

In principle, I support the idea.  I can think of nothing worse than to be told there is no information or birth information available.  The sentiments of the amendment are too strong, in that the wording presupposes that there might be something to seize, which raises an expectation that cannot be met.  That is why I am cautious about the amendment.  However, we need some sort of mechanism.  We cannot just say there is nothing there.  People need to be brought into a process.  Therefore there is a need for some mechanism whereby further information can be obtained or sought and the person assisted and not left hanging with nowhere to go.  The hurt and devastation of that would be significant.  In principle, I support the sentiment of the amendment.  It is a little bit too strong.  I ask the Minister to respond accordingly.</p></speech>

We have worked with many people through pre-legislative scrutiny and all of our work on the Bill.  It would be incredible to think there is no step beyond simply saying there is no birth certificate.  A process, procedure, advice and somewhere to go to be able to gain more access or increased access to who one is, where one came from and how one's life began is necessary.  The wording of the amendment might be too strong for this Bill, but I await the response of the Minister because there are important and beneficial concepts in the amendment.</p></speech>

Again, we have to manage people's expectations in a responsible manner.  We know that for many years there has simply been no information.  That is not to say there was not information originally.  Much of the information has been destroyed.  Many of the people involved in these illegal acts are in the wrong or the people responsible for them, their sponsors and supporters have run away from the things that were done.  The easiest thing was to light a match and do away with it.</p> <p>There is a lot of denial going on within families and in the institutions of the State, and that needs to be recognised.  There are people who deliberately withheld information over many years, but when they were persistently pressed, they handed it over.  I know of two people who arrived at a particular institution two years ago and refused to leave, having been told there was no information, and then secured information.  The establishment concerned lied through its teeth to them.</p> <p>It would be foolish of us to think people were co-operating at all times.  People deliberately set out to withhold information.  It is not a question of there being information versus no information.  Information was withheld and deliberately destroyed.  That is a terrible thing to do to any individual at any point in his or her life.</p> <p>I fully understand where the amendment is coming from.  In his response, the Minister might touch on the creation of a centralised State repository of records.  In time, where people co-operate, this should all come forward.  A lot of things we are anticipating will not actually happen.  I do not say that as a brushstroke remark.  Eventually, those who want to co-operate and be supportive will let the information come forward, subject to the legal checks and balances that are required and the obligations on people.  A centralised State repository of records is something the Minister has mentioned.  There might be no one to give information to in terms of individuals, but a central repository may be a place that could hold much of this information and assist people in the future.  Second and third generations of people may wish to seek this information.</p></speech>

The amendment would require that where no birth information is available upon application by an affected person, the authority must seize all records and conduct an investigation into what transpired.  We had a fairly significant discussion during the last debate on the Bill on a similar amendment put forward by the Senator and Senator Higgins.  We teased out some of the issues.  This amendment seeks to provide that the AAI would seize any available records and open an investigation in a scenario where no birth information is found.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The legislation only requires that where a relevant body has no records available, the relevant body must inform the applicant of this fact in writing without delay.  The concern in this scenario is that an applicant would be met with a mere letter noting there is no available information and nothing more.  Senator Higgins and others have expressed what that would mean to an affected person seeking information.</p><p>I cannot accept this amendment, because as I said about the previous amendment, I cannot accept it, as currently drafted.  First, section 63 provides for the agency and the authority to provide support to relevant persons, and this support can extend to assisting a person in identifying where their records are held.  In addition, the section provides for the agency and the authority to provide support to a person making an application to a contact preference register and the tracing service.</p><p>Having reflected on the discussion the previous day and having reflected on what other colleagues have said on this issue, we may be able to look at bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage that would make it clear that where no information is available that it will be explicitly made clear to the relevant person in the letter conveying that how they access the contact preference register in undertaking a search there and how they access the tracing service.  Other routes are available and while it might not get them the original documentation, rather than them just receiving a letter saying there is no information, it would clearly signpost the pathways that are already there.  I will ask officials to look to see if something can be done that would make that clearer in the direct response that relevant people receive where no information is available.</p><p>As Senator Boyhan has made clear, we do have to be careful about expectation management.  At the end of this process, there are probably going to be thousands of disappointed adopted people and people who were boarded out and while we cannot overestimate what we can provide in terms of documents, other processes exist.  Senator Boyhan is correct: there is a process to bring together records.  Part of the legislative provisions allow the AAI to begin the process of bringing records within its custody.  My Department is already doing that in respect of getting health records and records from other areas as well.  That is why we hired an archivist in my Department.</p><p>As Members will be aware, we made an announcement about a national records and memorial centre and work is advancing in that area as well.  In the longer term, I hope that is where these documents could be accessed.  We made a very clear decision in the context of this legislation that we would not ask people to wait until a national records centre is set up because that is a long-term project.  Once the three-month period has passed, people will be able to access information under this legislation.  We all recognise that is the priority, namely, quick access to information.  I hope that provides some information and perhaps some comfort to the Senators.</p></speech>

I know the Minister and perhaps other Senators as well as me will look at what those next steps can be in the communication.  However, even if the next steps are laid out very clearly and something is not just dropped at that point in terms of engagement, there is also the question of whether all avenues have been explored.  There is still a question mark at the end of the process for the State as to why.  Even if we can clearly outline the support and other avenues that someone can take, what happens when they get to the end of that if there is still no sign of anything?  At what point do we ask why is that the case and try to understand why someone's birth would not be registered?  Is there still room to discus that very last possible avenue?  It is not as harsh and as strong as an investigation into the records, but it is a question the State has to ask itself as to why there are no records anywhere.  Between now and Report Stage I wonder if we could figure out what a different wording in that regard might look like that is not as strong as what is outlined in the amendment.</p></speech>

Perhaps the functioning of the specialist tracing team needs to be spelled out more clearly in terms of how it is going to function.  If there is no information and there has clearly been a wrongful registration, be it that whatever happened was done illegally or mistakenly, a specialist tracing team was envisaged by the Minister in his own undertakings and arising from the Conor O'Mahony report, but we also have the possibility of a further undertaking, statutory or otherwise, that looks into all of the illegal registrations.  Perhaps such a mechanism would be possible and that it could be done by guidelines or statutory instrument so that it would be one of the things that would trigger the specialist team to act.  There could be a means of linking it into the Act.  It could be too prescriptive to go into the Act, but the guidelines that flow from the Act could consider that.</p></speech>

In every case where an applicant is provided under this Act with a copy of the records that contain the birth information to which the application relates, or with a statement setting out the birth information contained in those records, the Authority shall send to the applicant, by prepaid registered post or other recorded delivery, a statement by the Authority setting out, in so far as it has established in relation to each relevant parent,whether&mdash;  	(a) he or she has not made a statement under <i>section 38(11)</i>,<br /><br />(b) he or she has made a statement under <i>section 38(11)</i>that either of the following applies:  <blockquote> 	(i) he or she is seeking to have contact with the applicant;<br /><br />(ii) he or she is willing to be contacted by the applicant, </blockquote>(c) he or she has made a statement under <i>section 38(11)</i>that he or she is not willing to be contacted by the applicant,<br /><br />(d) he or she is deceased,<br /><br />(e) he or she is not willing to be contacted by the applicant.&rdquo;.   </blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 68 is the substantive amendment in this group and deals with the issue of the mandatory information session.  That issue, which these amendments address, is a big sticking point for us in the Labour Party.  We are disappointed we did not see progress made on this issue in the D&aacute;il.  I know my colleague, Deputy Bacik, had a full debate with the Minister in committee and on the D&aacute;il floor and we acknowledge how much progress was made on this and other issues on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  We all appreciate improvements have been made to the Bill and the Minister is open to making improvements on Report Stage.  However, this is still a difficult point for us and for those who are seeking information.  It means access to birth information remains conditional in certain cases on the holding of this information session.</p><p>We all accept, as the Minister said on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il, that we need to balance information rights and privacy rights.  For us, the retention of the mandatory information session means privacy rights continue to trump identity rights.  During pre-legislative scrutiny, the committee put forward a unanimous recommendation that an alternative to mandatory information session as a safeguard to ensure the balance of the rights would be to send an appropriate statement by registered post.  In amendment No. 68 and the other amendments in this group, we have crafted a mechanism whereby such a statement could be sent by the authority setting out the relevant matters in writing to a person seeking information.  In our view, this would be a sufficient safeguard, along with other safeguards in the legislation, such as the information campaign, to ensure these constitutional rights are balanced.  It would be a more practical mechanism because it would also ensure there could be no dispute as to what was said and whether a Zoom call or a meeting had, in fact, taken place.  It would also show trust in people seeking the information that they would receive the statement and it would be sufficient.</p><p>We have looked at section 17 to see what the Government proposes as a safeguard.  The information session need not be in one place but it does require that each participant is able, directly or by means of electronic communications technology, to speak and be heard by the other participants.  It sets out in subsection (2) the relevant information about which the designated person is to inform the adopted person seeking the information.  Why can this information not simply be set out in a written statement and be sent by registered post so there is proof it has been received?  This is particularly relevant when section 17(4) requires the designated person, on completion of the information section, to confirm it has taken place and to provide a notification.  There is already in the Government's proposal a mechanism for a written statement.  Why not bypass the mandatory information session, bypass this condition on access to information, and proceed as the committee recommended rather than pursuing a paternalistic approach requiring an information session?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#U03200"><p>Amendment No. 69 seeks to delete section 17 as authored and to substitute it with a new section that replaces the mandatory information session with a registered letter that sets out information regarding the contact preferences of each relevant parent.  The suggestion to substitute a register letter was recommended.  A considerable amount of discussion and thought went into attempts to find that compromise at the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Such an amendment was first tabled in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Bacik with the intention of making access to birth certificates and other relevant information by relevant persons unconditional.</p> <p>Section 17 currently provides that to access certain information, an applicant or relevant person must first attend an information session with a designated person.  This provision is problematic, as the Minister knows, for many people involved as it makes access to certain information, including birth certificates, by a relevant person conditional on his or her attending an information session.  This section of the Bill is a red-line issue for stakeholders and survivor groups and its replacement has been debated at length.  The Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth recommended during pre-legislative scrutiny that the information session be replaced with an appropriate alternative such as the sending of a registered letter to all applicants irrespective of whether their birth parent had expressed a preference regarding contact which advises of the circumstances surrounding the contact preferences.</p> <p>The Minister will be aware of the views held by stakeholders and survivor groups in respect of this provision.  I encourage him to consider the alternative provided by these amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#U03300"><p>I should probably begin by taking responsibility.  In the course of pre-legislative scrutiny, I first floated the idea of the registered letter because I looked to the courts and the mechanism there.  A registered letter is sufficient in any legal proceedings as a demonstration of service of documents, proceedings and summonses.  If a registered letter is sufficient to go before a court and a failure to attend a court case regardless of the issues at hand may result in a case being struck out, I did not see why it would be insufficient for a registered letter to be sent where the sender of the letter, Tusla or whatever other authority, adhered to the appropriate protocols and signed off that the register was checked for contact preferences.  In that case, all beneficiaries of information would receive exactly the same treatment so there would be no risk of paternalism.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Naturally, I will support the Government although I have personal unease with the proceedings.  I will stand over it, regardless.  </p><p>I have a difficulty with what is being proposed and am a little uneasy with the legal advice that has been given on this because it suggests that a telephone call or some other means of communication represents a discharging of its obligations by the State.  I completely agree that there must be some positive action on the part of the State to demonstrate that it has protected the right to privacy of the affected individual.  I have spoken with many birth mothers who are frightened for their current circumstances.  It has nothing to do with their personal feelings with regard to this.  We need to ensure that the State positively acts in the preservation of privacy.  </p><p>However, in order to prove that a phone call took place, the transcript of that phone call is going to have to be held somewhere.  Something like that is necessary.  A mere ticking of a box to say that a phone call happened is a lesser burden than a registered letter.  If we can go to that light a burden - that a phone call just took place - then what if the person does not answer the phone?  What if that does not happen?  In the alternative scenario, the person can put in a subject access request.  If the person can put in a subject access request and get all the details anyway, then we seem to be undermining this in a circle.</p><p>I completely agree with the requirement to proactively do something on what is a constitutional right to privacy.  In that hierarchy we are putting privacy below the right to personal identification, which is absolutely the right thing to do.  I see that the Minister is shaking his head.  I trust he has an answer and I know that this has been well thought through.  I know that it is not for the want of trying and action on his part.  What is captured?  How is the phone call proven?  Maybe I need to have an answer to that and then I can come back to the Minister.  I need to understand how that is stronger and how we will not have a constitutional challenge anyway in this regard.  If registered post suffices in the High Court, in what can be huge commercial proceedings and huge cases, for the striking out of cases then I do not see why it does not suffice here.  That said, I am willing to hear the Minister's response.  I know he has done a lot of work on it and I am ready to hear what he has to say.</p></speech>

I do not have much more to add to what Senators Ruane and Moynihan have said already except to say that Sinn F&eacute;in supports their amendments.  We oppose this section outright and may do so at the end of this discussion if those amendments are not accepted.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge that the Minister has moved significantly on this through the various Stages in the D&aacute;il, across the Bill, but section 17 is highly contested.  The mandatory information session, as Senator Ruane points out, is highly contentious among stakeholders.

Senator Ruane suggested that this is one of the red line issues and I agree.  In terms of the needs and wishes of the survivors, their families and advocates, this matter has been raised with me constantly.  It has been a consistent concern.</p> <p>I took the time to read the committee engagement in relation to this and it was interesting to note that the committee was supportive of the idea of the registered letter.  Indeed, Senator Seery Kearney has just explained some of that to us, which I found very helpful.  There is a real dilemma around this issue.  I also looked at the D&aacute;il debates and again, there were issues around that.</p> <p>I want to acknowledge the enormous amount of work that the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Bacik, has done on this.  She argued strongly on these particular issues in the D&aacute;il.  The record speaks for itself.  There was clearly a lot of flow and engagement around these issues.  Part of the issue is the mandatory information session.  I can see some of the reason and logic behind the mandatory information sessions but I can also see why there is genuine concern for people who may have a difficulty engaging with them.  It is about having some sort of practical, meaningful and effective alternative for those who have concerns in relation to it.</p> <p>There has been a lot of debate on this issue.  We have committees here but what is the point in having them if we are not going to take on board their recommendations?  This was teased out at great length in the committee and it was also teased out in the D&aacute;il.  I support these two amendments.  The issue is how to bridge the gap between the mandatory information sessions and some alternative.</p></speech>

In a perfect world none of this would be necessary and we would not have to work within the realms of our awful history.  I would agree with Senator Seery Kearney about registered letters.  In the opinion of most lay people, a registered letter makes common sense.  Unfortunately, I cannot slot myself into the Attorney General's brain to see why this had to be mandatory and why a registered letter was not sufficient.</p> <p>I want to raise an issue related to that phone call or that contact, that is, the legacy of previous trauma that has been inflicted on people by contact from those organisations.  Getting another phone call setting out the state of the law could be retraumatising for an individual who has been through the wringer already.  That is my big fear.  A call from Tusla or one of the other organisations could be retraumatising and we need to make sure those organisations are given every possible instruction on empathy when they make those mandatory phone calls.  I have also heard from women who are very comforted by the mandatory information session.  When we speak here, we are representing both sides.  I have heard from birth mothers who look at the mandatory information session and see it as a comfort blanket, for want of a better description.  </p> <p>I am concerned about retraumatising people and about trust in the organisations.  In a perfect world we would not need this but, unfortunately, we do not live in a perfect world.  We have this legacy of an absolutely desperate history but we must balance that against privacy in the Act.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p></speech>

It is central to this legislation and central to that balancing of rights that we are seeking to achieve in this Bill and which has eluded previous Oireachtais over the last 22 years.  I take what we do here very seriously and I take on board the contributions and concerns raised.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope it is accepted that that is the case.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 68 and 69 are the same and propose a mechanism of communication of a contact preference through registered post as an alternative to a meeting or phone call.  I have noted the suggestion in the pre-legislative scrutiny report that the function of the information session could be fulfilled by registered letter.  Amendments to the same effect were brought on Committee and Report Stages in the D&aacute;il.  However, I do not believe the use of a registered letter instead of a phone call resolves the central issues.  We are trying to balance EU and constitutionally protected rights, namely, the right to identity of the adopted person and the right to privacy of a parent.  This legislation gives significant priority and preference to one set of rights over another.  It  elevates the right to information of adopted people over the right to privacy of their parents.  That is right and we all agree with that.  It has not been done for too long and has been a deep denial of the right to identity of adopted people.  However, when constitutional rights are being balanced, there has to be a balancing mechanism.  I think we all accept that.  The question is how we do that.  For the Government, the central issue is the conveying of the contact preference of the parent.  How do we convey that in the best way possible to the adopted person, while recognising that the identity of the parent will now be provided to the adopted person?</p><p>In a small number of cases - and I believe it will only be a small number - the identity of the parent will be conveyed to the adopted person against the parent's wishes.  We need to achieve that so the adopted person can enjoy their identity rights.  How do we convey that in a meaningful way?  The idea of the registered letter was considered during the drafting process and rejected as being insufficiently protective of the privacy right because it did not sufficiently guarantee the conveying of the preference.  The conveying of the preference is not a tick-box exercise but a genuine effort to protect the privacy right and make sure it is recognised in this process, taking account of the fact that that right has been pared back significantly.  With registered post, there is no guarantee that the individual receiving the post will receive or read it.  There is every possibility that someone else in the house may receive the registered letter.  In that situation, the preference is not directly conveyed.  There are wider circumstances about the individual's preference if somebody else in the house receives the registered letter but, putting that aside, is the preference conveyed?  Senator Seery Kearney focused on the evidence of the call versus the evidence of the letter.  I am focused on the conveying of the information.  How do we ensure to the best of our ability that the vital information, which may or may not be difficult information depending on the individual's circumstances, that the parent does not want to be contacted is conveyed to the adopted person?  We believe the best way is through a call, an online communication or a meeting, whatever is the view of the adopted person.  It cannot be guaranteed through a registered letter.</p><p>A point was made about a call and is right.  It depends on the circumstances of the adopted person.  There may be situations where this call or letter is easy or difficult.  We spent time earlier in the session talking about what an adopted person feels like if they get a letter saying, as it were, "No information &ndash; full stop".   It could be argued that getting a letter saying the parent does not want contact could be regarded as cold and unsatisfactory.  At least with a call, there is the opportunity for some engagement and further information about tracing services.  I am conscious that adopted people do not want to be spoken about as if they are delicate and need counselling in all situations.  Different people's situations are different.</p><p>The central concern in the context of this legislation is the conveying of the information concerning contact preference and looking at how to best secure that.  I believe a call, meeting or online engagement better guarantees the direct conveying of the information than a registered letter and gives us greater security that the information will be conveyed.  The adopted person will do with that information what they decide.</p><p>Senator Seery Kearney made a point about the subject access request and she is right that such a request can be made.  The difference is that such a request does not guarantee access to all information in every circumstance, whereas the legislation we are bringing forward does.  We could have relied on GDPR but we know there is a decision-making process where the data controller reviews the matter and makes a consideration in every case.  That does not happen in this legislation.  Where the process set out in this legislation is followed, every person will receive all of the information.</p><p>On the use of the term "mandatory information session", where someone seeks access to records, be it birth information or early life information, the person make the application and the authority or agency looks at the contact preference register.  Where there is a preference for contact expressed by a parent or it is blank and no preference has been expressed, the full information will be provided to the adopted person immediately.  That will occur in the vast majority of cases.  I am confident of that and will explain why in a moment.  In the vast majority of cases, the idea of the phone call or information session will not be relevant to the engagement.  The person will make an application and receive in the post all the information unredacted.  In a case where the authority or agency identifies that a clear no-contact preference has been made, that means that at some time after this legislation is passed a parent has, for whatever reason, indicated concerns about their privacy right and proactively gone to the effort of contacting the contact preference register and asking that a no-contact preference be recorded.  This is someone clearly expressing concern about that issue.  Where that is the case, that piece of information the parent has seen as vital for the protection of their privacy rights will be conveyed to the adopted person in a phone call, an online meeting or a physical meeting, whatever is the preference of the adopted person.  After that, all the information will be released.  That is the essential point.  This is a mechanism to ensure that, unlike in all previous efforts to legislate in this area, all information will be released and nobody will be left behind.</p><p>A significant focus has been given to how we do this.  As Senator Moynihan knows, the mechanism I now propose was proposed by her party previously, in terms of how we get this balance.  I know people have concerns but it is about getting this constitutional balance right and, for the first time ever, ensuring the result is always the full release of information.  I believe we have got the balance right and we are guaranteeing the vindication of the constitutional right to identity in every situation, while maintaining some protection of the constitutional privacy rights of a parent who has clearly expressed a desire for such protection.  I hear the concerns of Senators as I heard the concerns of Deputies but we have gone as far as we can constitutionally to achieve that difficult balance.  The outcome will always be, where the processes under this legislation are followed, the full and unredacted release of all information.  That is essentially where we want to be.</p></speech>

Usually when I hear people's reasoning and logic I go back and forth in my head exploring the issue and ask if they are right.  When I hear the Minister speak, however, I do not feel any confidence that a balance has been struck as regards how communication is received.  We are putting a hierarchy on how somebody receives information and communication as a mechanism for balancing constitutional rights.  Somewhere in the conversation that happens, a greater value is placed on in-person verbal communication than written communication in conveying something.  If all communication is language and the sharing of information, who decides which is more valuable in respect of a constitutional matter?  It comes down to how we receive and how we are given information.  On the issue of mandatory in-person communication, or whatever we want to call it, anything beyond privacy rights actually hinges on a form of control or a form of removing someone else's agency in how they do or do not wish to receive communication.</p> <p>When it comes to language, communication and information, I do not understand how a Government or Attorney General decides that the balance between them is a right because it is the same information no matter how it is received.  It seems there is a paternalistic aspect to this, where the person on the end of the phone, or the person in the room, somehow has some sort of magic power to know that this message has been better conveyed because it was said verbally than if it was received in written form.  It is as if there has to be a burden of proof if someone is on the phone asking, "Do you understand what I am saying?"  How do we make an assessment that conveying something verbally is better?  It is about the State and the agencies having control over being able to hear someone's voice, witness someone's face, and somehow make the determination that they have better conveyed or better balanced someone's rights rather than basing it on just sending them a letter.</p> <p>I would love to understand why the hierarchy of how information is communicated, and who decides that something is conveyed, balances a constitutional right based on how information is given.  There had to have been a debate on written communication, verbal communication and telephone communication, and why one of them is of more value than the others in balancing constitutional rights.</p></speech>

I understand this is the motivation and that we need to prove information has actually been conveyed.  I depart slightly from Senator Ruane on that, but it could have been done by addressee-signatory only.  Making the person the letter is addressed to the only person who can sign for it would discharge the obligation to prove that he or she has received it.  What are we saying?  The corollary of complete disclosure under the mechanism in the Bill is there will not be complete disclosure if we do not comply with that mechanism.  Therein lies a problem.  Are we saying there will be a difference between what is released through a subject access request and exercising the mechanism in the legislation?  Will we get different types of disclosure?  We need to explore what that means.  Will people get information that is redacted if they submit a subject access request?  Unless the subject access request is in compliance with this law, and it can be proved the telephone call occurred, how will it be proved the telephone call occurred?  That will happen through the caller's affidavit.  Somewhere along the line, somebody will have to sign a document that states he or she made that telephone call and the information was conveyed.  We are already in a realm where documents were falsified or whatever, so we run the risk of a checkbox no matter what we do in all of this.  It is probably unfair of me to allude to the fact there are falsified documents in the background of all this.</p> <p>This could have been split in two.  We could send a letter intended for the addressee only that conveys the actual message.  I would be interested to know how that was explored.  I take the Minister's point that we need to prove the message is conveyed, but we do not know how we prove the message has been conveyed through a telephone call.  What would the evidence be for that?  If there will not be transcripts and recordings, we are then reliant on an affidavit from the caller.  I do not see how that is better than addressee-signatory only through registered post.  If there is to be any sort of recording of the telephone call, it will involve the retention of more than just saying there is a contact preference for no contact.  It will be more than that.  It will be the reaction of that person.  It will lead to a storing of personal data, which I am not sure is what we intend or want to intend.</p> <p>There are a couple of issues.  Will a subject access request under GDPR lead to different information compared with the exercise of this mechanism in the legislation?  If it does, when we exercise that mechanism, and if a case is taken regarding the State's failure of preservation of privacy on the part of the person who expressed a preference for no contact, how will that burden of proof on the part of the State be discharged?  Will it be through an affidavit on the part of the caller?  If there is a difference between the subject access request and the disclosure under the mechanism in the legislation, does that not lead to a constitutional issue in and of itself in respect of the right to identity and the right of disclosure?  We run a risk of a constitutional challenge, regardless of which route we go down.  I do not see why this could not have been done through an addressee signature only.</p></speech>

I understand the point he made about whether the message is conveyed via telephone call, but I have also heard from people who have had to have those conversations with adoption authorities and felt very traumatised by it in terms of the reaction.  Equally, letters can be cold.  It is a very difficult matter and I really do not envy the Minister in trying to strike that balance.</p> <p>That said, we will move this amendment.  In the interim, and we have heard it from both sides of this House, there is a desire to seek a solution but everybody is a little stumped as to what it is.  There is no perfect answer to this and I do not think anybody will argue there is.  Perhaps the Minister would agree to meet Members from across the House before Report Stage.  I am standing in for Senator Hoey on this but Deputy Bacik would like to engage a little further on this particular aspect of the information.  As I said, I do not envy the Minister's task.  He has moved very substantially on this previously but I ask him to engage further in advance of Report Stage.</p></speech>

I cannot, therefore, say that every subject access request will result in the production of all information.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What I can say is that every request for information submitted under this legislation will result in all information being provided.  That is as much as I can say there.  There may be a difference.  The reason for this legislation is a desire to remove that possibility and to remove discretion from individual data controllers who are looking at individual subject access requests.  That is essentially what we are doing.  The answer will always be &quot;Yes&quot; to giving out the information.  With regard to the Senator's question, I cannot speak to any more detail but the disadvantage of subject access requests is that they ultimately come down to a person making a determination having considered a set of facts.  That is not the position under this legislation.  <br/><br/>I will try to address Senator Ruane's point but I have to look at this from the point of view of the risk of constitutional challenge, which is a genuine risk.  I am not trying to raise fears here but the reason all of these issues are before us springs from a constitutional challenge in respect of the release of adoption information, the I. O'T <i>v. </i>B. case.  I know there have been plenty of criticisms of how that judgment has been interpreted but the reality is that there is a risk of litigation and constitutional challenge because of the sensitivity of this information.  In bringing forward this legislation, in recognising that it could be the subject of constitutional challenge and in preparing to defend the balance the Government has struck by prioritising the right of access to identity information over the right to privacy, we have to show that the State has done its best to convey the parental preference which, at this stage, is at the core of considerations.  Parents' right to anonymity has been taken away by this legislation.  The adopted person will know their names.  The sole remaining part of their privacy rights is their desire not to be contacted.  That is what is left of their privacy rights so the State has to demonstrate that it has done its best to convey that preference to the adopted person.  The legal advice we have received, and my own belief, is that the best way to convey this is not through a letter, but through that direct contact.  That is the best way to ensure the State can show it has done its best to ensure the parental preference was conveyed and the remaining element of parents' privacy rights was respected so that this legislation, although it severely limits the privacy rights of a parent, remains constitutional.  <br/><br/>On Senator Moynihan's request, I am always happy to engage with Senators but I do not want to raise expectation that there is still wiggle room here.  This has been examined in detail.  It has been discussed in both Houses.  There has been a real examination of this and the legal advice I have received is that the mechanism put forward is, in the State's view, the best way to vindicate privacy rights while creating a system that will always result in the full release of all information to adopted people, which is, again, the essential aim of this legislation.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator's Moynihan that he has an unenviable task and that, no matter what way things go, there will be hard choices involved in this.  Section 70 provides for a review.  I know this cannot be put into the Bill and I am not asking the Minister to do so but I wonder whether the terms of reference of the review, when it is being commissioned two years down the road, could include a review of this mechanism to ascertain whether it is effective or too strong and to see how it has worked up to that point.  It is really only when we see the different means by which real people seek their information that we will really understand what they will do.  As I was saying, I understand the Minister's view but perhaps he could agree to include a review of this mechanism at the point the overall review is carried out.  I think it would probably be included anyway.</p></speech>

We have had a debate on the "may" versus "shall" language on a number of occasions.  In legislation there is a distinction between the use of the term "shall" and the use of the term "may".  The use of "shall" in legislation creates a compulsion, often on a State body, to act in a certain way in certain circumstances.  While this may seem like a good idea on the face of it, as legislators we also need to be mindful of the impact this may have on a State body and the management of its operations.  We have engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on whether the use of the term "may" or "shall" should be used in this legislation and I am satisfied that we have the right balance here.  In certain circumstances, the word "shall" is used but in the guidelines we are discussing we believe the correct balancing has been achieved.</p> <p>It is also important to recall that the Minister is given the power under this legislation to issue guidelines to the agencies, authorities and bodies that will be implementing this legislation.  Those guidelines can also act to ensure that the agencies and bodies act in a certain way in furtherance of the overall goals of this legislation.  We are not just relying on the text of the legislation itself; we are also relying on the power of the Minister to write guidelines for the operation of bodies and agencies.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 79 seeks to replace the word "may" with "shall" to strengthen the language relating to the issuing of guidelines by the Minister regarding the types of information to be deemed relevant to the health of a qualifying person.  Section 24 provides for the release of medical information relating to a genetic relative of a person by a relevant body or the AAI upon the application of a qualifying person.  This amendment strengthens the language in the relevant subsection by specifying that the Minister ought to issue guidelines on the type of medical information relating to a relevant parent or genetic relative of a relevant parent that is or likely to be relevant to the health of the qualifying person.  The report of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth also recommended this change in regard to the use of the word "may" throughout the Bill.</p> <p>Amendment No. 80 does something similar.  Section 24 provides for the release of medical information relating to the genetic relative of a relevant person by a relevant body or the AAI upon the application of a qualifying person.  This amendment strengthens the language in the relevant subsection by specifying that in preparing guidelines on the type of information that is or is likely to be relevant to the health of a qualifying person, the Minister shall consult such persons as he or she considers appropriate, including persons with expertise in hereditary or medical conditions.</p> <p>Amendment No. 81 is similar and also replaces the word "may" with "shall".  The amendment strengthens the provision of the subsection by specifying that the Minister should issue guidelines involving the practical guidance to the Child and Family Agency, the AAI and relevant bodies regarding their functions under Part 3.  Again, the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth recommended this change in the language.</p> <p>Amendment No. 91 is to section 30, a miscellaneous provisions section of Part 4 which makes provisions relating to the accessing of birth and other information and provided items relating to the relevant relative by a qualifying person.  The relevant subsection provides that the Minister may issue guidelines to the relevant body regarding the performance of its functions under this Part.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The amendment strengthens the provision of the subsection by specifying that the Minister instead should issue guidelines to the relevant body on the performance of its functions under Part 4.</p><p>Amendment No. 102 strengthens the subsection by specifying that the Minister should issue guidelines to the Child and Family Agency or the AAI on the performance of its functions as they relate to the proposed tracing service.</p><p>The Minister has addressed each of the points about the language.

Section 21 provides for the release of birth information relating to the relevant parent by a relevant body on application by a qualifying person.  This amendment strengthens the language in the subsection by specifying that a relevant body ought to provide the qualifying person with a statement setting out the birth information contained within the records it holds on written request by the qualifying relative.  The pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth recommended this change.</p><p>Amendment No. 74 would insert a new subsection providing for the relevant body to make every effort to locate the data controller holding the relevant parents' records in the event that the records are unavailable.  The new subsection would provide assurance to the affected people that the State would make every effort to retrieve their personal data.  We know from Tusla's data management strategy for 2019 to 2022 that historical closed paper files will not be digitised at this time due to the scale of the investment involved.  In effect, that means that an unknown number of records belonging to affected people are not backed up.  The Government must immediately initiate an independent review of the location, status and condition of all records held by Tusla and the relevant data controller.</p><p>Amendment No. 77 to section 22 provides for the release of early-life care or incorrect birth information relating to a relevant parent by a relevant body on application by a qualifying person.  This amendment strengthens the language in the subsection by specifying that a relevant body ought to provide a qualifying person with a statement setting out the early-life care or incorrect birth information contained within the records it holds relating to the applicant on written request.</p><p>Amendment No. 135 seeks to delete the word &quot;certain&quot; and to insert the words &quot;all available&quot; when making provision for the records related to birth adoption and care of relevant persons to be transferred to the adoption authority.  This amendment would mean that all available records, instead of just certain records, would be transferred to the AAI, with the intention of making all available records accessible to the applicant.  This would also ensure better safeguarding of records when centralising in the one body.</p></speech>

Part of this discussion relates to the issue of the use of the word "may" versus the word "shall".  I have made the point that we believe we are using the correct terminology.</p> <p>In reference to amendments Nos. 73 and 77, the Bill places obligations on relevant bodies to provide a summary of all relevant records it holds, including information to which the application does not relate.  As such, the amendments proposed here are not necessary as relevant bodies will already provide a supporting statement in all cases where it makes sense to do so.  As I said, there may be a situation where just a single piece of information has been sought or provided.  A statement seeking to list all that is being provided is not really relevant in that situation because we are dealing with just one document.  However, I made the point during our previous discussion that ministerial guidelines to be made under this legislation will stipulate that an enabling approach should be taken whereby bodies should release information over and above the categories of information set out in this legislation, except where they would be prohibited by law from so doing.</p> <p>I cannot accept amendment No. 74, which seeks to amend section 27 in order that records to be released would include those held by other data controllers.  As I have said when speaking to previous amendments of this nature, to oblige one of the relevant bodies set out under this legislation to search for records held by other data controllers is just not feasible.  Tusla cannot be asked to look for records held by another organisation.  Such an approach just will not work.  As we know, this Bill is carefully constructed in order that applicants apply to the body that holds their particular records.  To oblige such bodies to do so, which is what we are talking about by using the word "shall", would be to put a statutory obligation on a relevant body to search for records held by other bodies.  It would be resource-intensive and time-consuming and would take the relevant body away from focusing on providing information it does have to applicants who have come forward to it.  As we know, the Bill allows for access to records where they are held, and I think an alternative approach would not serve applicants.</p> <p>I draw the Senator's attention to section 63.  Subsection 63(1) states, "The Agency and the Authority shall, insofar as practicable, provide assistance to a relevant person who wishes to".  It then sets out a number of categories.  Category (b) states, "for the purposes of making such an application, identify a relevant body that may hold the categories of information relating to the relevant person sought by him or her".  There is therefore an obligation on both the authority and the agency, where, perhaps, an applicant has come to them and is not able to get information from them, to advise the applicant of other places where the applicant can search for information.  That is a "shall".  It is an obligation.  That is there already in the legislation.  That speaks to assisting people to find information, wherever that information might be.</p></speech>

Currently the Bill provides that a qualifying relative for the purposes of seeking early life information of a relevant person who died in an institution specified in the Schedule must be a next of kin of that person, rather than just a relative, to seek early life information under section 27.  This could lead to scenarios where a relative such as a sibling may not be able to access the early life information of another sibling due to the next of kin not seeking such information.</p><p>We are going to withdraw amendment No. 83.  Amendment No. 133 seeks to delete the line &quot;, where such persons are deceased,&quot; in the Title relating to the release of information.  This amends the Preamble, which in its current form is hasty, ambiguous and exclusionary.  The Bill currently excludes people in two ways: first, by how it defines people who are eligible to access information; and second, how it defines records that are considered relevant.  The Preamble does both.  The inclusion of &quot;where such persons are deceased&quot; in certain circumstances defeats the purpose of the legislation, which is to make the information available to affected persons.  The use of conditional language and narrow definitions will have a significant impact, not only on the type of information that is available but on those who can access it.</p><p>Amendment No. 134 seeks to delete the line &quot;in certain circumstances&quot; in the Title relating to the access to records by a relevant person's relative.

This Part provides for access to records for the family of those children who died in a mother and baby institution or county home institution.  The necessity of these provisions featured very heavily during the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  They were not referenced in the original draft of this Bill, as published, but having listened to the pre-legislative scrutiny process, having seen the report and having engaged with groups of survivors and relatives of those who died in these institutions, we amended this section to provide for the right of access for the next of kin of the relatives who died in mother and baby and county home institutions.</p> <p>I have a concern, and as a result of that I am not able to support amendment No. 82, because of the lack of specificity in the language being used.  It seeks to include the term "relative" rather than next of kin.  Section 26(2) clearly specifies who those people are and provides for parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews.  This section has been very carefully drafted in accordance with advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  The approach being adopted in this legislation in terms of who can access sensitive information is similar to the approach being adopted in other legislation providing for access to information, for example, freedom of information legislation.  We have modelled our approach on existing legislative procedures in terms of the definitions used and the hierarchy.  I accept that with the withdrawal of amendment No. 83, Senator Moynihan is not trying to remove the hierarchy, but the use of the term "next of kin" is linked to that detailed listing of hierarchy that is set out in the Bill because it gives clarity in terms of who can use this legislation and when.</p></speech>

The amendment seeks to strengthen the language in the subsection.</p><p>Amendment No. 85 creates a new subsection 27(4)(d) that provides for the release of records created or held by a data controller involved with the relevant relative's adoption, boarding out, nursing out and-or incarceration.  Subsection (4) categorises the type of information accessible to the relevant relative.</p><p>Section 34 authorises Tusla and the AAI to request information from several data controllers, including a Roman Catholic Church or the Church of Ireland diocese or parish.  This information can be sought only for the purpose of facilitating a trace, not to share the records with the affected people concerned, which means that church parishes and dioceses, religious orders and other religious entities have not been named as data controllers under the Bill.  It is imperative that such records and data controllers be taken into consideration.  Church data controllers cannot be ignored.  The amendment to this section seeks to ensure the data subject will have a right of access to personal data concerning him or her that have been collected from all data controllers involved in the relevant relative's adoption.</p><p>Amendment No. 88's wording is similar, replacing &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall&quot;, and seeks to strengthen the subsection in section 28, which provides for the release of early life care or incorrect birth registration information relating to relevant relatives by a relevant body upon application by a qualifying relative.  Amendment No. 90 replaces &quot;may&quot; with &quot;shall&quot; in section 30, which provides for the release of medical information relating to the relevant relative by a relevant body upon application by a qualifying relative.  Each of these words should be used to teach children how to speak their &quot;r's&quot; correctly.  The Minister has already stated he cannot accept these amendments for the reasons he outlined, but I wish to move them anyway.</p></speech>

The decision to specify that the application for the tracing service should be made to Tusla was taken after careful consideration of how the application process for the various services provided under this legislation would work, particularly in respect of the user experience and ease of application.  I am also mindful of the resources, systems and existing expertise Tusla has in terms of providing tracing services to individuals.  It would be beneficial, therefore, to future applicants that applications be directed to Tusla initially.</p> <p>The intention of the amendment is to add the ability to apply to the authority for tracing services.  The authority will be able to provide tracing services under this section.  However, it is not intended that the authority would receive the direct application for the tracing service.  Applications for tracing services will go to Tusla and much of that tracing will be undertaken there, but if it is judged that it would be more appropriate for the AAI to undertake a trace, for example, where the majority of files on a particular institution were held by the AAI, it may be decided that the AAI would undertake the trace.  Tusla will lead on tracing but the AAI will not be shut out.  Rather, the AAI will be asked to trace in circumstances where it is relevant.</p> <p>I will point out a contrary factor.  The national contact preference register being created under this legislation will be held by the AAI, and Tusla will apply to the authority.  Different functions under the legislation are being led by different bodies - the agency and the authority - in recognition of where the primary skill sets exist at the moment.</p></speech>

This amendment deletes the part of section 42 that achieves this necessary function and does not replace it, leaving a subsection that does not actually do anything.  All the amended subsection would do is say what will not happen.  This may have been an oversight in the drafting of the amendment.  I believe the intention of the amendment was to create an exception whereby, if a person has not personally indicated a preference on the existing contact preference register, that will not be taken to mean a no contact preference in the new register.  That is what we take was meant to happen here.  To provide some reassurance, there is no need to create such an exemption as the existing provision will only transfer an entry from the old register if an entry made by that person exists.  Only the person or the solicitor acting on their behalf can record a preference on the existing national adoption contact preference register.</p></speech>

To be fair to the Minister, he has taken it up and worked within the constraints of the law and his own advisers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am not privy to all of that but I take it in good faith that he is acting on the advice of his officials, and I do not doubt for one moment his absolute commitment.<br/><br/>What am I trying to achieve?  I am going to keep this short and sweet.  The amendment states &quot;In page 50, after line 33, to insert the following&quot; and deals with the process and complaints procedure, which is not a subsection in the Bill as of yet.  It continues:</p><blockquote>	(1) The Minister shall create an appeals process and complaints procedure.  The appeals and complaints procedure shall take into account concerns in relation to compliance, problems arising from limited definitions and issues arising regarding institutions not listed in this Act.  The appointees shall also be responsible for documenting recurring issues [and there will be many recurring issues] and shall issue a report to the Minister.<br /><br />(2) Notwithstanding Seanad Standing Orders, the Minister shall issue a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister shall be required to provide a post enactment report which shall review the functioning of this Act. [That is a pretty standard thing anyway]  Such post enactment reports shall be laid in the Oireachtas Library for the information of all Oireachtas Members and shall outline the developments regarding the implementation of this Act. </blockquote><p>That is reasonable, fair, prudent and rational, and I hope that the Minister will be in a position to support what I think is a very reasonable and practical amendment.<br/><br/>I thank the Minister for making himself available this evening, because if we are not making progress, then I understand we may be here for another few hours.  I am in the Minister's hands on this amendment and I would appreciate his support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#GG00150"><p>I thank the Senator for raising these two issues in his amendment relating to an appeals and complaints mechanism and a review of the legislation.  I will address both issues.</p> <p>As regards the first point, I understand, and I think we all know from our engagement on this issue over the past two years, in my case, and for a lot longer in the case of the Senator the level of mistrust that has built up among adopted people regarding their engagement with some of the agencies that have provided information in the past.  I understand there is real hurt and disappointment and that the actual experiences have often been very sub par.  Part of that has to do with the legislative confines and the lack of clear legislation these agencies and bodies were operating on, but it was not always that.  We know that there are examples where just the practice and the personal touch was bad in terms of how information was conveyed in callous ways.  This legislation is all about changing that.  It is about providing that changed legal basis but, as we have said before, there is more than a change in the legal basis.  There has to be a change in mindset.  I have spoken about the guidelines whereby the Minister is given power to issue under this legislation to these various bodies in terms of how they carry out their functions under the legislation.  I have also spoken about the implementation group my Department is leading with Tusla and the AAI, again talking about how the approach should be release of information unless there is a clear legal reason not to do so rather than the restrictive approach that has happened so far.</p> <p>As this legislation requires the full and unredacted release of all information, we do not see a situation where an appeals process is needed because, under this legislation, the answer is always "Yes" and the information is released.  There is no discretion of the data controller to be appealed because, if these bodies have the information, the relevant person has a right to that information and that information might be released.  In terms of freedom of information, FOI, or even a subject access request there is discretion on the data controller who must make a decision and that can be appealed.  In this case under discussion, there is no decision to be made.  If the information exists, it must be released.  That is why I do not believe an appeals mechanism is necessary.</p> <p>That said, as the Senator will know, we have the power to write guidelines on how the bodies and agencies act under this legislation.  We will stipulate that they must operate an internal review process and an internal complaints mechanism.  That provision will be set out in guidelines.  I do not think that requires a legislative basis and we can do it within a guidelines framework.  Of course, all of these bodies and institutions are regulated by the Office of the Ombudsman.  If someone is unhappy with how a State agency conducts its tasks, a complaint can be made to the Office of the Ombudsman.</p> <p>On the matter of issuing a report to the Houses of the Oireachtas, section 70 provides for a review of the Act at two years post enactment.  I believe that speaks to the centre of what Senator Boyhan is talking about.  Originally in the legislation the term was four years and we shortened it in the D&aacute;il to two years.  I believe it is important that some time is given for the processes of this legislation to work and operate in order that we can assess how they do over a period.</p> <p>That being said, the detail of what the report will look at, which Senator Boyhan has put forward in his amendment, is more significant than the current text of section 70, in particular the idea of laying the review before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That aspect is not referenced in section 70, as I have outlined, so I will take that part of it in terms of putting more detail into the review mechanism.  We will take that away and I will look to see if I can bring forward some broadening of the review on Report Stage.</p></speech>

However, I do think it needs to happen and it should happen.  The Minister started off mentioning trust, and that is very important but, sadly, many of these people have had a long drawn out experience of trying to ascertain information.  They are not trusting too many people at this point and there have been many promises.</p> <p>The Minister said there is no need for an appeals process.  If people have issues with this process, however, to whom do they appeal?  If people genuinely have issues, to whom do they appeal?  It is always important we have some sort of a third party appeal or recourse to petition - call it what you like.  The Minister said there will be complaints, so he acknowledges there will be complaints.  He has acknowledged that in his reply to me.  There may be complaints about the procedure.  Where will those people go to?  The legislation is before us and problems emerge with all legislation.  For someone who has a difficulty with this legislation when it is enacted, where is his or her port of call?  Whom can that person go to?  It is simple.  The amendment is asking the Minister to create an appeals process.  Clearly, he does not want to have an appeals process.  That is what I am picking up, but I am open to correction.</p> <p>The Minister has acknowledged there will be complaints, yet he does not want to put a complaints procedure in place or he is not proposing some mechanism of a complaints procedure that will take into account the concerns about compliance problems arising as a result of the limited definitions.  There may be issues of concern, so where can people go with them?  I am conscious we do not shut the door and say this is it, and if people's requirements do not fit into it or they have an issue, they have nowhere to go.  Where do people go to complain?  Many of those involved in this already feel disempowered from processes anyway.  Therefore, I do not think my amendment is unreasonable.  I take on board what the Minister said about section 70 and laying the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>Where does the Minister envisage a situation where people have a complaint about the procedures?  What is their recourse?  Whom do they go to?  Who will listen to them?  Who will be empowered in legislation to follow up on their concerns?</p></speech>

My belief is there is no need for an appeals mechanism because there is not a decision to be taken in terms of "Yes" or "No" or "Issue information" or "Do not issue information".  If a relevant person applies under this legislation, he or she is now legally entitled to all the information on him or her held by the relevant body.  There is nothing to be appealed.  The information will be released.</p> <p>In terms of a complaint, complaints are made about all State agencies.  There may be complaints made about State agencies that will implement this legislation.  I do not think a legislative requirement for a complaints mechanism is necessary.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That can be dealt with under guidelines in the same way that if a complaint is made by a local authority - I am trying to cite other public bodies - there is not necessarily a legislative provision of the Local Government Act that states X has a right to make a complaint, but there are complaints mechanisms there for internal complaints.  The question of trust applies, as if the complaints mechanism is internal there is a body like the Ombudsman that, as we know, oversees the application by State bodies of their statutory duties.  The Ombudsman is there and these agencies fall within the Ombudsman's remit with respect to the manner in which they undertake their statutory obligations.  That is my response on there not being a requirement for an appeal.</p><p>A complaints mechanism can and will be set out within the guidelines, as is the case with complaints under most State authorities.  On the review, it can, in fairness, ascertain whether the statement I am making now is incorrect and it has not worked out like that.  It needs to be a thorough review.  That is why we brought forward the timeframe within which the review takes place.  However, we are happy to look at greater detail on what the substance of the review of the entire legislation will be like and again making it explicit that review will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This will allow the Senator and other Members put questions to whoever is Minister then and discuss whether legislative changes to the Act are necessary.</p></speech>

I do not accept it, I will call a vote and at least I will be able to go back on the hustings when I have to and do a name check on the people who did not support it.  Talking through both sides of their mouths and someone shouting across to me about democracy has provoked me into a response I did not stand on my feet to do.  I was actually just going to withdraw the amendment.  Now I will not and will pursue the thing to a vote.</p></speech>

The new NMH has, of course, been recently debated extensively and the concerns raised regarding ownership, governance and influence have been addressed in the legal framework that has been published.  In approving the legal framework, the Government was satisfied it had achieved the State's objectives to ensure all legally permissible services will be available, with no religious influence in the operation of the new hospital now or at any time into the future, to safeguard the State's investment and, critically, to ensure we will have a state-of-the-art, modern, co-located national maternity hospital that will be able to expand greatly and deepen the services provided.</p> <p>The State will own the hospital and the land for 299 years under leasehold ownership, a common ownership approach with multiple operators, such as apartments.  The new hospital will be entirely secular.  Its founding rules, contained in the constitution of the new NMH, state there can be no religious ethos or influence whatsoever.  The published legal documents make clear there can be no religious ethos in the provision of any services or operations at the new hospital.  The documents also state that not only can the new hospital provide all services but that it must do so.  The State, via the Minister for Health, will have the power to intervene directly if the hospital fails to meet these requirements relating to services and remaining secular.  All services that should be provided in a maternity hospital, including all those currently provided in Holles Street, will be available in the new NMH.  To further address concerns about the availability of services in the new NMH, in the context of the Government's decision of 17 May, it was also agreed an annual report will be published on the operation of services at the new NMH for five years from when it opens.</p> <p>These past few weeks of debate on the matter have helped to highlight the overwhelming support from clinicians, midwives and doctors for this project to proceed.  It includes unanimous support from the clinicians, doctors and midwives at the National Maternity Hospital and the directors of midwifery from all 19 maternity units in the country.  There is also clear support from the medical board of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, representing more than 250 clinicians.  I fully share the confidence of these clinicians and experts who support the project.  We cannot delay this process any further.  As I said recently, the need is too great and the delay to date has been too long.  The task now is to get this hospital built as quickly as possible in order that we can improve experiences and outcomes for women and girls for generations to come.  I hope we can all work together to ensure the hospital will now be built as quickly and effectively as possible.</p> <p>Turning to the women's health action plan, improving the outcomes and experiences of women in our health service has been a priority since I became Minister for Health.  On International Women's Day in March of this year, the women's health action plan was launched.  It is the first plan of its kind in Ireland and represents a revolution in women's healthcare services here.  We have listened to women throughout Ireland over the past two years.  They have spoken of their experiences of our health service and told us which issues they feel need most attention.  Their requests were simple, that is, to keep listening to them, not to make promises but to take action, to respect them as experts through experience, to empower them with trusted sources of information and, most important, to give them access to the women&rsquo;s health services they need, that is, services that are accessible, expert and empathetic.  The women's health action plan places women in control of their own experiences in healthcare.  We place women's health at the heart of everything we are doing in the plan.  We are advancing initiatives that will have a direct, positive experience on women's experiences and outcomes.</p> <p>Last year, I had the great honour of opening the first publicly funded dedicated menopause clinic in Ireland.  This year, five further specialist menopause clinics will be opened, meaning there will be six such clinics by the end of the year serving the needs of women experiencing complex menopause symptoms.  Last year, we opened nine see-and-treat gynaecology clinics, while this year, we are opening a further 11, creating in just two years a national network of 20 such clinics.  These clinics provide necessary care to patients in just a few hours in one visit, instead of multiple visits over many months and sometimes well in excess of a year.  It is one of the vital steps we are taking to reduce gynaecology waiting lists.</p> <p>Last week, I visited the new women&rsquo;s health services on the Lee Road, Cork.  The clinic is focused on addressing waiting lists for all related investigations a woman may require.  For example, a woman with urinary incontinence requires a diagnostic test called urodynamics prior to a doctor's consultation.  In February 2019, the waiting list for this procedure stood at 500 patients and the average waiting time for those patients was two years.  Today, the figure has fallen to just 77 women waiting and the average waiting time has fallen to just two weeks.</p> <p>In the coming months, we will introduce free contraception for women, beginning with 18- to 25-year-olds, and set up four new postnatal hubs that will provide wrap-around care to mothers in those critical first weeks with their babies.  This plan also brings a new spotlight to women's mental health and well-being, including growing supports relating to self-harm, setting up new eating disorder teams, examining supports needed by carers, a majority-female workforce, and developing an inpatient mother and baby unit.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Six publicly-funded regional fertility hubs have been established to support women and their families in their fertility journeys.  Women expressed the need for more support in making the choice to breastfeed.  As colleagues will be aware, we have the lowest breastfeeding rate anywhere in Europe.  In response, we have more than doubled the number of lactation consultants trained to provide specialist hands-on support.  That now includes all 19 maternity units and for the first time we have national coverage.</p><p>We have prioritised initiatives like rolling out the first maternity bereavement study this year, an important study which allows us to understand how best to help mums, dads and families during the hardest time imaginable for any parent.  All of this has been made possible through a significant increase in funding for women's health services.  To put this in context, in 2020 new development funding for women's health services was about &euro;4 million.  The full-year cost for the new developments for this year alone will be &euro;50 million.  That gives Senators a sense of how this investment has been prioritised.</p><p>I would like to acknowledge the major work done by the women's health task force, my Department and healthcare workers across the HSE.  I also very much acknowledge the tireless work done by Members of the Oireachtas, including many Senators - in many cases the work was led by Senators - who have campaigned for years for many of the measures being rolled out in the women's health action plan.  I hope the plan will be seen not so much as a plan of Government, but rather as a plan of the Oireachtas.  Most importantly, I acknowledge the time and participation of the women across Ireland who contributed to the plan and the radical listening exercise, and gave up their time and shared their experiences, sometimes very good and sometimes very difficult and painful experiences.  That input, and their voice and testimony, have helped us to create a plan and design services that are what women have said they want and need.</p><p>We will all agree that we have wonderful clinicians in Ireland working in women's healthcare across the country.  In spite of this, there has never been sufficient investment in women's healthcare here.  There has never been the range and depth of services needed for generations, and which are still needed today.  We are changing that.  We are not interested in making things a little bit better each year or having marginal incremental change.  Our ambition is to radically improve women's healthcare services in Ireland and to do so very quickly.  Between last year and this year alone, we aim to have put in place 20 see-and-treat gynaecology clinics, six specialist menopause clinics, six endometriosis clinics, six regional fertility hubs, nine eating disorder teams and 24 additional lactation consultants.</p><p>We will have fully funded the national maternity strategy this year and last year for the first time.  We will have expanded perinatal mental health teams to all 19 maternity units.  We are investing in period poverty.  We are strengthening sexual assault treatment centres.  We are introducing free contraception, starting with 17- to 25-year olds.  We are expanding research into women's health.  We are increasing support for GPs for women's health and will launch a HPV vaccine catch-up programme.  There is more in the plan.  It will take several years to build up the level of services to where they need to be.  Over last year and this year, we have got off to a very good start.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#LL00300"><p>The Minister is welcome to the House.  It is fantastic to hear him going through all of the delivery that has happened for women's health over the past two years.  It sounds like he has been doing this for much longer.  There has been a huge amount of delivery despite the fact that he was dealing with a pandemic for most of his term of office.</p> <p>The Minister hit the nail on the head when he spoke about women's experience of feeling not listened to.  We often hear the term "gaslighting" whereby women are told something is not wrong with them when they know that is not the case.  It is welcome to reiterate our position that we will listen to women and shape our services around what they need.</p> <p>The work that has been done around menopause clinics, see-and-treat gynaecology clinics, free contraception and trying to reduce waiting lists is all very positive.  Waiting lists are probably the number one issue women are raising with us, in terms of the length of time it takes to be seen.  I agree with the Minister that the clinicians and doctors working in this space are the best trained in the world.  Getting in the door and being seen is the problem.  I know the Minister is doing significant work to reduce waiting times.  When something is termed an elective procedure, very often people think it may not be necessary.  However, the women behind the statistics are often living with chronic and rehabilitating pain and have no quality of life while waiting for much-needed procedures.</p> <p>I would like to focus on the areas that would be a priority for me.  One is an issue I have spoken about for many years, namely, endometriosis.  It is an issue close to my heart and Senators in the House will have heard me mention it numerous times.  I welcome that we have additional endometriosis clinics, which is great, but there needs to be a greater focus on those at the severe end of the spectrum, namely, those with stage 3 or stage 4 endometriosis who require complex surgery which often involves more than one surgeon operating at the same time.  We know for a fact that women are still travelling to the UK, Poland and Romania for such surgery because there is a view among the community that access to the specialist surgery required, namely, excision surgery which, rather than ablation, is the gold standard, is quite limited here.  We are doing a good job in treating and providing access to services for women at the milder end of the spectrum with stage 1 or 2 endometriosis.  However, those with more severe cases often require surgery on their bowels, reproductive organs, including the uterus, and, perhaps, the rectum, diaphragm and lungs.  Such surgery can be lengthy and extensive.  It requires theatre time, which can be difficult to secure because three C-sections could be performed within the time it would take a surgeon to perform complex endometriosis surgery.  Competition for theatre time has proven to be a challenge in terms of booking surgeries.</p> <p>In the next phase of dealing with this disease, which affects one in ten women, I ask the Minister to put a particular focus on those at the more severe end of the spectrum and those requiring complex surgery.  Ultimately, I would love for no woman to feel she has to travel to another country to get that surgery.  We should be the best place, not just in Europe but in the world, to get that surgery.  We should have the top surgeons and doctors and provide that treatment here in Ireland.  Currently, the view of the people with the condition is that is not the case today.  It is something we need to work on.</p> <p>The Minister has committed to funding IVF for couples and women.  I have no doubt he will make the case to the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance in the upcoming budget talks which will kick off this summer.  Many of us will have had contact with couples and women who are waiting for this much-needed financial assistance.  Without it, they simply will not be able to have a chance of having a family.  I ask the Minister, when he enters into budget negotiations, to make it a priority to secure much-needed funding for IVF cycles.</p> <p>We can do better than three cycles; we should be able to do four or five.  We have to ask ourselves whether we should limit the number of cycles.  Infertility is considered a disease.  Do we limit treatment for other diseases?  It depends on what we think is reasonable.  Cost will always be a factor.  Perhaps the doctors working in this space will have a better idea of what will be a reasonable level of assistance.  As it stands, we are an outlier and one of the only EU countries that provides no financial assistance whatsoever to couples facing infertility.  Infertility is classed by the WHO as a disease.  We can do better on that front.  The Minister is committed to delivering for the women and couples who require much-needed fertility treatment.</p> <p>As I have said, I welcome that the new national maternity hospital has got the go-ahead.  I sincerely thank all of the consultants, doctors, midwives, nurses and others working in healthcare who have been involved.  Many of them came out in their droves to support the project.  They are not public people and did not want to have a public profile, but they knew the project was on the line and because of that, they staked their reputations on defending the project.  That is why it is going ahead.  I thank them for doing so and articulating the point so well on behalf of women and girls in this country.  We could have been waiting another decade to get the hospital started otherwise.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the significant challenges he faces and his dedication to the portfolio he holds, which is probably one of the hardiest portfolios in government.  We are here today to talk about the new national maternity hospital and women's health in general.</p> <p>I will start by commenting on the national maternity hospital.  It is a very good thing and is long overdue.  The Government has committed to building the facility and providing the &euro;1 billion or more it will probably cost to build.  There were concerns, and I was one of those who raised them.  I was not the only one.  Ministers in government also raised concerns.  That is why the Minister, along with the Cabinet, correctly decided to defer the decision for two weeks to allow for further consultation, engagement, discussions, clarifications and the provision of information.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Martin Conway:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2347"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2347&amp;amp;pid=MartinConway&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That was a good thing.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health, which engaged on the issue for 12 or 13 hours between public and private meetings.  We engaged with the Minister for four and a half hours.  That was a positive meeting because the Minister and the team at the committee provided quite an amount of information.  That meeting brought clarity to many people.  It was an open discussion and in no way disrespectful.  People with strong views aired and exchanged them and I believe that clarity was provided.</p><p>Of course, the situation is not ideal.  The Religious Sisters of Charity should have provided the facility as a gift, as had been mooted.  In fact, it was not far off being agreed before the situation suddenly changed.  As the Minister rightly said, the land was not for sale at the time so we were not in a position to buy it.  As a result of that, we are now dealing with a complex legal structure.  Although a lease is in place for 299 years, it remains a complex legal structure involving companies, landholdings and so on.  However, I believe the assurances that have been put into the record of the health committee in particular have a legal standing because they put the plan and programme around the lease into context.  I believe the fact that the context has been put into the record of the House will stand the test of time.  That was a useful exercise.</p><p>There is a lot of confusion about the golden share.  The Minister might like to comment on the matter and bring more clarity.  </p><p>The project is going ahead and I want to be sure there will be no delays.  The Government has decided to go ahead at the site on the St. Vincent's campus.  The Minister might give us a timeline as to what he expects to happen in year one, two and three.  When does he expect construction to actually begin?  When will the tender process end?  I know we have planning permission, which is great.  How long will the tender process take?  How long will the construction process take?  As I said, we need to drive the project on as quickly as possible because it is needed.</p><p>Speaking of maternity hospitals, I draw his attention to the fact that the maternity hospital in Limerick also needs to be upgraded.  I know that plans are in place to move it to the campus of University Hospital Limerick.  The Minister might advise the House as to where we are with that plan.  No more than the women who use the facility in Holles Street, the women who use the facility on the Ennis Road in Limerick are using an old building where numerous people are sharing one room.  I do not believe the building is fit for purpose.  The care that is provided there is second to none and I know many of the midwives who work there.  However, the new facility is needed to serve the entire mid-west region, including counties Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and elsewhere.  I would be interested in the Minister's views.</p><p>I will move to consider women's health in an overall sense.  An awful lot has happened in that regard.  We need to pay tribute to and to thank the task force on women's health that was set up by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Harris.  The task force has done great work.  It is something to which we are all committed.  It is part of the ethos of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It has full, cross-party political buy-in.  I welcome the fact that the Minister launched the programme on women's health in April.</p><p>I sincerely thank him and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for waiving all fees in respect of the HPV vaccine.  I campaigned for that for two years.  I believe the HPV vaccine saves lives.  Ms Laura Brennan, from my own county, campaigned tirelessly on the issue.  There was a significant issue with the catch-up because there was vaccine hesitancy with a small portion of first-year students or their parents.  Now that the catch-up programme is being rolled out free of charge, there is no impediment to anybody getting the vaccine.  In his summing up, the Minister might like to outline what format the catch-up programme is going to take, when he plans on rolling it out and where he plans on delivering it.  The pharmacies could have a significant role to play in that regard.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's beliefs and how his Department plans to roll out the catch-up programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#MM00200"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire.  As the Minister did, I will start by commenting on the national maternity hospital because I would like to put on the record how disappointed we are at the deal that went through the Cabinet a couple of week ago.  Nobody was denying the need for a maternity hospital.  Concerns were raised by a wide group of people who were legitimate in raising those concerns and diligent in their attention to the details involved.  Those concerns were not addressed.  They related to the difference between a leasehold and a freehold, but particularly applied to the retention of the "clinically appropriate" language.  We heard there were people who had no objection to the removal of those words, yet they remained.  It is deeply disappointing that while the decision was delayed for two weeks, it seemed to be a box-ticking exercise in the hope that the furore would die down and we would move on two weeks later as intended.  I express my disappointment in the regard.  The situation is disappointing to those of us who raised concerns and feel those concerns were not addressed.</p> <p>I would also like to raise a couple of other issues.  We know that woman have had to go to the courts for years to access healthcare.  Even though we have repealed the eighth amendment, there remains an issue around the accessibility of abortion services in this country.  One in ten GPs still does not offer abortion services and only nine out of the ten existing maternity hospitals offer those services.  The Minister has been in this House numerous times promising to deal with the issue of safe access zones and we are still to see progress in that regard.  The Bill to legislate for that has passed all Stages in the Seanad.  We need those safe access zones and that legislation passed so women are not having to run the gauntlet to access healthcare in this country.  </p> <p>There were awful images on social media during the week of protests outside a clinic in Stepaside.  We also heard of one incident where a GP service has had to shut down its entire clinic on Saturdays because protesters were attending every Saturday.  That means that not only woman who want to access abortion services are being denied access on a Saturday but all patients of that GP clinic are being denied access.  We need progress on that issue.  There must be no more delays in that regard.</p> <p>I will also raise an issue in respect of assisted human reproduction.  My Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues recently met parents who have had children through international surrogacy and have clearly outlined the unacceptable issues and challenges they have faced every day due to the lack of regulation.  While the assisted human reproduction legislation is very welcome, albeit long overdue, we cannot just omit certain issues that are deemed to be too difficult and decide to tackle them at another time or allow another Minister to address them.  We have seen that approach to the Children and Families Relationships Act.  Certain issues and certain members of society have been left in situations that are either unregulated or without the necessary legal protection.  I was concerned to hear from representatives of the Assisted Human Reproduction Coalition that the Minister has not engaged with them.  There has been a lack of engagement and reassurance that this issue is going to be addressed.  I would like the Minister to respond as to why he is not engaging with the group.  </p> <p>My party wants strong legislation that is fit for modern Ireland and that serves the interests of the thousands of people who find themselves grappling to deal with infertility issues each year.  The assisted human reproduction legislation has been in the works since 2005 and as in the case of the national maternity hospital, no one is looking to delay it.  However, we must make sure we get it right.  We need the legislation to deliver for those families.</p> <p>I remind the Minister of the commitment in the programme for Government on the provision of free period products.  I believe a pilot scheme is being launched.  We are more than two years into the term of this Government.  The provision of the products they need every month in all public buildings is low-hanging fruit when it comes to women's healthcare.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->From the experience of the organisations that are filling that gap and delivering those products, I know the need is greater than ever.  We now have Ukrainian refugees and the organisations have stepped up to provide those women with these products.  We were told those in direct provision centres would be able to access the products yet all of the time these organisations are being contacted by women in direct provision who are saying the products are not being provided by the managers of those centres.  The need for food banks has also increased.  There is a great need out there for the provision of period products.  I urge the Minister to progress that.  We do not need a pilot.  We just need to put the products in the bathrooms of all public buildings.</p></speech>

He is very welcome to the Upper House.</p></speech>

I will confine my comments to the women's health action plan.  I have made my views on the maternity hospital very clear.  I warmly welcome the women's health action plan.  There are a lot of very good people behind it.  I refer to the women's health task force.  Services that have long been fought for are now committed to in this plan.</p> <p>I am struck by the theme running through the document and mentioned on the cover, which is "Listen. Invest. Deliver".  That is what Government and politics are about, are they not?  They are about listening, investing and delivering.  I want to ask the Minister about the particular issue of delivery.  On 11 May last year, 55 weeks ago now, the Minister made an announcement after listening to those of us who have been campaigning for breastfeeding supports for many years and listening to people within his own party and Government colleagues.  Bainne Beatha, Cuidi&uacute;, La Leche and other groups have also been campaigning for breastfeeding supports.  The Minister announced 24 new lactation consultant posts.  I absolutely welcome that.  That would be progress.  It is still far off what we need, but it is progress.</p> <p>However, as of 18 May this year, recruitment was only commencing for these posts.  I do not know if I misheard the Minister's statement when he seemed to convey that these consultants are in place but, from the reply to a Commencement matter I put down here just two weeks ago, it was very clear that despite being halfway into the year, recruitment was only commencing for these posts.  We really have no idea as to whether they are going to be filled.  If we look at the 2020 commitment, we would not exactly be filled with hope that the 2021 will be realised and delivered upon because, in 2020, 10.5 lactation consultant posts were approved under the national maternity strategy but, two years later, only eight have been filled while two and a half posts remain open.  We welcome the commitments but ultimately we can only judge them based on delivery and, to date, we are not seeing that.</p> <p>I welcome the commitment to embedding perinatal mental health services within all maternity units.  We know that postnatal depression and other mental health issues relating to pregnancy and postpartum have been very much the poor relation in maternity services over many years.  Provision has been very patchy across many maternity services.  I respectfully suggest that the Department might start by reviewing all partner restrictions across maternity units because, as I understand it, partner restrictions remain in place across the majority of maternity units.  I know Holles Street has lifted its restrictions but many others have not.  We have heard from the Better Maternity Care campaign and psychologists with expertise in the area that the environment and conditions in which a baby is born can have a significant impact on a mother's mental health.  I ask the Minister to engage with the maternity units and ensure that those restrictions can be reviewed and, indeed, lifted as soon as possible.</p> <p>The GP lead on women's health is another important introduction.  I ask that the Minister ensure that, when that person is appointed, he or she has a specific remit to look at migrant women's health issues because I know from talking to AkiDwA, the organisation representing many African people and people with African descent in this country, that knowledge and expertise in dealing with African people's issues among GPs in this country is very patchy, disappointing and insufficient in many parts.  Again, I ask that the GP lead look at that.</p> <p>I will refer to something that is not referenced in the document.  There is nothing with regard to home births.  There is a long-standing issue in that the HSE has effectively failed to properly provide for the second midwife in a home birth situation.  They are only paid &euro;160 and are not paid if the woman is transferred to hospital.  I ask the Minister to do something about this.</p> <p>In the last few seconds available to me, I will mention that we have had a commitment to a Bill on assisted human reproduction for many years now.  There is a commitment in this document as well.  Many of us are waiting for this Bill, all for our own individual reasons, political and personal.  We know that the Bill has been delayed for an unacceptable length of time.  The Minister has to progress this Bill and he has to ensure recognition and legal certainty for the parents of the babies born via surrogacy.  Any provision put into this legislation must have retrospective application because it is simply not good enough that there are babies who were born via surrogacy whose parents will not have legal recognition in this country.</p> <p>The last thing I will say is that none of this matters unless the staffing is in place.  The Minister knows better than the rest of us here the staffing shortages that exist right across the country.  There are shortages among medical scientists, in the therapies and in the children's disability network teams, CDNTs.  Children are waiting three years or longer to get a diagnosis within the CDNTs.  Their only option is to go private.  People are being approved for home support hours but simply cannot get them because the staff are not there.  What is the Department doing with regard to workforce planning?  We are at a really critical point now.  People are not being paid enough to do the jobs that are vitally necessary.  We need a comprehensive response from the Department with regard to the shortages right across the health system.</p></speech>

I will specifically note one point in respect of breastfeeding.  I encourage the Minister to lend his support to the proposals currently being considered by the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, with regard to bans and restrictions on the advertising of formula milk.  However, I am going to focus on the national maternity hospital.</p> <p>I will focus on the fact that many of the concerns were not addressed.  In fact, they were heightened.  It is really regrettable that the time was not taken to review or make any change whatsoever to the proposed legal paperwork to reflect the concerns that were not resolved, but heightened, over the course of the two weeks of hearings in the Joint Committee on Health, in which I participated.  With regard to the language used regarding delay, we should be very clear that the primary delays in this project to date have come from those with whom the Government has been negotiating.  For example, three to four years passed while Vatican sign-off on the transfer of lands was awaited.  Let us be clear, those were the cause of delay in the project rather than those activists who pushed and who were pressing many years ago for the hospital to be publicly owned and for things like a compulsory purchase order, which could have been activated at that time but were not.</p> <p>It is astounding to me that the key issue I want to highlight was not addressed.  I refer to the phrase "clinically appropriate".  Over the course of the two weeks, we heard multiple interpretations of what that might mean, including multiple interpretations from legal advisers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->One of the core phrases in the context of the leasehold agreement is "permitted use".  Is it all clinically appropriate and legally permissible healthcare services or is it all clinically appropriate or legally permissible services?  This is a double test and is really important.  We also heard that this was to make sure that it would only be services related to a maternity hospital but there already was a line which said that it would be legally permissible healthcare services provided by a maternity, gynaecological, obstetric and neonatal hospital.  Again, that was already specified.  </p><p>The phrase "clinically appropriate" which is not defined and has an ambiguous meaning, was left hanging.  One may well say that legally permissible services are there but if they are subject to a double test, for example, of clinically appropriate, then the question is not just what services are available but when they are available, how they are available and whether they are available on an elective basis.  To simply say all services will be provided is not enough.  Abortion was available in Ireland even while the eighth amendment still stood but it was only available if a woman was dying and even then, doctors had to determine how close to death the woman was.  We all heard in the committee about such determinations - is the risk of death 20% or 40%?  Similarly, we also know that some of the services in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group such as sterilisation were made available when clinically necessary for other reasons but not solely for the purposes of birth control.  Symphysiotomy was clinically indicated in Ireland at times by certain physicians.  These things matter. </p><p>Over the course of the hearings the National Maternity Hospital,  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and Mr. Mulvey himself suggested the phrase "clinically appropriate" be either deleted or defined but the Government did not choose to seek a definition or a deletion.  In the lease that phrase is interpreted by the landlord, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  The group was asked directly about its values, not about its religious ethos but its values as expressed in its new constitution which includes references to things like human dignity.  I asked if this is human dignity as set out in the Universal Charter of Human Rights, which is from birth, or as set out in the declaration on human dignity by the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, which is from conception to natural death.  Which definition is the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's definition and how does that apply to its interpretation, as the landlord, of "clinically appropriate"?  These questions were not answered.  </p><p>The decision was made to rush through with an ambiguity which will be the subject of potential debate and interpretation for many years.  This will have significant financial consequences because the State has also managed to reach a deal in which it has no exit clause.  If this hospital expires after 70 years, as we have been told it will, the State will have to build another one and then another one because if, at any point, there is not a hospital on that ground, the rent reverts to &euro;850,000 per year.  St. Vincent's Hospital Group can throw us out if we do not have a hospital on that ground but the HSE's own legal adviser, when I asked what would happen in 70 years, said that if we do not want a hospital there after 70 years we could build something like a shopping centre or an apartment block and force St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to terminate the lease.  We will have to try to get ourselves thrown out.  In terms of the business case, is it four hospitals that we are building?  The business case has not been answered and if the State cannot get a good deal on that and cannot even get first right to purchase the site if it is put up for sale after 30 years, how are we are going to be in a good position in terms of the negotiations we are facing for the next 299 years on the board of this hospital?  Again, a disservice has been done to future generations.  </p></speech>

He really has had a baptism of fire since becoming Minister for Health.  He had no ministerial experience,  and I do not mean that in any disrespectful way, but he has shown good leadership.  He has settled very well into his brief.  He is dealing with a lot of issues that had not been dealt with for years and particularly in relation to the National Maternity Hospital, he and his officials took a very wise road.  Despite all of the assurances and reassurances given, he decided to pause the process for two weeks to allow for further consultation and clarification.</p> <p>The creation of a new maternity hospital is the greatest infrastructural investment by the State in the area of women's health.  It is going to provide world class facilities for women, girls and babies for generations to come.  Women and infants have not been well treated and are not well served by the existing cramped facility at Holles Street which is no longer fit for purpose.  The National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital have worked together for decades.  Approximately 40% of consultant staff at the National Maternity Hospital are employed by St. Vincent's and work between the two hospitals at present.  The new hospital has very strong support from clinicians at the National Maternity Hospital.  In relation to this debate and the clarifications, if we do not want to believe the Minister or his officials, surely we can believe the clinicians.  For me, as a lay person and a politician, the clinicians clarified the situation over and over again.  We should never forget that 52 clinicians at the hospital outlined the strong need for a new hospital.  Of course, there are one or two people who are against the development going ahead but that means that around 90% are in favour, with 10% against.  That is fine and people are entitled to their opinions.  </p> <p>I was talking to one clinician who gave me a briefing.  She said that she was exhausted because despite all of the explanations, people would still not believe her.  For me, the clinicians are the people who are dealing with this.  They made statements over and over again.  They took time out, spoke to the media, and met all of the groups that wanted to meet them.  The Minister was right to pause the process but the people want this to move on now.  That was the clear evidence I heard in my own part of the country and in other parts of the country.  People are saying "let's move on now" and I am hopeful it will work and that everything will be fine.  </p> <p>Budget 2022 delivered an additional &euro;31 million for women's health.  This additional money provides a foundation for a fully funded action programme for women's health in 2022.  The action plan will focus on improving the foundations of women's health by investing in policy implementation, tackling the issues that women have said they want to see improved and funding innovative new approaches to women's health.  Budget 2022 saw the investment of almost &euro;9 million in additional funding to ensure the continued implementation of the national maternity strategy beyond 2022, building on the significant investment of 2021.  There are many other positives to which I can refer, including the continued improvement in our gynaecology services through the establishment of a further six ambulatory "see and treat" gynaecology clinics, bringing the total to 20 clinics nationally.  The Government has also invested almost &euro;9 million to fund access to contraception for women aged from 17 to 25 and an additional &euro;5 million in the Women's Health Fund to fund innovative new approaches to women's health services nationwide.   </p> <p>I could go on but in conclusion, I want to acknowledge the support the Minister is giving to two very important projects in my own county.  I thank him for his support for the building of a new 50-bed unit at Roscommon Sacred Heart Hospital and Care Home for our older generation, which is much needed and very welcome and a ten-bed rehabilitation unit at Roscommon University Hospital.  The Minister is very much behind these projects and is progressing them by providing funds to ensure that they become a reality.  Outside of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Roscommon will be the only place in the State that will have such a facility.  These are important developments for my part of the country.  I am pleased that the Minister and his officials can see their importance.  I will be working with them and the HSE to progress those projects as quickly as possible because they are so important.  When the Minister visited Roscommon University Hospital last November he was highly impressed with the management and staff and with everything that was going on there.  I welcome the fact that he is behind those projects and look forward to working closely with him and his officials on them into the future.</p></speech>

I congratulate him of the women's health action plan, which is a considerable piece of work, and it is fantastic to bring forward what was begun in the task force under my colleague, Deputy Harris.  I also congratulate him on bringing it to reality and negotiating the budget.  It has significant elements in it.  I welcome the clinics; having a focus on maternal bereavement supports is really important.  A cohort in our society needs a response to what is an appalling tragedy in their lives and there are other dimensions to that.  I really welcome that.</p><p>We are beginning the review of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 and in that I call for the need for safe access zones.  I understand, I have heard and I take on board what the Minister has said previously on whether legislation is required but the fact is that it is happening.  Women are intimidated from accessing services and GPs are intimidated from providing services so we need to implement that.  I also welcome the Minister's commitment to the funding of IVF.  It is important that IVF services are accessible and affordable and that there are supports in place for all couples.  Where I would bring that conversation would be how will we determine who gets access to it.  We need to ensure no impediments are put in the way of women and couples with disabilities.</p><p>The most fantastic campaigner from the Independent Living Movement Ireland, Selina Bonnie, has been in before the Joint Committee on Disability Matters and the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy.  Her experience before she could access assisted human reproduction services in her long journey to the birth of her child was that at one stage she was asked to prove that she would not have a disabled child before she could be permitted access to the services.  When we are putting the supports for IVF in place we need to make sure there are no impediments for anyone with a disability, that there is the same access and that, if anything, we have positive discrimination in favour of people with disabilities to be supported on their journeys to growing their families.  That needs to be a priority.  Aligned to that is the fact that many same-sex couples, particularly women, need the support of assisted human reproduction to grow their families but they are put through fertility tests and all sorts that they have to pay for in private clinics in Ireland, which are totally and utterly unnecessary.  We need to be mindful of that and I hope the assisted human reproduction authority has a role in prescribing that.  One of the untapped gems or Cinderellas of women's health is polycystic ovary syndrome and we need to raise awareness of this.  There is an awful lot of patient and sufferer blaming in this regard and one of the myths is that people lost weight this would be fixed and it is important that we dispel that myth.</p><p>The Minister knows what I will say next.  We are doing fantastic work on the Joint Committee on International Surrogacy and witness after witness has come in and said we need to legislate for international surrogacy in the AHR Bill and we need to do so urgently.  The best way to safeguard the interests of women who would be surrogate mothers, regardless of where they live and the best way to preserve the rights and interests of everybody involved in the surrogacy journey, is to provide legislation for it.  The New Zealand Law Commission has contacted us and it has done extensive work and reviews.  It has a comprehensive solution that will assist us and that should inform us.  We need to expand section 7 to include international surrogacy.  This has been said by witnesses ranging from the likes of the Children's Rights Alliance and by the Ombudsman for Children.  These are not people who would be perceived to be biased but who are truly objective in this space.  We have to be brave and legislate retrospectively as well.  It is reasonable that we set a high threshold but we have to ring-fence those children who have already been born via surrogacy.</p><p>There are also anomalies arising from the Children and Family Relationships Act that still have not been dealt with, such as the fact that same-sex couples are denied rights and a full legal parental relationship with their children, which is aligned to surrogacy and yet is not anything the same.  In those instances, if these people had their fertility journeys abroad they are being denied those rights in Ireland.  There are issues such as that that the Minister has a unique opportunity to bring home in his Bill to make us a world leader in safeguarding the rights of everybody on fertility journeys and to ensure that Ireland is setting a standard worldwide in it.  We have a unique opportunity to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.373" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1686" speakername="Fintan Warfield" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#PP00200"><p>I welcome the Minister to the House and I commend him on the publication of the women's health action plan.  I wish to raise two issues.  The first is the issue of free contraception for women aged 17 to 25.  The Government has repeatedly said that programme will commence in August and I want to ask about that.  We are just a couple of months out from that roll-out and I hope the Minister will be able to tell me how prepared we are for it.  Have the regulations been signed to enable this to start in August?  Will an information and publicity campaign start so that people know where to go and know about the roll-out?  Has that been finalised so that people will know where they can get access to free contraception?  There is a commitment on the training of medical professionals and I have heard there is a delay in rolling this out.  Is that the case?  Is the Minister confident that there is sufficient capacity in the system so that women will have access to their choice of contraception in all parts of this country?  The Government stated this will commence in August and, therefore, can he confirm that women aged 25 on 1 August will be eligible to avail of free contraception to ensure they will not age out of the programme if it does not start until mid-August, when people are turning 26?</p> <p>The other issue I want to raise is the fact that there is a national emergency in transgender healthcare in this country.  There is a waiting list of up to ten years in the National Gender Service.  Many identify this as a gatekeeping bottleneck.  Up until recently the National Gender Service was refusing to engage with the trans community and it seems to have cut ties with NGOs.  I wonder what that is about.  Many trans people, including friends of mine, have taken to fundraising online and taking on debt to travel for hormone replacement therapy, HRT, treatment abroad.  Many Irish trans people go to Poland and places that have been declared lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, LGBT-free zones to access the basic care they need and deserve.  There is a commitment under the programme for Government on World Professional Association for Transgender Health, WPATH, standards and the National Gender Service is not following those standards.  People are being delayed in accessing treatment and so they are being denied treatment.  It is an emergency if the waiting list is approximately ten years long.  I would appreciate any response to those issues.</p></speech>

Rather than giving a pre-written speech I might respond to the Senators who are present on the issues they have raised.  I might engage with Senator Warfield further on the transgender issue.  If there are barriers to access that should not be there, then we need to know about them and to identify them.  I am open to discussing that with the Senator.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Stephen Donnelly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2336"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2336&amp;amp;pid=StephenDonnelly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->He and I could meet and the Senator could write a note on the issue.  If progress can be made, let us make it.  </p><p>We are on track with regard to free contraception.  I always say that with my fingers crossed slightly because healthcare is complex, as is rolling out things that have never been done before in Ireland.  It is a priority and we are on track.  It does not mean everything will work perfectly in August but we have negotiations ongoing with the IMO, which is very involved, as are the pharmacists and, to a lesser extent, hospital providers.  Most of this will be led by GPs and pharmacists so that is where the main discussions are and they are progressing.  </p><p>Several colleagues asked about assisted human reproduction.  The Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill was not originally envisaged to include international surrogacy, as colleagues will be aware, and it would have been law by now if we had not stopped it.  It has been years in the making, as several colleagues said, and is urgently required, regardless of international surrogacy, for people in Ireland.  We need to regulate this sector domestically.  The assisted human reproduction legislation, which is on Committee Stage, has been paused.  I was asked to stop it for several months and have done so but I am keen that we get going with that Bill quickly.</p><p>We agreed to a 12-week pause while a special committee was established to look at international surrogacy.  That work is going well and there have been many positive contributions to the committee.  There have also been contributions to the effect that we have to take our international human rights obligations deadly seriously.  Few countries in the western world facilitate international surrogacy and we understand why.  It is because it is complex, not just in respect of what happens in our country but also what happens abroad.  It is a complex ethical space and we are balancing all manner of international human rights obligations and obligations to people living here.  I hear clearly the calls from colleagues around retrospectivity.</p><p>We cannot indefinitely pause the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Bill.  We will see where that process is at.  It was agreed there would be amendments ready to go within 12 weeks.  We need to address the matter domestically and internationally.  If that can be accommodated within the current Bill, it will be.  However, we cannot indefinitely postpone the Bill while we wait for an amendment.  Amending legislation can be brought at any time.  We can pass a Bill and make it an Act, amend that Act, bring in a different Act or amend on Committee Stage.  It is in the hands of the committee as to where that goes.</p></speech>

We have stopped the Bill to wait for and accommodate that process.  That has been agreed.  The special committee has been set up and is meeting.  We have paused the Bill and are waiting to hear back from the committee after 12 weeks.  That is the process that has been agreed.  Let us see where that takes us.  Both domestic and international surrogacy need to be addressed.  It is just a question of timing and sequencing.</p> <p>Safe access zones were raised and much progress has been made on those.  I hope to bring the heads of a Bill on that issue to Government soon.  The heads of Bill would then go to the Joint Committee on Health for pre-legislative scrutiny.  I think we can move through that process quite quickly.  There has been healthy and important debate of the issue in the Seanad and it has been addressed in a Private Members' Bill brought forward in this House.  That legislation has been examined and the clear advice I have is that we need a new Bill.  I think we are in a good space on this and colleagues will like the Bill when they see the heads.  We will then bring it through drafting and, hopefully, through both Houses as quickly as possible.</p> <p>On lactation consultants, I will get Senator Sherlock a detailed note on the position in that regard.  Funding has been provided and the posts have been sanctioned.  I have met several of the support groups.  It is going well, both in the maternity units where some of the additional support is and through community support groups.  I met one group about two weeks ago and I have met a few others around the country.  They are going well.  I will check the position because we need those experts in place as quickly as possible.</p> <p>On home births, I agree this issue has not moved at the pace it should.  It is address in the national maternity strategy.  There has been much good work done on midwifery-led care, new birthing units and better facilities, but more is needed on the community care and home birth sides.  Home birth is not where it needs to be and I am working with the national women and infants programme to see how we can move it along.</p> <p>Deputy Sherlock is correct on recruitment and workforce planning.  It is a bigger question than we have time to address today.  Suffice it to say that we have sanctioned more posts than ever and over the last two years the HSE has hired more staff than at any time since its foundation.  A huge amount of work is being done but we want to hire many thousands more clinicians and other staff.</p> <p>A few Members stated I have committed to introducing IVF services.  I have committed to seek the funding to introduce it.  I want this service to be publicly funded.  However, that is subject to budgetary constraints.  We are an outlier and need to move on this issue.  It is a matter for discussion with clinicians and the Department as to who it applies to.</p> <p>Regarding Senator Seery Kearney's input on people with disabilities, for anyone to be asked the question she raised is completely unacceptable.  I would take it as a given that a disability would not preclude anybody from being able to access IVF treatment.  I am horrified by the question that person was asked.</p> <p>HPV vaccination is something we all support and I was keen to see a HPV vaccination catch-up programme put in place.  I sought NIAC advice, which came back and was positive.  It has referred to an age cohort of up to 25 years of age.  I am seeking additional advice now.  Some countries have moved from a three-dose to a one-dose regimen.  I believe the NHS has moved to that too.  I am seeking additional advice on that because it will have a big impact.  On the back of the NIAC advice, I have written to the HSE and asked for options to initiate a catch-up programme.  There are two parts to this, namely, a catch-up programme for boys and girls still in school who were offered the vaccination but did not take it or missed it, and also for young women up to 25 years of age.  Those are the operational pieces I am looking for.</p> <p>Going back to the start of this, which is around women's healthcare, this debate shows how far and quickly we are moving.  It does not mean we are getting everything right or that we can do everything in one or two years but over last year and this we will, by the end of the year, have built up a national network of women's health services that did not exist previously, including fertility hubs, endometriosis support, menopause support, see-and-treat gynaecology clinics and other women's health facilities.  It is an exciting time in terms of women's healthcare and I am delighted to see political support across the Seanad and D&aacute;il for continuing to make this a priority, investing in it and growing out the services.</p></speech>

The report Moneylending: Policy Proposals was published by the Minister for Finance last July along with the heads of this Bill.  The main proposal is the introduction of an interest rate cap on moneylending loans.  The feedback from the public consultation on the issue was that the introduction of a cap would protect low-income households that avail of moneylender loans, reduce the cost of credit for customers of moneylender, reduce the number of customers in default and align Ireland with other EU countries that have an interest rate cap on short-term credit in place.</p> <p>The Bill contains 16 sections.  I will now set out its main provisions.  Section 2 will provide for the terms "moneylender" and "moneylending" to be replaced by the terms "high cost credit provider" and "high cost credit".  This makes clear that the credit is high cost and will help to differentiate between legal and illegal providers by moving away from the generic term "moneylender".</p> <p>Section 3 will introduce two new offences where a provider grants a loan in breach of the legislation.</p> <p>Section 6 will remove the requirement for providers to register in each District Court area and extend the licensing period from 12 months to five years.  It will also bring in new factors the Central Bank can take into account when granting, suspending or revoking a licence to improve consumer protection and the orderly regulation of the sector.</p> <p>Section 7 will ban cash loans from being granted for a period of more than one year.  The key rationale of high-cost borrowing is that it is needed because of short-term circumstances and where an alternative source of borrowing may not be available.</p> <p>Section 8 will require providers to include the words "high cost credit agreement" prominently on the agreement.</p> <p>Section 9, the key provision, will provide for the setting of a maximum interest rate that a high-cost credit provider can charge for both cash loans and running accounts.  It will be an offence for a provider to grant credit at a rate in excess of the maximum set at that time.  Under this new section, the Minister for Finance may, following consultation with the Central Bank, make regulations providing for the maximum rate of interest at which a moneylender can provide credit.  The Minister must have regard to a number of relevant factors when making such regulations, including: the impact on competition in the high-cost credit sector; the impact on the supply of credit in the high-cost credit sector; the average rates of interest offered to customers in the high-cost credit sector and any trends in such interest rates; and the impact of a reduction of credit supply on financial inclusion.  The Minister must also adhere to ceilings set down in the Bill.</p> <p>In regard to cash loans, the maximum rate of simple interest chargeable per week can be set only at a rate less than or equal to 1%, while the maximum rate of simple interest chargeable per year can be set only at a rate less than or equal to 48%.  In respect of a running account, under a high-cost credit agreement, the maximum rate of monthly nominal interest can be set only at a rate less than or equal to 2.83%.  Using a simple interest arrangement for the interest rate caps on cash loans will simplify the product and enhance transparency.</p> <p>A different approach is recommended for loans provided on a running account basis because these operate like credit cards, whereby there is a credit limit and purchases can be made up to that limit.  The credit owed, therefore, could be the result of several purchases over a lengthy period less the monthly payments.  Applying term limits and simple interest rate caps to each purchase that ends up in a single outstanding balance on an account would be too difficult and would be likely to be unworkable.</p> <p>Following the enactment of the Bill, the Minister for Finance will make regulations setting the cap at the maximum level allowed for under the legislation.  This will take the most expensive products off the market and require the bulk of products to be revised downwards in price.  These interest rate caps can be varied downwards in the future by regulation if circumstances and the consideration of factors I have outlined warrant doing so.  The Central Bank will also be required to prepare a report within three years of the interest rate caps having come into operation.</p> <p>Section 10 will require providers to include the option of maintaining an online version of a repayment book if the borrower requests this.</p> <p>Section 11 will add collection charges to the list of prohibited charges.  The Bill will not abolish the practice of home collection, just the right to charge separately for it.  Moneylenders who decide to continue the practice will have to accommodate the costs associated with that in their revenue model, which can consist only of interest.</p> <p>Section 12 will allow the Minister to require the Central Bank to collect and publish non-personal data on the high-cost credit sector.</p> <p>The Bill received much interest from Deputies when it was in the D&aacute;il.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators during this debate.</p></speech>

If it were ever timely to bring in an item of legislation, that is certainly the case with regard to this Bill given many people will, clearly, face significant challenges in the near future.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the Bill, the main purpose of which is to restrict the total cost of credit on moneylending loans, probably as a result of the report on moneylending policy proposals.  The report examined the moneylending industry in Ireland and assessed the potential impacts of the introduction of an interest rate cap along with other supporting policy.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat Casey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It provides an overview of the current regulatory framework for licensed moneylenders and an analysis of the different credit options, and describes key characteristics of each of the moneylending markets.</p><p>In May 2019, the Department of Finance launched a public consultation process to gather the views of stakeholders on whether the Government should introduce a statutory interest rate cap on licensed moneylenders in Ireland, along with other regulatory matters.  The main focus of the consultation was the question of interest rate caps.  Respondents were asked, if an interest rate cap was introduced, which of four different models they were presented with would be the most beneficial and transparent for all consumers.  The majority of submissions received were in favour of the introduction of an interest rate cap.  This is what the Bill does.  It will restrict interest rates by providing the Minister for Finance with the powers to make the regulations setting the maximum interest rates at which moneylending can be provided and prohibit moneylenders from charging for home collection services.</p><p>The Bill will reduce the cost of credit for customers of moneylenders.  It also introduces a range of measures to reform and modernise the moneylending sectors.  These measures will provide better protection for consumers and will streamline the licensing process for providers.  The Bill will also contain a range of measures to modernise and streamline the sector, including allowing prepayment books to be maintained online.</p><p>As I said, this legislation follows a comprehensive review of the moneylending sector undertaken by the Department of Finance.  The proposals take into account the submissions received during that public consultation process held by the Department in respect of these issues.  Fianna F&aacute;il will support this vital legislation as it progresses through the House. </p></speech>

Many years ago, I worked as a barrister advising the providers of personal credit so this is an issue, as are collection charges and the like, that I have some experience of.</p><p>I agree completely with what has just been said about us now heading into a financial crisis where many people may be driven to borrowing money just to keep going.  I will say a number of things before we sign off on this Bill.  The Minister of State's speech is really just the explanatory memorandum.  I would like to know far more about how it is intended this will all work.  It is all very well to say the Minister will have the power to regulate the interest rate that can be charged.  That sounds good, but I am slightly sceptical about how it will work for two reasons.  For example, and I know this sum is probably too low, if &euro;100 is lent on a collected-weekly basis, and if over six months the borrower pays &euro;120 back over 25 payments, the APR on that will be approximately 40%.  The actual amount collected each week would be &euro;120 divided by 25.  When we think about it, the amount involved does not seem enormous, given somebody arrives at someone's door every week to collect the money.  There are people for whom that is a more satisfactory arrangement than having to go to some office somewhere, or to a pawnbroker or moneylender's office or whatever it is, to pay back the loan.</p><p>As the Minister of State pointed out, at present collection charges are charged separately and are not included in the APR.  Once collection charges are included in APR, however, it rockets up to 40%.  We then have to take into account the risk and the work involved in going to collect the money every week from a person.  None of us would like to see somebody paying 40% per annum, but &euro;20 over six months on &euro;100, if it is collected, does not seem on the face of it to be a shocking amount, given the service involved in that.  I ask Members to bear in mind that while these figures can suddenly look dramatically higher, and indefensible and unconscionable, and a rate of 40% per annum for people who are down at heel seems enormous, nobody else will lend them that money at that rate in a way that involves going to their houses and that is controlled and regulated.  These are the kind of things we have to bear in mind.  I am not speaking on behalf of moneylenders.  I am just asking us to bear one thing in mind.  If we give a Minister the power to regulate the maximum amount that can be charged, it is a politically very sensitive thing for a Minister to have to do because some clever journalist will stand up to say that Minister has just authorised 40% APR per annum, when it is really just about collecting &euro;120 on a &euro;100 loan over six months with daily collections.  I am just pointing that out.</p><p>It is easy to say 40% is shocking but, and this is the second and most crucial point I will make, if we eliminate these areas of lending by making them uneconomic, the lending will still take place and there will be loan sharks.  I recall when I was a child living on Leeson Street, off Appian Way, a man - long-since dead so I will not damage anybody's reputation - who was a newspaper vendor at the top of Chelmsford Road in Ranelagh.  He was also a local moneylender.  All the people who borrowed money in Ranelagh went to him.  He appeared to be selling the <i>Evening Herald </i>and the <i>Evening Press</i>in the evening but was, in fact, lending money and people were coming to him to pay it back.  That was fine in its own way because he was not going to threaten to break people's legs if they did not pay.  He was just a local service that was totally unregulated.  The point is I want the Minister, at some stage, to spell out how he will protect people from loan sharks and unregulated people.  If we regulate people very heavily, and leave people who need money badly in the hands of those who are not regulated and will not pay a blind bit of attention to what is in this Bill, we are exposing the weakest in our society to the most vicious in our society.  The methods of getting money back and the whole question of having a licence with the Central Bank or anybody else regulating them is utterly irrelevant.  They will just come, break people's windows, break people's legs and threaten somebody's children, or whatever they threaten to do.  </p><p>It is all very well to do this but I just want to see the actual effect of it.  Will we drive people into the hands of unlicensed moneylenders?  Will the figures the Minister will fix by way of maximum interest rates be politically sustainable for any Minister because clever journalists will expose them to ridicule, even if at the same time these rates save people from loan sharks?  This is something we should think about. </p></speech>

We need to look at some interesting facts and figures.  According to Central Bank figures, at the end of 2020, the moneylending sector had more than 283,000 customers with &euro;141 million in outstanding loans.  Research shows that the customers of moneylenders are more likely to be women, to have dependent children and to be in their late 30s to early 50s.  It is great the Minister of State said that when this legislation is enacted, borrowers of the most popular products should see immediate reductions of approximately 13% in the interest charged.  The abolition of home collection charges is very welcome.  That was an appalling practice and it is great to see an end to it.  The introduction of an online repayment book allowing people to check the status of their accounts on their mobile phones is also very welcome.</p> <p>I will mention credit unions because they can offer an alternative to moneylenders in some instances, but only if they are enabled to do so by the Government.  Will the Minister of State review the maximum interest rates credit unions can charge and other restrictions on credit union lending?  Credit unions have an important part to play in this but we need to keep an eye on their rates as well.  Does the Minister of State envisage any of the recommendations of the review of the credit union policy framework will impact on the high-cost moneylending sector?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is always the most vulnerable who get stuck in these situations and any work we can do to help them deal with moneylenders, who can by their nature be violent, ferocious and frightening to people, is something I welcome.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  The issue of moneylenders has been of great concern for many years.  The permission for ultra-high interest rates charged by moneylenders is immoral and unethical.  The law currently permits moneylenders to charge rates of interest that trap vulnerable borrowers in a cycle of debt.  Under this and previous Governments, moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank are permitted an APR of up to 187% on loans.  That increases to 288% once collection charges are included.  When compared with more affordable sources of credit like credit unions, which have an APR charge of no more than 12.67%, there are no grounds whatsoever on which such high rates can be justified.</p> <p>In 2013, the Central Bank published a report that found typical moneylender customers are predominantly female and from lower-income backgrounds.  The excessive rates charged by moneylenders risk driving borrowers into an unsustainable and vicious cycle of debt and in many cases they already have.  Imposing a cap on the cost of credit moneylenders can charge is first and foremost a moral issue and one that can and should be addressed.  In 2018, my colleague, Deputy Doherty, introduced the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2018 to place a cap on the cost of credit moneylenders could charge, only for the Government to block its progress for years for reasons that were party political rather than in the interests of consumers.</p> <p>There are many provisions of this Bill that Sinn F&eacute;in supports.  These include the separation of home collection moneylenders, the elimination of collection charges from home collection loans, the use of the simple rate of interest rather that the APR for home collection loans, the term limit of home collection loans at 12 months and the ability of the Minister for Finance to amend rates further by regulation.  All of that is welcome.</p> <p>However, the biggest weakness of this Bill is the proposed interest rate cap.  It will allow moneylenders to continue to charge levels of interest that are excessive, immoral and unjustifiable.  Deputy Doherty has spoken about this in the D&aacute;il and I am going to speak about it again because it is so important.  One does not have to be a smart journalist to given an example.  The Government proposes an interest rate cap based on simple interest of 1% per week up to a maximum of 48% per annum.  Let us flesh this out properly.  At present, on a cash loan of &euro;1,000 a typical moneylender can charge interest of &euro;560.  That is extortion.  In contrast, a credit union would charge interest of &euro;60 on the same loan amount.  Under this legislation, the Government proposes moneylenders will in future be able to charge &euro;480 on a &euro;1,000 cash loan.  That is what is proposed in this Bill.  That is still extortion.</p> <p>I must take up the argument Senator McDowell made.  He made the point that because it is broken down into small amounts it is actually not as bad as it sounds.  With the greatest of respect to the Senator-----</p></speech>

They are absolutely outrageous.  My colleague, Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell, put it well in the D&aacute;il.  She said, "This Government never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity", to do the right thing.</p> <p>The most important part of this Bill is that the Government is apparently still happy for these extortionist moneylenders to charge &euro;480 interest per year on a &euro;1,000 loan.  I ask the Minister of State to tell me how he justifies that.  I grew up in London in a working-class community.  Moneylenders were an absolute horror.  I am lost for words to describe the damage they did predominantly to my community, the London Irish community in north London, at that time.  In the areas we look after in particular - Sinn F&eacute;in as a working-class party - we know the damage these moneylenders do.  The Government has an opportunity to do something right here.</p> <p>Maybe it should have a look at what has happened in the rest of Europe.  These high interest rates were described as excessive in Spain, as unconscionable in Finland and in Germany as lacking in moral legitimacy.  The interest rate cap proposed in the Bill does not go far enough and we cannot allow such a financial regime that damages the economic interests of borrowers to continue.  We must understand those who use moneylenders are the poorest and most vulnerable in society.  Much of the time they are locked out of the normal banking system and pushed towards moneylenders as a consequence.  They can end up clocking up vast amounts in interest.  We all know this.  This is why Sinn F&eacute;in introduced its own Bill, which would have limited interest rates to three times the market average, which is much less than in the Government Bill.</p> <p>We will press amendments on Committee Stage.  I am not optimistic given the Minister of State rejected them in the D&aacute;il but it is never too late to do the right thing.  When we think of the damage these moneylenders do, especially to the weakest and most vulnerable, the idea this Government is suggesting it is good news - in the time of a cost-of-living crisis that is the worst we have seen in many years - that lenders can charge &euro;480 per year on a &euro;1,000 loan is never going to be acceptable.</p></speech>

Fine Gael supports the Consumer Credit (Amendment) Bill 2022.</p> <p>As has been outlined already, the main proposal is to introduce an interest cap on moneylending loans which will protect low-income households who avail of moneylender loans.  I too represent many working class communities and have done so since 2009 when I became a councillor in Waterford.  I know personally of the devastation moneylending can impact on so many families.  However, this is an important step to move to regulate this industry that has essentially operated like the wild west, in many cases, up to now.  We are trying to reduce the cost of credit but as Senator McDowell also said, we must be mindful of the ability of people to be able to lend while also not trying to drive lending underground, where it will happen, and happen at a far higher interest rate.  Oftentimes violence will also run through it.</p> <p>There are some positive steps in this Bill.  The Minister of State outlined some of them in his speech.  Section 2 includes reference to the terminology and states the new classifications will be "high cost credit provider[s]" and "high-cost credit".  That is a positive move because it is important we state on the tin what this is.  It is no longer acceptable for such practices to just be called "moneylending" as if they are the friendly person at the door who is being very kind in terms of lending.  These are high-cost credit providers.  It is true they are needed at times by people but we need to be mindful and document exactly what it is, that is, a high-cost credit provider.  We have the likes of our credit unions and many others to provide lower-cost loans.  Of course, all of us in the House encourage people to avail of those products, which are far more appropriate than the high-interest loans on offer.</p> <p>The cap, as has been referenced, sets a maximum of 48% interest.  I note also the Minister of State said the regulations would be set at that level initially but there would also be a review within three years of this coming into operation.  I suggest that review be brought forward to perhaps 18 months into the legislation's operation or a maximum of 24 months afterward.  We would then be able to see how it is operating and if we need to reduce the caps.  It would also allow us to ensure people still have the ability to avail of those loans, should that be necessary as a last resort.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope such a suggestion can be taken on board on Committee and Report Stages.  Overall, however, as regards the thrust of the Bill, this is an important step forward in regulating what has for a long time been essentially an unregulated industry, with interest rates ranging into very high figures.  I hope some of the suggestions I have made can be taken on board.</p></speech>

The Labour Party welcomes the Bill.  I find it strange, though, to be effectively welcoming a maximum interest rate of 48%.  Interest of &euro;480 paid on a &euro;1,000 loan is exorbitant.  It is wrong.  The principle of the Bill to impose a cap is to be welcomed, but the cap is excessively high.  I take on board what Senator McDowell said.  There are many money sharks.  There are illegal money sharks out there who will seek to exploit opportunities and will be there regardless of the regulated system.  However, the 48% cap has to be reduced much more swiftly.  I therefore join the calls to have the review over a much shorter period.</p> <p>As has been said, those relying on moneylenders, as we all know, tend to be low-income, female and of a particular demographic in respect of which the costs associated with raising children or just trying to put a roof over one's head are disproportionately high.  It is also important to say that any of us who have dealt with people who are reliant on moneylenders know that they borrow when they are credit-impaired.  There is a key issue here as to what we are doing for those who are credit-impaired, perhaps because of decisions they made very early in their lives, or those who do not have bank accounts at all.  Notwithstanding that the concept of a basic bank account now exists across every bank in this country, we know there are still a few thousand people out there who do not have bank accounts, incredible as that may seem in this day and age.  The last piece of research undertaken on this is from some years ago now.  We would all benefit from having an understanding of who does not have access to a bank account and, therefore, can only be reliant on the likes of a moneylender.</p> <p>Reference has been made to credit unions and the stark contrast in respect of the cap for many credit unions on their cost of lending.  We need to look at how we might better support credit unions and other State-run banking institution to lend effectively rather than having profit as the key incentive.  Ultimately, low-income people have no other choice but to rely on whomever will give them the money, as opposed to having a choice in the market.  The State needs to better provide for those persons.</p> <p>Lastly, I appreciate that there is an updating of the regulation of moneylenders in this legislation, but I am uncomfortable with extending the licence from a one-year to a five-year period.  We need to go back to those issues of enforcement to better understand that this legislation will work before we start to extend the licence period.  I presume there was good reason at the time behind the removal of the requirement for moneylenders to register in each District Court area.  Perhaps this is borne out of a position of distrust, but I do not believe we should loosen the regulatory conditions surrounding moneylenders in advance of understanding how they apply the cap.  We have called on the Minister of State to reduce the cap.  I know he has previously said there is a concern that moneylenders will escape the market.  We should not make life easier for them in respect of their regulation.  Overall, however, we support that a cap is being put in place, notwithstanding our very serious concern that it is being pitched at simply too high a level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#VV00300"><p>I thank all the Senators who spoke on the Bill.  Generally, I think everybody is supportive of the legislation, despite some issues of concern.</p> <p>The first question asked was how this will all work because we have given just an outline of the Bill.  One of the key differences is that, until now, a prospective moneylender had to go to each court to get a licence.  That now will be done by the Central Bank.  The same conditions will apply nationwide.  As this will be a regulated market from now on, which it is not as we speak, the Central Bank will have a key role.  Importantly, there are only about 30 moneylenders in the country now, so it will be very straightforward for the Central Bank to have sight of the financial affairs of each of them.  It is not a big imposition, compared with over 200 credit unions and all the banks the Central Bank regulates.  The biggest moneylender pulled out of both the Irish market and the UK market last year.  It is very important we maintain some proper licensed moneylenders.  The alternative to the lenders being cut out, as I think everybody accepts, is that people will borrow elsewhere.  We all want to ensure that people do not go to loan sharks.  There is therefore a balance to be struck in respect of the interest rate.  We could bring it down to a very low level and we would find nobody lending money because these are higher risk loans than larger loans, whereby people can have collateral and they have savings records and credit records with financial institutions.  We want to make sure that lenders continue to be viable.  We all know that credit cards have interest rates of 20% and more per annum.  That is the baseline for this.  We have gone for the 1% simple interest approach, that is, 1% per week subject to a maximum of 48%.  There is currently no regulation whatever in respect of the interest rates charged today.</p> <p>As for collection charges, which can be helpful, about half of moneylenders add on the cost of door-to-door visits.  That puts up the APR significantly.  We are not saying they cannot do that, but they cannot factor it into the interest rate they charge if that is the way they do business.  Some do door-to-door visits without levying an extra charge.  They do the collections but the cost is built into their APR.  At present, on a 12-month &euro;1,000 loan, a simple interest of 48% would equate to an APR of 128%.  That assumes that the customer does not pay anything back for 364 days.  That is not the way most loans work.  People pay back loans by the week or month.  People can take the example of a customer taking out a loan and not paying any of it back until the last day and can extrapolate the APR in that situation.  Use of the APR in such cases is often not suitable because most of these loans are short.  They could last a couple of months.  They could be for a holy communion or for Christmastime.  They last three, four or six months.  Trying to impose an APR on something that is not an annual loan does not make logical sense to start with, but some people try to attach one to the other where it is not suitable.</p> <p>Letting the Central Bank see how this will operate for a couple of years is important.  The maximum rate provided for in the legislation is 48%.  Let us compare the rates.  As we speak, the highest APR used, including when charging for door-to-door collection, is 288%.  There are some people out there today paying 288% equivalent APR when the cost of weekly home collection visits is factored in.  This Bill will bring that down to a simple interest rate of 48%, a dramatic reduction but still high.  We want to make sure that the 30 companies that are here stay in business and can operate viably.  If they disappear, everybody will go to loan sharks.  We have to avoid that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Sean Fleming:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=418"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=418&amp;amp;pid=SeanFleming&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is, therefore, a balance to be struck in that regard.

There are people who require short-term loans.</p><p>Another provision in this legislation is that the maximum loan period is 12 months.  I must be clear that there is no provision, and it is an offence, to run a loan over to 13, 16 or 18 months.  For the first time ever, these are regulated bodies monitored by the Central Bank and it is a legal offence to run a loan beyond 12 months.  These are good protections.  I accept that the Central Bank will do a good job.  It has to watch only 30 of them.  Overall, I understand what Senators are saying, but it is important we put this legislation in place as soon as possible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1650" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#ZZ00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, who has responsibility for European affairs.  He is doing a lot of work in this area as has Senator Dooley.  Like me, Senator Dooley has visited Ukraine, as has Mr. Billy Kelleher, MEP, and the Ceann Comhairle.</p> <p>It is important for us to have this debate at this particular time in terms of the sanctions that have been taken and the increase in sanctions by the European Union.  We all agree that that is important but obviously more can be done because, as has been pointed out time and again, it is the purchase of Russian gas that helps to fund the war against the people in Ukraine, which in of itself is something on which we must reflect.</p> <p>While we are against the war in Ukraine and will support it as best we can as a neutral country, as Members will be aware the Ukrainian Government has called for more sanctions than what has happened heretofore.  During the meetings that we had with the Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament, Mr. Stefanchuk, whom we hope will address this House at some stage, the Ukrainian Prime Minister and President Zelenskyy called on Ireland to do more.  When they address different countries they are aware of all of the issues that relate to Ireland and every particular country so they do not do a single transferable speech.  They know what Ireland can and cannot do.  They are aware of our expertise in terms of landmines and ordnance from our experience in southern Lebanon and have called for us to assist when the appropriate time comes.  There are 300,000 sq. km of land that was occupied by Russian forces, which now must be checked so that means houses and the land itself.  The Ukrainians have found that the Russians booby-trapped places as they left as hand grenades have been found in washing machines and children's pianos.  Therefore, every house and building must be checked but it will take years to clear 300,000 sq. km of mines.</p> <p>The Ukrainian Government has asked, and this is a clear ask for Ireland not just to be supporters of Europe, in terms of Ukraine's membership of the European Union, but also for us to be advocates.  I and the Ceann Comhairle undertook that we would write to the speakers of the parliaments of other countries in the European Union and we would ask them to ask their members to allow for the accelerated membership of Ukraine into the EU.  That is a very good example of ripple diplomacy where by having one meeting one essentially asks for those particular members, and people whom one meets, to become advocates for their cause.  Hopefully, members of the Ukrainian Parliament will come to the Seanad as well to address us on this very important war.  This war is not just a war for Ukraine but a war for Europe because, as we know, the Russians are on our doorstep in the battle for Ukraine and if they win that battle they will be inside the door next.  This is not the end of Russian aggression and is just a continuation.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister of State and Members to the House.  Leading off on the motion for the Fianna F&aacute;il group is Senator Timmy Dooley.</p></speech>

It is very clear to all concerned the importance of Ireland standing firm with the Ukrainian people, the Ukrainian parliamentarians and the people of Ukraine across the world in standing up to the aggression that has been foisted upon them by Russia.</p><p>It is just happenstance yet welcome that this motion is being taken this week when the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, PACE, held a meeting here in Dublin, which had in attendance a number of Ukrainian parliamentarians.  I met a number of them yesterday.  A delegation of ten Ukrainian parliamentarians will arrive in Ireland tomorrow to attend the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, conference that will take place at the Convention Centre Dublin.  The Deputy Prime Minister for Ukraine, Ms Olha Stefanishyna, who has responsibility for European affairs, will be in Ireland on Friday and another very well know Opposition politician, Ms Kira Rudyk, will also be here representing her party called Holos.  The Holos party is already a member of the ALDE group of parties across Europe.  I hope that on Friday the Servant of the People party, of which President Zelenskyy and Ms Olha Stefanishyna are members, will formally join the ALDE family.  So Ireland is playing a central role in the life of the parliamentary affairs of Ukraine at this really important time.  While I have described Ms Kira Rudyk as an Opposition politician, she is very quick to respond when she is described as such and say that in the Ukraine at the moment there is no Opposition as all politicians work collectively.  We often speak with one voice in this Parliament and think that we will do so tonight.</p><p>Right from the very start Ireland has taken a very proactive role in support for the Ukrainian people and Ukrainian Parliament.  It was either day 10 or day 12 of the war when Billy Kelleher, MEP, and I were invited by the Servant of the People party to visit the city of Lviv to see the humanitarian crisis unfold for the refugees who were fleeing the war of aggression and attempting to make it to safe ground in Poland.  What we witnessed on that occasion really was something to see at close hand.  It was an appalling vista.  We saw people, principally women and children, who had queued for two days in lines of anything between 6 km to 10 km depending on how quickly they got through and there were lines of cars that ranged up to 20 km.  Thankfully, that situation has come to an end.  The vast majority of the people fleeing the country have gotten out but they went through hell on earth to do so.</p><p>Billy Kelleher, MEP, myself and other people have returned to the region since.  I know that the Cathaoirleach has more recently visited the same region of Kyiv and north west of Kyiv into the areas of Irpin and Bucha, which had been occupied for some time by Russian forces.  We saw at first hand the absolute devastation that had been visited on a law-abiding, well meaning and viable community.  It was most distressing to see what these people had been put through.  Many Ukrainian citizens had managed to escape but those who had not were obliterated individual by individual with heaving bombing with mortar shells from tanks and other missile launchers right down to tank fire and then right down to rifle fire.  So nobody got out.  Once Russian forces surrounded the area nobody could get out.  We saw cars that had been riddled with bullets.  We saw blood stains left by individuals who had been left to die and, in some cases, they were killed before the Russians left and we saw what had been left.</p><p>We spoke to community leaders and clergy who had done an amazing heroic job.  In an effort to show some level of respect to the dead, they gathered the bodies under the cover of darkness on occasion.  As the soldiers had moved on believing that they had killed everyone in sight these people gathered the bodies.  In some cases they used body bags and where they did not have body bags they had to place the bodies on carts and then bury these people in the grounds of a church.  Initially, that was a mass grave.  I think that others will have seen coverage of the mass grave as it has been well documented and ventilated.  When the international community managed to get into the region, as the Russians were pushed back or left, the painstaking work commenced whereby bodies were removed from the ground, taken to morgues, attempts were made to identify these people so that their bodies would be returned to their families, and there was a process to try to identify the cause of death.  From what I saw, and what was relayed to me, the cause of death in most cases was very obvious.  These people had been shot in the face, in the back of the head and on the side of the head with the clear intent of murdering them.</p><p>The Cathaoirleach visited Irpin and Bucha and he can attest to the fact that these areas have no military compounds or army bases.  There is no war machine of Ukraine located in the region.  There are no logistic centres either.  In fact, they were high-end dormitory towns near the city of Kyiv, a bit like D&uacute;n Laoghaire, Dalkey and some other upmarket locations here.  One could see that there were new apartment complexes and families building their lives.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These places were no threat and had no interest in threatening anyone, but because this was a strategic route to the centre of Kyiv, where the Putin war machine believed it was about to topple the Government of President Zelenskyy, they were collateral damage.  I am no expert on war or how to define it but I have read enough to know that targeting innocent civilians in the game some people call war, to use that awful term, falls well outside those actions that can be considered the operation of war and, as such, falls into war crimes.  While this is a political forum and we are speaking politically, I cannot understand how any court of law, wherever it is located, could ever come to any conclusion other than to say that what was done in the areas of Irpin and Bucha, which I personally visited, cannot be described as anything other than war crimes.  Mariupol is in a similar situation, albeit in a different location.</p><p>This motion declares those actions as war crimes.  The systemic approach taken by the Russian military and the way in which its actions aim to leave nobody alive reaches the threshold whereby we can say the war of aggression on Ukraine amounts to genocide.  That is what this motion does.  If we pass this motion, we will be among a small number of houses of parliament to have given recognition to that statement, that is, that what Putin's war machine has done in Ukraine can only be described as genocide.  The Cathaoirleach has had the opportunity to speak to Ukrainian people on the ground and he will be familiar with what they believe to have happened.  They believe the clear intent of the Russian Federation, led by Putin, is to intimidate the citizens of Ukraine, as Ukrainian people, and make them subservient to that despot ruler.  That meets the threshold of the description of genocide.</p><p>Language is important in all these case and we all make mistakes from time to time.  I know a little about this.  We need to be careful when we refer to the Russian Federation and Russia.  We need to be guarded about this because this is not a Russian war.  It is a Putin war.  I know quite a number of people in Russia because the ALDE party I spoke about has an affiliate in Russia, a party called Yabloko.  I spoke on Zoom to a number of people from that party yesterday.  They want to make it painstakingly clear that the actions being taken by the Putin war machine do not reflect the sentiments, desires, wishes, goals or ambitions of many people in Russia.  It is estimated through surveys that 30% of the Russian population does not support what is going on.  However, there is a caveat to that figure.  Russia is not like we are here when it comes to an opinion poll.  If someone puts a microphone or a clipboard in front of people and asks them their opinion on the war, their immediate reaction will be to ask who is asking the question.  It is unlikely to be an independent polling company.  People are afraid to express an opinion and are more likely to indicate support for government action rather than what they really believe because of the fear of reprisals by the Putin war machine.  While we must stand full-square behind and with the Ukrainian people in every way we can, we must also recognise there is a silent cohort of people in Russia who are desperately pained by what is happening.</p><p>This motion must be seen in the context of where Ireland has always stood.  There are some who are somewhat ambiguous in their support for Ukraine because they think that approach flies in the face of what is often referred to as our neutrality.  We are militarily neutral but you cannot be neutral in any shape or form from either a diplomatic or human nature perspective when you see a peaceful people getting on with their lives and doing their business and their neighbour decides to come and covet their land, their people and their assets.  There is no place in the world for that anymore.  Those kinds of battles were fought in a different century and diplomacy has moved on considerably.  Going back to the approach of resolving issues through wars of aggression cannot be supported by anyone.</p><p>We must also reflect on the generosity of the Irish people, who have put their hands in their pockets in so many different ways, including through appeals for funding through the aid agencies, of which the Red Cross is to the fore.  UNICEF and others have done amazing work in supporting refugees, both here and for those displaced throughout Europe.  That is testament to the Irish people's continued support for people who are under pressure or fighting aggression.  We also must recognise the tremendous work of communities right across Ireland, who have welcomed them with open arms.  I can speak of that at first hand.  I have seen the level of support in the county of Clare, where I come from, whether in Lisdoonvarna, Ennis, Shannon or throughout the county, where communities have come together to support the large numbers of Ukrainian refugees, principally women and children, who are now getting on with life.  They may be living in hotels or guest houses or whatever but they are getting into school, starting to play sport and starting to play with the kids on the street.  It is lovely to see it but then you have to pinch yourself and remember what is behind this.  Many of these people will never see their loved ones again.</p><p>While the focus from all sides has been on who is winning or losing, in every battle people die at a massive rate and on a daily basis.  Neither side wants to talk about it because they want to keep going, but war is never good and it can never be a solution.  I welcome the efforts being made by European prime ministers.  I met with President Macron on Monday and with Xavier Bettel, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, both of whom have regular contact with President Zelenskyy and the despot Putin.  They remain clearly on the side of good and support the Ukrainian people, but they are keeping channels open because they rightly believe diplomacy will have to come into play at some point, it is hoped sooner rather than later.  This continued aggression is not going to solve the problem.  There will have to be key talks.  All of us across this House know how slow reaching a peaceful solution can be, but we are benefiting so much from what we have achieved in getting all sides in the Six Counties to a peace process that has worked.  We have our political differences, which we will often air and toss around in this House, but we managed to silence the guns.  That took a huge effort but it happened through dialogue, bravery, outside intervention and support.  It is that kind of outside intervention and support that will help lead, we hope sooner rather than later, to a level of stagnation where the guns can be silent and people can start to rebuild their lives.  They will need the continued support of this House, this country and the European Union.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Dooley and Fianna F&aacute;il for using their Private Members' time for this motion.  It is commendable.  I will not repeat the various aspects of the motion.  I believe in it.  I do not think we need to rehearse all of this because are all well versed in it.  I will use my time to share a few thoughts.  I was prompted to think about this before I came here today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Ceann Comhairle who went to Ukraine and represented our Houses.  It was very moving and it sent a very strong and united message from us to Ukraine.  </p><p>Last week the President unveiled a War of Independence monument in Kenmare.  The Cathaoirleach was there, as was the President's wife, Sabina.  During his visit the President met a 16-year-old boy, Pavlo Marin, who fled Ukraine on 3 March this year with his mother.  He is now in transition year.  It was reported on RT&Eacute; and in the printed media that he told the President that his life has changed since coming from Ukraine to Ireland, with new opportunities and new beginnings.  He said that he does not know how long he will be here but maybe it will be forever.  He was not concerned about being here forever because he felt safe and secure.  He realises the potential future he could have.  Many people are fleeing their homes in Ukraine and it is terribly sad but many who have come here have found a temporary home and I hope many will find a permanent home, by choice.  The President went on to talk about people fleeing Ukraine and Ireland and about migration.  He suggested that the Irish might know more about migration than most and said that it is important we meet the needs of those coming here.  </p><p>While we can address all of the issues raised in the motion, it does not call for a lot in the end.  I do not say that in a disrespectful way.  The motion sets out the issues and what it calls for only amounts to two paragraphs.  I would like to add, in conversation rather than by way of a formal amendment to the motion, that it is important that we are mindful of migrants and refugees, as the President said.  Many of these people are not coming here by choice.  We need to talk about integration, mainstreaming people into work and about every Government Department being conscious of the demands, needs and genuine expectations of people coming here.  We are their hosts.  We invited them in and welcomed them warmly.  The Government was right to tap into the emotion of the nation, its citizens and its people.  However, we must ensure that our guests are protected and are not excluded from our communities and our society, that they are not put in ghettos or in inappropriate long-term accommodation.  They must be given full access to public health services.  We must prioritise social inclusion and access to education.  It is also important that they continue to use their native language and that we respect their culture.  Many will want to go back but if they do not have their own language it will be so much more difficult for them to go back to their homeland.  We also need to address health, employment and training opportunities and pathways to work because many of these people will choose to stay.  I hope they will all be welcome.  We need to address integration in communities and to promote intercultural awareness, acceptance and support.  We need to combat racism or the potential for racism or any form of exclusion that these people may experience.  Of course, we must also promote the great love of Irish sport, music and culture and assist them in embracing some of our traditions.  That is what real integration is about and that is the real challenge for us as a people.  How can we meet their needs?  </p><p>The President told Pavlo Marin that he hoped he would be happy here and that Ireland would meet his needs and those of the others who have come here.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il and all of those involved in preparing this motion.  It is commendable, right and appropriate.  Let us not lose sight of the simple things.  Let us be advocates and leaders.  Let us use our contacts in local government to support housing, integration and acceptance right across this country.  That is the real challenge and the real test.  In time, interest in all controversies, disasters and wars dilutes and people's emotional connection is not the same.  It weakens over time.  Let us show Ireland at its best.  Let us show that we genuinely believe these people are here for support, that they want to be in our communities and that they will enrich our society by bringing greater diversity-----</p></speech>

I commend Senator Dooley on his very fine contribution and on his commitment.  I also commend the Cathaoirleach on his recent visit to Kyiv and Ukraine.  It is important that we stand in unison as a House.</p> <p>I hope that other parliaments across Europe will take up the clarion call from the Cathaoirleach.  What we saw this week from Europe is not good enough.  The Minister of State has shown leadership, as has the Irish Government but other countries are beginning to fray at the edges and we have to stand up to that.  Senator Boyhan is right that we have a duty to welcome the men, women and children who have come to our country and to inculcate a love of their language, culture and customs but also of ours, and that is happening right across the country.  I commend Senator Conway for the extraordinary work he has done and is doing every day in County Clare.  </p> <p>This is a very important motion.  I do not agree with those who have said that we have not been strong leaders.  We have been really strong leaders and advocates, as a Government, a country and a people.  I support accelerating Ukraine's application for membership of the EU and I ask the Minister of State to provide an outline of the situation in that regard.  </p> <p>Today in this House we must not just stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine but must ensure there is a proactive call to action across the EU and the world.  There can be no obfuscation by some.  We must look to China, Hungary, Turkey and others and call them out.   Last week in this House, Congressman Neal spoke about Ukraine in his contribution.  Where are our fellow Ukrainian parliamentarians today?  They are not doing what we are doing because they cannot.  This motion is not about the world that Senator Dooley spoke about.  It is about working to ensure that the progress, peace and economic prosperity that Europe has made and enjoyed since the Second World War continues.  </p> <p>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his proactivity, his words and his visit.  I commend Senator Dooley for his work and I also commend the Minister of State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Let us look at the wording of the motion.

T&aacute; ardmholadh tuillte ag an Seanad&oacute;ir Dooley as an r&uacute;n a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair.  Is r&uacute;n t&aacute;bhachtach agus suntasach &eacute; agus, mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag comhghleacaithe eile, gheobhaidh s&eacute; taca&iacute;ocht ar fud an tSeanaid anocht.</p> <p>Russia's full-frontal and declared invasion of Ukraine has entered its third month.  More than 4,000 people - men, women and children - have been deliberately killed by the Russian military in the carpet bombing of cities, towns, villages and hamlets.  The Russian Government is waging its war against defenceless civilians, with no regard to the many human rights conventions that ban such crimes against humanity during war.</p> <p>The Russian Government's bombing strategy is to force the civilian population to leave their homes and create a wasteland for the Russian Government to seize as its territory.  The Russian bombardment has left eastern Ukraine in ruins.  In the war it is waging in the Donbas region, we can see that the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk are slowly being annexed by the Russian military.  As a consequence of Russian aggression, millions of Ukrainians have been uprooted from their homes and are now refugees in their own country and across the European Union.</p> <p>It is important that we remind ourselves that the Russians have been involved in an undeclared war in Ukraine from 2014, when they invaded Crimea and the Donbas region.  Since 2014, nearly 15,000 people have died in this undeclared war.  In that context, it is nothing short of an amazing story that the people of Ukraine have not only halted the Russian military juggernaut in its attempt to take Kyiv but have forced it back.  The people of Ukraine, of all ages, gender and class, have joined the national resistance to free their country from Russian occupation.  The Ukrainian resistance has inspired the people of the world and especially the people of the EU.  It is truly a David versus Goliath struggle.  People have rallied to their cause and are assisting them in many ways, especially the welcome that refugees have received here in Ireland.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Boyhan in particular in terms of that solidarity and how we move forward in welcoming refugees from Ukraine and indeed from wherever they happen to come to make Ireland their home.</p> <p>The people of Ukraine are entitled to fight for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of their country.  They are entitled to the support for their fight against the Russians, which the people of Ireland and the Irish Government rightly support.  Sinn F&eacute;in also supports the extension of the sanctions against Russia and welcomes the most recent decision by the EU to block most Russian sea-borne oil imports by the end of 2022.  Two thirds of Russian oil arrives into the EU by sea.  This sanction will cut off a huge source of finance to the Russian war machine.  We also welcome the pledge by Poland and Germany to end pipeline oil imports from Russia.  I also welcome the news that Russia's largest bank, Sherbank, is to be removed from the SWIFT payment system, which allows the rapid transfer of money across borders.  Vladimir Putin needs to continue to feel the world's anger at his immoral and illegal invasion of Ukraine.  This is best expressed in the help that is being given to the armed forces opposing the occupation, in the sanctions that are being taken and in the worldwide condemnation and isolation of Russia on the international stage.</p> <p>If the Russian Government, by its actions, puts itself beyond the world consensus on how difficult matters are to be resolved through tried and trusted diplomatic channels, then it must feel collective pressure.  It must be collective pressure, not with the purpose of prolonging the conflict but, on the contrary, to end the conflict as soon as possible through a process of credible negotiations.  These negotiations must bring peace and the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity while recognising and protecting Russia's territorial integrity.</p> <p>There are many immediate consequences for governments across Europe that are trying to manage the fallout from the war.  All efforts need to be employed to ensure that the predictable collateral damage is minimised.  At home, the Government must continue its assistance to Ukrainian refugees.  The EU must continue its support to Moldova and Romania.  Russia's decision to blockade supplies of wheat and grain from leaving Ukrainian ports will lead to devastating consequences for those poorer countries dependent on Ukraine and Russia for food supplies.  Failure to act will result in a humanitarian catastrophe for parts of Africa and the Middle East, leading to unprecedented levels of famine, forced migration and political instability in the region.</p> <p>The one big lesson in this war that everyone needs to take on board is that militarism in whatever guise has no place in the modern world.  The fact that diplomacy has failed the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia is not an argument against it.  It is certainly not an argument for people in this State to raise questions about the neutrality of this State.</p> <p>At yesterday's Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, we heard from the Ukrainian ambassador and President Zelenskyy&rsquo;s chief of staff.  I asked him how Ireland could assist through our position on the UN Security Council.  He lauded our record of peacebuilding, negotiation and conflict resolution and encouraged us to lean in to those efforts further as we move ahead.</p> <p>The Russian invasion is totally unjustified.  The military tactics used by Russian troops are cruel, excessive and uncivilised.  The Russian Government must accept that its military aims are not achievable.  It needs to end its military campaign and sue for peace immediately.</p></speech>

They are very important stories of what is happening on the ground.  As Senator Dooley outlined, those stories form the basis of this important debate we are having at this juncture in the war.  I thank Senator Dooley and the Fianna F&aacute;il Senators for putting forward this very important motion during Private Members&rsquo; business tonight.  There can be no doubt that the dreadful events surrounding the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, almost 100 days ago, was an unprovoked act contrary to international law.</p> <p>In supporting this motion tonight, the Labour Party recognises the right of the great people of Ukraine to democratically elect their own political leaders and for those same people to be able to choose which international organisations they wish to join.  The horrific reports of the murder and rape of the Ukrainian population by this occupying force must be the subject of international court scrutiny.  The motion before us tonight mentions the deliberate deceit, misreporting and propaganda that we have all listened to over the past 100 days and which it seems has also been used to justify this unlawful invasion in Russia.</p> <p>The call in the motion that governments around the world maintain and strengthen sanctions on the Russian Federation while continuing the work - accelerated this week by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and the Taoiseach in Brussels - to end the imports of Russian oil, gas and coal, which are funding this murder and terror against the Ukrainian people and their homeland, should be supported by all.  We have all seen the horrific pictures of the destruction of this once proud country and the bodies of members of this proud nation lying in their streets.  It is unacceptable and must be called out as such.</p> <p>I take the opportunity afforded by this motion to thank the Irish people for their efforts in welcoming the many proud Ukrainians who have come to our shores to find safety among us.  Other colleagues have made this point also.  I am told recently that some 600 of the almost 30,000 Ukrainian refugees have come to my home county of Kildare.  There have been a number of welcoming committees and they continue to meet and assist these displaced people in my county.  I thank them most sincerely for their efforts.</p> <p>My office continues to deal with a number of queries from many of those who have come to our shores.  One of the issues raised a number of times with me is the ability of those fleeing the war in Ukraine to continue their education while with us.  I note from a recent reply from the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that work is ongoing and that a national student and researcher help desk is now in place to assist those wishing to continue their education.  In addition, there are further issues with those from Ukraine in our primary and secondary school system.  I note the Minister for Education is before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science this evening to answer questions on those issues.</p> <p>I thank my party leader, Deputy Bacik, for hosting members of Ukrainian Action in Ireland in the Oireachtas this week.  They came to show their initial findings of a survey of those who have fled here from Ukraine, which is an important piece of work and important information for us all.</p> <p>It is important to note that Ireland has had diplomatic relations with Ukraine since 1992 and we established an embassy in Kyiv in August 2021.  I am informed that Ukraine has had an embassy in Ireland since 2003.  Prior to the almost 30,000 refugees coming to our country from Ukraine, there were already 3,000 Ukrainians living in Ireland before the war.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In many cases, these people had put down strong roots within our communities, contributed handsomely to community life in this State and been important and valuable members of their communities.  Since this war began, 6.3 million people have fled their homes, a greater number than all the people on this island we all call home.  Within Ukraine, 7.7 million people are internally displaced and 10.2 million are in need of food and livelihood assistance.  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as of 17 May recorded 7,964 civilian casualties, of which 3,778 were killed and 4,186 injured.  This is a war the people of Ukraine did not want and one that has changed and devastated their country for a long time.  It may also have changed the face of Europe, an outcome we will all have to deal with.  I commend Fianna F&aacute;il Senators on bringing forward this motion.  The Labour Party fully supports it.</p></speech>

She is welcome back to Seanad &Eacute;ireann, albeit temporarily.  I am sure she does not wish to come back permanently any time soon but we are always delighted when she visits on occasions like this.  It is an issue I am sure she would be in the middle of if she were still in the Seanad, but I know she is championing the cause in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.

Russia's shocking, illegal invasion of Ukraine - a further invasion of Ukraine, of course - which started on 24 February, is a profound event with numerous implications for the entire world.  I thank Senator Dooley for all his work, particularly on the political front with political parties in Ukraine who have been advancing the cause of democracy there in recent years.  I am glad he is organising for a number of them to be in Ireland this weekend at the ALDE Party Congress Dublin 2022, an extremely important event for the people of Ukraine, especially the Servant of the People party, which I expect will be admitted to membership of the ALDE party.</p> <p>Ireland has been united and everybody has agreed we should call for peace.  We have called in all relevant forums for Russia to withdraw its troops immediately from the sovereign territory of Ukraine.  Ireland has always been ready to support meaningful dialogue which could deliver peace.  We commend the Ukrainian Government's willingness to participate in dialogue while simultaneously defending its country from Russia's unjustifiable military aggression.</p> <p>Achieving an end to Russia's violence and to the grave humanitarian consequences it has created is an important priority.  However, pursuing peace never means we neglect the need to see justice done.  Peace and justice reinforce each other.</p></speech>

The most important facet of the resolution is its call that those responsible for crimes in Ukraine be held to account.  This focus should remain to the fore in international consideration of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Everybody responsible within and without Russia should be held accountable.  The Seanad provides a platform for this important principle tonight.  That is important.</p> <p>The further invasion of Ukraine, starting on 24 February 2022, was and is a gross violation of international law.  All of us are aware of the many reports, seen by Senator Dooley, the Cathaoirleach and others, of shocking acts perpetrated by the invading Russian forces.</p> <p>When the Minister, Deputy Coveney, debriefed the UN Security Council on 19 April following his visit to Ukraine, he was able to bear witness in the council chamber to what he had seen, focusing on the town of Bucha.  He described hundreds of family homes, shops and other civilian infrastructure blackened, burnt, looted, damaged and, in some cases, completely destroyed.  He described family cars riddled with bullets, windshields smashed and bloodstains evident.  He described standing at the edge of one of the mass graves while the work of carefully exhuming bodies continued.  A total of 503 civilians had been identified at that stage and just four soldiers.  Reports like this horrify us all and remind us that we cannot slacken in our support to Ukraine and to the Ukrainian people.  I was glad to meet the ambassador from Ukraine in the corridors this evening and reiterate our support.  The events of these months must never be forgotten.</p> <p>I will speak on the support Ireland is giving for Ukraine's membership of the European Union.  Ireland has joined a group of member states called the friends of enlargement and is to the fore in supporting Ukraine in its quest for candidate status.  Tonight, the ambassador or permanent representative in Brussels is hosting a meeting of the group of countries supporting Ukraine's accession to the European Union.  Ireland will continue to lead on that.  The Taoiseach has given strong leadership on that and reiterated that point at the European Council on Monday.  Ireland supports the strongest possible sanctions and always has.  We have achieved much, and more than people would have given us credit for.  Pretty much every bank in Russia is de-SWIFTed, as it were.  That was not thought possible before Christmas.  Huge parts of the Russian economy are now sanctioned.  We will not get everything we look for because different countries have different needs and some countries, unfortunately, are wholly dependent on Russian oil, but we have come a long way.</p> <p>The motion refers to genocide, specifically in its conclusion.  The determination of an act of genocide involves a complex analysis of fact and law.  Ireland's practice is to recognise genocide only when this has been established by a final decision of an Irish court or international tribunal, or where there is international consensus on the matter.  Both the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, ICC, and the relevant legal authorities of a number of states, including Ukraine, are conducting criminal investigations into numerous acts committed by Russian forces that may constitute international crimes, including genocide.  It is important we let these investigations run their course and do not pre-empt outcomes.  However, there are serious, sincere and widely shared concerns that the act of genocide may well have been committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, and those responsible must be held accountable.</p> <p>Ireland and our EU partners are clear on the need for international justice mechanisms to assist in delivering such accountability.  Ireland is a strong supporter of the ICC and is one of more than 40 states parties to refer the situation in Ukraine to the office of the prosecutor of the ICC for the purposes of investigating the matters Senator Dooley discussed, namely, the claims of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.  The prosecutor has started investigation activities in Ukraine.  The starting of investigations is intended to lead to the prosecution at the ICC of individuals for the commission of crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of that court.  It is important we allow these investigations to proceed with independence and impartiality, values that are fundamental to that court's work and mandate and to any court in our democracies.  We have expressed some concern to the Ukrainian authorities about their proposed legislation, which could limit Ukraine's co-operation with the court solely to possible crimes committed by Russian forces.  The court must be allowed to do its work independently.</p> <p>There are now additional staffing and financial pressures on the ICC and it has asked for further resources from states parties.  In response to this, Ireland announced on 14 April that it will provide an additional &euro;3 million to the ICC, &euro;1 million of which has already been dispersed to the office of the prosecutor.  Although announced in Ukraine, this voluntary contribution will be made available for the benefit of all country situations under investigation or on trial, as the rules governing such funding preclude it being used to influence any one investigation.  The situations in Palestine, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of Congo are other matters before the court.  Ireland is also investigating the possibility of providing national seconded experts from our Civil Service or others to the office of the prosecutor.</p> <p>To date, EU member states have agreed to contribute &euro;7,646,000 and to second 16 experts to the ICC to be made available for the benefit of all situations before the court.  France, Czechia, Lithuania and Slovakia have offered the services of 32 experts to the judicial authorities in Ukraine, while the Netherlands has provided a forensic and investigative team of around 30 experts under the aegis of the ICC.  The voluntary contributions made to the ICC have proved essential in supporting the prosecutor's investigation of the situation in Ukraine, but the best way to meet the resourcing needs of the office of the prosecutor and all the other organs of the court is through the court's regular programme budget, which has to go up.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On 25 March, Eurojust established a joint investigative team, JIT, consisting of Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, to co-ordinate the collection and sharing of evidence of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukrainian territory.  On 25 April, the ICC joined the JIT as a partner and the Czechian, Estonian, Latvian and Slovakian governments are expected to formalise their membership shortly.</p><p>Another important tool in the rapid work of holding Russia accountable has been the use of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE's Moscow mechanism.  On 3 March, the Moscow mechanism was invoked by Ukraine, supported by 45 of the OSCE's participating states, including Ireland.  Subsequently, a mission of three experts was appointed on 14 March, which delivered its report to Ukraine as the inviting state on 5 April.  The mission's mandate was to establish the facts and circumstances surrounding possible contraventions of OSCE commitments and possible violations and abuses of international human rights law and international humanitarian law.  The mission was also mandated to establish the facts and circumstances of possible cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including due to deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure.  It will act to collect, consolidate and analyse the information with a view to presenting it to the relevant accountability mechanisms as well as national, regional or international courts or tribunals that have, or may in future have, jurisdiction.</p><p>The mission's initial report found credible evidence of violations concerning the most fundamental human rights, mostly in the areas under the effective control of Russia, as well as clear patterns of violations of international humanitarian law committed by Russian forces.  A further invocation of the Moscow mechanism is expected tomorrow to cover the period following the first report.</p><p>Holding Russia accountable for violations of international law must continue to be pursued by the multilateral system.  Ireland has been a strong and consistent voice in so doing.  As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland is supporting efforts to bring an end to the conflict through diplomatic means, to hold Russia accountable, and to call out Russia's cynical attempts to use the Security Council and other UN bodies to spread disinformation.  Ireland has co-sponsored two resolutions on Ukraine at the General Assembly.  Importantly, we also co-sponsored a resolution, adopted by the General Assembly on 7 April, that suspended Russia from the UN Human Rights Council for its gross and systematic violations of human rights.  Ireland co-sponsored a Human Rights Council resolution establishing an independent commission of inquiry to investigate all alleged breaches of human rights and international humanitarian law and related crimes in the context of Russia's invasion.  Ireland is one of 56 countries that supported a special session of the Human Rights Council on the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine resulting from the Russian invasion.  Ireland has joined the Group of Friends of Accountability, an informal group of countries dedicated to ensuring accountability for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and other crimes perpetrated in this conflict.</p><p>I reiterate that the Government does not oppose this motion, which raises important points about Russia's unacceptable military aggression in Ukraine.  That aggression is completely contrary to the principles of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act.</p><p>On some specific conclusions the motion makes, the Government deems it important to avoid pre-empting any determination that may be made by the ICC or any other competent judicial mechanism.  Of course, the Seanad is free to make its own political determination separate from the ICC's proceedings, which I know the Seanad agrees are important.  Nevertheless, Russia's violence in Ukraine has been morally repugnant and disgusting and we are making every effort we can internationally to ensure the facts are recorded and the perpetrators will be brought to justice.  Ireland will play its part in ensuring these events will never be accepted nor forgotten.</p><p>I thank the Seanad for the opportunity to address these issues and for Senators' contributions on the motion.</p></speech>

I thank the Government for its leadership in Europe on this issue.  Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe that has never invaded another and we know what it is like to be in Ukraine's position.  Therefore, we know what it is like to fight for our very survival as a country and a nation.  That is why we stand with the people of Ukraine.</p></speech>

I am deeply appreciative that people have put their political differences aside and that we as a Chamber have come together around an issue that we hold dear, as has been well ventilated by all sides.  There has been a recognition by all of the principles of democracy and that every country has a right to self-determination - to decide how to govern itself, elect its own leaders and make decisions on foreign policy and, equally, defence policy.</p> <p>Ireland remains militarily neutral and we have not had any interest in joining any particular military alliance, but it is not for us to determine what any other democratic country might do.  Neither is it for Russia or anyone else to decide what Ukraine, Finland, Sweden or any other country does in terms of its defensive policies.  Being able to deal with its own business is something that should be open to every democratic country.  The Ukrainian people have that right.</p> <p>I am thankful to the Minister of State and the Government.  Making a determination of genocide raises hackles in various Departments, with diplomatic flags going up and suggestions being made that perhaps this is not a decision we should be taking, but we must separate the politics from diplomacy and the justice system.  There has rightly been an acceptance by politicians in this country generally that we do not stray into the decisions of courts.  That is for a good reason, given that juries are sometimes influenced by what is said in the Houses.  It has impacted on previous cases.  However, the decisions that will ultimately be taken, most likely in The Hague, around war crimes or genocide in this instance will not be taken by citizens in isolation.  Rather, they will be taken by qualified judicial practitioners who are not influenced by what anyone in this House says.  They are not under our influence or direction.  They will separate all of that out and go through the process on the basis of facts, no different from the way in which the Garda might follow an investigation or how the Special Criminal Court operates.</p> <p>I have no problem with the House making a political judgment based not on what we have been told but on what we know and what some of us have seen.  I am thankful other Senators are prepared to accept my bona fides and those of the Cathaoirleach - we have visited Ukraine and seen and spoken to people on the ground - and to stick with us and make that political judgment based on the evidence we have put before them.  The courts will not be influenced by what we have said here or elsewhere.  They will follow the evidence provided to them.  I am happy we are not transgressing that important line - a line that should exist - separating our Legislature and a judiciary, given the way in which any such trial would be constituted and the jury would be independent of the sentiments expressed in this House.</p> <p>We are taking the right decision.  We are joining others in attempting to bring international pressure on the despot that is Putin.  There is a notion that when the truth comes out and there is a laying down of arms, the Putin regime will want to reset diplomatic relations to what they were prior to the invasion and that it will be back to business as usual.  Some commentary is attempting to do that, saying the sanctions will have to be lifted as part of the cessation of violence.  That cannot happen.  There cannot be a return to business as usual.  Unfortunately for the Russian people, they will also suffer, but the people around Putin will have to be made to realise the decisions they took in February have consequences that will go beyond the ending of the violence.  I hope that, in the fullness of time, the support of European politicians for individual parties in Russia that have democratic outlooks will lead to a change in direction in that country and that the people of Russia will at some stage recognise that the continuation of the Putin regime is not in their long-term interests, regardless of how they deemed it in the past.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not in their long-term interest.

That &euro;1 billion per day it has taken from us and used to fuel the war in Ukraine must be brought to an end, no matter the difficulties we will face in the short term.

The Minister will be aware of the concerns I had previously expressed about the issue of "may" and "shall" as it relates to the provision of important and relevant information.  I intended my amendment to this section to highlight the need to ensure suitable and specific measures around the protection of the fundamental right of persons.  I am going to engage further on that issue and I know the Minister has indicated to me that he is looking at certain areas of the Bill where I have highlighted there may be concerns with regard to the rights of persons under the Data Protection Act.  There are sections of the Bill where there could be a perceived or actual incapability with certain of the rights that persons may be able to exercise under the Act.  It is not constructive for anybody who has rights they can use under the Act and other measures are prescribed in other legislation.  As the Minister will be aware, we particularly indicated one example relating to the question of those who may have visited.</p> <p>There are a number of amendments on which we will return to these issues.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This relates to the general concern around persons not being put in a position where they have to rely on direct powers under data protection legislation as regards seeking appropriate information.  I also note, since section 67 references the general data protection regulation, it is important to clarify such specified measures as the Minister may put in place.  It is very important the Minister is extremely clear on the issue of immunity, in particular.  I tabled a number of amendments that were unfortunately ruled out of order, which is a disappointing decision but so be it, on the question of the protection of persons from vulnerability to prosecution and immunity.  It is very important we do not have a situation under this Bill whereby somebody is protected, and I am speaking specifically about those who have intentionally withheld information, and who we know in the past have a record of intentionally withholding, obscuring and, in some cases, falsifying information, in respect of those who have sought the kinds of information provided for in this Act that relates to their families, their personal health services, for example, and so on.  This is a section around a relevant body and, in particular, certain religious orders and adoption agencies that have been found, in the past, to have intentionally misled or provided false information to any persons.  It is important there is not a presumption of good faith on their part.  That relates to section 65 on immunity.  I will reserve the right to come back to that on Report Stage.</p><p>On the regulations for the purpose of data protection under section 67, which we are discussing, the Minister needs to be very clear that where there is a record of the failure to disclose information, or a proven record of the falsification, or intentional misleading or provision of false information on the part of a body, regulations for the purpose of data protection should specify limitations to immunity for those bodies.  My amendments in respect of immunity have been ruled out of order, but I urge the Minister to think very carefully about this area and to ensure the Bill does not provide immunity for bodies that have, potentially, a previous record of intentional false action in respect of information.</p><p>As I said, I signalled my amendments to section 65 on this matter, but if it is not possible to deal with those issues through that section, there may be potential to do so through the regulations made under section 67.</p></speech>

I have always said, throughout the discussion on this legislation, this is a twofold change.  It is a change in the law to make sure the legal presumptions are completely different to what they were so there is a clear basis for the release of information and an openness to the release of that information.</p> <p>There also has to be a change of culture that many Senators have referred to.  Key to driving that is the power the Minister has to issue guidelines to the agencies and authorities that will implement this legislation to make sure they continue on a path of openness and transparency and a presumption of the release of information.  Linked to that is the implementing body, which is the group led by my Department that brings key officials in Tusla, the AAI and my Department together, so there is a common understanding that the purpose behind this legislation is to release information.  That is what all bodies and agencies should be working towards.</p> <p>I take on board the Senator's point.  We are seeking to bring about a legal change through this legislation, but we are also seeking to bring about a culture change.  Work on that has begun in advance of this legislation being passed. </p></speech>

I will again indicate something that can perhaps be provided for under the regulations.  This matter relates to the regulations under GDPR but I will address it more widely.  The Minister will be aware I also had amendments that were ruled out of order in respect of what is a very basic suggestion, which is that information campaigns, for example, highlight the options open to persons under this Act, including their options under GDPR.  As the Minister said, it is very important people know that their rights under GDPR are not negatively affected by the provisions of this Act.  The idea is those provisions are meant to be supplementary and in addition to rights persons may hold under GDPR.</p> <p>As I said, I had amendments that were, unfortunately, ruled out of order, which sought to require the information accompanying information campaigns that may arise from this would be in plain English.  A separate issue, and one I will raise with the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight, is the fact that an amendment to suggest an information campaign would be in plain English, something that is stated Government policy, was regarded as a charge on the Exchequer and not regarded as suitable for an amendment is outrageous.  To simply have an amendment that states something could be communicated in a way people can understand regarded as an intrusion on the State's finances is a very serious question for the Seanad to solve in relation to the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight.</p> <p>Leaving aside that issue, which is for the Seanad to resolve, I hope the Minister will indicate, for example, as regards the regulations that he will set, the intention in those regulations to ensure that communication is in plain English, including communication on persons' rights under the general data protection regulation, so that people know and are given that information in plain English.  That is even provided for within the general data protection regulation itself.  Leaving aside the fact it is meant to be State policy to have plain English, there is within GDPR an actual specification that people should be able to understand their rights under that regulation.  The Minister might indicate his intention to ensure all relevant information is communicated in a way that is in plain English and that is understandable to persons, regardless of their levels of education.  I do not doubt the Minister's commitment in that regard but it would be useful to have that assurance given to the House.</p></speech>

We have been working to commence that.  The AAI has engaged with the National Adult Literacy Agency on making sure the information and material produced as part of this campaign meets the criteria and is easily understood.  We are acutely aware, and we know from our dealings in this House, that this legislation is highly complex.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Roderic O'Gorman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RodericOGorman&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As the Senator has noted, there are two sets of legislation, that is, the new legislation we are creating and existing legislation such as the GDPR.

That will be highlighted within the information campaign.  I hope that reassures the Senator.</p></speech>

This amendment seeks to ensure the provision of counselling support to parents and relevant persons is not subject to inappropriate delays.  This is important because these periods of time will involve extraordinary pressures for individuals who may be affected by the measures in this Bill.  We need to recognise that timeliness has an impact in this regard.  This is not about people choosing to address a long-standing issue but persons who are reaching out during a time of significant pressure or difficulty for them.  In that regard, they should not simply have an entitlement to counselling and go to the end of a very long queue.  This should be a timely measure.  We would all like to believe people could access counselling support immediately but I have sought to be reasonable and have suggested that counselling sessions would commence within 90 days of being requested.  If people were to seek counselling support, that would be guaranteed and they would know that, within three months, they would have that opportunity.  Recent stories have highlighted that a large number of persons have had to wait well over three months to receive counselling from the HSE.  It is important such delays do not become commonplace.</p><p>A number of my amendments on this issue have been ruled out of order but they relate to the same core principle of counselling.  I encourage the Minister to take on board the importance of ensuring counselling is provided for as long as a person may need it.  An amendment on that was ruled out of order.  The idea was that people could access counselling within a timely period and be given it for the period of need, which may be different for different persons.  Some persons may need counselling around a difficult decision or contact point.  We only need to look to the mother and baby home reports and other reports to know there may be very difficult and complicated issues of trauma that may be unpacked by the provisions of this Bill.  It is important those persons who need that additional support are given counselling for the period of time they need it.</p><p>The legislation suggests that counselling &quot;may&quot; be provided at the request of a relevant person or the parent of a relevant person.  My amendment on that was ruled out of order but I hope the Minister will take on board that counselling should be provided.  There should not be a question as to whether it will be provided.</p><p>This next issue is slightly outside the scope of the Bill but it relates to the principle of counselling.  An interesting question arose around the future Minister and the adoption legislation.  I acknowledge the former Minister, Katherine Zappone, who brought forward that legislation.  I succeeded in bringing an amendment to it on open adoption.  When we have dealt with the past, I hope we will have the opportunity to engage with the future and open or semi-open adoption.  The previous Minister engaged with my amendment, held a consultation and conducted a legal review, which found there was a strong demand for open and semi-open adoption.</p><p>One of the issues we encountered was the gap in counselling in respect of adoption.  Ireland has a mindset whereby when someone has been adopted, they are part of a new family.  The family will no longer talk about the process of adoption because it is a &quot;one family only&quot; framing, which is out of line with the child and family relationship legislation.  The person will be told he or she cannot talk about adoption because that person is a Smith now, for example, rather than having counselling.  There has been a very <i>ad hoc</i>and informal relationship with counselling for those who have experienced adoption in Ireland.  There is some support informally through NGOs for those who have been subjected to adoption from another country, but there is a gap in counselling supports from the State for those who have experienced adoption, many of them at an older age.  I am just signalling that.</p><p>My focus in this amendment is on ensuring counselling is promptly provided for as long as it may be needed, but I also want to signal that there needs to be a general look at the wider question of counselling, including for children and those with experience of adoption.  There is a little bit of a lacuna at the moment.</p></speech>

Nine months is crazy.  It is not sufficient.  When someone is in desperation or suicidal, with recurring anxiety, or is feeling threatened - that may be internalised and is not necessarily external - nine months is an unsatisfactory wait.  We have a scandalous arrangement where people are waiting anyway in the HSE.  I spoke to a man a few weeks ago who was abused within this State.  He is well known and has reported it to the authorities.  He is initiating legal proceedings through the courts and he cannot get services.  I have made representations to various Ministers and Departments on this.  I meet this man weekly in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  He is desperate, anxious and vulnerable.  He has had experience of living in an institution and he cannot access supports.  Due to their kindness, a neighbour pays for some limited private counselling services.  It is all unsatisfactory.  I do not need to spell that out the to the Minister because he is aware of it.  There will be a need for counselling.  That is clear from having spoken to and knowing many people who will be involved with the provisions of this legislation when it is enacted.  It is to be hoped it will be enacted.  It is not everything any of us wanted but it is progress and I acknowledge that.  It is important that we, the Department and the health service start preparing to provide counselling services.  They are critical.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Victor Boyhan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2463"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2463&amp;amp;pid=VictorBoyhan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In many cases, counselling services are the difference between life and death for people.  That is the reality of it.  There are many people who are constantly in and out of psychiatric services because of their trauma, experiences and vulnerabilities.</p><p>I thank Senator Higgins for raising this matter.  It is a marker for us all that we now need to look at counselling services.  There will be counselling services.  There are people who will go on for many years without any form of anxiety or concern but then, suddenly, issues arrive and these things all come back up.  Issues around these matters do not just go away, although they may go into abeyance for a while.  I wish to flag genuinely that we need to look at counselling supports.</p><p>Initially, as this legislation is enacted, there will be a higher focus in terms of publicity.  The usual old radio stations will conduct interviews and we will have the same people talking about their experiences ,describing how they were forgotten and lost, and all the stories that go with that, and genuine stories at that.  The point is there will be a surge again, just like there is every time with issues like this, and therefore we need to be ready, in the short term by providing confidential phone services and things like that, which in turn could be an initial reception for people.  At least we would be aware of them and we could give them a referral at some future date.  It is important because I genuinely believe it will open up a lot of issues for many people.</p></speech>

As it stands, section 63 provides specifically for a parent who is registering a preference of no contact to be informed of his or her entitlement to avail of counselling support.  Counselling support for relevant persons is also covered in this section and is drafted to ensure those who need it most are prioritised.  As such, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.  In particular, I do not believe that placing a statutory timeline for the provision of counselling is necessary.  I do not think it is useful either.  My understanding is that counselling can take different forms depending on the expressed needs of the individuals, and that the type of counselling can evolve in how it is provided.  Forcing a timeline for the provision of counselling in statute does not add to the value of making sure counselling is supportive and person-centred.  My worry is that by putting a very strict timeline in the legislation, as proposed, it becomes more of a box-ticking exercise than a genuine attempt to support an individual and provide him or her with the type of support he or she needs, recognising that different people come to this with different experiences and have different needs.</p> <p>In terms of the additional ask for counselling from the AAI and Tusla from people using this legislation, as Senators will know, both bodies have received additional funding from my Department, which will allow them to enhance their resources for the provision of counselling for people applying under this legislation.</p> <p>On the wider point of counselling, I accept the points both Senators have made.  I reiterate the point, as I have done whenever I have spoken on these issues in Seanad &Eacute;ireann, we brought forward the national counselling service.  We opened it to coincide with the publication of the report of the commission of investigation, we increased its hours, and we stated clearly that survivors of mother and baby homes and county home institutions are prioritised groups when applying for its services.  Therefore there is a way for the survivors on whom we have placed so much focus in the context of this legislation to avail of that service.</p> <p>In terms of the experience of Senators who have spoken to me, I am not sure whether people have tried to engage with this.  If any Senator has encountered a situation where that service is not delivering, please tell me and we will look to improve that situation.  That service is there and has been there.  It is a free service and survivors of mother and baby homes and county home institutions are prioritised in terms of access to that service.  It important for all of us to get that information out there because there are people who would benefit greatly from this counselling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#JJJ00200"><p>I do not believe our amendment is prescriptive in terms of what persons would need.  In fact, it is the opposite.  We have indicated, and Senator Boyhan has indicated very eloquently, that people may need longer periods of time.  The key point is that if a person is requesting counselling, he or she should be provided with that counselling within 90 days of such a request.  To be clear, and it is important, that is not prescriptive in terms of the amount of counselling required or needed.  It simply says that if a person reaches out, he or she should be provided with counselling in a relatively timely manner.</p> <p>It is important in terms of relevant persons, and that needs to be looked at.  Specifically, as the Minister has indicated, it is also important for parents, for example, where they may have a situation whereby they are unsure whether they will be contacted.  That may be the initial issue on the basis of which they seek counselling support.  Of course, the very fact somebody has fears in that regard may unpack some of the other fears or concerns they have relating to the experience they may have had.  I am thinking, in particular, of mothers, although it is not exclusively mothers, who have had experiences in mother and baby homes.</p> <p>In that regard I note that my amendment is not prescriptive in terms of the period for which such persons may require care.  My amendment is prescriptive in saying that, within 90 days of having sought counselling support, such persons should receive counselling support.  Nobody should go longer than three months in limbo, having said, and it is a difficult thing for people to admit, they need psychological support, nor should they go longer than that without being given a guarantee they will receive that support within 90 days.  If you know help is coming, that is something, whereas if there is not a set period within which you are going to receive counselling support, it could feel indefinite and create a situation whereby persons feel alone.  The Minister may not be open to the 90-day period and maybe he is interested in a different period.  What I want is that persons who reach out and seek counselling support have that assurance that, within whatever period of time, they know they will receive that support rather than simply sending a request for psychological support with no idea of whether or when they will hear back.</p></speech>

We discussed at length earlier today and at our previous debate the issues regarding striking a balance when it comes to privacy rights, and for some parents, and I believe they are in a minority, their concern about protection and their not being contacted.  Earlier in this process we changed the obligation in terms of providing counselling and made it mandatory.  The Bill states, "The Agency, on the request of a person referred to in subsection (1), shall arrange for the provision of counselling support to him or her."  It is clear the legislation takes a particularly strong view of the need to provide that support for parents.  I do not think putting in the timeline, as the Senator suggests, is an enhancement of that.  It is important to recognise that the legislation itself shows that it sees the importance of providing counselling for parents while recognising that a group of them may be especially vulnerable in terms of fear and apprehension about the release of their name to the child who was given up for adoption.  That is recognised by making this a mandatory obligation within the legislation.  We have had that debate about "may" or "shall".  I have disagreed in terms of situations where "may" or "shall" should have been used.  Here is a situation where we have used "shall".</p></speech>

I hope the legislation will be reconfigured in other situations where we debate the use of "may" and "shall".  Nonetheless, I believe having a designated timeline is more constructive.  In that regard, I will press the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#KKK01000"><p>I move amendment No. 130:</p> <blockquote> 	In page 65, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:  	&ldquo;(2) A review under this section shall include meaningful engagement with relevant persons, groups representing survivors and families, persons with expertise in human rights and data protection, and other relevant persons or groups as the Minister deems appropriate.<br /><br />(3) At the conclusion of the review, a report shall be prepared and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.  </blockquote> <p>Amendment No. 130 specifies that, in a review of the operation of the Act, the Minister should consult with relevant stakeholders and affected persons and that, at the conclusion of the review, he should lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again, I welcome the fact that there is provision for a review of the Act.  That is important.  Section 70 states that there will be such a review &quot;not later than 2 years after the coming into operation of this section&quot;.  That wording is a little strange.  I mention that because I have had experience in the past of winning the insertion of new sections in legislation only for those sections not to be commenced.  It would probably be better if it was worded as &quot;after the coming to operation of the Act&quot; but I am going to trust the Minister that he will commence this section along with the other sections, even though I have experience of that not happening.  Again, this is just a technicality.</p><p>I welcome the fact that it is indicated that there will be a review of the operation of the Act but I believe we may need to go into a little more detail.  It should be borne in mind that, even though I accept the bona fides and good intentions of the current Minister, it may be another Minister who is there in two years and it would, therefore, be useful to specify some provisions in respect of the review of the Act.  Amendments Nos. 130 and 131 would specify that, in the review of the operation of the Act, the Minister would consult with relevant stakeholders and affected persons and that, at the conclusion of the review, he would lay a report before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again, these amendments seek to specify who the Minister would consult.  The current Minister will be very aware of the importance of consulting with those who are affected, the difference that has made and the changes in approach that have arisen from speaking to people about their real and specific experiences.  Again, I believe it is appropriate that we specify that this same kind of thought and integrity would be reflected in the review.  The Oireachtas joint committee also specified the importance of that sustained engagement with stakeholders and affected persons so this amendment reflects a recommendation of that committee in its prelegislative scrutiny.</p><p>Amendment No. 131 seeks a specific report on how the Child and Family Agency has performed its functions in respect of this Act.  It asks that, in preparation of such a report, the Minister would engage with the relevant persons.  This is also complementary to the committee recommendation in respect of a stakeholder advisory group.  It also addresses issues on which I can be frank because I know the Minister is very aware of them.  I refer to the significant issues of trust in the Child and Family Agency.  New provisions have been made and new mandates given but it would be appropriate to specifically look at how the agency has changed practices, engaged in different ways or applied different policies in recognition of the provisions of this Act.</p></speech>

I will not go back there because we have been there, done that and made a decision.  We will ultimately account for that as we go out from here in the next few weeks.  It is right that we need to engage.  We have talked about the business of trust and about engagement.  Many of us have come in here and engaged through amendments.  We are now wrapping up.  There will have been 137 amendments and we know what happened to most of them.  That does not instil a lot of confidence for me, but it is not about me.  This is legislation going through these Houses of the Oireachtas and it is right and proper to have some form of review.  The Minister has indicated that he is happy enough to have some sort of review.  It is important that we engage with people and instill confidence.  I, therefore, support amendments Nos. 130 and 131.  They make sense.  I will wait to hear what the Minister says before I respond further.</p></speech>

When I spoke to Senator Boyhan's amendment No. 108 earlier, I indicated that I was open to reviewing the text of section 70.  I am, therefore, a little disappointed in Senator Boyhan's comments suggesting this is all being railroaded through.  I said I would respond to that and I have indicated to Senator Higgins that I will respond to some of her amendments on Report Stage.  I have listened and taken points on board but, where I do not agree with proposals, I have also put forward clear articulations of why I do not believe they should be brought forward.  I want to put that on record because we are coming to the end.  This has been a lengthy process and a respectful one.  There will be amendments to the legislation on foot of the hours we have put into Committee Stage over the past two weeks.  I will bring forward a proposal to amend the text.  In particular, I will propose that the report be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as suggested by Senators Higgins and Boyhan, and that it be a broad report.  It should be noted that I also changed the review provision in the D&aacute;il.  Originally, it was to occur after four years but that has been brought back to two years.  It is important to strike a balance and not to leave it too long while also ensuring that there has been time for the Bill to operate so that, if there are problems, they will have been flushed out.  There is not point doing it in a year because problems will not have been flushed out at that point.</p> <p>I do not agree with amendment No. 131.  The role of the Child and Family Agency will, of course, be assessed with regard to the operation of the overall Act.  The agency also provides its own annual report.  This will be part of that report.  I meet with the chief executive and the chairperson of the agency on a quarterly basis.  As long as I have been in this role, information and tracing has been at the top of the list of issues we discuss.  The aency's role and, indeed, the role of AAI and other relevant bodies, will be looked at under the terms of the review.  Singling out a separate report for the Child and Family Agency in the legislation would not be beneficial.</p></speech>

It is a useful acknowledgment of the fact that there has been very constructive engagement from concerned individuals from parties across the Oireachtas.  The evolution of our national discussion on this issue reflects the fact that there has been very constructive Oireachtas engagement.  I welcome the Minister's indication on that with regard to amendment No. 130.</p> <p>I understand his concerns regarding amendment No. 131.  I suppose we will have to wait and see.  I hope the review will address to an adequate level the operations of that agency but we need to very clear.  We do not need to be afraid of acknowledging that there have been failings on the part of agencies in the past.  That is important.  Part of how we build confidence for the future is acknowledging where agencies have fallen short or where there have been particular cultural practices within them in the past that have been very narrow.  The Minister will be very aware that many individual citizens' experience of engagement with the Child and Family Agency has not been positive or constructive.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I entirely understand and accept the potential and intention for change, reform and improvement in this regard, but it is also my view that citizens have a right to express the reality of their experiences.  As Oireachtas Members, we all must become used to accepting criticism all of the time, in every forum and about everything we do.  Similarly, our State agencies must be open to accepting criticisms and concerns and acknowledging citizens have had negative experiences and that those concerns need to be addressed.  Recognising that and offering apologies is part of us all moving forward as a contemporary state.</p><p>I acknowledge the Minister's view that this issue can be addressed internally, as part of the general review.  We must wait and hope the review will address the specific functions of specific agencies.  I am confident that if it is he who is putting the terms for such a review in place, then that will be the case.  We do not know whether it will be the Minister who does it but I hope it is.  I welcome his indication in respect of the engagement with the Houses of the Oireachtas and, I presume, with relevant stakeholders on a future review.</p></speech>

I say that genuinely.  I want to put it on the record of the House that, as I have said all along, I believe he is absolutely committed to reform on this issue.  There is no question about that.  It is my intention to support the Bill.  I made up my mind to do so because it represents major progress on what we had before.  We can all be critical and we all can go outside the Chamber and suggest A, B and C.  The Minister has a job to do and he takes advice on doing it.  I am committed to supporting the Bill, given what I know now and have known for some time.  There is no malice on my part and I will move on from this.  We have new business and new challenges every day.  There will be something else to deal with tomorrow.</p> <p>There will be a post-enactment report on the legislation, whether I, the Minister or anybody else likes it or not.  It is a requirement and it should cover off some of the issues we have discussed.  It is important to have that.  It is not the Minister's or anybody else's fault but it is quite frustrating to come in here and see that we are, to a certain extent, engaged in a numbers game.  We have very small numbers in the Opposition, which is just the nature of this coalition Government.  It makes it exceptionally difficult for us and it is frustrating at times.  There is no surprise here.  We know the outcome of all the amendments and it does not come as a surprise to anyone.  One might begin to scratch one's head and wonder what one is doing wrong if what one is saying is not resonating with anybody and is not getting support.  All parties will have their turns to be on the Opposition benches.  I have always believed during my time in the Seanad that we need to be constructive.  It is not about the Minister or me; it is about the policies.</p> <p>I am supportive of the Bill and I look forward to the post-enactment report.  I welcome the Minister's confirmation that he is working on something and will come back to us on it.  I look forward to that and thank him for it.  I acknowledge that he and the staff who are here with him have given more time than was originally scheduled for this debate.  It brings us nicely to the completion of this work and enables us to move on to the next Stage.  I genuinely acknowledge the Minister's absolute and enormous commitment on this matter.  He has cracked something that no one else has done before.  I wish him well and I will support the Bill.</p></speech>

On Senator Higgins's point, yes, there will have to be engagement.  As she knows, the stakeholder reference group that is to be established will be a touchstone for the ongoing implementation of the Bill.  I have always recognised that State agencies have failed, and failed hugely, in some of their engagements with citizens.  Moving away from the legislation and the question of what certain agencies could or could not have done, how they did what they did was, too often, not right.  The chief executive of Tusla, Mr. Bernard Gloster, has been very upfront on this matter.  He has met with large numbers of adopted people, including those who were subject to illegal birth registrations.  He has engaged not just by way of a once-off meeting but in a substantive and continuous way with individuals.  He is, of course, accountable to the Oireachtas through the children's committee.  There is a large range of mechanisms for the Minister, whoever that may be, and the Oireachtas to examine and question the implementation of this legislation by State bodies, particularly the Child and Family Agency.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-06-01a.507" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022060100002#LLL01900"><p>There is an opportunity for the Title to better reflect the debate we have had and the nuances that have emerged over the course of that debate.  I will not rehash all the points already made in respect of amendments Nos. 132 to 137, inclusive, which were grouped with other amendments, including the question of whether "incorrect" or "illegal" should be used.  That was an important debating point, however, as was the discussion on whether the Bill should refer to "all available" records or "certain" records.  There was also a discussion around whether the provision of certain information should be limited to situations where persons are deceased or should be more widely available.</p> <p>I have another concern in regard to the Title.  It relates to a topic that has been debated and on which I will be pressing more strongly on Report State.  The Minister is aware of the concerns in this regard and colleagues have spoken on my behalf.  There is a limitation on certain rights under this legislation to next of kin and there is, moreover, a narrow definition of next of kin.  For example, if there are persons who rightly have a concern in regard to access to certain information but those persons are not considered next of kin because another person is alive, then they may not be able to access relevant information under this legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=06&amp;amp;day=01"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a real concern.  For example, in the case of a living parent who may be considered next of kin, a sibling may not be able to access certain information under this legislation because that parent does not wish to exercise his or her next-of-kin entitlements.  I think there is a real concern, and it is an excessive constraint, about persons who have the potential to be next of kin in that they are recognised as being a significantly connected relative, who may not be able to access their rights under this legislation because of another person who technically holds the status of next of kin.  It is, certainly as set out in this legislation, a closed limitation.  For example, a sibling may not be able to access information if one parent is alive.  One parent may be deceased and a sibling alive.  A cousin may not be able to access information because of a sibling who is choosing not to exercise his or her next-of-kin entitlements.  It is out of spirit with the understanding of family we have in this State.  It is out of spirit with the important legislation we passed, namely, the Child and Family Relationships Act.  That Act recognised that there is a web rather than a hierarchy of familial relationships and that there is not simply a patriarchal tiering of rights from the head of the family down.  Every child has both lateral relationships - that is, sideways relationships with siblings and others - and parental relationships.  Again, the way in which next of kin is configured in this legislation is out of spirit with where we are in this State and out of touch with the kinds of provisions put forward in the Child and Family Relationships Act and the referendum on the rights of the child.</p></speech>
