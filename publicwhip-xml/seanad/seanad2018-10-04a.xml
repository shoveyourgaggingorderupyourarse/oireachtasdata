    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-10-04a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1389" speakername="Paul Gavan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018100400002#A00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  He will be aware that my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, recently submitted a parliamentary question asking how many prosecutions since January 2013 for the failure of owners to microchip their horses had taken place.  We submitted that question after a meeting with Action for Animal Welfare Ireland, AAWI, which, the Minister of State may know, is holding a protest today at 2 p.m. outside Leinster House.  The answer came back from the Minister of State's Department that there had been zero prosecutions in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, which in fairness shows a consistency in the Department's approach.  It has consistently done nothing to ensure the effective policing of this issue, and has consistently failed to apply the law in this area.  The reply to the question stated: &quot;Enforcement of equine identification legislation is largely undertaken by authorised officers across the regional offices of [the Minister of State's] Department&quot;, and that the Department's &quot;policy is to adopt a fair and proportional approach in dealing with breaches of equine identification legislation&quot;.  Let us consider the words &quot;fair and proportional&quot;.  In the Minister of State's county of Cork last year, 92 horses were euthanised.  Is that number fair and proportional?  There were 211 in south Dublin, 67 in Tipperary, 139 in Fingal and 138 in my county of Limerick.  In total last year, some 1,198 horses were euthanised, and there have been numerous documented cases of disgraceful abuse and cruelty to horses, which is why there is a protest here later today.</p><p>This is not fair and proportional.  This is what happens when the law is not applied year after year, and it is the result of the Department not doing its job.  It is now a major problem across a number of our towns and cities across the State, which interestingly is largely associated with working-class areas of Limerick city, Cork and Dublin, as well as areas of rural Ireland, such as Tipperary, which have long been forgotten by this Government.  If these horses were roaming around Montenotte in Cork, Foxrock in Dublin or the North Circular Road in Limerick, I suspect we would quickly see a different definition of &quot;fair and proportional&quot;.</p><p>I wish to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i>from last December: </p><blockquote>The latest find, on Wednesday, was a decomposing horse beside an isolated walkway at Suir Island in Clonmel.  The animal is thought to have died of malnutrition.  The remains of seven horses were found in a field in the Knocklofty area on December 18th.  The horses were in various states of decomposition, with one foal standing by the carcass of a mare that may have been dead for up to a month.  Up to 14 horses were discovered in the field alongside the dead horses&rsquo; remains and they were taken to an Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ISPCA) compound in Cork. </blockquote> <p>AAWI described last year as the worst for abuse of horses.  As I said, it is holding a protest at 2 p.m. today and my colleague, Councillor Catherine Carey, who has been outspoken on this issue, will be there with the protestors.  To conclude, the Minister of State's Department is failing, and I ask him to address the matter.</p></speech>

This EU legislation was subsequently transposed into national legislation via SI 62 of 2016, as amended.  Under the current rules all equines must be identified with a passport no later than 12 months from the date of the equine&rsquo;s birth and must be implanted with a numbered microchip transponder by a veterinary practitioner.  SI 62 of 2016 requires that keepers submit an application for an equine passport with an appropriate passport-issuing organisation within six months of the date of birth of the animal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Andrew Doyle:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This provides the passport issuing organisations, PlOs, with sufficient time to conduct further examinations, including DNA testing for studbook equines, with a view to ensuring the identification document issues within the required timeframe, which is no later than 12 months from the date of birth of the equine.  It is not an offence to apply for a passport outside the six-month timeframe but a passport issued outside of the 12 months specified under the article must be issued as a duplicate replacement document.  The latter automatically and irrevocably excludes the associated equine from being slaughtered for human consumption at the end of its life.</p><p>In the context of microchipping, the number of the microchip must he recorded on the passport issued in respect of the equine.  It must also be recorded on the database maintained by the issuing PIO and must be notified by the latter the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's central database, along with all other identification data in respect of the equine that is required under Article 38 of CR 262/2015.  The microchip creates a link between the equine and the passport issued in its respect.  However, the passport is the required identification document under CR 262/2015.  Equine identification documents are issued by PIOs to the Department.</p><p>The Senator referred to a response to a parliamentary question which indicated that the Department's policy is to adopt a fair and proportionate approach in dealing with this matter.  The problem is that many of the animals referenced have never been microchipped and, as such, there are no traceable owners.  All of the animals recorded in registered studbooks are so recorded for other reasons.  Much work needs to be done in communities.  The Department has invested &euro;127,000 per annum over the past two years in a specific project in Limerick, which has expanded into many other areas.  This project, known as the Moyross project, has resulted in some young people taking up training in stables and, in some cases, further education in this area.  One particular young man is considered to have a bright future ahead in this field.  There is work being done in this area.  I am a horse owner and I have taken rescue animals onto my own farm in the past.  I understand the difficulties expressed.  As a former member of a local authority, I know that when animals are found in a poor state of health nobody admits to ownership of them.  These animals are never released until they have been microchipped and only then to persons who can prove they have access to sufficient grazing land for them.  This is how the system works.</p><p>This was highlighted as a major issue some years ago but people's activities have been reined in year on year in the meantime.  I agree that the cruelty to which reference was made is unacceptable.  As an owner of animals, I could not stand over such cruelty.</p></speech>

I appreciate that he did not just work through the script because, with no disrespect to the civil servant who drafted it, it does not address the issue raised.  I accept the Minister of State's bona fides but, with no disrespect, the Department is not policing the system effectively.  According to Action for Animal Welfare Ireland, there are repeated behaviours year on year because there are never prosecutions.  A fair and proportionate response must include prosecutions.  It is not acceptable that there have been no prosecutions for the last five years.  The Department should and must do more.</p></speech>

The Senator did not ask about prosecutions for cruelty.  The question is specifically about the failure of horse owners to have them microchipped.  Were the Senator to ask for the statistics on prosecutions for cruelty to animals, including horses, he might get a different response.</p></speech>

Ms Carter took proceedings in the High Court to ensure that she did not lose out on a place in veterinary college owing to a totting-up error on a leaving certification examination paper.  While she was successful, she missed a number of weeks of the course.  As a parent of children who have sat the leaving certificate examination and of others who have yet to sit it, I understand the pressures involved.  For students who sat the leaving certification examination this year, the results were issued on 15 August 2018 - five days prior to the first round of offers of third-level places on 20 August.  The second round of offers took place on 29 August.  Mr. Justice Richard Humphreys, who, I understand, will soon hand down a written judgment in the case of Ms Carter, has asked that this process be reviewed and amended before the examinations next year.</p> <p>The Minister has previously stated that the State Examinations Commission and the third-level institutions will meet to discuss the matter this week.  Will he confirm if that meeting is going ahead?  Would it be of benefit for the chief executive officers of the institutions to also engage in discussions in the issue with the Minister and his Department?  In terms of this year's leaving certificate examination, there were approximately 284,000 scripts for correction and 1,652 examiners.  The process took 54 days to complete.  In terms of the appeals mechanism, in respect of which there were 400 examiners, the process of rechecking 9,000 scripts and 5,900 oral examinations - approximately 15,000 rechecks in total - took 40 days.  Between 15 August when the results were issued and 5 September, which was the deadline for receipt of applications for rechecks, there were 15 working days or almost three weeks, which is a long time.  There are then 25 working days, or almost five weeks, between the date for recheck of the scripts and the issuance of the results.  When will the results of these rechecks be announced?  Overall, this process will take approximately 40 working days.</p> <p>What is the position regard, totting-up errors similar to those which occurred in Rebecca Carter's case?  This is about real lives.  Of the 55,400 students who sat the leaving certificate examination this year, 5,200 appealed their results and 1,400, or 15%, received upgrades, 400 of whom were offered places on other courses.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Kieran O'Donnell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2207"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2207&amp;amp;pid=KieranODonnell&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is a time gap there.  It appears to take a very lengthy period of time under the appeal mechanism to get scripts back, which takes 15 working days, nearly three weeks, and then a further 25 days for them to be checked, which amounts to 40 days in total.  That compares to 54 days for nearly 384,000 scripts as against 9,000 scripts on the appeal.</p></speech>

I am pleased that Rebecca Carter has started her course.  She is in University College Dublin, UCD, and I am happy for her.  I certainly do not want to see students having to go to the courts to exercise their rights on this.  The judgment was just issued yesterday and it is 44 pages long, so the Senator will understand that my Department and the State Examinations Commission, SEC, need time to absorb that judgment before any comment will be made on the detail of it.  However, what has happened immediately, as the Senator said, is that the SEC board instructed its executive to review those very timelines which the Senator outlined.  As he rightly said, there is a 16 day period before students view their scripts and then there are another five days before they appeal.</p> <p>There is the possibility for rectification, which happens immediately.  However, rectification, as I understand it, is only allowed by the SEC where it is a figure added up on the front of the script.  If there are issues inside in respect of one question being weighed against another question the SEC does not regard these as a simple addition in this sense because there can be revisions in the course of quality control of correction that can result in changes, so if it is at that detailed level within the script, a full examination of the script can be required.  The SEC is an independent body so it is obviously for it to decide that and not for a Minister to issue a diktat.  The SEC has a simplified procedure for rectification where it is a totting error.  In the other cases, it has the procedure the Senator mentioned.</p> <p>The higher education institutions and the SEC are meeting today.  The objective will be to shorten that period from 15 August to 10 October.  While I appreciate the independence of the SEC and that it has to make sure that whatever it does is robust, I am confident those timelines can be shortened in some dimensions.  To be fair to the SEC, it is particularly robust when looking at re-examinations.  It applies more intense quality control with the re-examination of one in five scripts being appealed as opposed to one in 20 in the general scheme.  The SEC is rigorous and it is defending the robustness of the system.  The norm for all colleges was to accept someone who got an upgrade in their examination but what changed this year was that UCD decided that it would only allow such people to continue their course if they had a change by 30 September.  That was prior to the date when appeal results would come out and that clearly had implications for students.  UCD has since indicated that it is lifting that requirement so that students in a similar position who get an upgrade will be able to continue-----</p></speech>

Although the exam results always came out on 15 August and appeals were always on 10 October, the trend in recent years has been for colleges to bring the start date further and further forward to try to fit into a new semester system.  The colleges depend exclusively on the leaving certificate results.  They do not operate any alternative admissions system so there is an onus on colleges to respect the integrity of the examinations system, including its appeal process.  That is why I am bringing both together to ensure we get a solution that meets the needs of any student who sits his or her exam and is the victim of an error and that he or she does not find himself or herself at a disadvantage.

We will work with them to ensure students do not have this same experience next year.</p></speech>

When does the Minister anticipate that the SEC and the third level institutions will conclude their deliberations and advise him of the changes that will be implemented?  When does he anticipate that we will have a definitive outcome so that parents and students will be aware of the process that is in place so that if we have a situation in numerical totting in particular, we can have an immediate resolution?  Most students start in a third level institution at the beginning of September.  Students are six weeks into a course before they get the examination rechecks.  That is too long and many of those cannot change because they will not be able to adapt to the new course.  That needs to be looked at.  It is about timetables and fairness.  The Minister might give us an indication of what he expects the timetable to be in terms of the outcome from the discussions between the SEC and the third level institutions so that parents and students doing their leaving certificate will have full clarity.</p></speech>

On the issue of when the SEC allows a simple rectification and when it seeks a re-examination, we have to rely on the independence of the SEC in making that decision.  I understand the reason it does not allow additions inside to be simply added is that often the reason for additions of figures inside the paper can be a revision in the marking based on quality control in the course of the examination.  There may be changes in marking that a student would perceive as having been unfair to them that were not and so on.  The simple rectification within a day or two is done within very specified circumstances only.  By all means they should be allowed to re-examine those circumstances to see if they can be eased but I respect the need for caution in that area.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, Jigsaw began a national review of its national youth mental health services.  The review aimed to report on finance, clinical and governance matters.  It is welcome and there is certainly merit in stopping to take stock and examining if things can be done better but there has been a serious problem in the delay of the completion of this report.</p> <p>To put it into context, my colleague, Deputy Brady, has been in contact with groups in Bray, County Wicklow, which have been working hard to secure a Jigsaw site for many years.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Jigsaw has a development procedure and the community has undertaken to ensure it is ready, and indeed it is.  Bray has done Trojan work on this.  Young people have done the majority of the work.  Jigsaw has deemed Bray ready for the service for well over a year now.  Action was taken to begin this service in 2012, more than six years ago.  In 2017, the HSE advised through parliamentary questions that the 2018 mental health budget would not have any funds for the expansion of Jigsaw services.  As Members can imagine, this is disappointing for young people and adults in the communities that have been working tirelessly for the service and have been promised its delivery time and again.</p><p>I acknowledge that things take time.  However, the review of Jigsaw services was supposed to be published in June.  This would allow plenty of time for the findings to influence budget 2019.  Recently, it was revealed through a parliamentary question I submitted that the deadline was pushed to September.  It now seems the report will not be available until the end of the year.  Is the delay in the publication of the review's findings going to be used as a justification for excluding expansion of funding for the mental health budget in 2019?  Is Jigsaw still marketing itself as a service that wants to be in every county and does the HSE support this?  It is absolutely vital that the Minister of State outlines in her response the reasons for the delay in the publication of the report and her Department's detailed plan for the expansion of Jigsaw services to other areas.  We need to inform this House, the adults who have worked for years on this, and most importantly the young people who have committed to developing Bray for this service since 2012 and who so desperately need it.</p></speech>

Unfortunately the Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health, Deputy Jim Daly, has asked me to take this Commencement matter as he cannot be here.</p> <p>Mental health continues to be prioritised by Government within the wider health sector.  This has been underpinned by significant new investment annually since 2012.  More than &euro;200 million in additional funding has been provided over this period to enhance all aspects of services, thus bringing HSE mental health funding for this year to around &euro;910 million.  This is significant by any measure, notwithstanding the need for further investment in the modernisation of services to meet emerging needs and demands.</p> <p>The HSE funds Jigsaw to provide early intervention mental health services which focus on the needs of young people.  Their model provides tangible supports for those with mild or emerging mental health difficulties.  There are 13 Jigsaw services in communities across Ireland, underpinned by HSE funding of around &euro;9.8 million last year.  In recent years Jigsaw has provided a new service option and approach for the HSE whereby young people can access free and confidential supports from trained mental health professionals.  Aside from front-line care, it has been to the fore in tackling wider issues around changing attitudes, raising awareness, reducing stigma and promoting early intervention and recovery.  An independent evaluation of the Jigsaw service model was commissioned by the HSE to better understand Jigsaw&rsquo;s approach to youth mental health and how the service fits alongside other youth mental health services.  The evaluation took place between March and July 2018, as has been said.  Participants in the evaluation included young people, staff based at the Jigsaw national office and at four local sites in Dublin, Galway, Cork and Kerry and representatives from five community-based mental health organisations.   </p> <p>In addition, Jigsaw data for 2017 was analysed, three online surveys were conducted and relevant literature was reviewed.  A delay in the publication of this review arose because the executive wanted to ensure widespread input from the fullest range of stakeholders in the evaluation.  The HSE expects to have this process completed by end of this year, as the Senator has stated.  Such a review is a normal process for any organisation funded by the HSE and was particularly apt in this case following earlier consolidation of Jigsaw services nationally, thus developing a more formal partnership approach with the executive over recent years.</p> <p>The Government remains firmly committed to following through on the benefits generated to date by the collaboration between the HSE and Jigsaw.  Collectively, they have achieved significant progress over a relatively short period of time, and this detailed review will help clarify how best to meet future challenges and service requirements. </p> <p>The Minister of State is leading important and wide-ranging changes across mental health legislation, policy and services.  These range from updating the Mental Health Act 2001 to refreshing A Vision for Change.  The review of Jigsaw should be seen in the broader context of new opportunities and the Senator can rest assured that the Minister of State will continue to liaise closely with the HSE to conclude this review as quickly as possible.  </p></speech>

She will forgive my cynicism.  This review was supposed to be commenced in February but only started in March.  It has now been pushed out to the end of the year and that is causing concern.  Obviously budget 2019 would seem to be an appropriate time to carry out an expansion of the service, particularly for the Bray area, where the community has been site-ready and psychologically ready for the opening of services for young people for many years.  I agree that any organisation funded by the HSE must undergo a rigorous audit process, and must be reviewed to find the best way to improve its service.  However, we are now ignoring the need for expansion.  A report out today from Mental Health Reform shows that the vast majority of people do not believe that the HSE places enough focus on mental health services.  Here we have a site that is ready and people who are ready to expand this much-needed service to the Bray area.  I am disappointed that it has been pushed to the end of the year, therefore probably falling outside the window of opportunity for funding for expansion.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the budget is part of the reason it has been postponed or pushed out to the end of the year.  I am not 100% sure about that so I cannot answer.  I would like to acknowledge the work Jigsaw does.  I know the work that is done on the ground by Jigsaw, having been in some of the counties around the country where it operates.  I heard a conversation about mental health services in this country on the radio this morning.  More than &euro;910 million is being put into the services.  I hope that will continue, because we need to focus on young people and mental health, particularly in communities.  We must bring mental health services back into the community so that young people can be assessed in the community where they live.  I will bring Senator Devine's concerns to the Minister of State.</p></speech>

I hope the Government and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will take heed and acknowledge the seriousness of our housing crisis.  I do not think I have ever seen such a large group outside Leinster House.  There are 10,000 families, including 4,000 children, in emergency accommodation.  There are almost 100,000 people on social housing lists.  What we have seen in recent years are failed policies put forward by this Government.  I refer to the failed rapid-build programme.  We were promised 1,500 houses and we got 208.  There is the failed repair-and-lease scheme, a failed local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, scheme and now we are supposed to believe that the announcement of the Land Development Agency is going to be the panacea.  In the same week as that announcement, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, announced the sale of the John Player site on the South Circular Road.  That should be halted and the Government should intervene.</p> <p>Another matter I would like to raise relates to a meeting the Minister attended in the constituency in which I live in August.  The subject under discussion at the meeting was the land at St. Michael's Estate.  Many of us have been reading about that meeting, at which I was also in attendance, recently.  During the meeting in question, the Minister announced the launch of a cost-rental model.  I welcome that.  It is a fantastic model, it will be a pilot and I it will be replicated in other schemes throughout the country.  When I did more research, I discovered that no planning applications have been submitted in respect of this model and that no drawings have been created.  In late September, I also discovered from Dublin City Council that there is going to be a further consultation process.  It will not be finished until 26 November.  I agree with the consultation process but it should have started before any announcement was made on a definitive model.  If the process is not going to be finished until 26 November, we will not have plans until, perhaps, January.  They might be submitted at that stage but we all know how long processes of this nature take within councils.</p> <p>We are talking about plans not even going in until 2019 for a massive site with huge potential to resolve the housing crisis within our city.  When the Minister feels he is under pressure, he seems to decide that he is going to come up with another new plan.  It is a plan that he is never going to implement.  It is just an idea.  He finds himself in a corner and decides he is going to come up with another idea to get his critics off his back for a few weeks.  Time is up on that now.  We need action.  NAMA's sale of the John Player site cannot be allowed to go ahead.  The Minister has to intervene and show a proper willingness to tackle this housing process.  On the issue relating to St. Michael's Estate, the consultation should happen but the Minister needs to provide a firm commitment regarding when the plans will be submitted and when this is going to happen.  I hope I can get a proper response from the acting Leader.</p></speech>

Statistics show that 90% of Irish adults own smartphones and that they look at their phones 57 times a day.  I wonder how often some of us look at our phones?  It is much more than that.  It has been scientifically proven that people are addicted to their phones and to social media.  It is becoming the new issue, it is the new cigarettes of our modern times.  I ask the acting Leader and everybody in the House to support and push for a nationwide social media-free day.  It is fine if people need to be on their phones but for that one day we would ask everybody in the country to get rid of social media.  That was done with cigarettes and in many other areas.  Ireland would be the first country in the world to do this.  I am of the view that this collective initiative, not that of just one party but of all of us together, would show a lead in asking the people of Ireland to move away from social media for one day.  Let us break the addiction.  It is causing mental health issues, bullying and a whole host of issues.  I am not saying get rid of social media all together - I do not agree with that - but let us help to try to educate ourselves and the people of Ireland on the damage that can sometimes be caused by the overuse of social media.  I would appreciate the support of the acting Leader and the Government on this.  I am also asking all of my colleagues to strongly support this initiative.</p></speech>

There was a briefing with some 40 representatives of Ireland's local and regional newspapers and other media here in Leinster House two weeks ago.  The AV room, in which the event was held, was full to the rafters.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Grace O'Sullivan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2467"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2467&amp;amp;pid=GraceOSullivan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The media outlined the severe pressures faced by their industry in a digital news age. <br/><br/>We know that an informed electorate is a prerequisite for democracy.  The demise of local and national media would do untold damage to that in an age of fake news, digital manipulation and partisan silos online.  As two headlines in the Journalism Matters campaign state: &quot;Strong, Independent Journalism Matters&quot; and &quot;Irish journalism is at a crossroads.&rdquo;  In my own county of Waterford, local newspapers such as the <i>Waterford News and Star, The Munster Express, The Waterford Mail, Dungarvan Leader, Dungarvan Observer and Waterford Today</i>still play an integral role in shaping discussions on local issues, highlighting problems and successes and fostering a sense of regional cohesion and community.  While online news has threatened old models, it is not as if the newspapers and radio stations have stood still.  They have innovated and moved online while still providing news and analysis, despite greater competition.  Other EU countries offer considerable supports such as differential VAT rates, indirect subsidies and even direct subsidies to help support a vibrant, competitive and diverse local media environment.  With this in mind, I ask the Acting Leader whether the Government has given consideration to the five asks made by NewsBrands Ireland and Local Ireland, and which of them might be featured in next week's budget.</p></speech>

I was lucky enough to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence to hear a presentation by the Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, EAPPI.  The programme was founded in response to a call made by the heads of churches in Jerusalem.  Since 2002, more than 1,500 international volunteers from 22 countries have served as ecumenical accompaniers.  The work they do includes monitoring and reporting violations of international law, providing a protective presence, supporting the work of peace groups and undertaking public policy advocacy.  The delegation gave us the update on the village of Khan al-Ahmar located in the occupied West Bank, which the Israeli High Court has declared can be demolished.</p> <p>I raise this issue because the EAPPI made a valuable contribution and outlined practical measures our Government could take.  Our Government, in fairness, has made some good statements on Palestine but there has been no action.  The EAPPI pointed out that we could call for the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine and press for compensation for the demolition of EU-funded aid structures.  Most important, we could end the arms trade with Israel.  We have purchased 17 million armaments from Israel over the past decade.  How can we continue to treat Israel as a normal state?  Everyone in this Chamber knows what is happening.  Everyone knows that we are witnessing the slow genocide of an entire people.  It would be a record of shame for this Government, when it ends, if no concrete actions were taken.</p></speech>

In the 1980s, we heard all the same excuses and reasons that we could not take action on South Africa.  It is highly significant that Fine Gael is now out of step with everybody else in this Chamber.  Everybody else supports Senator Frances Black's excellent Bill on the occupied territories.  Is the Fine Gael party prepared to let the record show that when the genocide of an entire people was taking place, its members were prepared to sit with their arms folded and do nothing about it other than offer sweet sympathy?  That is not good enough.  I ask for a debate on the matter.  More important, I ask Fine Gael to stand up for human rights values and stand up for Palestine.</p></speech>

Compliant taxpayers are the unsung heroes of this country.  They pay for our nurses, garda&iacute;, teachers and social welfare system, including pensions for older people.  I would like to object to some of the rhetoric from Government sources in the past while regarding non-compliant taxpayers or those who avail of the tax exile system.  A Fine Gael MEP has congratulated one tax exile on his supposed philanthropic donations to GAA clubs.  This individual has decided that his money is not good enough to pay for teachers, nurses, garda&iacute; and pension provisions in Ireland and has decided to reside overseas.  We have a Minister of State who visited a convicted tax evader in prison and who made inappropriate advances to the Minister for Justice and Equality to intervene in the case.  Now we have a Government that is reliant on the support of somebody with a criminal conviction for tax irregularities.  I ask Fine Gael and the Government to realise that without people who do not avail of tax exile status, and are proud to pay their taxes, we would have no budget and we would have no capacity to pay for the public services that everybody in this country needs. </p> <p>I would like to raise the issue of homelessness again.  In particular, I refer to the disgusting suggestion that homeless people should be housed on a cruise ship docked on the quays of Dublin city.  I am glad to here since the idea was - pardon the pun - floated that the Minister has come out and rejected the idea.  The Government should do what the Fine Gael-Labour Party government did in 2011.  When we realised that there was economic crisis, an Economic Management Council was established.  The then Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform met weekly to manage the economic crisis and found a way out of it.  We are currently in a housing crisis.  It has reached such a scale that it is time for the Government to take it as seriously as the economic crisis of a number of years ago and to form a housing management council comprising four the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Ministers for Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  If this idea of housing homeless families on a boat is the best that Government representatives can come up with or defend on national media, they need to think differently about their strategies.  Everybody in these Houses want the housing, rental and homelessness crises resolved.  The establishment of a housing management council would be a practical measure.  It would give some comfort to Oireachtas Members and the country that the Government was genuinely taking the matter seriously and were not sending out spokespeople to a defend disgusting suggestion to house people on boats instead of housing them in houses.</p></speech>

I am conscious that a new GP contract is being negotiated.  I am also conscious that a lot of investment has gone into primary healthcare centres throughout the country with many of them opening as we speak.  These are being welcomed by the communities in which they are being established.  I have particular concerns about primary healthcare in rural areas.  I want to raise one specific example with the acting Leader and ask that he uses his good office to negotiate with the Minister for Health.  The matter relates to the Four Mile Water Health Centre in County Waterford.  Some years ago a modern clinic was built there by the HSE.  Approximately six months ago, the resident GP resigned from his contract and a new GP contract was advertised on 18 June.  Four months later, no new appointment has been made, which has caused concern in a vast rural area in County Waterford and south Tipperary.  The areas affected include the Nire, Four Mile Water, Ballymacarbry, Newcastle, Touraneena, Colligan and Kilbrien.  Patients from all these areas attend this practice, which is currently being manned by the staff and locum doctors.  More than a month ago, I received written assurances from the HSE that the new contract appointment was imminent but there has been no progress.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paudie Coffey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2237"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2237&amp;amp;pid=PaudieCoffey&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is frustrating.

This has come to my attention through personal experience of conversations with members of local authorities who are at the coal face and conversations with Members of both Houses, from all parties and none.  I do not know if this is coincidental or the result of concerted effort.  The county development plans in different areas have not changed and the conditions of local need have not changed.  I have had this conversation with representatives of local authorities all over Ireland outside Dublin and it is the same story everywhere.  It is nigh on impossible even when applicants tick all the boxes on local need and have their own family site and access to the funds they need to build the house.  It cannot be a coincidence that it is getting harder and harder.</p> <p>The Minister has the final say on this.  The Minister signs off when county councils or local authorities draw up their county development plans or area development plans.  If they want to include a variation that the Minister is not happy with it will not be included.  The Minister has wrongly been publicly critical of local authorities for not delivering on houses and not building houses.  There is a lack of communication between his Department and local authorities to free up people who are prepared to build houses.  When people are refused planning permission in their native, local, rural areas, despite having the financial resources to build, they are forced into other settlements.  They buy whatever house comes up for sale and that takes that house out of the market for somebody else who does not have the facilities, the land, the site, or the local area knowledge or ties to build a house in a rural area.  The Minister must come in here and address this issue.  By virtue of the fact that councillors select Senators, there are not too many Senators who would be unable to give him case-by-case examples of it happening in every local authority area.</p></speech>

This morning the staff and chief executive will have access for the first time to the full accounts and exposure.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council had a council meeting last night at which I met a number of councillors.  I still stand over the figures I put into the domain of this House.  There will be another debate on another day about that issue.</p> <p>I mentioned yesterday the issue of protected disclosures.  I spoke to an officer dealing with protected disclosures in the Minister's Department to ascertain and understand the extent of protected disclosures in a general context.  I will continue to explore a number of avenues.  I will bring to the Minister's attention my intention to pursue the matter.  I stand over what I said about the weakness of corporate governance.  It is wrong and inappropriate to saddle a local authority with these matters.</p> <p>I welcome the Acting Leader, Senator Richmond, a former colleague of mine on D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  I ask him to arrange for statements on the issues of whistleblowing and protected disclosures.  I understand the Minister for Finance is, or was, involved in initiating a review of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  The Act came into full effect in 2015.  There have been two, possibly three, annual reports about it.  It needs to be revisited and I wish to raise a number of detailed issues about it.  I would welcome a debate in this House about protected disclosures as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is important that people of all ages, and especially people who meet others on a daily basis, avail of the vaccine.  This will help bring down the numbers of people presenting to accident and emergency departments of hospitals with pneumonia and flu and occupying beds.</p> <p>Edwards Lifesciences, a pharma company, announced 600 jobs for the mid-west a couple of months ago.  The company has a temporary base in Shannon Airport.  It has announced its permanent location in Castletroy in Limerick.  This is good news for Limerick and the mid-west.  One of the things that influenced the company's decision was the standard of education and the skills of the workforce and training that people have had.  It is good news when a company of this size locates itself in Limerick and it will have an effect on other companies that are looking at the mid-west as a location.</p></speech>

A cost of &euro;30,000 was cited for private therapies, speech and language or occupation therapy, transport and everything connected with that.  There are huge extra costs for families with people with disabilities and not just autism.  It is not right that they are made to jump through hoops to get any assistance that is there.  There are so many gaps in the system that do not meet the needs of adults and children with autism.  There is a lack of respite care and other care that is needed.  It speaks to a failure of our heath, education and transport systems that these services and supports are not available.  </p> <p>I particularly want to talk about the lack of residential places and the Government's refusal to approve, or delay in approving, places where residential care is needed.  Families will always try to look after their children, young adults and adults within the home setting.  There are cases where that is not possible and the behaviours of the person with autism are such that the health and safety of those living within the family setting are endangered.  These people with disabilities like autism are being intentionally criminalised by the health services because they are being referred to the Garda.  Families and carers are being told to call the guards.  The Garda station is alerted to respond immediately to a call from a specific house.  That is not right.  I want the garda&iacute; and the Garda Representative Association to say this cannot continue.  Why are we criminalising people who have behavioural difficulties and disabilities?  It is crazy and wrong.  I want the Minister to come to the House to talk specifically about this issue.</p></speech>

I had reason last summer to check the number of vacant houses in our area, with a population of approximately 2,000 people.  There were 352 vacant houses or apartments, including those in ghost estates.  In the early 2000s and days of the Celtic tiger, tax incentives were given to build houses that were not needed.  Could Senator Ardagh explain to me the recklessness of that period?  If that had not happened, we would not have had a protest outside Leinster House yesterday.  There must be a bit of balance brought into the debate and a history lesson to illustrate the reasons the crisis has come about.  I have no doubt it will be sorted but this cannot be done overnight.</p></speech>

It is a Bedouin village I visited two weeks ago with my former partner, Ezra Yizhak Nawi, a very strong defender of Palestinian human rights.  It is proposed that this village will be demolished illegally.  The people there were removed from their homes 70 years ago and they formed this village, which is a pathetic construction.  A school has been built on motor car tyres.  It is proposed to demolish the village and move the people either to a garbage dump or a sewage facility.</p></speech>

I will also speak to another form of abuse of human rights, which relates to the former Clerys shop in the centre of Dublin.  It was bought by a woman rescued by the Irish taxpayer and she failed to honour the pension obligations of Clerys staff.  She turfed them out on their ear, including people who had been there for 40 years.  Now she has made a profit of something like &euro;30 million on the backs of these workers.  It is the unacceptable face of capitalism.</p> <p>I will finally comment on the state of British politics.  God almighty.

It is virtually impossible and I will not attempt to emulate Senator Norris.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity and I formally support Senators Gavan and Norris in their comments about the Bedouin village.  It is very important to do that.</p> <p>I ask the Acting Leader to facilitate a debate as soon as possible on Brexit readiness in the agricultural sector.  Before getting to the substance, I acknowledge that the Minister, Deputy Creed, has opened new markets and increased direct payments in the last budget.  Today we saw Kuwait opened for poultry and Qatar was opened recently for beef, with China opened earlier.  He has had great success in opening new markets and direct payments were increased last year.  More needs to be done and we should discuss agriculture in this House in the context of Brexit, along with a fodder shortage and pricing difficulties.</p> <p>We need to restore to pre-2008 levels the single farm payments in areas of natural constraint.  This is in what were traditionally known as severely handicapped areas where farmers labour under particular difficulty with respect to soil type, weather conditions and a range of matters that make it difficult to farm and have much higher costs of production.  Direct farm payments must be increased in those areas.  It is important particularly in the Border context, including in Cavan and Monaghan, as we prepare for Brexit.  There is a crisis in the suckler cow area, specifically premia for suckler cows.  The Irish Farmers Association held a very well-attended protest about this yesterday in Dublin.  We must increase the premia as the numbers of farmers engaging in suckler cow farming are falling dramatically quarter by quarter.  This needs to be addressed.</p> <p>We need a debate on readiness for Brexit in agriculture, as well as how the sector can cope with fodder shortage and pricing issues.  There must be an increase in single farm payments in areas of natural constraint and suckler cow premia should also be increased.  I hope we can have that debate very soon.</p></speech>

Relevant here is the question of funding of public broadcasting, particularly RT&Eacute;.  As we know, earlier this week the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, called for RT&Eacute; to get a &euro;30 million increase in annual funding "at a minimum", citing significant challenges in a rapidly evolving media industry.  That was the reason given for the taxpayer to prop up this money drain.  The BAI even stated there may be a case for increased funding in excess of &euro;30 million and, unsurprisingly, the chairman, Dr. Pauric Travers, requested that the Minister and the Government urgently address the financing required for public service broadcasting.</p> <p>This is at a time when the Government is struggling to keep the national homelessness figure below five figures and we have a national debt equivalent to 68% of our country's GDP.  RT&Eacute; received &euro;186 million through the licence fee in 2017, and that is taxpayers' money going to an organisation that recorded a deficit in six of the past nine years and only avoided one in 2017 because of cash generated from selling land.</p></speech>

TV3, recently renamed as Virgin Media, has its entire operation in an industrial estate on the edge of the city.  It gives the organisation space for new studios and expansion, whereas RT&Eacute; is hemmed in on some of the most valuable land in Dublin.  Perhaps we should have the Minister of State responsible for the Office of Public Works in to tell us whether the campus is a listed structure or there is a compelling reason the land cannot be disposed of to save the taxpayer some money.  We should also have the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in to speak to the matter, as RT&Eacute; must restructure its operations.  The capital released from moving would allow the company to purchase new facilities and clear its debt.  In the knowledge or expectation of an unrestricted cash flow, it seems instead to be following the example of many by having no incentive to reduce costs or any serious attempt towards a more efficient use of resources.</p></speech>

The Minister is to argue that Ireland is still producing too much waste.  Could the Leader facilitate a debate on the memorandum the Minister will bring to Cabinet outlining a zero-tolerance to single-use plastics in Government and State-funded buildings?

I have made a recurring speech in this House about Airbnb.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government now agrees that we would get 1,000 units back into the rental market if legislation or regulations were introduced.  These 1,000 units are badly needed in the housing sector.  The Minister promised action in June, July, August and September.  We are now into October.  The last commitment was that he would bring forward proposals in September.</p> <p>When the T&aacute;naiste was Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, he made a promise that we would see a start on the Poolbeg West site in 2017.  It is now 2018.  I received a letter this morning from An Bord Plean&aacute;la relating to Poolbeg West.  Let me remind the House that this site will house up to 8,000 citizens.  The letter informed me that due to what I would describe as incompetence, An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs further information on design, public grounds, community facilities, parking and traffic management.  It goes on and on.  I previously received a letter from An Bord Plean&aacute;la about this site on 2 August.  It told me that because of resources and backlog, An Bord Plean&aacute;la was unable to deal with it.  Let me point out the reasons for the problems with resources and the backlog.  The Minister made a decision that any application for more than 100 units would go directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la but he did not resource it to actually deal with the increased workload.  The outcome was that many planning applications were withdrawn and then upscaled to more than 100 units causing more and more delays.  Senator O'Mahony spoke about historical issues.  This all happened within two years.  The Government refused to accept that we had a problem with short-term lettings until after two years of it being constantly highlighted in this House.  The Minister would not accept that there was a problem with the Poolbeg West because of lack of resources, an issue that had been raised in this House for two years.  We still have no agreement on the 900 units of social and affordable houses and affordable rental.  Discussions are still ongoing, which results in further delay so instead of seeing ground being broken in 2017, we will be lucky to see ground by 2022.  </p> <p>My last point affects the acting Leader's neighbours.  There are thousands of apartments in this city and other cities that have legacy issues relating to construction during the boom.  Residents are facing possible eviction because of fire issues.  I can say quite honestly that there is a template in the Department for how this is dealt with.  I was involved in setting up that template when I was in government.  It is not acceptable to see thousands of our citizens evicted because of problems with fire certificates when there is a template for fixing this.  They are not asking for charity.  What they are asking for is access to funding at a reasonable rate - not the 7% or 9% that was being offered.  We will see thousands of our citizens being evicted on health and safety grounds because of inaction.  This issue has been raised for the past two years.  There is a template down in the Custom House for how to deal with this.  Ministers are actually refusing to meet with residents with this problem.  The prospect of possibly thousands of citizens being made homeless is totally unacceptable in the middle of a housing crisis.  We need action on this.  There was a large march yesterday.  We do not need history lessons.  This has happened in the past two years.  There is a mechanism to deal with this but the Government is refusing to use it.</p></speech>

I call for a debate on this report in the near future.  I know there was a debate in the D&aacute;il but it was truncated.  There are members of the committee here who would like to see that.</p> <p>I noticed that funds have been made available for rural and urban regeneration.  The town hall in Naas is an historic building that was built in the mid-19th century.  It was the former jail and is now being put to community use.  There are exciting proposals for its development as a library and further community facilities, particularly for those of us from rural areas who enjoy going to country markets every now and then.  I am not talking about farmers' markets.  I am talking about country markets selling the real produce developed locally.  Perhaps the Minister for Rural and Community Development might come to the House to give us some ideas of where that funding is going to go and how we can get our local authorities to apply for additional funding through that scheme.</p></speech>

I will begin with the issue of housing, which was raised in various guises by Senators Ardagh, &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, Paul Daly, O'Mahony and Humphreys.  I take on board what Senator Ardagh said about the two sites in the constituency of Dublin South-Central - the John Player site and St. Michael's Estate.  I acknowledge that the Raise the Roof protest yesterday was not just sizeable but impactful, although I would remind her of the protests under Fianna F&aacute;il, including that of the pensioners who marched outside Leinster House when Fianna F&aacute;il took away their medical cards.</p> <p>I agree that it was right that the Minister rapidly dismissed, and I know Senator Humphreys mentioned it, the notion of housing people on a ship.  This was something what was, pardon the term, floated in the UK as a way to house prisoners.  When I was a poor intern in the European Parliament staying in Strasbourg for a week, a cruise ship always sailed up the Rhine and that is where we were put.  The suggestion is not fit for purpose.  It should never been seen as accommodation.  If somebody wants to holiday on a cruise ship or join the merchant navy, well and good, but it is not a response to the housing crisis and I was relieved the Minister dismissed it in such a wholehearted manner this morning.  The suggestion of a housing emergency committee-----</p></speech>

The suggestion about a housing emergency committee is a valid one.  We are all keenly aware of the issue within housing.  The Government is on record as saying this is the number one issue but I will bring that suggestion to the Minister's attention.</p> <p>In response to Deputy Paul Daly's remarks about one-off housing, he might be shocked to hear that it is also a massive issue in my part of the world involving the Dublin Mountains up towards Glencullen, Ticknock and Tibradden.  In my seven years on the county council, I sat at many a kitchen as someone went through the process to try to get a home for their son, daughter or other family member on land that could easily accommodate it.  Each county council has a different approach to this.  I know we sat on the regional assembly together in a former life.  Each regional authority has a different approach to this.  It varies from county to county but it is something that could solve many of our issues.  However, it must be done properly.  Building one-off houses without proper planning or consideration for the overall county's needs is not responsible but there is a need there and I will bring the Senator's suggestions to the attention of the Minister.</p></speech>

It is in every county.  Regarding Senator O'Mahony's comments about the vacancies in Ballaghaderreen, we need to work on making sure people know this country is not Dublin-centric.</p> <p>Senator Humphreys discussed a number of key issues involving Airbnb.  He has consistently raised this issue in this House and I commend him on the progress he has achieved by his continuous lobbying.  The Senator also mentioned the delays in respect of Poolbeg West.  I came to the Chamber this morning from a meeting of apartment owners in Beacon South Quarter in Sandyford, which is the latest development to be affected by legacy issues.  The owners are facing bills of &euro;10,000 to &euro;15,000 for remediation works.  It is a two-year process.  A number of suggestions are going through the finance Bill which I hope might be able to alleviate that problem.  I will bring the matter up with the Minister in due course.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Neale Richmond:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2472"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2472&amp;amp;pid=NealeRichmond&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh raised the issue of social media and the suggestion of a social media-free day.  I would struggle to get through a social media-free hour.  While I acknowledge the many issues the Senator raises, including addiction and cyberbullying, it is also important to acknowledge the great benefits that social media bring, for example, the ability of grandparents to connect with grandchildren on the other side of the world through Facebook or Skype.  The vast majority of people who follow my Facebook page are well into retirement.  They may only have 17 friends but I am sure the picture of their grandchild on a beach in Sydney warms their heart even though the family is further away.</p><p>Both Senators Grace O'Sullivan and Mullen mentioned two different issues affecting traditional media.  On the issue of local media, I appreciate the in-depth briefing given by local media providers last week and the Government is taking into consideration all five of those requests.  I would love to tell the Senators what will happen in the budget next week.  I do not know and I am not sure if the Minister knows yet, but they are being fed into the process.</p><p>Regarding Senator Mullen's lengthy contribution regarding RT&Eacute;-----</p></speech>

I agree that there should be compensation for those losses.</p> <p>I reject the suggestion that Ireland is doing nothing in this region.  As I mentioned in a previous debate on the Middle East, Ireland is obsessed with the region.  The Government has invested more than &euro;8 million in the past year, be it through peacekeeping operations or directly in overseas development aid to the Palestinian people.  I have sympathy for the plight of the Palestinian people and I do not say that lightly.  The conditions in Palestine are horrendous, be they inflicted by the aggressive, inappropriate and illegal actions of the Israeli state or the domestic terrorism of Hamas.  We all need to work together on this.  I welcome the fact that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Taoiseach, as well as President Higgins, met the Palestinian President, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, last week.  I hope we continue to be obsessed with the Middle East.  Hopefully, some day there might be an element of relief for this most deprived part of the world.</p> <p>Senator &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also mentioned the issue of tax evasion and the comments on individuals.

Tax evasion in any form should always be condemned.</p> <p>Regarding Senator Coffey's concerns about primary healthcare, particularly in respect of the Four Mile Water healthcare centre, I will bring to the Minister of Health's attention that we need a debate on the issue of primary care.</p> <p>Senator Boyhan made reference to the debate last night on D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour to which I contributed.  I share many of his concerns.  I met some of the Fine Gael group of councillors in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown following their special meeting last night that ran concurrent with our own debate.  I agree with the Senator that many questions remain.  There is need for statements on the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and I will raise it with the Minister to see if that can be facilitated.</p> <p>Senators Byrne and Devine raised the important issue of the flu vaccination and the need for all people to get that, particularly those who are at risk, are young or old, those working in the HSE  it was the best investment I ever made or for the Department of Education and Skills.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will organise a day-long for all Members and staff of the Oireachtas to get the flu jab.  I took advantage of it last year.  It was the best investment I made for the princely sum of &euro;17.  I did not get the flu all winter.  It does not matter if one is scared of needles; it is worth doing.</p> <p>Senator Byrne also raised the important issue of the creation of 600 jobs by Edwards Lifesciences.  It is  not only a good news story for Limerick or the mid-west; it is a good news story for the entire country.  It demonstrates the importance of Ireland as a world player in the pharmaceutical sector.  Many new jobs are being created outside the Dublin region in the mid-west, Galway, Cork and in between.</p> <p>Senator Conway-Walsh raised the hidden cost of autism, respite care and residential care.  The delays in residential care have reduced to matter of weeks.  This is impressive, given where we were.  I agree with the Senator about the need to have a debate on this.</p> <p>Senators Norris and Joe O'Reilly also mentioned the state of British politics in respect of Brexit.  I will not comment on the state of domestic British politics because I have got to go on BBC again at 10.40 p.m and I will save it for that.  All Members are welcome to stay up.  On the question of Mr. Jeremy Corbyn M.P. and a second referendum, we have no role in the internal affairs of the United Kingdom.  However, Brexit is an absolute disaster for everyone, particularly Ireland.  It is our responsibility to make sure that we can limit the damage of Brexit and I look forward to the ongoing debates.</p> <p>Senator Joe O'Reilly raised the issue of Brexit preparedness in the agrifood sector.  The Government has made a &euro;25 million investment.  The Senator will be delighted to hear that the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have a meeting on 10 October with the relevant officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This will be open to all Senators.  The meeting will solely focus on Brexit preparedness, particularly in the plethora of areas in the agrifood sector the Senator mentioned and the importance of homegrown industries, such as Lakeland Dairies in his home town of Bailieborough.</p> <p>Senator Devine also mentioned the zero capacity for landfill report that was released this morning.  I will request that the Minister come in to take a debate.  That is a welcome and timely request and I thank the Senator for raising it.  Much has been done in reducing our reliance on waste.  The Government has been proactive on it but every individual can do more.  Simply getting a KeepCup or a plastic straw is not enough.  Much has been done.  I commend my colleague, Senator Noone, for her work to highlight this.  I also commend Senator Devine's work in that regard.  It is important and timely that we have a debate on this as soon as possible.</p> <p>Finally, Senator Lawlor raised issues in the report on Irish Aid.  We had statements on that in recent months, but that was prior to the Senator's election.  As someone who worked in the overseas development aid sector for two and a half years, as Senator Lawlor did in the lights of Vanuatu, I will request that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Cannon, to come to the House for statements on that and the importance of rural regeneration not only to towns such as Naas, but others such as Bailieborough, Ahascragh or Kilternan.  It is vitally important for all of us.  It is timely that we have a debate.  I look forward to welcoming the Minister for Rural and Community Affairs to the constituency of Dublin Rathdown where he is launching a new community centre in Kiltiernan on the Church of Ireland parish site and funded by this and the LEADER programme.</p></speech>

I do not blame Senator Richmond for it.  It is something that has crept into the proceedings of the House.  the absence of Members from the Chamber is referenced in the context of whether an extended answer is given to the issue they raised on the Order of Business.  Without in any way targeting Senator Richmond, whose response was excellent and thoughtful, I ask the Cathaoirleach to rule on this.  Those who are here are also interested in the issue raised.  The key issue is what is placed on the record of the House and whether the Senator who asked the question is absent or not has no relation to whether he or she checks what is given by way of reply afterwards.</p></speech>

However, there is nothing unusual about the section.  This provision has become a standard insertion in legislation such as this, which is setting up a new body.  I mentioned on the previous occasion similar provisions across a number of recent statutes, in particular agencies and State bodies under the remit of my Department.  I specifically refer to the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 and the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015, while, earlier this year, we had a comprehensive debate on the then Data Protection Bill 2018 before it was enacted.  I cite these three Acts from my Department as being statutes with a similar, dare I say identical provision, to that in this section in respect of the accountability of the chairperson to Oireachtas committees.  Section 24 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides for the accountability of the chief executive officer to Oireachtas committee other than the Committee of Public Accounts and the Committee on Members' Interests in respect of the general administration of the Property Services Authority.  Mention was made last week with some amusement as to the status of the Committee on Members' Interests.  I speak as a former member of that committee, a committee of some importance, although I am sure that Senators who are serving on that committee might be in a position to fill me in on its recent activities.  </p></speech>

I assume that is still the case, until I am convinced to the contrary.</p><p>Section 19 of the Data Protection Act 2018 provides for the accountability of the Data Protection Commissioner to Oireachtas committees other than the two committees mentioned as regards the general administration of the Data Protection Commission while section 30 of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 again specifically provides for the accountability of the chief executive officer to an Oireachtas committee in respect of the general administration of the authority.  In this instance, it is the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  I readily accept that statutes are somewhat dissimilar.  It is often a matter of stye of the individual Parliamentary Counsel with ownership of the Bill as to the expression of a particular matter.  Across the board we see a number of common aspects of accountability before an Oireachtas committee in respect of the general administration of the body when asked to do so.  Accountability is confined to &quot;general administration&quot; of the body while accountability to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of accounting matters is dealt with by way of separate provision, as is mentioned in section 21.</p><p>Another common thread is the specified exemption from reporting to an Oireachtas committee on judicial matters as set out in section 22(3)(a) together with a mechanism for the High Court to rule on any disputes that may arise between the Oireachtas and the State body as to whether a matter rightly falls within that exclusion.  There is a process in this regard again which will be known to Senators.  Other exemptions from reporting to Oireachtas committees are any other matters statutorily excluded as appropriate in the case of the Bill.  Such matters relate to the confidential information as specified and defined in section 28, which we did touch on on the previous occasion but which we will discuss later, and a provision that states that a person attending before the committee &quot;shall not question or express an opinion on the merits or objective of any Government policy, as set out in section 22(8) of the Bill&quot;.  This exercised some Senators but I remind the House that there is an identical provision in section 24(2) of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011, which prohibits the chief executive officer of that authority from expressing an opinion on Government policy when giving evidence to a committee under that section.  I acknowledge that these are broad exemptions and that the remit of the section what may be accounted to the Oireachtas committee is somewhat narrow, but section 22 provisions apply only in the context of attendance before a committee other than the Committee of Public Accounts, which is dealt with in section 21.  The commission in an independent body and I am not sure if it would be appropriate for us to make changes that would in any way impinge upon, or restrict, that independence.  I am not  sure that we should dilute some of the specified exemptions or delete them.  I do not see a reason for that and I am keen that we would follow precedent in other not dissimilar legislation.  Let me assure Senators that this is not new; this is not without precedent.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is not ground over which the Oireachtas has not gone before and, having regard to maintaining the independence of the new body, I do not wish to make changes which could be perceived to require a greater level of accountability to an Oireachtas committee for matters which would extend beyond the general administration of the commission.

He or she is not allowed to express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or to object to such a policy.  The Minister says this is included in other legislation and I accept that.  I remember vigorously opposing such legislation at the time as I thought it an unnecessary restriction.  It would be of considerable interest to hear the views of the chairperson on matters of Government policy, particularly where they impinge on his or her area of expertise.  I am not terribly keen on subsection 8 and, despite the fact the Minister says it is in other legislation, I will oppose it as a matter of principle as I have done it the past.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-10-04a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018100400002#Q01500"><p>Section 22(3) provides that the chairperson shall not be required to give an account before a committee for any matter which has been the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State.  Subsection (2) imposes on the chairperson of the commission the obligation to attend before an Oireachtas committee to give account for the general administration of the commission.  In that context, I cannot see why the chairperson would not be answerable in a case such as, for example, where there had been a dispute with an employee or an officer which had gone to the Workplace Relations Commission or the courts and a judgment had issued.  If it had been found by the court that an employee in such a case had been dealt with very badly, why would the chairperson be able to say that, as it had been dealt with by a court, he or she was not accountable?  It is one thing for somebody to win in the Four Courts but a different matter completely for a person, found to be to blame for something, declining to answer questions about it on account of the case having already been dealt with by the High Court.  I cannot see why the fact something has been dealt with by a court takes it out of the ambit of the phrase &quot;general administration of the Commission&quot;.</p><p>Section 22(3)(b) gives another reason for the chairperson to refuse to come before, or give an account to, a committee, that is, &quot;where the giving of such account would involve disclosure of proceedings, communications or matters contrary to <i>section 28.</i>&quot;  However, I will keep my powder dry on section 28 and the issue of disclosure until we discuss that section.</p><p>The Minister should be aware that section 22(4) of the Bill, as currently drafted, provides, &quot;Where the chairperson is of the opinion that a matter in respect of which he or she is requested to give an account before a Committee is a matter to which <i>subsection (3) (a) </i>applies, he or she shall inform the Committee of that opinion&quot;.  That triggers the potential circumstances which apply for a court application under subsections (5), (6) and (7) proceeding before the High Court.  It is strange that it only applies to subsection (3)(a) but not to subsection (3)(b).  If the basis of the chairperson not accounting to a committee is that the giving of such an account would involve disclosure of proceedings, communications or matters contrary to section 28, there is no recourse to the High Court because the second line of subsection (4) confines it to the earlier ground of refusal, which is that it is, has been or may be at a future time be the subject of a proceeding before a court.  I find it difficult to understand why the procedures from subsections (4) to (7) should apply only to disputes as to whether something was, is or may be about to come before a court or a tribunal, and not whether it would involve disclosure of proceedings, communications or matters contrary to section 28.</p><p>If the High Court deals with the matters under subsections (5) to (7), it will presumably deal with them in public.  There will be a public debate in the High Court about whether the chairman was right to refuse to discuss it on the basis that it may come before a court.  That seems to me to be a very strange provision.  Can the Minister imagine an application to the High Court by an Oireachtas committee for the chairperson to discuss something which he or she does not want to discuss on the basis that it has been, or may be, before the courts?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We want the High Court to adjudicate in public on whether it may come before a court.  It is a very strange procedure and I really wonder what useful purpose all of this very convoluted procedure serves.  I know that there are probably members of the Law Library sticking proverbial daggers in my back at the moment on the basis that this is a potentially lucrative form of new jurisdiction for the courts, to argue about what might come before them and what should not be discussed because it might come before them.</p><p>It seems to me that this is a very elaborate set of rules to determine whether the chairperson is right to say that the matter has been, may be at present or may in future come before a court, as a reason for not answering a question and then to say the whole thing should be shifted to the High Court to decide whether he or she is right to say that it may come before a court and refuse to be accountable on that basis.  I cannot understand, if a refusal to give an account involves his or her invocation or view on the confidentiality provisions in section 28, which is much more likely to arise in reality, why that would not be the subject matter of some recourse to the High Court if he or she gave a blanket refusal on that ground.  Why allow for an elaborate procedure to go to the High Court on the ground set out in subsection (3)(a) and exclude explicitly a refusal under subsection (3)(b)?  It simply does not make sense.  I am extremely dubious as to whether any value at all would really be served if the High Court is to be invested with jurisdiction to adjudicate between committees and the chairperson of the commission on the sole issue of whether something is, was or might in the future come before a court.  That is very difficult to understand and I would like an explanation as to why that is in the Bill.</p></speech>

I am not sure if that is possible but I imagine that it would be, which is one possible route out of the problem.  However, my concern is also with subsection (3) which holds that &quot;The chairperson shall not be required to give account before a Committee - (a) for any matter which is or has been or may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal in the State...&quot;.</p><p>That is madness.  It is stark, raving legal lunacy.  I can understand it in the context of a matter that is before a court, which is covered by the <i>sub judice</i>rule.  If it has already been before a court and a judgment has been registered, then that is the end of the matter.  I do not see why on earth that should preclude the chairperson from giving an account.  Then there is the absurd reference to a matter that &quot;may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court&quot;.  How in God's name would one know?  That is the answer to everything.  The chairperson would just have to say that a matter might come before a court at some stage.  He or she is not be required to give any substantial evidence that this is likely, that it is in the woodwork somewhere or that anyone has shown the slightest inclination in that regard.  It is absolutely absurd.  That is the end of the chairperson ever giving an account before a committee.  He or she need never give one because all he or she has to say is that it might come before the court at some stage.  That is the answer to everything.  It is a complete and utter nonsense and I cannot understand it.  Like Senator McDowell, I oppose the entire section but this subsection is a particular lunacy.  As I said, I can understand the<i>sub judice</i>rule.  When something is the subject of court proceedings or is being examined by a tribunal, then of course it should be excluded but it should not be excluded if it has already been decided on.  That is bad enough but to insert a provision that allows for an absurd, hypothetical projection that a matter might at some stage become part of court proceedings renders the whole thing completely and utterly ineffective.  In a way, Senator McDowell and myself should be supporting this because it actually negates the entire section.  It actually means that the chairperson can, on a whim, declare that he or she could not possibly discuss a matter because in the year 2043 it might become the subject of court proceedings.</p></speech>

The sky did not fall in.  I must come back to what I describe as the standard nature of this provision.  I do not want to restrict accountability for matters that are properly before a committee.  I want to ensure that matters run smoothly, that there is accountability and that there is a process through which the general administration of this body can be dealt with by the chairperson from time to time.  I do not want to see accountability restricted and do not agree with Senator Norris that a great restriction or nonsense is implicit in the section.  It works well in other legislation.</p> <p>Senator McDowell is right that there is no linking of the High Court procedure under section 22 to subsection (3)(b) because it is not necessary.  Access or resort to the High Court is a fairly common dispute resolution mechanism that we provide for in law and it is appropriate that this is the case.  The difference in subsection (3)(b) is the fact that the disclosure is prohibited explicitly under sections 27 and 28.  Matters that will be covered by subsection (3)(a) in terms of resort to the High Court would, in certain circumstances, be more subjective and may require to be determined in the High Court and will be the subject matter of argument whereas the disclosure of confidential information under sections 27 and 28 is catered for in those sections.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The proposal that "Any person who knowingly discloses or makes public in any manner any information that is secret within the meaning of subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence" is far more black and white.  Given the subjective nature of an argument or a point at issue under the earlier subsections, the question of resort to the High Court should be treated somewhat differently.  That is the basis of it.  Past experience points to a pretty infrequent use of this provision in any event.  It happens infrequently that tensions between Oireachtas committees and agencies have to be decided on by means of application to the court.  Nevertheless, it is important for this mechanism to be built into the legislation.  That is merely what we are doing - no more and no less.</p></speech>

I have described as a nonsense the provision in section 22(3)(<i>a</i>) that &quot;the chairperson shall not be required to give account&quot; for any matter that &quot;may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court&quot;.  That is a question the Minister has signally failed to address.  I wonder whether the Minister could comment on that specific question, which seems to provide a complete carte blanche.  I would be grateful if he would do so.  I have described as &quot;a nonsense&quot; the reference to matters that &quot;may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court&quot;.  I am not talking about anything other than this particular point.  I would be grateful if the Minister would comment on that.</p></speech>

If we look at past experience, in practice, no restrictions were placed on accountability to Oireachtas committees by dint of something that might well be <i>sub judice</i>in the context of current court proceedings or is likely to give rise to a court dispute at an early future date.  I do not accept that section 22(3)(a) will be used by chief executives, chairs or the chair of the commission in the way the Senator is suggesting.  There is no substance to the suggestion that the commission will be allowed to evade its discourse with the appropriate Oireachtas committee in this manner.</p></speech>

He has said that there is "infrequent" recourse to the High Court.  That is not what we are dealing with.  It could be completely infrequent, but it will still be in the legislation.  We are dealing with the wording of the legislation before the House.  The Minister said that this is not a restriction, but I contend that it is very much a restriction.  He suggested that this provision will relate to matters that are "likely" to come before the courts "at an early future date".  That is not what the Bill states.  There is nothing in the Bill about it being "likely" to come before the courts "at an early future date".  The phrase used in the Bill is "may at a future time".  The time is unspecified.  The Bill does not include the words "early" or "likely".  I am worried about the use of the phrase "may at a future time" and it should worry the Minister too.</p></speech>

It is my duty as a parliamentarian to object to sloppy wording - to something that is, as I have characterised it "a nonsense".  The Minister has not addressed the point that this could be used as a carte blanche.  I am not saying it has ever been used in such a way.  Perhaps it has never been used in that way or will never be used in that way in the future.  The possibility resides in the wording of the legislation that it could be used in such a way.</p></speech>

Instead, I would like to refer to something that has happened in the courts in the past.  Perhaps we might consider circumstances in which an Oireachtas committee is concerned that an officer of the commission has been wrongfully dismissed, bullied or wrongfully removed from office, and the High Court has so held.  I suggest that in such circumstances, any interpretation of section 22(3)(a) would give the chairperson immunity from being asked questions about how the person in question came to be bullied out of his or her job, or improperly dismissed or removed, on the basis that the matter has been before the courts.</p></speech>

Such a chairperson will be able to say that he or she is not obliged under the statute to say anything to the Oireachtas committee about the maladministration that happened on his or her watch and during his or her tenure as chairperson, and the associated decisions for which he or she was responsible.  That person will be able to avoid answering questions about something that was part of the general administration of the commission on the basis that the matter has been dealt with by the court.  It is not right that section 22(3)(a) will mean that the chairperson's personal accountability and responsibility for these matters will be off limits, and that nobody will be able to ask anything further about it.  This will not be confined to cases in which a substantive court decision has been made.  If an officer who brings a case for unfair dismissal, bullying, harassment or whatever goes on in so many of these cases nowadays is paid off with substantial damages, that matter will be deemed to have been before the courts and to have been settled.  Nobody will be able to find out about such a case because no evidence will have been given.  If the chairperson of the commission comes before the Oireachtas committee, he or she will be able to refuse to answer questions about that case on the basis that it was before the courts at one stage and was settled confidentially.  The chairperson would have no responsibility to give answers to the Oireachtas about what happened.</p></speech>

In the circumstances I have outlined, why should the fact that the matter has been the subject of court proceedings be of such relevance?  It would not need to have been the subject of an open trial.  It would suffice for a summons to have been issued, for a statement of claim to have been delivered and for the matter to have been settled and money to have been paid.  The commission might have backed down, admitted that it got it completely wrong, decided to reinstate the officer and issued an apology to the officer.</p></speech>

The third scenario is the one which Senator Norris uses as a blanket restriction on accountability for issues that may at some future date come before the courts.  To that I merely say that these are issues that will be well known, and reiterate the fact that this is a standard provision which in the past does not appear to have resulted in any adverse consequences for debate.  Correspondence may well have been exchanged and the issue may well have been the subject of some commentary in the media.

I cannot for the life of me see what useful purpose is served by such a provision.  The chairperson might well come in and say Mr. Bloggs sued the body but the matter was settled, and the chairperson may not want to disclose the terms of the settlement.

That person could be brought to the High Court and the court would apply that section so as to excuse all accountability.

That is not the type of discourse that is envisaged when a chairman or CEO, in this case a chair, reports and is accountable to an appropriate D&aacute;il committee.  It is not envisaged that the subject matter of debate in that committee should be an individual court case involving a member or employee of the commission.  I do not see that as the task of an Oireachtas committee.  Rather, it is the task of general administration.  Of course changes in the general administration which are the consequence of a high-profile court action can be discussed as part of the general administration, but not individual court cases.  I am sure that Senators will agree that if there is a dispute over the admissibility or otherwise of evidence, the place to deal with it is the courts as a normal recourse.</p></speech>

However, as Senator McDowell has pointed out that could include the award of very considerable amounts in compensation.  That is public money.  Of course there should be accountability to a committee for the expenditure of public money.  That is obvious.  If very significant amounts of State money are paid out to somebody in compensation then a committee of the Oireachtas should surely have the right to investigate, to establish the circumstances and in particular to establish the fitness of the chairperson to retain his or her position as chairperson of that body.  If there has been malfeasance on the part of the chairperson leading to a substantial award of damages, surely to goodness that raises questions about his or her suitability to be chairperson.  It is appropriate for a committee to examine this.</p> <p>The Minister says this is not envisaged in the Bill.  It is there in black and white.  We are discussing it.  The fact that these measures may have passed before a previous Oireachtas does not rule out their scrutiny now.  If a mistake has been made in the past it is part of our responsibility to correct that mistake.  We would be negligent in our duty if we did not do so. </p></speech>

Senator Norris has put his finger on a very alarming button by talking about the capacity of an Oireachtas committee to examine and, as he says, "investigate" a court case.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not see circumstances where that would be desirable or where an Oireachtas committee should second-guess the courts.

The Minister should be careful about putting words in my mouth.  The point I made was perfectly succinct and clear, and I am sure the Minister, as a fine lawyer, appreciates that fact, although he is doing his best to dodge it.  I am not talking about second-guessing a court.  The court has ruled.  Compensation has been given and taxpayers' money has been expended because of malfeasance on the part of the chairperson of that committee.  Surely to God it is right that there should be accountability.  Surely it is possible to question the fitness for the position of the chairperson.  That seems obvious.  There should be accountability.  I am not talking about second-guessing the judgment of a court; I am accepting the judgment of a court.  I am saying a judgment was made, the chairperson was found to be at fault, and a substantial amount of taxpayers' money was paid out in compensation.  Surely to goodness this raises questions about the fitness of the chairperson to continue in the position.  That is the point I was making, and the Minister should be careful before putting words in my mouth because I will quickly spit them out.</p></speech>

They do not be heard, adjudicated on or whatever.  Let us be clear.  We are dealing with a proposed provision in a Bill which will say that if a case is the subject matter of proceedings, whether the proceedings went to trial, whether a court ever heard the evidence in the case, whether there was a confidential or non-confidential settlement, or whether payment was made or reinstatement was agreed, all of that is put outside the boundaries of what an Oireachtas committee can ask the chairperson to do.  That is what that subsection says in plain black and white, and it is unambiguous.  It is not as if there are two views of it.  It is clear that if the case has merely been the subject of court proceedings, that is, not a court adjudication or determination, the chairperson may not be required to give an account under the rubric of general administration of the office, which is a serious matter.</p><p>This duty to appear before an Oireachtas committee is confined to the chairperson.  What happens if the chairperson has resigned or is not in office?  Under my reading of the legislation, the Minister is then obliged to appoint a lay person to be chairperson of the commission, and that must go through the public appointments procedure.  As I see it, there is no provision for a vice-chairperson or somebody else to act as chairperson in the absence of the chair.  Section 15(3) states:</p><blockquote>At a meeting of the Commission&mdash;(a) the chairperson shall, if present, be the chairperson of the meeting, or<br /><br />(b) if and so long as the chairperson is not present or if that office is vacant, the other members of the Commission, as the case may be, who are present shall choose another one of its lay members to be chairperson of the meeting.</blockquote> <p>The chairperson of the commission, however, is different.  The commission cannot appoint somebody to be chairperson of the commission pending the appointment of a successor.  If the office stands vacant, it appears that section 22 - the accountability provision - goes into suspension as the only person who is competent to be brought before an Oireachtas committee is the chairperson of the commission.  It is not somebody who is casually put in as chairperson for a particular meeting.</p><p>Section 14(1) states, &quot;The Minister shall not make an appointment under this section unless a resolution approving the appointment has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.&quot;  When one examines section 12(2), one realises that what happens is &quot;The Public Appointments Service shall recommend a lay person for appointment by the Minister as chairperson following a selection process held by the Service for that purpose.&quot;  If the position of chairperson lies vacant, the Minister cannot appoint somebody else to act as a stand-in and he or she cannot say that person will be the acting chairperson for the purposes of section 22 until the Public Appointments Service has conducted a recruitment campaign, made a recommendation and the matters have come before the Oireachtas for approval.  Until then, the Minister cannot anoint anybody to be the person who is to be accountable under section 22, which I believe is a serious lacuna.  If, for whatever reason, the chairperson resigns, falls under a bus, is removed or whatever, no accountability exists for somebody who possibly was not even there when any of the things the committee might want to ask him or her about happened, such as how in the name of God did the commission do all of this?  He or she will say that it all happened before he or she was recently appointed to the position.  It appears that there is a serious lacuna in how the matter is drafted.  There was careful scrutiny of many portions of this Bill in the Lower House and in committee, but it appears to me there must be provision for somebody to be appointed by the Minister to be chairperson until that vacancy is filled - from the lay members if that is what the Minister insists on, which he knows I am against.  There must at least be some kind of provision of that kind or else accountability is frozen while the chairperson is absent or the job is vacant, and section 22 ceases to operate.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The only circumstances in which section 22 can apply is if somebody else is appointed following a meeting of the commission, a nomination by the Minister - presumably with the say-so of the Government - and the holding of a debate in the Oireachtas on whether the person is suitable.  Is that person then to come in and account for the general administration of the body during a period when he or she was not even a member?  That would be very strange.</p></speech>

As a consequence of the ensuing scandal or whatever, the chair resigns.  There would be no accountability whatsoever.  Substantial amounts of public money may have been spent in compensation but the public will not be given an explanation.  That is wrong.  To adopt Senator McDowell's phrase, accountability is frozen.  That is wrong.  I believe in openness and accountability.  When considerable sums of public money are spent, there should be accountability.  That accountability should not just be to a commission, it should also be to the public.  The public should know.  There should not be confidentiality where somebody behaves wrongly or badly.  We are discussing circumstances where considerable amounts of public money might be spent in compensation and where the person involved resigns, and that is the end of the matter.  The public would not be given any information whatsoever.  That is wrong.</p></speech>

First, I will bring my colleagues back to the circumstances of section 22.  Its purpose is not to examine expenditure nor to investigate the spending of public moneys.  Those matters are provided for in section 21 and by the Committee of Public Accounts.  That is appropriate, having regard to normal practice.  It is also not the purpose of section 22 to comment on or investigate the fitness for office of the chair for the time being.  Section 22 is on the general administration of the body and that is appropriate in the circumstances.  I will address the point raised by Senator McDowell on the matter of the demise of the chairperson, whether by resignation, early retirement, incapacity or death.  We have had this in previous sections.</p></speech>

I go back to section 12, which places a firm obligation on the Minister to act by way of ensuring that the type of gaps referred to do not cause difficulty.  The Minister, under section 12(1)(b)(i) will request the Public Appointments Service to proceed and trigger the process to facilitate a chair of the body.  It would, of course, be undesirable for long periods to elapse without there being a chairperson.  Not only could the obligations under section 22 not be complied with, as stated by Senator McDowell, but the body would not function adequately without a chairperson.  It is not in the interest of anybody to allow long periods to elapse without there being a chairperson in place.  I do not subscribe to the view that there is going to be a legal difficulty or a real problem regarding the matter of the evasion of responsibility on the part of the chair or the avoidance of obligations under the legislation.  The Public Appointments Service, at the instruction of the Minister, can move pretty smartly to appoint a replacement in circumstances where this may occur.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-10-04a.223" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018100400002#V02100"><p>The Minister may be of the view that one of his colleagues thinks he is dragging this out but, with respect, that is not what is happening.  The Minister referred to section 12 and stated that he is under a duty to request the Public Appointments Service to carry out a selection process where a vacancy arises.  That is true.  The Public Appointments Service, under section 12(2), is then supposed to make a recommendation to the Minister following a selection process held by it for that purpose.  Then we go on to what happens and how that selection process takes place.  That is provided for in section 12(4), (5) and (6).  There is then an elaborate process of seeking appointments and validating appointments by virtue of eligibility and expertise.  Section 12(5) requires the person to be suitable by reason of his or her standing and possessing such experience, qualifications, training or expertise as is appropriate, having regard to the function of the commission.</p> <p>The people appointed are supposed to have knowledge of the operation of the courts, the provision of supports to victims of crime, human rights, equality issues or diversity among members of society, offending behaviour and the rehabilitation of offenders, or both, commerce, finance or administration, including public administration, civil society, trade union activity and academia, and professional dispute resolution and mediation activities.  What is clearly envisaged is a lengthy process where advertisements are put in the newspapers and people are asked to apply for the job.  Presumably, there have to be interviews.  It would be very strange if we had a fast-track procedure to appoint somebody as a chairperson who then in turn does not fast-track people for appointment as judges.  What happens then, if the Minister is proposing to make an appointment, is that he or she is prohibited from making that appointment unless a resolution approving the appointment has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  The realities of that must be borne in mind.  Months could pass before the resolutions are passed by each House.</p> <p>This is not a matter of some odds on the chairperson getting a puncture on the way to a meeting.  It is eminently foreseeable that there will be a vacancy in the office, for whatever reason.  I cannot see, and the Minister has not suggested, any reason why there should not be a provision for the temporary appointment of one of the other members of the commission to be chairperson.  I cannot understand why that is not there.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2018&amp;amp;month=10&amp;amp;day=04"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If there is a good reason it should not be there, so be it.  Let us hear it.  That could be done with a resolution of both Houses if that was necessary or done on an emergency basis without such authority on the basis that if he is appointing a current Member of the Oireachtas, the Houses have vetted that person as somebody suitable to be chairperson in the event of a vacancy.  However, I cannot see why the Minister will not accept that section 22 is confined to an officeholder and that if there is a vacancy, this officeholder will be asked to come in and be accountable for the general administration of the office at a time when he or she was not a member of the commission.  That seems like complete non-accountability.  I do not see the sense in the person who was not there when everything went wrong or when the administration fell short of what was appropriate coming in and saying he or she will be accountable but he or she knows nothing about it and that his or her predecessor should have been asked because he or she is only newly appointed.<br/><br/>Will the Minister at least agree that to make the section workable, at the very least there should be some provision in this Bill about who is chairperson for the purpose of the section rather than the chairperson for the casual purpose of absence of the meeting under section 15 for ensure the accountability system works?  It is not too much to ask that an assurance be given by the him that provision will be made in a Report Stage amendment to provide for such a casual successor to be appointed pending the appointment of a chairperson under the elaborate scheme set out in the Bill.  I do not know whether it is too late for the Minister to table amendments on Committee Stage but it could be stuck in at the end very easily.  We are making steady and relentless progress with the passage of this Bill.  I would like an assurance from the Minister that the office of chairperson of the commission will not stand vacant without anybody occupying it or being appointed to occupy it pending compliance with the statutory procedure.  The Minister said there would be a speedy resolution.  I hope there would be and I have no reason to doubt the Minister's word on that but it is clear that section 15(3)(<i>b</i>) envisages some other member of the commission acting as chairperson of a meeting where the position of chairperson is vacant and it is equally clear that this section does not envisage anybody functioning in that position as regards accountability to the Oireachtas in the event of such a vacancy.  I cannot see any reason we should not have an assurance that this will be addressed either by a later amendment on Committee Stage or a Report Stage amendment.  </p></speech>

We have heard scenarios mentioned that have little basis in reality when we speak about the sudden departure, resignation and incapacity of the chairperson during the months of July or August and the consequent parliamentary gridlock that will ensue with the non-availability of the chairperson to attend.  We are merely talking about a standard provision involving the accountability of the chairperson to an Oireachtas committee.  In respect of there being no chairperson in August, I have not seen too many Seanad committees requesting people to come in during August.  It most unlikely that this will happen.</p> <p>The chairperson giving an account of the general administration of the commission is no more than what we are requesting in this provision.  In the event of the departure of the chairperson, there is provision in law for his or her replacement.  There is a good reason there is no provision for attendance with regard to either presiding over meetings or attending Oireachtas committees on the part of a vice chairperson or designated officer because of the requirement to have a lay majority.  Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; would not be too pleased if the chairperson of the commission said he or she was not attending but was making provision for another lay member or one of the judges to go before a D&aacute;il committee.  It is entirely appropriate that the chairperson should be the person on whose shoulders responsibility for these issues lies.  I do not accept that the commission will be rendered inactive because of something that might happen in August following the sudden resignation of a chairperson.  Ample provision allowing for an obligation on the part of the Public Appointments Service to fill the vacancy, have a chairperson and let him or her come in and deal with the Committee of Public Accounts as far as expenditure is concerned under section 21 is enshrined in the Bill as well las the accountability of the chairperson to other Oireachtas committees that may from time to time be required or deemed appropriate.  </p></speech>

There is no reason on God's earth why there should not be a provision in this Bill saying that where there is a vacancy for the position of chairperson, the Minister may, pending the conduct of an appointment procedure under the previous section, appoint one of the other members of the commission to act as chairperson.  I cannot see any reason why this could not be included.  The Minister then trails this utterly irrelevant scenario that the chairperson would avail of such an arrangement to say he or she will not go before an Oireachtas committee but would instead send somebody else.</p> <p>Section 22 clearly states that the chairperson must do this but if the Minister had statutory power to appoint somebody to be the chairperson in the event of the position standing vacant, this issue would not arise.  Maybe there is some unseen agreement in government that it cannot be conceded that one line of this is wrong and that one amendment is appropriate and, therefore, a blindingly obvious provision, namely, that in the event of the death, resignation or removal of the chairperson, the Minister may appoint somebody to act as chairperson pending the filling of the position in accordance with sections 12 and 14, cannot be accepted.  I cannot see what is wrong with such a provision.  The Minister is stubbornly stonewalling us on this.  He is saying that there is no problem.  What is the problem with providing that if the position of chairperson is vacant, the Minister may select from among those people even if he wanted it to be a layperson?  I am not trying to sneak in the Chief Justice by the back door.  Even if the Minister wanted it to be from among the laity, God help us-----</p></speech>

The purpose of the section is to give authority to the Minister to advance to the judicial appointments commission, if and when it is established, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, such amounts as the Minister of Justice and Equality may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, determine for the purposes of expenditure by the commission in the performance of its functions.  Subsection (2) states this section is in addition to any provision made by the Act with regard to the provision of funding for a particular purpose.  I will come to subsection 2 in due course.  It is very important that the House should know precisely what it is doing by authorising this section to be part of the Bill.  What we are doing is assenting to a major haemorrhage on the public Exchequer to fund what, in my strong view, is a totally redundant body.</p></speech>

In general terms it has functioned well and decent and proper people have been appointed to be judges.  Those who were unsuitable have been detected as applicants and have not been recommended.  Successive Governments have, since the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, appointed men and women to the Judiciary who have served the country well.</p></speech>

I note the commission is to have a much more elaborate structure.  It is to have an office and a director.  It is important in those circumstances that the Minister spell out in great detail what the annual cost of this proposed new quango is to be.</p><p>If we start at the beginning, what remuneration is to be paid to all the lay members of this body and how is it to be calculated?  Are they to be paid <i>per diem</i>, per annum or on some other basis?  Are they to be paid a fixed or variable amount and are they to be allowed expenses?  It is important that we start at the top with the chairperson and move on to all the other lay members of this commission and ask the Minister, because he would have been required by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to set out his estimate as to how this will, if brought in to effect-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2018-10-04a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2018100400002#AA00300"><p>That is another question.  He would have been required by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to set out how much money would be involved.</p> <p>Then we come to the question of how many staff it is assumed that this commission will have.  It is to have a director and an office, and unless that is a complete sham, presumably the director is going to be directing people, and there are going to be people who are officers of the commission, seconded or otherwise from the public service, but we will have to see.  How much money is to be spent per annum on the remuneration of the director and the various employees of the office?</p> <p>For that reason, I ask the Minister to set out the anticipated salary rate for the director of this body.  I noted that the director's term is two five-year terms, to a maximum of ten years.  Is this to be a pensionable office or is this person to be appointed for a maximum of five years, extendible for a further term of five years, with no pension entitlements whatsoever at the end of it?  If there are no pensionable entitlements, the clear question is whether this office of director is intended in reality to be one where the duties will be executed by a person seconded from the permanent Civil Service who will in any event have a pensionable entitlement at the end of his or her service to the State.</p> <p>We come then to the number of employees.  How many officers is it intended to appoint when this commission is up and functioning in its full form?  How many officers is it envisaged will be appointed and at what levels and at what salary scales?  Will they be seconded from the Department of Justice and Equality or other public service bodies, or will they be newly-recruited?  What will the cost to the Exchequer be and what will the additional expenditure be in respect of each grade?  What will the numbers at each grade be?  Will their positions be pensionable?</p> <p>We also have to deal with the question of office rentals.  I presume, like the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, an office will be rented for the purpose of this body.  Depending on it size, I would like an estimate from the Minister as to how much money is going to be spent on office rental.  I noted, for instance, that &euro;15 million has been blown away in Baggot Street by the failure of the Department of Health to move from the salubrious surrounds of Hawkins House to the award-winning Miesian Plaza on Lower Baggot Street.  Due to industrial relations problems, that has lain idle for some considerable time.  I would like to know how much money is going to have to be spent on office rental.</p></speech>
