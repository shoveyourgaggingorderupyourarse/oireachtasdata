They are descendants of my grandfather, Gerald Fitzgerald from Clonakilty, who taught in Clonakilty Agricultural College and whose three sons worked there as well.  I am honoured that they are here today and thank them for joining us.</p> <p>I thank the Minister of State for his attendance today for this most important issue to Irish emigrants living overseas.  As the Minister is aware, on 6 March this year it was announced that the spouses and partners of critical skills employment permit holders will be able to access the Irish labour market without the need to obtain an employment permit.  This is a very welcome announcement and I applaud the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, for bringing it into being.  I am, however, completely bewildered that although this initiative can be introduced with relative ease, the partners of returning Irish emigrants have to wait months before securing an employment permit.  Surely to God if we are extending this scheme to individuals of every nationality bar none who have the relevant employment permit, we can do the same for our own.  Partners of returning Irish emigrants are waiting anything up to a year to get a work permit.  They are our own people and they currently rank below partners or spouses of non-Irish workers in terms of priority.  What kind of message does that send to the Irish emigrant community about how welcome they are to return home?</p> <p>As the Minister of State knows, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade commissioned and published the Indecon economic report on addressing challenges faced by returning Irish emigrants in February 2018.  A key challenge identified within the report was the inability of partners of returning emigrants to obtain work permits.  According to the same report, in 2017, 529 spouses or partners of returning emigrants applied for work permits and the average processing time was almost six months.  The report, published over a year ago now, especially recommends at a very minimum the introduction of a pre-clearance system for applications in order to speed up both information and decisions.  This is the least we can expect, but I would ask the Minister of State to go further.  Why not allow all spouses and partners of returning emigrants an automatic entitlement to work and get rid of the permit requirement, as the Minister of State has done for critical skills employment permit holders?</p> <p>As the Minister of State is aware, we lost the Irish E3 visa allocation of 5,000 by a single vote in the US Senate before Christmas, after getting unanimous consent in the House of Representatives.  The Irish E3 is a surplus visa that the Australians do not take up.  We are in the process of reintroducing it in the US Senate and House very shortly and are hopeful of being successful this time around.  Significantly, spouses of these E3 visa holders will automatically receive work authorisation in the United States.  If this is passed, Ireland will reciprocate by allowing US citizens and their spouses work authorisation here.</p> <p>Irish citizens with their spouses are now returning to Ireland after the terrible recession we had over ten years ago.  They are returning with new skills and some with a non-Irish spouse.  These spouses cannot get work authorisation.  That is wrong.  We cannot be hypocrites in this.  We are talking about 572 people married to or in a partnership with Irish citizens.  According to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in 2018 almost 9,000 people were in receipt of the critical skills employment permit.  All of the spouses and partners of those people and future applicants for the permit have now effectively been given an amnesty to work in this country.  We must treat our returning emigrants equally.  I urge the Minister of State to at least implement the recommendations of the Indecon report.  Better still, he should afford partners or spouses of returning emigrants the same rights and opportunities that have been extended to over 9,000 spouses and partners of non-Irish citizens.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to address the position on the spouses and partners of returning Irish emigrants and their access to the labour market.  Broadly speaking, spouses and civil partners and de facto partners of Irish nationals have broad access to the Irish labour market.  For persons in a marriage or civil partnership, entry to the State and immediate registration with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, and the Garda National Immigration Bureau is possible and these people are granted a stamp 4 immigration permission.  Stamp 4 permission holders can work without the need for an employment permit, or indeed can set up their own business.  Feedback from the NGO sector has indicated that this is quick and clear to navigate and is inexpensive.</p><p>For non-visa required persons, the non-EEA spouse or civil partner can be issued with an entry permission on arrival in the State and will generally have a short period of a few weeks to wait for the stamp 4 permission.  It is worth noting Ireland's policy to allow de facto partners to apply for residency permission, recognising the changing nature of relationships and family make-up.  The decision of INIS to facilitate such applications is progressive and sets it apart from many other jurisdictions.  Currently, a non-EEA de facto partner of an Irish emigrant must make a written application to INIS for assessment, which is subject to a processing time of approximately six months, as the Senator has said.  When a positive decision is made, the non-EEA person is entitled to a stamp 4 immigration permission that will allow him or her to work in Ireland without need for an employment permit.</p><p>My officials are aware of the Indecon report on returning emigrants,<b></b>its recommendations, and the challenges faced by this group of people as they return to Ireland, which have been articulated well by Senator Lawless.  The Department and officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service have ongoing engagement with stakeholders and are working on proposals that will streamline the process for spouses, civil partners and de facto partners of returning Irish emigrants.  The aim of these proposals will be to deliver significant customer improvement gains in terms of the time taken to assess applications and in providing greater clarity to applicants at an early stage before travel commitments are made.  It is hoped to deliver this under the INIS service improvement plan 2018-20, and this will assist in streamlining the various schemes that permit non-EEA nationals enter and reside in the State.</p><p>I have taken note of the other points the Senator has made and will bring them to the attention of the Minister and the officials in the Department.</p></speech>

I am delighted that he is striving to streamline the process.  We have to stop putting obstacles in the path of our returning emigrants.  They did the State an incredible service when they left ten years ago.  Some 250,000 people left and thank God most of them are coming back, which is great to see.  We need them back but they are returning with new skills, and their partners also bring new skills, and obstacles or barriers should not be put in front of them.</p> <p>I ask the Minister of State to ensure this will be done as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The Minister and his officials in the Department are very aware of the challenges which many returning Irish emigrants face and are actively addressing the removal of the barriers the Senator has described, where possible.  It is expect that the revised arrangement will make a significant contribution to the delivery of the Government's diaspora policy.</p></speech>

This morning I met a lady, who is in the Gallery, who lost a wing mirror to a deer some time ago near the home of my colleague, Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP at Gortroe.  There are pinch points in the Ballydowney- Gortroe area, where deer wander from the national park across to good grazing land.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Coghlan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=1881"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1881&amp;amp;pid=PaulCoghlan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is concern that deer numbers are increasing.  I hope the Minister of State can give me a breakdown of the numbers of the native Kerry red deer and the imported Japanese sika species.  We have had a few hundred of them in the Killarney area for a hundred years or more.  We badly need some fencing along part of the road from Killarney to Killorglin, though not along its entirety because a wall runs along a good stretch of it.  The fencing on the walkway route is pretty good.  However, there are points where there is no fencing.  The deer come onto the land between the walkway and the roadway and they are free to cross the road.  They are very much tempted to do so.</p><p>Some of the accidents have been serious.  I have not heard of anyone being killed, thanks be to God, but I have heard of a lot of damage to vehicles, including in a case I heard about this morning.  I am looking forward to hearing the Minister of State speak about the management plan.  I know there is a new regional manager, whom I look forward to meeting.  I believe he is very good on the question of deer and he has already initiated a cull of a hundred or more.  A cull is necessary in managing the deer.  I am a member of the Kerry Deer Society.  We are interested in the conservation of the Kerry red deer, though not so much the sika.  The sika are often more difficult to locate.  They are smaller animals.  I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State.  I may have a question or two for him afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-02a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040200002#D00200"><p>On behalf of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, I thank the Senator for the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  Before I begin, the Minister has asked me to address the fire on Torc Mountain in the Killarney National Park over the weekend.  I would like to put on official record our thanks to the Kerry fire and rescue service, the staff of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, rangers in Killarney, the regional manager and all the volunteers who came to our assistance on Friday evening and Saturday morning and worked tirelessly through Friday night to put the fire out.  Preliminary mapping by NPWS staff has shown that in excess of 70 ha, that is, 175 acres, of priority habitat has been extensively damaged by this fire.  There has also been a severe localised impact on flora and fauna.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation and the NPWS will be following up with authorities, including the Kerry fire and rescue service, to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the blaze.</p> <p>In respect of the Commencement debate to hand, the Department recognises that deer form an important part of wildlife on State lands such as Wicklow Mountains National Park and Killarney National Park.  It should be noted, however, that while the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department licenses the hunting of deer, the Department does not own the deer population.  They are wild animals.  As deer species are increasing in range and numbers, there is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure that deer populations occupying the same land resources are managed at sustainable levels and in a responsible and ethical manner.  Killarney holds a special place among our national parks as far as deer population and management are concerned.  Killarney National Park contains the largest concentration of red deer, Ireland's only native large mammal, as well as large numbers of non-native sika deer, as the Senator has pointed out.</p> <p>With regard to Killarney National Park in particular, Senator Coghlan will be aware that as part of its regular ongoing management operations the Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands where appropriate.  A number of surveys, censuses and reports on the deer population have been conducted in recent years, including a comprehensive survey and report in the winter of 2016 on the distribution, population density and population structure of red deer and sika deer in Killarney National Park.  This was followed by further censuses in spring 2017 and winter 2018.  The results of the most recent census of late 2018 are being finalised.  Preliminary reported results indicate that the population density of red deer is in the region of 11.31 per sq. km, with a population of about 896 red deer.  The sika population density is in the region of 6.71 per sq. km, with a population of roughly 532.  Certain management issues, such as the need for culling, arise as a result of the increase in the deer population.</p> <p>Deer also have the potential to impact significantly on woodlands, including the iconic yew, oak and other wet woodlands within the park, for example, by stripping the bark of mature trees and preventing regeneration.  Therefore, where deer species are increasing in range and number, depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused to habitats by deer, culls need to be carried out to ensure deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.  More than 120 deer were culled between 2015 and 2017 and more than 120 deer were culled in 2018.  The 2019 cull of deer has commenced.  Some 210 deer have been culled so far.  The aim is to finish culling in April 2019 with approximately 250 altogether to be taken for humane and management reasons.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As deer culling has proven to be an emotive topic in the past few years, the proposed course of action is decided upon following consultation with NPWS professional staff, including scientific input as required.  Shooting of deer in the park is carried out only by NPWS professional staff members, who are fully trained, competent, expert and licensed in the use of firearms.  The selection of deer to be shot is in accordance with normal deer management protocols.  The deer are shot humanely by qualified NPWS marksmen.  The remains are processed and disposed of in full compliance with the applicable Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine guidelines, and with the involvement, as appropriate, of departmental officials.</p><p>As indicated above, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht does not own the deer population.  Deer are wild animals and they roam freely throughout the countryside.  The control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners.  Wild deer in the State are protected under the Wildlife Acts, but there is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to the last day of February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  Landowners may also apply to the Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case-by-case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.  Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p><p>The Senator will also be aware of the issue of fencing, which has sometimes been raised with regard to deer management in Killarney National Park.  There are no plans to fence the national park.  Fencing it would not be a viable solution and would not achieve the desired results for a number of reasons.  First, the presence of deer is not confined to the national parks and, consequently, fencing these properties would serve no practical purpose in wild deer control or management.  Deer, albeit larger, are like other wild animals in this country and it is not part of the remit of the Department, nor would it be generally possible, to cordon them onto specific areas of land.</p><p>Second, the park is more than 10,000 ha in size, including some rugged terrain.  Fencing this area would be an enormous task that is unlikely to result in the desired objective.  Third, sika deer are capable of going under fencing that is eight inches off the ground, while red deer are capable of knocking down fences.  Finally, the erection of a fence this size could also impact on the sensitive habitats within the park.</p></speech>

It was very unfortunate that such an area was destroyed and that insect life, hares and ground-nesting birds were wiped out.  Hopefully, officials will find out how the fire happened and where it started.</p> <p>The Minister of State said the deer was a wild animal, but I referred to deer that were born in the national park and live within the park but encroach on its environs.  I appreciate that it would be impossible to fence in the national park.  Much of it is high-walled but there are some select points where deer fencing would bring results and prevent them from wandering out.  Some of the existing fencing is good but there are gaps and, on the western demesne alone, some 200 deer wander daily from the park onto the Castlemaine Hotel grounds and the Killarney golf courses of Killeen and Mahony's Point.  I ask the Minister of State to consider fencing at certain pinch points, especially at Ballydowney and, even more so, Gortroe.  I appreciate that only rangers can shoot deer within the park in season and it would be totally irresponsible to license anybody else to do so when so many members of the public wander freely around.</p></speech>

Deer management is a complex and multifaceted process.  There is a significant challenge in attempting to balance the demands of agriculture, forestry and conservation with the need to ensure the deer population, occupying the same land resources, are managed at sustainable levels and in a responsible and ethical manner.

It is timely that he is taking this Commencement matter on World Autism Awareness Day and I thank him for coming into the House.</p> <p>This morning, I joined a group of approximately 40 parents and grandparents in Crumlin, Dublin 12.  We have been campaigning for quite a long time for extensions to the services provided for their children.  Many of them do not have any services for their children and are relying on home tuition, which is not ideal.  If they were lucky, some of them were offered places located miles away in the expectation that a five year old child would take a bus to Maynooth and back again.  That is just not feasible.  We need to act urgently in this regard.</p> <p>In terms of this Commencement matter, schools are under a statutory obligation to provide education appropriate to students' needs and ensure the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability, are identified and provided for.  That is a statutory obligation on our Government and on the Minister.  We know also that there are guidelines for primary and post-primary schools.  However, the challenge remains in terms of resourcing and equipping our teachers to deliver on the many expectations placed on them.</p> <p>One primary teacher I spoke to recently is passionate and dedicated to her role but in her four years of teacher training she was given the bare minimum to deal with pupils with additional needs.  The story is replicated when we look at the situation around individual education plans, IEPs, for teenagers with Down's syndrome.  The teachers unions - the ASTI and the TUI - advised members recently to stop providing these critical planning processes for children with additional educational needs due to resource issues.  IEPs are vital to ensure a positive learning environment for students with Down's syndrome but teachers and, more importantly, the young people themselves are caught in the middle between expectations without adequate support.</p> <p>It is essential and a no-brainer that our children should have a dynamic, adaptable and inclusive schooling environment that is mindful of their needs.  What exactly is the current training offered to teachers?  How do we know it is sufficient to meet the needs of our children?  How is it evaluated or monitored?</p> <p>Several teachers spoke bravely and in depth about the pressures they feel in managing their large class sizes with so many individual needs.  How do we intend to ensure that teachers' mental health and well-being is monitored within this context of improving responses to additional needs and mainstream education?</p> <p>The Minister of State knows that there are autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units but they are not adequate.  They are excellent when they operate well but our objective would be to move children on to mainstream schooling and have them included and not excluded.  The loud, clear and proud chant from the parents this morning was education, not discrimination.  It is the education system we need to focus on, one that will equip, enable and support teachers to provide for the individual needs of their pupils in their large classes.  That includes those with autism.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-02a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040200002#F00500"><p>On behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, who sends his regrets, I thank the Senator for raising this matter and for her sincere interest in this very important subject.</p> <p>Inclusive education is a fundamental principle of our education and training system.  This principle is put into practice in the policies of the Department and the Teaching Council.  That is clearly articulated, for example, in the quality frameworks for primary and post-primary schools, which is entitled Looking at Our School, 2016.  These frameworks provide a comprehensive picture of quality teaching and learning and quality leadership and management to schools and teachers.</p> <p>Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes in Ireland that lead to registration must have professional accreditation from the Teaching Council.  The mandatory requirements for accreditation are set out in the Teaching Council's criteria and guidelines for programme providers, which were published in June 2011 and revised in March 2017.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy David Stanton:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=1053"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1053&amp;amp;pid=DavidStanton&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Under these criteria, student teachers in all accredited programmes are required to undertake study of inclusive education, including special education, and this applies to all primary and post-primary teachers.  In 2017, the Department published guidelines for primary and post-primary schools supporting students with special educational needs, which provide guidance to schools on the use, organisation and deployment of additional teaching resources for students with special educational needs.  In addition to developing and reviewing their whole school policies on the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs, schools should be proactive in providing continuing professional development, CPD, for their teachers.  The support service of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support for teachers working with students with special educational needs.  Moreover, all the Department's support services, such as the professional development service for teachers, are required by the Department to have regard to the individual needs of all learners, in designing and delivering CPD for teachers.</p><p>The Department's policy on school setting is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided, unless such a placement would not be in their best interest or in the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Most children with additional needs attend mainstream classes but some require the environment of a special class or special school.  This decision is based on a recommendation contained within a professional assessment in consultation with the NCSE.  Through its network of special education needs organisers, the NCSE is responsible for the development, delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with special educational needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements.  Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school placement, they should update their local organiser to inform the planning process.</p><p>The Teaching Council is in the process of reviewing and redrafting its criteria and standards for initial teacher education programmes at primary and post-primary level.  The new edition of the policy draws on research findings, including recommendations and implications cited in a commissioned research report on school placement.</p></speech>

Will he or the relevant officials email me with an update on it and on when it will happen?  It is an urgent matter.  The Department should examine the waiting lists and the desperation of parents because the current teacher training is inadequate and is not fit for purpose for the number of children whom teachers are being asked to teach and take responsibility for.  We know that mainstreaming in school is the best option and outcome for children.</p> <p>Later in the D&aacute;il, a Sinn F&eacute;in motion on autism empowerment strategy is to be debated.  While it is a detailed motion, the crux of it is that we are calling for an all-party Oireachtas committee on autism to be set up in the immediate term and for it to be tasked with developing and publishing a comprehensive autism empowerment strategy within six months.  I ask all colleagues to support the motion.  In the meantime, we cannot allow children to be offered placements miles away from their home.  They need to remain in their communities rather than being isolated or alienated from them, because they will be the communities' next leaders.  The children's families, including their grannies and their support network, will live in those communities and the children will determine how their communities progress, but they will not be able to do so when their childhood takes place away from where they grow up.</p></speech>

A range of in-service professional development supports has been provided to teachers by the Department since March 2017.  The NCSE support service has a remit to develop schools' capacity to include students with special educational needs and to promote a continuum of inclusive and responsive education provision.  In addition, as the Senator will be aware, the Department provides funding support for teachers to expand their capacity through courses at the Middletown Centre for Autism and through funded postgraduate qualification provision at a number of higher education institutions for teachers involved in learning support and special education.  I agree with the Senator that pupils with special needs should stay in their own communities as much as possible, and I note her point.</p></speech>

Most of them are women who took time out to look after and rear their children.</p><p>I understand that a review is under way in relation to the post-budget 2012 band rates.  While I welcome the review, I am disappointed to learn that as of 8 March 2019, only 4,254 reviews have been completed out of a total of almost 90,000.  That is less than 4%.  It is disappointing to learn of such slow progress.  Fianna F&aacute;il has pushed the Government hard to address the anomaly in the contributory State pension scheme which resulted in people losing out financially.  These changes have resulted in thousands of people losing out on entitlements they thought they would get in their full State pension.  While the good news is that the review is under way, progress is disappointingly slow.  I appreciate fully that there is a significant job of work to do here.  I also acknowledge that some additional staff recruitment has taken place in the Department to carry out the review.  However, notwithstanding the fact that the commitment to undertake the review was made 15 months ago in 2018, only 4% of the 90,000 reviews are complete.  That is very disappointing.</p><p>As I said earlier, people, most of whom are women, have lost out financially due to the measures adopted by the Government in 2012.  They have lost a great deal of money for no other reason than that they took time out to rear their children.  The additional delay adds to what they have lost already and is very disappointing for many.  Many people have contacted me to express their disappointment and, indeed, anger at the continuing delay.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, can tell me today how the review is progressing, when he expects it to be completed and when people can expect to receive renewed payments in the form of increases in the State contributory pension.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-02a.39" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040200002#H00200"><p>I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this important matter and for his continued interest in the area.  Since late September 2018, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has been examining the social insurance records of approximately 90,000 pensioners who were born on or after 1 September 1946 and who have a reduced rate State pension contributory entitlement based on the post-budget 2012 rate bands.  These payments are being reviewed under a new total contributions approach to pension calculation, which includes provision for home-caring periods.  The reviews commenced on 13 February 2019, the day after the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, signed the regulations required, together with provisions in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018, to permit the increased payments to be made.  As of 28 March 2019, 11,646 reviews have been completed.  Of these, over 8,850 have resulted in an increased payment for the pensioners concerned.  Pensioners who did not qualify for an increase in payments will continue to receive their existing weekly rate.  As such, nobody will lose out as a result of this review.</p> <p>The Minister has stated from the outset that it will take a number of months to complete all the reviews due to the numbers involved and the individual nature of social insurance records.  In some cases, it is necessary to engage in correspondence with a pensioner in order to clarify contribution histories and periods of caring and work.  To date, over 34,000 requests for information have issued to pensioners.  In order to process these reviews, 121 temporary staff members have been recruited to the Department's offices in the north west.  Regardless of when a review is conducted, the person's rate of payment will be adjusted without delay where an increase in payment is due and arrears will be issued, backdated to 30 March 2018 or the pensioner's 66th birthday, if later.  Where a person's rate does not increase following a review, the person will continue to receive their existing rate of payment.  Given the scale of the work, which involves 90,000 pensioners, the fact that each case requires close individual examination and that some cases are more complex than others, it is not be reasonable to expect all reviews to be processed immediately.  While this work will take a number of months to complete, it will continue until all pensioners have been notified of the outcomes of their reviews in writing.  The Minister urges anyone who has yet to provide additional requested information to the Department to do so as soon as possible so that his or her review can be processed.</p></speech>

I welcome that some progress has been made with an increase on the 4,254 figure I gave to 11,646.  I welcome also and accept that 121 temporary staff members have been recruited to tackle this job.

Some 34,000 people have been written to and he is anxious that they would respond, if they have not done so already.  Where a pensioner is awarded an increase, it will be backdated to 30 March 2018 or the person's 66th birthday, if later than that, and arrears will be paid, which is important.</p> <p>Following the Government decision in 2018, work began on the significant system changes and legislative requirements to cater for new measures.  A system change was delivered in November 2018 and January 2019, in time for reviews to commence from 13 February 2019.  Reviews began the day after the Minister signed the necessary regulations, which together with the provisions in the Social Welfare Pensions and Registration Act 2018 allowed the increase in payments to be made.  In September 2018, work began on identifying people to be reviewed and examining social insurance records of those born on or after 1 September 1946 who have a reduced contributory pension element.  Because of this work, not all of those reviewed will need to provide additional information, which makes the process as easy as possible.  </p> <p>The Minister said that the first payments would be made in the first quarter of 2019.  This has been achieved and work on reviews will continue until all the reviews that have been completed over the coming months.</p></speech>

Vulture funds or investment funds are coming to Ireland and purchasing new homes <i>en bloc</i>.  We have learned that 282 properties under construction in Citywest have been put up for sale <i>en masse</i>to appeal to these large funds.  This is not the only deal that has been packaged in this way.  Last month an investment company snapped up 118 family homes in north County Dublin in a single transaction with a builder.  Other jurisdictions, for example New Zealand, have brought in measures to curb foreign investors from coming in and depriving first-time buyers of the chance to purchase affordable homes.  Jacinda Ardern's Government banned foreigners from purchasing properties in New Zealand, with the exception of Australians, to make it easier for Kiwis to buy homes and to stop speculative investment.  Germany is considering whether landlords with more than 3,000 units should be banned from operating in the cities.  These are radical proposals but I believe we have to do something to stop investment funds from coming in and acting in this way.  They are depriving young couples and young families of the opportunity to purchase homes.  It is a relatively recent phenomenon.</p><p>The second issue I wish to raise is the fact that today is Autism Awareness Day.  Autism affects one in every 65 people in Ireland.  It is not a disease, and it cannot be cured.  I would like to put on record my support for the Dublin 12 campaign for autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and inclusion.  There is a serious lack of services for our children and adults with autism in Dublin 12.  I am working with one mother of a non-verbal seven year old who is trying to get her child into a full-time school placement.  She has been doing this despite making many appeals to the Department of Education and Skills, in which she has been successful.  However, there is still no place available for this child.  She is one of many mothers in Dublin 12 who is fighting for a place for her child in a school with an ASD unit or in a special needs-type school.  There is a serious lack of placements for children with autism in the Dublin 12 catchment area.  Today, along with my colleague, Senator Devine, I joined the Dublin 12 group in Crumlin village in an effort to create awareness of the group and the absolute lack of placements and facilities for these children.  I ask that the Minister for Health would meet this group to discuss the lack of services, an ASD unit and a special school for children in Dublin 12.</p></speech>

After all, they are our electorate and it is only right and proper that we would represent them.</p><p>Since 2014, when I first mentioned the terms and conditions of employment for county councillors in this country, they have had promise after promise of improved conditions.  They have an allowance, which is now regarded as income.  They are paying tax and PRSI on an allowance, which baffles me to some degree.  It took a High Court action to force the Government into changing the class of PRSI that applies to local authority representatives and incidentally, I am sorry to the heart that I did not push the same High Court case the whole way to cover Members of this House in order that we would not be paying class K PRSI, for it is absolutely criminal to be taking 4% of our income off us with no benefit whatsoever to accrue to anybody in this House.  That is just wrong in every sense of the word.</p><p>We are finding ourselves that some 20% of our local authority members will not run for re-election.  We are losing young, innovative and highly motivated people, purely because of the amount of work that is involved in the job and their inability to see themselves properly rewarded for the amount of time and effort they put into their jobs.  It is absolutely disgraceful that we are coming into the next election and they do not have their terms and conditions properly set out so that they know what they are signing up for.  We are seeing a lot of senior county councillors, people who have served this country for ten, 20 or 30 years, who are walking away as well.  I know I am not alone in this House when I represent their views.  I know every Member that is elected by members of local authorities feels the same way.  It is just wrong.</p><p>On a second issue, I see that we are now deferring the local property tax for another year.  This is the most cynical move I have ever seen.</p></speech>

I wish to echo the sentiments of Senator Ardagh when she referred to Prime Minister Ardern.  She is one strong woman.  She has shown the world that it is possible to react urgently to the needs of people, in this case with the gun safety in her country because her paramount position and job description is to protect the people of the nation.  She is one strong woman and I am very proud that she is leading the way.</p> <p>I wanted to bring up a few matters.  First, we need a debate on vaccines throughout the world.  We know they are in decline and the herd immunisation has also declined and therefore we have seen the alarming rise of what we thought we had eradicated, namely, measles and mumps.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator M&aacute;ire Devine:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2468"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2468&amp;amp;pid=MaireDevine&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Measles and mumps are present in this country.  South Dublin has a particular problem with schools being closed, etc.  We saw authorities in New York closing cr&egrave;ches and schools to children who are not vaccinated.  I am pro-vaccination and pro-science and I will stand over that, but I simply do not know or have not thought enough about what we do for children who are not vaccinated.  Do we go down that road?  Is that unconstitutional?  A debate on that would be very much welcomed and is really needed.  We need to stick with science and with how we manage illnesses when they arise.  We must keep the herd protection that is so badly needed.</p><p>Another point I wanted to bring up relates to the Psychiatric Nurses Association.  The ambulance personnel are again out today, in particular those from the depot on Davitt Road.  They are looking to next week again and are reconsidering 24-hour stoppages.  At the moment there are 12-hour strikes.</p><p>They are my colleagues and I suppose I have a bias and a particular interest, but the HSE is refusing to deduct their union subscriptions.  The HSE is refusing to engage or negotiate and is ignoring them.  A hefty amount of PNA ambulance personnel are part of the National Ambulance Service Representative Association.  Like me, they want the Minister to end this now and to instruct the HSE to sit down under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission to engage and sort this out.  Everyone deserves and is entitled to the right to join a union or trade representative of his or her choice.</p><p>The third thing I wish to discuss - Senator Ardagh has raised this as well &ndash; is the Dublin 12 parent support group in Crumlin.  We decided to use today, Autism Awareness Day, to raise awareness in the village of Crumlin because places, classes and units there for children are non-existent.  The waiting lists are waiting lists of years, and that is too late for the children.  I have been to many of the meetings and I see new parents arriving all the time.  They are looking for support but they leave in shock, unfortunately.  I try to ease them into it gently but they do not realise the dearth of education classes that should be there.  The resounding vocal words this morning were "Educate, do not discriminate."  Five year olds are being offered places but they have to be put on a bus.  They have to manage and navigate the journey on their own to Maynooth and back again in a day.  That is simply not feasible.  Parents are resorting to home tuition, which is approximately an hour to two hours each week.  Isolation and alienation are not the way to be inclusive in our communities.  I tabled a Commencement motion this morning and I hope the Minister will take forward my views, fast-track more units and enable and instruct schools to open those units.</p></speech>

I note that it is more than 16 months since we took the Bill on Second Stage on 22 November 2017.  It is unfortunate that we have seen such a long delay at a time when there has been such unseemly haste to rush the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill through.  I am also disappointed that we saw at such late notice, and after our leaders meeting last week, the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill reappearing on this week's schedule on Thursday afternoon.  I know that is for another day but I want to put the point on the record.</p> <p>Might we make provision over the coming week or so for a debate on Brexit?  I know we have had many opportunities to do so but clearly the issue is changing daily.  More and more depressing news comes from Britain.  We are seeing, apparently, a catastrophic cliff-edge approach being taken in Westminster with the prospect of a no-deal scenario becoming more likely.  Those of us watching it from this jurisdiction feel immense and increasing helplessness.  We wish we could do something to avert the course of these votes that are constantly against any prospective resolution.  It was particularly frustrating to see such narrow margins last night in the House of Commons votes.  I know this point has been made elsewhere by other legislators and Members of the Oireachtas, but it is shocking that we have a party in this jurisdiction that holds seven seats in Westminster.  It could have made a major difference and would have enabled the passage of the Ken Clarke amendment that would see Britain stay within a customs union.  It was lost by three votes last night.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know Sinn F&eacute;in has its own reasons but if there was ever a time to leave that aside in the face of an existential crisis for this country and for those living in Northern Ireland as well as for our neighbours in Britain, if there was ever a time to take up seats, it would make such a significant difference.

No one can say it would not have made a difference.  No one can say that if people had been there to represent voices from Northern Ireland that are not being heard at Westminster at present, it might not have made all the difference to those in the Labour Party, my own sister party, who are shamefully failing to achieve a compromise to stop a no-deal Brexit from happening.  We are on a cliff edge with this.  It is devastating to see our nearest neighbours in such a catastrophic state.  That there are people who could have done something and did not will be seen as really terrible in times to come.</p><p>I commend Mary McAleese for her comments on Friday.  I was privileged to chair an event at which she spoke on Friday evening at the Law Society in Blackhall Place for the <i>Hibernian Law Journal</i>.  She spoke so powerfully and movingly of her experience growing up in Belfast in the Ardoyne and her fears for the return of a hard border.  No one listening to that could fail to be moved or to wish to do anything possible to avert the no-deal catastrophe that is so chillingly coming our way.</p><p>Today marks 100 years since the appointment of Constance Markievicz as Minister for Labour.  She was the first woman Minister in our Government and in any western European country.  Although her appointment was historic and must be commemorated today, unfortunately it took another 60 years before a second woman was appointed to Cabinet.  That was M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn in 1979.  In 2019, we still have only ever had 19 individual woman serve as Cabinet Ministers.  I am using today to call upon the Government to do more to promote the achievements and successes of women in politics, to encourage more women to enter and participate in politics and to commit to including more women in Cabinet.  They could have done so this time but the Government did not.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, chose not to appoint more women to Cabinet.  In marking the centenary of Countess Markievicz's achievement, it would be well worth seeking to ensure we have more women in Government positions in future.</p></speech>

It is also Autism Awareness Week.  I attended a coffee morning this morning with D&oacute;chas in Limerick.  I met many children and their families.  There was a talk going on and it was a really interesting morning.  It was great to get an insight and to hear first-hand from families and from a campaigner who has been 14 years fighting for children with autism and special needs.  It really was a very informative morning.  While some people know some of the issues facing some of the children and their families, it is very important to go out and engage with people and get first-hand experience.</p> <p>The Minister of State with responsibility for local government published the plans for the proposed directly elected mayors.  Nobody is forcing anything on anybody.  It is going to be a plebiscite held in Cork, Limerick city and county, and Waterford city and county.  It is very important that clear information be sent out to people.  As a former Mayor of Limerick I am a big supporter of the idea.  I think it is the right way to go.  When we look at other European countries, they have leaders, but it is very important that we get this right if we are to get the information out there.  As well as a leaflet going out to all the voters, it is important for the Department to hold public information meetings where people will have the opportunity to have their questions answered.  Several people have contacted me with questions and reservations.  We have to put clear information out there.  Sometimes things do not go through.

While people are not totally against the service <i>per se</i>, they have serious concerns about the lack of consultation and believe this was basically foisted upon them without any debate or forewarning.  The measure, unfortunately, will affect the elderly and the most vulnerable in our society, many of whom look forward to attending these services in their local facilities daily.  While I say they are not totally against this, they are disappointed that no consultation has taken place.  Some of the most vulnerable, including those with disabilities, will find that &euro;4 per day to be a financial burden.  The last thing we want is that these people would not be in a financial position to attend the services.<br/><br/>I ask the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister to see if a measure could be introduced to help the most vulnerable and those suffering financial hardship so they are free to attend the services as they do currently.</p></speech>

Today, we have got great solidarity from Emmanuel Macron, who said he will never abandon Ireland or the Irish people, no matter what happens.  This sends out a powerful signal to Brexiteers who think Europe will be divided.  The Taoiseach rightly said that we are open to a credible plan from Westminster that has a clear purpose.  The next few days will tell a story of where we are going but it is very concerning that the UK Parliament still has not taken control of an extremely difficult situation, which has caused huge confusion and unnecessary work and commitment over the last two and a half years.  I hope that comes to fruition.</p> <p>Last year, we had a very eventful moment in Clones when the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, attended the Ulster final between Fermanagh and Donegal.  I felt that was a momentous event.  It was well appreciated by the crowd and sent out a signal that times are changing.  There is a soccer club in Fermanagh, Ballinamallard United, which plays in the Irish league and is located only a few miles north of Enniskillen.  The club has got to its first cup final in 138 years, which will be played in Windsor Park against Crusaders.  This could be another wonderful moment for people from a nationalist point of view, in that we could attend and show our solidarity.  I live in Sligo and know Ballinamallard United is a very close friend of Sligo Rovers.  Indeed, Tom Elliot, who was the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and was an Ulster Unionist MP, is chairman of Ballinamallard United.  We should send out our good regards to our near neighbours for that cup final, which takes place in early May.  There could be a huge opportunity for people to show their solidarity with a small club in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Many students are staying in hostel dormitory rooms for whole semesters as a result of limited accommodation options.  Low incomes combined with the need for eight to nine-month leases are restricting their options in the rental market.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fintan Warfield:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2458"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2458&amp;amp;pid=FintanWarfield&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Some 2,876 bed spaces of purpose-built student accommodation were opened in Dublin city in 2018, almost all of which provide luxury accommodation and cater for international students.  Prices range from &euro;250 to &euro;410 a week.  It does not just have a knock-on effect on rents in the local area, it also provides political cover for the Government which is failing to provide affordable options and uses the new build figures as a sign that it is addressing targets.  I fear that the inaction to provide affordable rental options for students has started to restrict access to third level education for those who need to rent, particularly in Dublin.  The Government is continuously delaying in bringing purpose-built student accommodation within rent pressure zone legislation.  Students have been faced with huge rent hikes, particularly in Dublin and Galway.  They are to be combined with a student contribution charge of &euro;3,000, the second highest in Europe.  Students are feeling serious financial pressure.  I, therefore, ask the Leader when the Seanad will next hear statements on housing.  Will he inform the Minister of the need to discuss in that debate the issue of student accommodation, particularly luxury student accommodation?</p></speech>

What about the 16.3 million who voted to remain?  Have they no rights whatsoever?  I also point out that the United Kingdom has a population of 67 million; therefore, the figure of 17 million is not as impressive as it sounds.  Furthermore, it is being said it would be undemocratic to have a second referendum.  Those who say it do not seem to have any problem whatsoever with Prime Minister May putting her ratbag of notions about the European Union to a vote for the fourth time within a couple of weeks.  There is, apparently, nothing undemocratic about it, but having a second referendum to take the temperature of the people is undemocratic.</p> <p>Moreover, I agree with Senator Ardagh about cuckoo funds and certainly think we should take action.  I am delighted that Germany is doing so.  It is outrageous that foreign investment companies come here to buy up enormous blocks and prevent young people from getting a foot on the property ladder.  I also strongly support the No Consent, No Sale Bill 2019 brought forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  It is excellent and, of course, it should be done.  Foreign vulture funds come here to buy up enormous numbers of debts from the banks that were saved by the ordinary people of Ireland after their disgraceful behaviour, in which they are still engaged.  We are now allowing the people to be treated like slaves.  Their homes are being sold over their heads.  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the wonderful Irish Republic, by which we stand and in which we see these things happening without much by the way of protest.</p></speech>

It is now 21 months since this House unanimously passed a Bill dealing with the need for a national autism strategy.  To say we are disappointed that there has been no movement on the Bill and that I fail to understand why it has not reached D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is an understatement.  Many people suffer as a consequence of the condition and their families struggle bravely to help to bring their children into the world in a meaningful way.  They struggle with communication and the behavioural issues that stem from it.  Last week I was delighted to attend the opening of a fine new facility by Remember Us in Balbriggan last.  The group provides a home not just for children with autism but also for those with any disability.  I commend Ms Jean Fitzpatrick and Ms Nora Roban who are the main forces on the committee.  I refer also to Snowflakes Autism Support in Swords which provides great services, the Irish Society for Autism and many others.

We all attend other meetings.  Last week, figures for homelessness rose above the 10,000 mark.  According to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, 6,480 adults and 3,784 children were living in emergency accommodation in February.  These figures included 1,707 families.  The Minister said he was disappointed but disappointment is when something happens outside a person's control and it is not an appropriate response to what is an incredible rise in figures.  The Minister should be mad and outraged and he should be finding solutions.</p> <p>Rebuilding Ireland is not working, something I see in my own area of Carlow where homelessness is on the rise.  Day in and day out, my heart breaks when I have another poor soul come to my office, broken, in tears and overwhelmed with disappointment because he or she has been passed over for a social house.  I cannot tell such people why they were passed over because I do not know.  There is no clear system for the public to know why or when a person will get their social house.  When there is no system, there is no hope.</p> <p>Last month, the United Nations condemned Ireland for what it called the financialisation of housing, accusing this Government of allowing multinational vulture funds to force tenants out of their own homes and to manipulate the market by buying up massive amounts of property at low cost and flipping them or charging hugely inflated rents.  The report highlighted preferential tax laws and the weak tenant protections in our country, which I have raised in the Seanad and at committee meetings.  On Monday, a Social Justice Ireland report stated that over 6,000 Irish people are living in substandard accommodation, which is unacceptable.</p> <p>I ask the Leader to detail to this House what his response was to the letter he received from Leilani Farha, the UN special rapporteur, on the right to adequate housing.  We were one of five countries to receive this letter and I understand she did not hold back on her criticism.  I agree with her that we have no monitoring and no accountability mechanism.  There is no transparency and no system to understand.  In the end, the Government is failing.</p></speech>

Many of us have had New Zealand in our minds recently because of the appalling outrage of the murder of 50 people at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre.  It is appropriate to remember Ireland's affinity with New Zealand, on account of the emigration of our people to that country and similarities between the two countries in agriculture and the food industry.  I learned recently that there are 600,000 people of Irish ancestry in that country, with 18,000 relocating from Ireland between 2011 and 2015 during the worst of the recession.</p> <p>Perhaps because of that close affinity, I felt all the more shocked to hear of the case of an Irish family, the Suhinthan family, and its experience with the New Zealand authorities.  Their mother, Nilani, is an IT consultant and the father a computer engineer.  Unfortunately for Ireland, Nilani was headhunted for a high-paying job in New Zealand and the family decided to move there, as was their right.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->She moved to Auckland in September on an interim visa and the intention was that the rest of the family would follow later.  Preparing for that move has cost them approximately &euro;15,000 to date.  The New Zealand authorities issued residency permits to her, her husband and two of her three daughters but they were refused a permit for their third daughter, Bumikka, who is 15.  Shockingly, the reason for this seems to be that she has Down's syndrome.  As a result, the New Zealand authorities have told the family that she does not have &quot;an acceptable standard of health&quot; and that this would place demands on the health and education systems there.  The family have made it clear that they do not expect the New Zealand state to fund any special health treatment or educational supports for their daughter and they have offered to fund that themselves but their appeal was refused in recent days and they are now in limbo with their family separated.<br/><br/>I accept, and I am sure the Leader would agree, that each country has the right to regulate its own immigration laws as it sees fit but, on the other hand, this is a situation where we have to ask what it says about a society that would welcome a highly-skilled couple with open arms and two of that couple's daughters but turn away their third daughter purely because she has Down's syndrome.<br/><br/>The New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, in her speech at the Christchurch commemoration recently, stated:</p><blockquote>Racism exists, but it is not welcome here.  Assaults on faith and religion are not welcome here.  Extremism in all its forms is not welcome here.</blockquote><p>Listening to her speak and learning of the Suhinthan family's case, I am wondering if she could have added, &quot;A child with Down's syndrome is not welcome here&quot;.<br/><br/>Does the Leader agree that the turning away of an Irish child from the borders of a country on such grounds is truly reprehensible and is not reflective of a tolerant society, if that is the reason?  Can we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in the House to see whether the Government has examined this issue closely and whether it has anything to say or do in what must be a very upsetting situation for the Suhinthan family?<br/><br/>That is the information I have based on the facts as best I know them and have received them.  It is a truly disturbing situation if it is as I have said.  I would be delighted to be reassured if there is any positive development in that case or if I have misunderstood any aspect of it but, sadly, on the basis of all the reports I have read, I do not believe that I have.  It is a disturbing situation.</p></speech>

I was in an area in recent days where I was told by residents that a three bedroom semi-detached house has been vacant for seven years.  The owner owns of a number of other properties and it is now not profitable for that person to let the house.  I do not understand the reason for that but that person is not paying any additional tax by leaving the house vacant.  At the same time, he or she is not losing any money because the value continues to increase.  The issue of how we deal with vacant properties needs to be examined.  Some properties are vacant for genuine reasons - people may be in nursing homes or whatever - but in respect of a large number of them, people are waiting for property prices to rise.</p> <p>Allowing companies to come in and buy large lots of apartments needs to change.  That policy needs to be examined because at the time of the change of Government in 2011 personal borrowing amounted to more than &euro;200 billion.  That figure is now down to &euro;150 billion.  In fact, the amount of personal savings exceeds the amount of personal borrowing.  There is no excuse for allowing large companies to have a free-for-all in respect of acquiring properties because they can outbid everyone else.  That should be looked at with a view to a change in the regulation and in the legislation.</p> <p>I keep making the point that there is a cohort of people who do not qualify for local authority loans or to borrow from banks and who will continue to have to rent.  They need security of tenure and the only way of doing that is to create a system of 20-year leases, with a five-year rent review and the tenants being responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the apartment or the house.  We need to move on that and it is something we should examine.</p> <p>I welcome the decision by Cl&uacute;id and Cork City Council to buy 75 completed apartments in the past week.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Colm Burke:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2353"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2353&amp;amp;pid=ColmBurke&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a welcome development on Bachelor's Quay in Cork city.

John was a sincere, genuine and committed Oireachtas Member who gave Trojan service to the people of County Carlow and in the Houses.  On my own behalf and on behalf of Fine Gael, I express our sympathies to his family.  His son, Fergal, is a former Senator and I will pay tribute to him in due course.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam d&iacute;lis.</p> <p>I thank the 13 Senators who contributed to the Order of Business.  Senators Ardagh, Colm Burke and Conway-Walsh raised the issue of vulture funds and the appearance by officials from the Department of Finance at today's meeting of the finance committee.  I note that Senator Conway-Walsh did not refer to the contributions of Mario Draghi or Professor Lane in respect of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, which would incur a cost for mortgage holders due to higher mortgage costs and the higher mortgage interest that would accrue.  I am sure we all would agree with the sentiments expressed about vulture funds, the need to keep people in their homes, and the number of people who are able to remain in and buy property.  As Senator Colm Burke noted, we need to reduce the volume of borrowing.  Deposits in banks are currently greater than borrowings, and it is important that we consider long-term leasing, such as for terms of 20 years, which is common in other countries, as Senator Colm Burke has previously outlined.  I would be happy if that debate was taken in the House.  </p> <p>The words of Professor Lane in respect of the Bill before the committee that Senator Conway-Walsh mentioned are important.  The Bill would serve little purpose and undermine the banking system, for all its faults.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has become a major source of worry for all of us.  We must listen to what Mr. Draghi said about the costs and selling on performing loans, but I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House for a debate on the matter.</p><p>Senators Ardagh, Devine, Reilly and Conway-Walsh raised the important matter of World Autism Day which is part of our national autism week.  It is disappointing that the Bill proposed by Senator Reilly has not come back to the House.  It is about having a national strategy and ensuring we join the dots to have a whole-of-Government, interdepartmental approach to autism that places children and adults with autism front and centre.  The Bill proposed by Senator Reilly is reasonable and far-reaching and it seeks to place an onus on Government to engage on a cross-departmental basis and revert.  Equally, the Sinn F&eacute;in Party has a D&aacute;il motion tonight on which we all agree.  To be fair, Senator Reilly has been the forerunner, first as Minister and now in the House.  It is unacceptable that there has been an inordinate delay in the current Minister coming back with a response.  I would be happy to have him come to the House to discuss the matter with us.  During this autism awareness week, it is important to understand that we have not completed the jigsaw regarding the provision of services and supports for people with autism and their families.  That includes respite and other services.  I am as disappointed and as critical as other Members on some of the lack of action by Government.  I commend the D12 campaign for its proactivity in the matter.</p><p>Senator Craughwell raised a number of issues in his earnest and interesting contribution.  There is no rush by any local authority to increase property tax rates in tandem with Government.</p></speech>

I finished a book at the weekend on Cork in the 1980s.  It included an interesting piece on an advisor to Jack Lynch who warned him against the abolition of rates in 1977.  Look at what happened as a consequence.  We have a responsibility to pay for services and cannot just be populist about everything.</p></speech>

It is important to put matters in perspective.  The Minister for Finance is undertaking a process.  Let us allow that process to conclude.</p> <p>The Senator raised also the issue of pay for councillors and their services.  I agree with him fully and it is not because we are on the same panel and are trying to look after our constituents as Members of this House; on the contrary.  Local government is a very important part of our democracy and I have always made the point that councillors should be full time and paid a proper salary.   The Moorhead review is imminent, albeit I am not sure it will be published before or after the local elections.  It will address the issues of pay, conditions and supports for councillors.  I agree with Senator Craughwell that issues of pay and their power are very frustrating for councillors at local government level.  Their role has expanded with the introduction of municipal districts in some cases and bigger, longer and wider electoral areas.  It is a matter we need to address.  I have just returned from Kiev where the presidential election took place at the weekend.  Strangely enough, the one thing people over there did not mind doing was paying for their democracy and putting local and central government supports in place.  It is something we need a stronger voice on in the Oireachtas.  We can all go down the road of populism with regard to pay and conditions, but it is important to pay councillors a just and fair salary and to get rid of the caper of running around the country to attend conferences and whatever.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The other point made by Senators Craughwell and Byrne is that I welcome the publication today by the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, on directly elected mayors with executive functions.  It is important we support the plebiscite to give for the first time in this country directly elected mayors an opportunity to stand for office.  It is an innovative and transformative potential for local government.  I look forward to having the debate in this Chamber but also across the designated cities that are going to have mayors.  I am aware that Senator Byrne has been very forceful and strong in Limerick.  It is important and incumbent upon Government to travel to the cities in question, to have public meetings and information campaigns in the cities of Cork, Galway, Waterford or Limerick to inform people of the potential benefit accruing to a city from directly elected mayors.  I apologise, as Galway is not on this list.</p><p>Senator Devine also raised the issue of vaccination.  It is important that we remember Laura Brennan who was a champion.</p></speech>

Let us have union representation for members of the ambulance service who want to join NASRA.  Let them have membership of that union so that there can be dealings with both unions.  I do not see any issue with that.  I support the need for members to be involved and to have participation in a union.  It is equally incumbent on the HSE to engage with NASRA and end this back-and-forth for once and for all.</p> <p>Senator Bacik raised the issue of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2017.  I apologise to the House that it may be discommoded on Thursday.  It is a matter for the House to decide its business, as Senator Boyhan would say if he were here.  When the Minister becomes available, we will schedule this Bill.  The information came to us on Friday.  I put this Bill on the schedule, and it is up to Members to accept the Order of Business or not.  I appreciate that there are people who have a view on this Bill.</p> <p>The Judicial Council Bill is a priority for the Minister.  It has taken a length of time to get to where we are today.  In that time a great amount of engagement has been ongoing between the Judiciary, with regard to proposed amendments to legislation, with the Office of the Attorney General, and with the Department of Justice and Equality, which has resulted in the Bill coming back to us today with a number of amendments to it.  It is also important that we recognise that it is legislation the Government wants to prioritise.  Many of the amendments relate to the provision of sentencing guidelines, the need for which was referenced in the Second Stage debate here in the Seanad.</p> <p>It is my intention as Leader of the House to have the Bill come before the House today and, if it is not finished tonight, to have it back next week and to devote as much time as we can to it on behalf of the Government.  I would be happy to work with the Senator in this regard.  I understand the frustration that Members have on Bills not coming back.  Sometimes some of the Bills - I am not saying this one - are unconstitutional or flawed and need to be fixed, but I take the point the Senator has made.</p> <p>Today it is a significant day to remember and recognise Countess Markievicz and we congratulate all women who serve in the Oireachtas and as Ministers.  Senator Bacik is correct in that there are far too many women who have been appointed as Cabinet Ministers-----</p></speech>

It may be more expeditious to table a Commencement matter because I do not have the information to hand.</p> <p>I join Senator Feighan and other Members on the issue of Brexit and the frustration relating to it.  Senator Bacik also raised it.  It is a worrying and deeply frustrating time.  We are lucky that, today, our Taoiseach is in Paris where he has met President Macron, who has again committed to standing with Ireland and to not abandoning the Irish people.  The Taoiseach's remarks were very interesting when he said that Europe should be open to a credible solution and proposals from Prime Minister May.  I hope that the British Government will realise that there is no good Brexit and that a hard Brexit will be catastrophic for Ireland, England and the European Union.

The Minister will come to the House to debate the matter.  I will not get into a political debate with the Senator on it because we all accept that there is more to be done.  Again, Senator Murnane O'Connor fails to recognise the highest ever housing budget, with more people leaving homelessness than going into it.  It is important to recognise that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State at the same Department, Deputy English, have travelled the country and met local authorities.  They have increased the rate of home building and put in place the highest ever housing budget.

It was in the news last December.  I agree with the Senator that it seems very insensitive of the New Zealand Government to turn away people because of disability, but as the Senator knows, it has an A4.10 form which stipulates very strict protocols about entry into New Zealand.  It has strong rules and regulations regarding immigration.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That country has very strong rules and regulations for immigration.  One of the questions on that form deals with the issue of imposing significant costs to New Zealand's health system.  I do not agree with them, by the way, in the same way that I completely disagree with the Senator's comments last week here about conversion therapy, for which he should apologise to the House.</p></speech>

In section 2 of the Bill before us, the Government is amending section 16 of the 2000 Act and my amendment No. 1 is a further amendment to that section.  It relates specifically to an amendment of subsection (6) of section 16 which sets out the various scientific factors that may be considered in the context of the designation of particular places as natural heritage areas worthy of conservation.  There is a wide list of scientific factors that are included in the 2000 Act but that Act, by virtue of the time of its introduction, predates some of the key and most pressing scientific and environmental concerns that we have today.  Most notably the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 in section 6 (6) does not include the key issue of carbon sequestration.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I may table amendments on Report Stage on the wider set of climate change impacts, but I have tried to be specific by focusing on carbon sequestration.  In the past 90 years a considerable body of relevant scientific information that looks to the role of our forests, bogs and other spaces in sequestering carbon and helping to reduce carbon emissions has been built up.  That is a fundamental matter.  This is about ensuring that the section dealing with scientific factors in the 2000 Act is up to date.  I do not believe it can be up to date if it does not include a consideration of the environmental impact of having carbon sequestered in our bogs and the role they play.  I could cite at length the various statistics, and there may be a chance at a later stage to look to those, in terms of the role carbon sequestration plays, but I wanted to highlight that factor in the first instance.</p><p>I have mentioned on previous occasions, and I know that the Minister of State understands my point, that we face twin crises at the moment.  There is a crisis in terms of climate change and in respect of biodiversity and the collapse of ecosystems.  An abundance of scientific information has come to light on these topics.  We are told that 40% or more of our pollinators may be under threat and may die.  The University of Stanford in particular has produced large-scale research on this area.  Bees have become so scarce that they are transferred from one side of a country to another to help with harvests.  When we spoke about these issues during the debate on the Heritage Bill recently, I emphasised that it takes multiple visits, sometimes up to 20, from a pollinator for horticultural produce such as apples to develop fully.  Pollinators have a key role, which has been recognised by the Government in the national pollinator plan.  That plan, however, must be given recognition and substance.  We have to be consistent.  If we have a national pollinator plan and are looking at scientific issues in respect of special areas of natural heritage or environmental considerations, we must give effect to it.</p><p>Amendment No. 1 seeks to ensure that the environmental factors that are taken into account in the consideration of bogland when it comes to its designation or its environmental benefits include its role in carbon sequestration or in respect of pollination.  Amendment No. 5 follows through on the same theme.  While I recognise that there are positive aspects to the Bill, one of my primary concerns is that there are entirely different criteria set out concerning the designation and de-designation of a bogland as an area of national heritage.  I will return to that in subsequent amendments, but it seems extraordinary that we would have entirely different criteria being applied to designating and de-designating areas of national heritage.  To designate an area, section 16(6), which is the part of the Bill dealing with scientific environmental impacts, is referred to.</p><p>I am trying to double down on this.  If my first amendment is not successful in including the role of carbon sequestration and pollination directly into section 16(6), I have taken those two factors and included them using the next amendment so that the Bill would include at that point consideration of "contribution towards the achievement of climate change targets or goals within the National Pollinator Plan" and "national, regional and local economic, social and cultural needs" in the designation of a national heritage area.  I think it is clear in the drafting, but I want to emphasise that the provision does not state that all of these factors are required.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It simply means that these are all factors that might contribute to the Minister of State's decision to designate a natural heritage area.  Again I commend him and I recognise that he proposes to designate some 25 areas of public land in respect of national heritage areas but this would effectively future-proof the legislation and ensure it is truly responsive to the wide range of considerations that should be brought onboard.</p><p>I refer to amendment No. 7 on page 4, line 11.  This is about bog habitats ceasing to be designated.  My concern is that while section 16(6) may be incomplete, it includes key scientific measures in respect of environment.  That is referenced in relation to designating a natural heritage area.  However, in the decision to de-designate natural heritage areas, which I spoke about on Second Stage, that is the headline issue and that is what we are seeing in the papers.  Section 16(6) is ostentatiously missing.  It is a real concern if those scientific factors, evidences, concerns and environmental considerations that are looked at when deciding to create an area of natural heritage are not also considered when de-designation is being considered.  If it is being considered to take something out of natural heritage protection, surely the same factors and criteria need to be addressed.  Instead, environmental criteria are referred to and a definition of environmental criteria is produced later in the Bill, which is quite different to those factors outlined in section 16(6) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000.  There is a concern here as it is an inconsistency.  In legislation, an inconsistency is a concern, as well as those areas of omission such as climate change and pollinators that I mentioned.  I hope the Minister of State can address that point somewhat.  We will come back to it in some subsequent amendments but amendment No. 7 is just another quite blunt proposal to do that.  I reserve the right to bring section 16(6) directly into the proposed section 18A(3)(b)(ii) and I may do that on Report Stage.  In the meantime, I have put in the phrase, &ldquo;and contribution towards achievement of climate change targets or goals within the National Pollinator Plan&rdquo;.  I have held back on bringing section 16(6) directly into the de-designation because I wanted to hear the Minister of State's rationale for that decision.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the benefits of the restoration of peatlands, its benefits for Ireland's commitments under our international climate change targets and to them functioning.  Peatlands capture carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation.  The National Raised Bog Special Areas of Conservation Management Plan 2017-2022, approved by the Government and published in December 2017, sets out how raised bog special areas of conservation are to be managed, conserved and restored and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed.  The national restoration programme for Ireland's raised bog special area of conservation and national heritage area is contained within this plan.  It is intended to restore all designated raised bogs within three cycles with the first cycle operating for the duration of the management plan.  As provided for in the Bill, the primary focus of any review of bog habitats would be nature conservation in terms of maintaining bog habitats at, or restoring bog habitats to, a favourable conservation status.  Restoration of bog habitats through the blocking of surface water drains by the insertion of peat or plastic dams, with the accompanying benefits regarding climate change targets and carbon storage will be a key element of the process.  However, I am also conscious of the balance within the Bill between the needs to protect the environment, living up to our EU obligations and working with landowners and turf cutters.  While I will not be accepting the Senator's amendments, I will consider the matter further, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to bringing forward amendments on Report Stage, which take account of the issues raised.  I understand where the Senator is coming from.  I assure her that we will look at the language of her amendments in bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage.</p> <p>The All-Ireland Pollinator Plan 2015-2020 includes a strategy to address pollinator decline and protect pollination services on the island of Ireland.  Its recommendations will be taken into account in developing any necessary regulations.  Therefore, I do not see the need to include any of the amendments on the pollinator plan in this regard and I will not be accepting those amendments.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 1 is probably the most comprehensive and represents the preferable way to move forward in terms of engaging with section 16(6) of the 2000 Act.  I will not press it now but I wish to put a number of specific points to the Minister of State.  I appreciate and welcome his comments on the national restoration plan and specifically what he outlined on re-wetting.  These are very positive measures and the conservation plans will, of course, have climate benefits as well as habitat benefits.  My amendments are not so much concerned with what happens after a designation but are related to the process of designation.  They reference the decision to designate an area.  I recognise, for example, that 25 areas of public land are being designated, which is very welcome.  There may be scientific, environmental and other considerations that mean that some other lands also need to be designated.  I will not go into some of the social considerations, of which I am very aware.  The Minister of State will be aware that I have tabled a number of amendments on issues like fuel poverty and turbary rights, which I absolutely respect.  However, this particular amendment is concerned with the kind of standards we apply to designation or de-designation.  I ask the Minister of State to clarify his thoughts on section 16(6) of the 2000 Act and the application of that to designation but not to de-designation.  I appreciate the Minister of State's engagement on these matters.</p></speech>

On the one hand, we have the concerns of local communities about what are often small areas of land and their designation.  Communities may wish to remove small contentious areas of land from the designation because in their view, it will not impact on the overall status of the larger NHA.  On the other hand, we need to protect the maximum amount of NHAs and bogland in recognition of the role they play in carbon sequestration, as the Senator rightly pointed out.  Functioning peatlands capture or sequester carbon from the atmosphere and store it in the form of peat and vegetation.  They have a very important and positive role to play in mitigating climate change by enabling the storage of carbon.  A balance must be struck between the need to remove what are, in many cases, very small areas on the one hand and the need to designate what are, in most cases, larger areas.  One would not designate an area the size of this Chamber, for example, but one may wish to de-designate an area of that size for some specific purpose or role.  The process of de-designation is simpler and the standards would be lower.  However, there is still a process that must be gone through which is based on scientific advice.  Obviously, we will have a wider debate on section 16(6) of the 2000 Act in the context of some of Senator Higgins's later amendments.</p></speech>

Perhaps this could be addressed on Report Stage by way of amendments from me or from the Minister of State, whereby size limits could be set on the spaces that can be de-designated.  That may be a way of tackling this issue.  I am very aware of the issues involved here.  My own family comes from the Galway-Mayo border area and I have family members who have turbary rights.  I know that in many cases, the holdings affected are very small but it is important, where we have considerations, that there is consistency.  There may be ways to expedite the process but the same set of considerations must apply.  I will reserve the right to table an amendment on Report Stage and am happy to engage with the Minister of State in the meantime.  I believe that section 16(6) of the Act of 2000 is the area where this should be addressed.</p></speech>

I could list all of the species affected but will not do so.  However, it is very important that the national pollinator plan be factored into the equation here.  I know that the plan exists but we are in a crisis situation in terms of our pollinators.  When we spoke about these issues three years ago, the beekeepers of Ireland sounded the alarm bells.  We know now that we have the equivalent of foot and mouth disease in our bee population.  I have been contacted by beekeepers who do really crucial work.  They have told me that they are burning down hives in the midlands because a number of different factors are affecting the health of bees.  These essential pollinators are having to travel greater distances because the range of plant life around them is diminishing.  This is not just about the bees but about all of us, as we know.  I once attempted to put the national pollinator plan on a statutory footing.

I am moving this group of amendments on behalf of my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, who cannot be here today.  Her amendments all aim to limit the scope of the proposed review in order to better protect our natural bog habitats from being de-designated as NHAs.  We are opposed to any regressive steps to de-designate these bogs due to their important role as our largest natural carbon sinks and the massive part they will play in helping Ireland to meet its climate action targets under various international and EU climate agreements.  These bogs are resources of incredible natural, historical, environmental and cultural value and any review of their special recognised status as such should be approached with the greatest caution, care and respect for their environmental role in contributing to the Irish efforts on climate change, an approach which is sadly lacking in this Bill.  </p><p>Amendment No. 2 seeks to remove section 18A(1)(b) which opens up raised and blanket bogs to potential de-designation while amendments Nos. 3 and 4 would limit the scope of the proposed review by only allowing it to apply to raised bogs and excluding blanket bogs from the process.  Amendment No. 21 would also remove blanket bogs from the review process while amendment No. 25 makes a consequential amendment to the Title of the Bill, making it clear that the review would only apply to raised bogs.  I hope the Minister of State will give these amendments favourable consideration.</p></speech>

The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016, as initiated, has been amended in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and now provides for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, at his or her discretion, to conduct a review or reviews of the blanket bog NHA network as well as to continue and complete the 2014 review of the raised bog NHA network.  The Bill now gives the Minister the power to conduct a review or reviews of the blanket bog NHAs at some point in the future without obliging the Minister to do so.  Such a review of blanket bog NHAs would not be done in a vacuum.  It would involve public consultation and would not necessarily lead to proposals for the de-designation of blanket bog NHA sites.  There are principles and criteria in the Bill to guide a Minister in conducting a review and in making decisions, such as the carrying out of a strategic environmental assessment, public consultation and linking the achievement of nature conservation objectives for blanket bog habitats to the favourable conservation status of these habitats.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As provided for in the Bill, at the heart of any future review will be nature conservation in maintaining blanket bog habitats at, or restoring bog habitats to, a favourable conservation status.</p><p>I do not share the views of the Senators on the blanket bog natural heritage area network.

There has been a substantial 12 year consultation process involving a large number of factors and conversations on raised bogs.  It is not that it is inconsistent, but perhaps, with due respect, it is irresponsible, having had a 12 year process in respect of raised bogs, with long consultations and processes, to then simply throw in blanket bogs.  I know that the Minister of State spoke about the matter on Second Stage.  He said it had been discussed on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il when I know the proposals were made.  However, proposals being made on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il is not the same as engaging in public consultation or having a considered review with stakeholders.  It is not the same as monitoring work.  In no way does a brief Committee Stage discussion in which the inclusion of blanket bogs was proposed and rejected by the Minister run parallel with a12 year consultation process in respect of raised bogs.  I am not saying we need a 12 year consultation process, but we need a consultation process.  Frankly, it would be irresponsible to allow blanket bogs to be included without having one.</p> <p>We really will be pressing and fighting this.  Even those who are advocates of some of the proposals made in respect of raised bogs are rightly concerned about the inclusion of blanket bogs which form a different kind of environment, about which they have other environmental concerns.  We know that blanket bogs are crucial, not only for carbon sequestration.  I will be bringing forward several proposals if blanket bogs stay within the Bill.  They are also crucial as flood plains and for water retention.  They are crucial in dealing with some of the impacts of climate change.  We talked about the mitigation role they can play in carbon sequestration, but there is also a major adaptation role for them as they are particular environments.  The work has not been done to include blanket bogs in this legislation, to which they do not belong.  It is like adding apples on top of oranges.  If they are different, they require the application of different considerations and thoughts.  We simply cannot add in another thing at the end.  This is too serious and important a process for that to happen.</p> <p>We recognise the integral keystone habitat among Ireland's native flora and fauna.  A total of 49% of all endangered species are to be found in peatlands.  The Minister of State mentioned some of the later processes - we will come to this issue when we come to the environmental criteria to be considered - but they are really not adequate.  The environmental criteria to be considered in the potential de-designation of blanket bogs include the conservation value of a blanket bog, taking into account a comparison made between its area, range, habitat, structure, function and ecological features and those of one or more blanket bogs elsewhere.  We are saying we are definitely going to de-designate some blanket bogs and that it will be a question of the weakest link in determining which one is for the chop.  That is what is set out as the environmental criterion and it is deeply inadequate.  At least in the case of raised bogs there is reference to range, habitat, structure, function and ecological features.  I still believe it is inadequate, but at least they get a mention.  With blanket bogs, it is a question of picking the least favoured and deciding that is the one to be de-designated.  </p> <p>I know that many other parties represented in the House are supporting the Bill overall, but I hope they will engage with us and at least consider the removal of blanket bogs.  The work has not been done in advance and it has not been done in this legislation.  Senator Grace O&rsquo;Sullivan has made proposals for the removal of blanket bogs.  I may come with a different approach to the removal of blanket bogs, but I am keen to indicate that it really is a problem.  I urge the Minister of State to revise and reconsider the matter, perhaps in subsequent legalisation designed more for this purpose and with an appropriate range of criteria relevant to engagin in public consultation on blanket bogs.  That might be a better approach to take to the inclusion of blanket bogs.</p></speech>

It might have been mentioned in the media and in the ether, but the consultation period has not been 12 years.  The consultation process followed the 2014 national heritage area review.  The Senator is right in the sense that there has been engagement or that discussion has been ongoing for a long period.  It was rather problematic and difficult and caused much public concern.  There was engagement with officials in the National Parks and Wildlife Service, while there were some difficult situations in respect of turf cutting, as the Senator would have seen in the media.  To be honest, the approach taken was not ideal, but the level of engagement increased and led to the review that took place which Senator Higgins supported in how it was enacted.</p> <p>The approach taken stems from a recommendation made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.  Any earlier proposal arising from a review would have been subject to a strategic environmental assessment and public consultation before the Minister would have been able to formally propose new sites for designation or designate or partially designate blanket bogs as natural heritage areas.  It is envisaged that any review of the blanket bog NHA network will take place in the context of the development of a management system for blanket bogs.  Consultation with local stakeholders will be required in advance of scientific fieldwork taking place on special area of conservation sites.</p> <p>The review of NHA status for raised bogs was part of the process of relocation.  The recommendation in respect of the de-designation of parts of larger bogs impacted on the most or those that offered the least benefit to the conservation of the overall habitat of a given bog was made with a view to protecting the majority of it.  The idea was to try to relocate people from certain areas to bogs with less favourable status.  Any review of the NHA status of blanket bogs will involve a similar approach.  I cannot predict what will happen when the experts carry out reviews, but I anticipate a similar approach being taken.  There are areas of blanket bogs that have been degraded greatly by active turf cutting.  There are other areas that have been impacted on less and still others that have been untouched.  There may be areas that have not been designated but could be as part of a review.  Again, we need to look at State lands, as we did in NHA designations.  It would all be part of a process in looking at special areas of conservation.  The Bill does not allow for de-designation of SACs, but in a review of SAC blanket bogs that we will be obliged to undertake by the European Commission we will look at the overall package of blanket bogs, including those which have been designated as natural heritage areas.  It is not as if anything would happen overnight.  It would happen as part of a review of SAC blanket bogs.  It would include NHAs and certain areas that have been overworked, as well as those that have been impacted on less or those that have not been impacted on at all.</p></speech>

They are referenced in the Bill and are required by Europe, but they are in a different category and do not relate to this.  Our concern is those blanket bogs that are not protected by SAC status or all of the various requirements and caveats that come with that.</p> <p>While the Minister of State has spoken about what might be anticipated or expected or what he might think might be considered, that is not in the Bill.  That is the concern.  There may be a number of factors that may be anticipated for consideration, but they are not in the Bill.  Blanket bogs have been included alongside raised bogs which have already undergone those good processes that the Minister of State has spoken about.  I recognise that there are areas that are very degraded.  Again, that is one area where we need to take care.</p> <p>We also want to ensure that we do not set up an incentive for the degradation of areas.  While I am aware that it was not always managed well and that repair work has been done in the past two to three years in rebuilding relationships, actions were taken in that period such as, for example, key heritage areas being largely cut.  Was it on 21 June in one year that a large-scale cutting in a quite symbolic area took place?  We do not want in any way to create a dynamic whereby there is a sense that there is any reward for the degradation of heritage areas.  That is why having all of these other considerations, like the track record and what the environment has been like over a period, would mean that it would not simply be a case that if there were to be degradation of an area this year, it would be more likely to get de-designated in a year's time.  There needs to be a continuum of work and a joined-up impact assessment that looks at the bigger picture.</p> <p>With due respect to the Minister of State, those factors that are there for SACs because they are obliged to be there for a SACs are not present in the Bill at the moment.  I support all of Senator O'Sullivan amendments and I will not presume to press them without allowing her an opportunity to engage with them further on Report Stage.  I urge the Minister of State to consider whether it may be a more expeditious and appropriate strategy to look at dealing with blanket bogs separately.  He may end up with a blueprint that is useful and usable.  We are not ready to add them in at the moment.</p></speech>

There are no immediate plans.  A lot of expertise has been gathered over the recent period on methodology and process as to raised bogs, which would be transferred to any review of blanket bogs.  The Senator has mentioned 12 years and I have mentioned four to five years of consultation.  How we have done that and what we have learned from that will be transposed to how we deal with any reviews that we are obliged to do on SACs, but it will also encompass natural heritage areas, NHAs, as part of the overall package.  I have met officials on this, and what we have seen with blanket bogs is that they are not all the same.  There are areas that are more degraded and other areas that are relatively pristine.  We want to transfer the knowledge that we have gleaned from the review of the raised bogs to dealing with the blanket bogs.  I have been very cognisant of our obligations under European legislation and the fact that, as we are aware, there is a critical role in climate mitigation within which bogs have a very special place.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh spoke last week about the special place that they have in parts of Connemara and elsewhere, an important role in climate change which we all appreciate.</p> <p>Where the debate five or six years ago was all about designations and the perception that big bad Europe was trying to force us to do this, the debate in the future about bogs will be about the very important role they play in carbon sequestration and mitigating against climate change.  This is where the debate is going.  Anything that is being done on blanket bogs will be mirrored by what we have done on raised bogs in the same process and procedure.</p></speech>

I attempted to table amendments that reflected the issues mentioned around turbary rights, fuel poverty, and just transition.  I had the opportunity to sit on the Committee on Climate Action, substituting for Senator O'Sullivan, and we discussed those issues.  There are issues there and I had hoped that there might be potential for a review to look at all those issues on a legal basis.  This involves co-operation with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but any amendments in this regard were ruled out of order for now.  The Minister of State is right in that there is a package of issues to be considered.  The human sustainability is both social as well as environmental.</p></speech>

They cover very much the ground we have spoken about previously.  Although the Minister of State has addressed many of the specific environmental issues, and I thank him for his engagement on that, the specific issue of an openness to considering section 16(6) of the 2000 Act and the scientific factors set out in respect of the environment and merely updating them is one issue and the other issue is that amendment No. 6 specifically seeks to ensure that those same scientific factors would be considered regarding dedesignation as well as designation, a point I outlined previously.</p><p>Amendment No. 20 is consistent in that respect.  It is an attempt to address the problem with the environmental criteria, which we discussed previously.  There are different factors - habitat, structure and function.  The Minister of State is correct in that it is the same provision in respect of raised bogs and blanket bogs in that regard but, again, the problem is that the environmental criteria are simply a comparison between those factors in one bog and in another bog, rather than a consideration of the scientific and environmental factors on their own terms.  It almost sets up a weakest link approach in the sense of which will we go for?  Part of that process is to indicate which are most suitable or not suitable for dedesignation but they are not environmental criteria; they are, effectively, pragmatic criteria.  Environmental criteria need to include the same scientific objectives, environmental facts and points of research, data and reference set out in section 16(6) of 2000 Act.  This is the same point but it is particularly pertinent in respect of amendment No. 20 of the section.  If the Minister of State is not able to accept the proposed change to one area of the section, he might consider accepting amendment No. 20. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-02a.260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1314" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040200002#KK00300"><p>Section 16(6) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 refers to special scientific interest in the process of proposing sites for designation as natural heritage areas under the Act.  Section 16(6) is also specifically referred to in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2016 as regards the criteria to be taken into account in selecting the most suitable bog habitats to be designated as natural heritage areas.  In order that the selection process for the inclusion of sites in the reconfigured raised bog natural heritage area network adopted a sustainable approach, the selection criteria, while including the primary environmental and technical factors essential for raised bogs existence now and into the future, also include economic and social criteria.</p> <p>The environment, technical, social and economic criteria used for the raised bog natural heritage area review were given equal weighting and in all categories the highest scores were given to the most favourable sites, which are those with the best existing environmental standing, the best restoration potential, the most socially appropriate and the most economically advantageous investments.  At the same time, each site was examined by departmental staff from a nature conservation and management perspective to ensure that the final outcomes of the selection process were practical and achievable.</p> <p>I would envisage that the undertaking of future reviews of blanket bog natural heritage areas would follow a similar sustainable approach in accordance with the previsions of the Wildlife (Amendment ) Bill 2016.  That would include setting up terms of reference, environmental strategic assessment and providing for public consultation.  There is no need, therefore, to specifically refer to section 16(6) of the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 among the criteria to be taken into account as referred to in this Bill when selecting the most suitable bog habitats to cease to be designated as natural heritage areas.  These criteria are environmental criteria, restoration potential and national, regional and local economic and cultural needs.  </p> <p>Within the Bill the definition of environmental criteria has been carefully drafted and there is no need to refer to section 16(6) within it.  I will, therefore, not accept the amendments.</p> <p>I should have said earlier that I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage on the conservation of biodiversity.  In consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, I intend to table an amendment or amendments on Report Stage to a section within the Bill with respect to introducing a biodiversity duty, which would place a requirement on public bodies to embed biodiversity in carrying out their functions so as to promote the conservation of biodiversity.  </p> <p>Senators have rightly referred to the importance of biodiversity and nature conservation.  The proposed introduction of this legislation follows on from the National Biodiversity Action Plan 2017-2021 and the recent national biodiversity conference attended by the Minister, Deputy Madigan.  The plan recognises that biodiversity can only be maintained or restored by complementary actions by a wide range of sectors, as decisions and actions have a profound influence upon the natural environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-02a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040200002#KK00400"><p>I look forward to the amendments in respect of biodiversity.  They will strengthen the Bill.  The idea of a duty is important.  There is scope in a number of areas in the Bill to revise and consider duties, responsibilities and actions that may be taken consequently.  I may reserve the right to introduce an amendment in respect of that area on Report Stage.</p> <p>With due respect, the concern currently is the environmental criteria definition.  Along with blanket bogs, that is probably one of the main core concerns I would have about the Bill.  The environmental criteria currently are simply a comparator.  The section references a number of environmental words, including "range, habitat, structure, function, ecological features" but it simply states that it be a comparison between them in one bog and in another.  That is not the same as examining the scientific, environmental and other factors and data that exist.  As the Minister of State rightly described, a range of indicators were put in place in the designation processes set out in section 16(6).  We cannot simply say that, if, for example, we discover five bogs are all of pristine quality that we will go for the 100% and the 90%, and that the 80% - the graded one - needs to go, if it emerges that they are performing key functions.  There needs to be some element within the definition of environmental criteria, which is environmental rather than pragmatic, which I recognise is a concern, whereby if we have to dedesignate some, which one will we go for?  That is the core of how environmental criteria are set out currently in a Bill.  It is a matter of saying which is the best and getting rid of the worst.  Environmental criteria need to have an objective space and there needs to be some reference in that respect.  Section 16(6) fits that because it is already set out in statute by the Government.  I could invent what I believe should be included in the environmental criteria but in this case I have simply attempted to include an existing frame and definition.  I will not press amendment No. 6 at this point but I will return to this issue on Report Stage.  I urge the Minister of State to examine that environmental criteria factor between now and Report Stage.  I believe he recognises what I have said about it.  It is a case of comparing A, B and C, and A, B and C; it is not an evaluation of A, B and C or pulling together indicators in respect of A, B and C.  It is a mechanism for comparison rather than for evaluation such as would be appropriate for actual criteria.   They are criteria almost for a decision rather than for an assessment of environmental importance.  I will not press the amendment in regard to that but I urge the Minister of State to consider the definition between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

She mentioned where that notification should be provided and she has tabled amendments in that respect.  We we will debate that later and I agree with those sentiments.  This process will take place.  It will be based on what we have learned from the natural heritage bog review.  We can take a great deal from that and replicate the processes that have led to the reviews that have taken place of raised bogs.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->For the natural heritage areas raised bog review, there were different criteria, including environmental, technical and socioeconomic.

I welcome the Minister to discuss Committee Stage.  I indicate my intention to withdraw a series of amendments, including Nos. 1, 5, 12, 16, 18, 22, 25, 28, 39, 42, 52 and 54.  I am doing that because the Minister has tabled amendments which cover these issues and I do not wish to duplicate them.  I acknowledge the role of my colleagues, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire and an Seanad&oacute;ir Mac Lochlainn, in pressing the issue and advocating for sentencing guidelines to be introduced over recent years, a move which has been welcomed by many stakeholders in the area.  In accepting the amendments tabled by the Minister, I believe that we as legislators have delivered on the concept of the sentencing guidelines similar to those of other jurisdictions, which has long been sought by groups representing the victims of crime and sexual violence, such as Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and the Rape Crisis Network.</p><p>This is a landmark moment for the justice system.  I expect that, ultimately, the majority of criminal cases in this State will see a judge having to take into account sentencing guidelines for that offence in future, making it a significant move.  Far too often, we have seen victims feeling severely wronged as perpetrators of crime have been faced with inadequate and inappropriate sentencing.  Everybody agrees that the severity of a sentence must match the severity of the crime.  There are too many instances where this is not the case.  While the vast majority of judges balance the considerations well, it is our view that sentencing guidelines will tackle the issue of unsuitable sentences being handed down, and we believe that the public deserves to know that offenders will receive a sentence that fits the crime and that heinous crimes will be met with stiffer sentences.  People deserve to know that there is a basis for calculating that sentence.</p><p>I am not sure if the publishing of sentencing information has been addressed within the Minister's amendments.  I may well come back to it later and consider some further amendments on Report Stage.  I look forward to the Minister's contribution.  Sentencing information should be publicly available in the name of transparency and allowing stakeholders to scrutinise it where it is deemed to be inappropriate, whether due to a lack of or failings of existing guidelines.  I thank the Minister for working with us on this.  It is a good example of how progressive measures can be introduced with cross-party support and a collaborative approach in this House.</p></speech>

I welcome the Bill back to the Seanad and express my strong support for the move to bring draft sentencing guidelines within the council's remit, and for the creation of a new sentencing guidelines and information committee.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Ruane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2481"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2481&amp;amp;pid=LynnRuane&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This has long been called for by organisations supporting people in the criminal justice system and I would like to pay tribute to those organisations for their advocacy and for the role that the Sinn F&eacute;in Party has played in advocating for them to be included in this Bill.  Sentencing consistency is so important to maintain public confidence in our Judiciary and it really is a landmark step that we are debating it here, which is welcome.</p><p>I also welcome amendment No. 15, which will broaden out the matters in which education and training will be provided to judges on an ongoing basis by the council.  I do not propose to speak at length, only to point out that as this is the first we are seeing of the new sections on sentencing guidelines role for the council, I would like to reserve the right to bring amendments to these new sections on Report Stage, after they will presumably be added to the Bill this evening.  I would particularly like to mention the new section 75 to be added by amendment No. 77 on the sentencing guidelines, the criteria for selecting the layperson members of the sentencing committee in the new section 20 and the new provisions added by amendment No. 15 on education and training for judges, which could do with expansion.</p><p>I would also like to draw the Minister's attention to the Sentencing Council for England and Wales, which does really excellent work in this area to support the judiciary to ensure sentencing consistency and public awareness of and confidence in sentencing.  Under the UK Coroners and Justice Act 2009, the Sentencing Council for England and Wales has an analytical role where it monitors the operation and effect of its sentencing guidelines, publishes information on sentencing and practice for the information of the public and publishes information on the cost of different sentences and their relative effectiveness in preventing reoffending.  It is also great at doing public consultations with judges, magistrates, victims and witnesses and it sends all its draft guidelines out for public consultation before they are officially adopted, which is something that is really worth considering, which would really strengthen this Bill and could easily be included within the provisions of section 18.</p><p>There are also a couple of issues that I would like to put on the Minister's radar for consideration as these proposals move through the Houses.  I understand that sentencing inflation has been a problem in other countries that have introduced sentencing guidelines.  I really urge the Minister to guard against this now at the start of the process, before it becomes a problem further down the line.  Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 40 on sentencing ranges could be helpful in this regard, as could Sinn F&eacute;in's amendment No. 43, which would give the council a role in monitoring implementation of the guidelines in practice, as would amendment No. 44 on impact assessment.</p><p>I would also like to know if the Minister is considering the repeal of mandatory sentencing for most crimes as recommended by the Law Reform Commission in 2013 now that we are looking to introduce sentencing guidelines.  Mandatory sentencing is normally used in jurisdictions that do not have sentencing guidelines, so now that we are moving to introduce them, we should look to remove mandatory sentencing so judges can use their discretion in the courts with the aid of the guidelines and without their hands being tied by mandatory sentencing.</p><p>Those are just some of the issues that I am looking to progress on Report Stage.  I would appreciate the Minister's thoughts on them and I thank him again for bringing these amendments to the Bill.  They are very welcome.</p></speech>

I know it has been over 16 months since the Bill was before us on Second Stage and on that occasion I welcomed it as a long overdue Bill and a very welcome Bill.  In the context of this first group of amendments, I would also like to welcome the principle which they are based upon and which they are ushering in.  I note that Sinn F&eacute;in has withdrawn its amendments and Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has explained why.  I support the Government amendments and it is very welcome to see the detail concerning the operation of a sentencing information and guidelines committee.  This is long overdue and anyone involved in researching sentencing or in practice in the criminal courts is well aware of the many calls that have been made for the introduction of such guidelines.  This is what Tom O'Malley has referred to as a structured discretion system, rather than the current system which is so reliant on an "instinctive synthesis" in sentencing as the Law Reform Commission has said and which, therefore, on occasion has resulted in inconsistencies in sentencing practice and a lack of predictability, which is a problem for those working in the criminal justice system, for those before the criminal justice system and of course for victims as well.  I very much welcome the introduction of these amendments and of this principle of sentencing guidelines.</p> <p>I absolutely agree with Senator Ruane on mandatory sentencing.  It has been unfortunate that we have seen presumptive minimum sentences introduced in the past in respect of some serious offences.  Now that we are introducing a proper system of sentencing guidelines, there is an even stronger argument for the rejection of mandatory sentencing and for a move towards this structured discretion model that we see incorporated in other jurisdictions and that we will see in this jurisdiction too.  I very much welcome these amendments and I am glad we will not have the debate about some of them now that some have been withdrawn and the Government scheme of amendments appears well crafted.</p> <p>On a related matter, where we do need to see further amendments, which I hope to introduce on Report Stage and I give the Minister notice of this now, is to tighten up or provide more detail on the role of judges in giving guidelines and effectively drawing up model charges to juries.  I raise this now because we have seen controversy recently about a lack of judicial control in prejudicial comment made to the jury.  I am specifically talking about comments made about a victim's clothing in the context of a sex offence trial.  More generally, it would be useful for us to amend section 17 of the Bill, which currently provides for a judicial studies committee.  I know that amendment No. 15 is included but I would like to put in an amendment on Report Stage, and I ask the Minister to reflect on same, to enable the Judiciary to have information and materials distributed among it for its use and for the performance of its functions, including in respect of judges conducting criminal trials with a jury to give guidance on: trial management; jury management; directing the jury and; such other matters as may assist in the fair disposition of a case in the opinion of the committee.  It is about empowering the committee to provide for more detailed guidelines to judges along the lines of model charges to juries.  That might be a helpful additional function for the committee.  We might reflect on how that could be done.</p> <p>I certainly hope to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to that extent.  I know the judges have bench books in the Four Courts, which are centrally important to the conduct of trials, but of course they are private and unregulated documents and now that we are moving in this very welcome fashion towards a more structured system for sentencing, it would also be useful to move towards a more structured system for the giving of charges to juries in criminal trials.  We have seen so many appeals also, where critique has been made of particular charges to juries.  It is a very difficult task to give accurate, fair and impartial charges to juries in any criminal trial and we all appreciate that, but some sort of structuring of that would be useful and section 17 is probably the appropriate place to see some sort of additional power inserted to do same.</p> <p>I welcome these amendments again and I look forward to the progress of this Bill being more speedy than it has been to date so that it will come into effect and provide for this important change to our law.</p></speech>

I also welcome the amendments that are being proposed on sentencing guidelines.  Of course there is a difficult balance to be struck between the administration of justice, which is the prerogative of the Judiciary, and the independence of the Judiciary on the one hand, and the entitlement of the Legislature to have an input into the outcomes of penal policy in the State on the other hand.  The use of the judicial council as a body which generates guidelines for sentencing is both welcome and long overdue.  I remember being involved in a case where the Supreme Court had to adjudicate on a very light sentence, which might have been a suspended sentence, that was given in a rape case and the court attempted to establish some rough principles applying to the sentencing of rape cases.  Apart from that, there has been very little judicial consideration of the relative seriousness of different kinds of cases.  Therefore, it is timely that we should ask the members of the Judiciary to collectively put their minds to establishing broad guidelines for the guidance of individual judges in individual cases, bearing in mind that in every case the facts, the nature of the convicted person and the outlook for the rehabilitation of the convicted person differ.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Michael McDowell:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=719"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=719&amp;amp;pid=MichaelMcDowellPD&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Senator Bacik might prick up her ears at what I have to say about guidelines.  I am astonished at the unconscious gender bias in the imposition of sentencing.  I have noticed all my life that the Judiciary tends to take a certain view.  It might be based on the proposition that a convicted woman is less likely to reoffend than a convicted man, but it is remarkable that there is a consistent difference in the severity of sentences handed down to men and women, although perhaps it is sensible.  I do not argue that it is indefensible but it strikes one from time to time.  There are some offences I would consider serious, such as the making of a false report of rape against a man, but in the rare case when that is prosecuted to conviction, I have noticed that the Judiciary holds back from the enormity of the crime for which the conviction has taken place, namely, where an innocent person has been put on trial or through the criminal process on a knowingly false complaint, which is a serious matter.  In my own days in practice, I always noted that female shoplifters, for some of whom I appeared and some of whom, I regret to say, were repeat offenders, seemed to be subject to a different type of sentencing philosophy.</p><p>To those who look to the legislation in the hope that there will be more severe sentencing and that the Judiciary will become more severe in its sentencing, we must remember that imprisoning a young woman or young man - it is more likely to be a young man - is a disaster for him, his family and society.  Given that our prison system is so deficient in rehabilitation, which we must work on collectively as a society, it is a disaster for society in many cases that a person has been sent to prison.  The first principle that must apply in any of these guidelines, especially in respect of the District Court, is a philosophy of avoiding imprisonment where possible because it is easy for a judge on an afternoon to sentence a young man to six months in prison for violence or whatever, but in many respects it will be the destruction of that young man's life forever, as well as of the potential of that young man's life to be a useful citizen through employment forever.  We must be careful, therefore, when we demand severe penalties, that we are conscious of the absolute importance of using imprisonment as a last resort in most cases, although there are many cases where it must be imposed, bearing in mind the severity of the offence.</p><p>I trust that the Minister will not take my final point in any way as an attack on his Department or his record, because it applies across the board.  Our prison system is deficient not only in its capacity to rehabilitate but also in its physical capacity to hold on to prisoners who are sent there by the courts.  I will not raise the idea of the revolving door because it is an easy, populist argument to make.  Nevertheless, we have significant problems with prison capacity, and those who have expectations that sentencing guidelines will inflate or raise the bar for prison sentences should remember that there is limited prison infrastructure in Ireland, which is currently incapable of dealing with an increasing number of persons convicted for sentences carrying life imprisonment and so on.</p><p>I agree that Sinn F&eacute;in was correct to take the view that this legislation was the opportunity to address the sentencing guidelines issue, and I am glad that the initiative the party took has resulted in the series of amendments which are to be tabled by the Government to the legislation.</p></speech>

What is the possibility of broadening the scope of the sentencing information and guidelines committee, and will some of the recommendations of the Personal Injuries Commission be taken on board?  They could be taken on board by that committee, or another committee could be established under the judicial council to examine the recommendations of the Personal Injuries Commission.  I might speak to the Minister before Report Stage about how this might be achieved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-02a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040200002#OO00300"><p>I do not wish to prolong the debate given that we are all in agreement on the merits of the amendments.  As I should have stated when I was speaking about the sentencing guidelines, we have an unfortunate history in sentencing practice of overuse of short sentences and of committing far too many people to prison for far too short a time.  I hope we will see a change to that through the introduction of the guidelines, although I recognise there has been a good deal of change in recent years thanks to the enactment of the Fines Bill 2010, and far fewer people are now sent to prison for the non-payment of fines.  In 2013, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, on which I served with Senator Conway, produced a report on penal reform in which we agreed with the approach of the Irish Penal Reform Trust.  We called for less use of prison, for prison to be a sanction of last resort and for a cap on the numbers of people being sent to prison.  In that context, I am glad the plans that Senator McDowell had when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the building of an enormous prison at Thornton Hall have since been shelved, and I commend subsequent Governments on not proceeding with that because we do not need that number of prison places.  Senator McDowell has acknowledged the lack of rehabilitative function that prison serves, particularly when people are sent to prison for such short periods, and it would be far better to consider community-based sanctions, as we recommended in our committee report in 2013.</p> <p>On Senator McDowell's point on the gender differential in sentencing, I have researched the area and extensive research has been carried out elsewhere.  Women tend to comprise a far smaller proportion of offenders than men, at no more than 10% in any jurisdiction, and where women are sentenced for similar offences to men, there tends to be somewhat more lenient treatment in most cases, but that is largely due to family circumstance being taken into account and women being much more likely, in Ireland as elsewhere, to be the primary carers of children.  Judges are unwilling, therefore, for good reason, to imprison women where so doing would deprive the children of a primary carer.  Conversely, women who are convicted of serious offences are treated more severely in many cases and are certainly more extensively stigmatised, especially for participation in violent crimes.  It is not always the case, nor is it so simple or straightforward, that women are always treated more leniently.  The research shows that there is a more nuanced reality.</p> <p>Perhaps Senator McDowell did not intend to do so, but it is unfortunate that he used the one example of false complaints of rape because we know that it is a very rare occurrence and that there is an all too prevalent myth in our society that women make false accusations of rape more frequently than the reality.  Again, there is extensive research which shows that myth has no basis in fact but, unfortunately, it still informs certain attitudes and stereotypes.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=25&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is exactly why on Report Stage I will be bringing forward the amendment to section 17, about which I spoke, to ensure judges would have power and be given guidelines on the charges they should give to a jury with reference to the sexist attitudes or stereotypes that in the past have prevented prosecutions for rape from proceeding effectively or in the same way other prosecutions proceeded.  The rape crisis centres, Rape Crisis Network Ireland and others have raised this issue.  We have also seen it raised in the context of other recent cases.  I will not say any more about it now, but we do need to challenge the sexist assumptions that have pervaded and, unfortunately, influenced the conduct of rape and sex offence trials.  The Bill is an excellent vehicle to bring forward the changes we want to see in the criminal justice processes.</p></speech>

I note that it is practically one year to the day from the Belfast rape trial, but we will say no more about it.  I remember the case referred to by Senator McDowell when he was the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It was regrettable that, through no fault of his own, high up or low down, he found found himself in that situation.</p> <p>I echo Senator Bacik's comments on the work done on the issue of penal reform by the previous Joint Committee on Justice and Equality.  A lot of work was done by that committee and if the recommendations made in a number of reports it carried out and into which it put serious work had been implemented, the penal system would be far better.  We produced a report on community courts in which we looked at the example of what happened on Times Square in New York.  It became the epicentre of the trend of having community courts which achieved phenomenal results.  It turned Times Square from being a no-go zone into probably one of the safest places in the world.</p> <p>A report on restorative justice, for which I was a rapporteur, looked at the excellent examples that had been piloted in Tallaght in south Dublin and north Tipperary.  Senator Ruane will appreciate from where I am coming from on this issue.  The pilot projects were driven largely by a retired judge, Mr. Justice Michael Reilly, who was a great person with huge empathy for people who found themselves on the wrong side of the law, probably because of circumstances related to their background, rather than anything malicious.</p> <p>Our job in this House is to look after, protect and advocate for the most vulnerable in society.  Sometimes - not all of the time; rarely, in fact - we have to give counsel to the Judiciary because its members, no more than anybody else, including those who have been in this House for many years, can, through no fault of their own, become detached from reality.  Elements of the Judiciary - a minority - can become detached from society as it evolves, changes and alters.  Technology, for example, can change a society.  Perhaps when a judge started off in the legal profession, he or she saw a set of circumstances, but after 20 years on the Bench he or she would see a new and evolving set.  That is where the Judicial Council Bill and a judicial council could play a significant role.  Nobody in this society and country is above receiving advice or counsel.</p> <p>The Bill is probably long overdue.  I am delighted that it has not received the same attention or been subject to the same controversy as another judicial Bill currently going through the House.  When the Judicial Council Bill 2017 is passed, we will actually assist the most vulnerable.  Senator Bacik is correct that there is so much we could do to help and assist people.</p> <p>Senator McDowell has served in government.  I am very fond of and have huge regard for him, but he was in government for nine years, at a time when the State had a lot of resources and when we could have really transformed the prison service, but that did not happen.  Fine Gael has been in government for seven or eight years, in probably the most challenging economic times in our history - certainly in lived history - and done quite a lot.</p> <p>At this point it is appropriate that a huge tribute be paid to the former director general of the Irish Prison Service, Mr. Michael Donnellan, for the work he did and respecting people who were in prison.  He did his best to promote education and rehabilitation. </p> <p>This is a great and necessary Bill that will enable us to adhere to best international practice.</p></speech>

Those of us who have been to visit it will appreciate that it is and always will be wholly unsuitable for the rehabilitation of prisoners.  At least Thornton Hall would have had the advantage of having space to play football, have running tracks and so on that could give offenders a decent life.  Such facilities would also help to physically rehabilitate them.  The site also had the capacity to allow us to move towards having a drug free prison, something Mountjoy Prison simply cannot do.  Those who condemned the Thornton Hall project should remember that at the time the Government sold 30 acres of land at Shanganagh Castle.  It sold part of it for private development and part of it to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for public housing.  I note in the papers that although this happened in my time as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform some 14 years ago, no housing has ever been built on the land purchased on that occasion.  The entire proceeds of the sale were invested in acquiring 150 acres of land in north county Dublin in an isolated place where there would not have been major communal resistance and where it would have been possible to provide decent psychiatric facilities in conjunction with the Irish Prison Service.  It was a visionary project for the improvement of prisons.  A previous Minister, former Deputy Alan Shatter, commissioned a report that did not state the project should be abandoned.  I believe that some day on that land a proper, decent prison should be built.  Whether the numbers have to be larger or smaller is not the issue; it is about having the capacity to rehabilitate prisoners, people who are sentenced having some hope in their lives instilled through the education system and sports and recreational facilities and the physical rebuilding of the lives of drug addicts in a drugs free prison.  These are hopes to which I aspire to having and they are hopes that will never be realised as long as Mountjoy Prison is the main prison in the Dublin region.</p> <p>There is no point in being romantic about Mountjoy Prison, Brendan Behan, Kevin Barry and all the rest.  It is not and never will be a suitable institution for the rehabilitation of offenders.  It is a depressing and awful place.  Anybody who thinks it has a long-term future in a decent prison system is very much mistaken.</p></speech>

I have been in the prison many times and I agree with Senator McDowell about its unsuitability and the lack of purpose for rehabilitation, notwithstanding the fact that conditions have improved in recent years.  When Thornton Hall was proposed there was a very advanced plan, as the Senator knows, to demolish and reconstruct on the site.  That would have been entirely different from using the existing structures of Mountjoy Prison.  The view I hold is well informed and is on the basis of a lot of evidence and research.  I am sure we all agree that we should be moving towards less reliance on prison.</p></speech>

I have been there on a number of occasions, once or twice with Senator Bacik.  Slopping out and such things does not exist there anymore.  Thornton Hall was a great proposal at the time of the Celtic tiger but it never really took off.  Fianna F&aacute;il was in government from 1997 to 2011, when Thornton Hall was purchased but the prison never happened.  It will probably not happen now but it is a pity because it would probably have given people the dignity that society wants and which is in accordance with the international obligations to which we have signed up.  It is probably nobody's fault that Thornton Hall did not happen and the aspiration was appropriate.  It would be unfair, however, not to point out that there are very good people in Mountjoy who are doing their best to rehabilitate people.</p></speech>

I first visited Mountjoy Prison when I was a trainee solicitor.  We were brought up to see the men's and the women's prisons and there is significant difference between the two.  The prison officer who was bringing us around pointed out that the women who ended up there tended to have been victims throughout their lives but, for the first time in their lives, they were in a safe environment.  They had a bed to sleep in and they were not going to be attacked in their own home.  The officer said that when women entered prison, their outside relationships broke down.  They are not visited by their partners or husbands, though their mothers come in with their children and their sisters or other people in the community.  In the men's prison, however, the wives and girlfriends continue the relationships.  There is a significant difference between female offenders and male offenders.  It was an eye opener for me and it was very sad to see that women desperately wanted to stay in the women's prison because they received support, education and training there for the first time in their lives.  It is a pity the men do not get a similar experience when they are in jail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-02a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040200002#QQ01000"><p>I am reluctant to enter into a debate on prison infrastructure and policy but, lest that reluctance be interpreted as indifference, I have lived and worked throughout my career in the town of Portlaoise, which is perhaps best known for its prison complex, the largest urban prison complex in Great Britain and Ireland.  I am very familiar with the workings of prison and with prison policy and we might have an opportunity on another occasion to engage on the varying issues, though I do not see a great divergence of opinion with regard to prison policy or operations.</p> <p>We all agree that prison should be a penalty and a place of last resort for the courts and, by and large, that is the case as far as the administration of justice is concerned.  I was amused at the suggestion by a former Minister, Senator McDowell, that Thornton Hall be used for football and sport.  That would put into some insignificance the contractual and monetary relationship between the FAI and the chief executive or the current executive vice president, but that is also for another day.</p> <p>I welcome the debate on the specific amendments.  I acknowledge support from all sides of the House and we have worked together in the past few months to facilitate a debate.  I thank spokespersons of other parties for their active engagement which has led to the amendments before us being put, and I acknowledge the support of the parties in the Seanad.  I also acknowledge the work of spokespersons at party level in the D&aacute;il, and I particularly acknowledge the work of the Attorney General to ensure we are in a position to debate amendments that need to acknowledge the separation of powers between the Legislature and the Judiciary.  We have achieved this essential balance.</p> <p>I note and acknowledge that Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has withdrawn his amendments in favour of mine.  There was a considerable overlap between the group of amendments which we are discussing but there remain a number of points of divergence and I note the Senator did not make reference to his proposal to withdraw amendments Nos. 41, 43 and 44, which relate to matters such as ministerial proposals and the monitoring and further assessment of legislative proposals.  In my view, the amendments are more appropriate to a somewhat different type of structure than is possible within the framework of this particular Bill.</p> <p>The key point is that there is general consistency in the overall objective to ensure there is public confidence in the practice of sentencing in general, though I am not sure how far we can go in terms of the particular in this regard.  As policy makers, we have to ensure confidence in the sentencing regime is evident.  We are debating a larger number of amendments, which is somewhat inevitable having regard to the changes required in the Bill as we move towards a provision for sentencing guidelines and the information committee.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the amendments in my name, the first set of amendments, which are Nos. 2, 6, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26, all appear to be very straightforward.  They concern a change in name for what is currently referred to as a sentencing information committee.  The effect of the amendments is that the committee will be renamed the sentencing guidelines and information committee.  This reflects its new remit and the new functions bestowed upon it.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 4, 19, 21, 24, 27, 29, 30 to 32, inclusive, and 77 are connected with the new functions the committee will now have.  A key amendment among those is amendment No. 21, following the model in section 30, which relates to the judicial conduct committee.  Provision is now being made for the committee to prepare draft sentencing guidelines and to submit those guidelines for review by the board of the judicial council.  Any amendments to guidelines adopted by the council will be dealt with in the same manner.  </p><p>Another key amendment in this group is amendment No. 77.  It sets out the broad parameters for the sentencing guidelines which are to be adopted by the council.  This amendment also specifies various factors which must be taken into account by both the committee and the board in preparing or reviewing drafts of such guidelines.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 32 are linked to No. 77 insofar as they define the terms "sentence" and "sentencing guidelines."  Amendment No. 27 is a consultation provision, which will allow the committee to draw upon external expertise in the preparation of draft sentencing guidelines.  Amendment No. 31 mandates the committee to prepare material for inclusion in the annual report of the council in relation to its work.  Apart from the first report of the council, which may cover a period longer than a calendar year, the relevant period will usually relate to activities during the preceding year, which is normal, as Senators will be aware.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 8, 10 and 11 relate to the role of the committee on the board of the council in relation to the draft sentencing guidelines.  To ensure consistency with other provisions in the Bill, these amendments mirror the arrangements envisaged for the judicial conduct committee insofar as the proposed guidelines for judicial conduct and ethics are concerned.  In essence, the board will be tasked with reviewing the guidelines and introducing modifications if deemed appropriate.  The council will be tasked with the adoption and publication of the guidelines.  Adoption must take place not later than 12 months after the draft guidelines have first been submitted by the sentencing guidelines and information committee.  </p><p>Amendments Nos. 3 and 33 to 37, inclusive, are all concerned with issues around membership of the committee and its procedures.  Amendment No. 33 provides that the committee is to consist of 13 members, being eight judges and five lay members, appointed by the Government following a recommendation from the Public Appointments Service, PAS, on foot of a selection process.  The role of PAS is dealt with in amendment No. 34.  The eligibility criteria for being appointed as a lay member are set out in section 31 of the Bill, which deals with lay members of the conduct committee.  In this case, however, a person is not excluded from appointment by virtue of being a practising barrister, solicitor or civil servant.  These restrictions, which are appropriate in the case of the judicial conduct committee, are not appropriate in this instance.  Amendment No. 35 specifies that the standard membership term for the committee shall be four years, which shall be renewable once.  The filling of casual vacancies is dealt with by amendment No. 36.  Matters such as the procedure in relation to meetings, the first of which is to be held not later than three months after the date of the first meeting of the council and the quorum, set at five, are addressed under amendment No. 37.</p><p>The final amendment with which I need to deal is amendment No. 78.  Senators will agree that it is one of the most critical.  This is the amendment which specifies that a court shall, in imposing a sentencing, have regard to sentencing guidelines relevant to the proceedings before it unless the court is satisfied that to do so would be contrary to the interests of justice.  This amendment has been carefully crafted following extensive engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.  I confirm to this House that the clear advice received was that non-binding sentencing guidelines of the kind proposed are constitutionally permissible.  However, the imposition of guidelines of a binding or statutory nature on courts in criminal matters would violate the separation of powers, the requirements of Articles 37 and 38 of the Constitution, and would interfere with the scope of judicial discretion, which would also be contrary to the Constitution.  I was anxious to explore the scope which existed for a more robust approach to sentencing guidelines.  I take the view that confidence in the criminal justice system would be greatly enhanced if the public feels there is genuine consistency in the imposition of sentences in criminal cases.  </p><p>I have listened to what Senators have said during this debate.  I am inclined to strongly agree with Senator Bacik on the point she made about mandatory sentences, and I suspect that it is a view that a majority in this House holds.  In recent years it must be acknowledged that the guidelines, as developed by the Judiciary, are increasingly used as a technique to structure judicial sentencing discretion.  However, it is often not very clear if the public is aware of these developments.  The requirement to produce formal guidelines builds upon evolving good practice and will, I hope, allow the public a greater insight into and appreciation for the workings of the criminal justice system.  It will provide people with the assurance that the system is working in an appropriate, efficient and effective way.  </p><p>I ask Senators to agree to the amendments.  Reference has been made to a perceived delay in bringing this legislation back to the House.  I acknowledge that time has elapsed, but that time has been put to good use.  I return to the introduction made by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, and acknowledge the work done in that regard.  I ask Senators to accept that I have pushed the boundaries of sentencing guidelines as far as I believe is feasible within the parameters of the Constitution, and I acknowledge the input and work of Senators across the board in that regard.  I acknowledge the withdrawal of Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's amendments.  I should not make comparisons with any other legislation passing through this House in parallel, but I very much welcome the fact that already, in the course of the early stages of the debate on these amendments, that at least three Senators are preparing for Report Stage by reserving the rights to put down amendments and talking about what might happen at later stages.  I very much welcome that, and hope that the short time between now and Report Stage will be used by all of us to discover the other issues that might be addressed.  I acknowledge what Senator Ruane has said, and would be happy to look at the issue she raised.  I am more than willing to consider any proposals that are constitutionally sound and are workable, and which do not have any unintended consequences or impinge upon the fundamental independence of the Judiciary in any way in the carrying out of its duties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I acknowledge a fundamental thread that was referred to by Senator McDowell when he said that each and every case that goes before the courts is judged and should always be judged on its own particular merits.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2019-04-02a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2019040200002#TT02300"><p>This reflects what has been a tradition - that of recusal - whereby judges may wish from time to time to recuse themselves from hearing a particular case independent of any application or after an application that recusal is appropriate in the circumstances.  The test of recusal is one of objective bias.  Essentially, if a reasonable and fair-minded person in possession of all the relevant facts reasonably apprehends that the judge will not be fair and impartial, then in general a judge will recuse himself from any case to which he has a personal connection.  For example, a relevant case may involve relatives or friends or a former client or some other circumstances that might create a risk of impartiality being called into question.</p> <p>The Bill as published already provides that the conduct committee shall prepare and submit to the board of the council draft guidelines concerning ethics on judicial conduct.  The practice in other jurisdictions where guidelines or equivalent measures have been adopted is that provisions on impartiality, which include conflict of interest considerations or separate provisions relating to the latter, are included within that framework.  I have every confidence that similar provisions would be included in the guidelines that the conduct committee is being mandated to draw up.  Given the importance of this issue for the administration of justice, however, it may be useful to include a provision in the Bill that explicitly highlights the need for the guidelines to include guidance as to matters to be considered in the context of recusal.  This is one way in which conflicts of interest may be managed.  The merit of the amendment is that it will ensure rules relating to recusal are included in a single publicly accessible document.  I am still considering whether it may be desirable to set up a register of financial interests for judges and, if so, what the overall structure of that register might be.  This is a matter that we may return to when we come to Report Stage.</p> <p>There is precedent for this approach.  I am keen to acknowledge the situation in New Zealand where legislation has been introduced recently that places an obligation on the judiciary there to develop and publish guidelines to assist judges in deciding whether they should recuse themselves from proceedings.  On foot of that legislation, guidelines have been published for the supreme court, the court of appeal and the high court there.  New Zealand also has well-developed guidelines for judicial conduct.  I believe the amendment is desirable and I am seeking the support of Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; in that regard.</p></speech>

I appeal to Senators in the spirit of compromise that has been evident over the past hour or so to accept my proposals having regard to the fact that they are designed to achieve what is a common objective, that is to say, increased transparency, subject to the need to address what might be regarded as exceptional circumstances where publicity might not be warranted.</p> <p>The key amendment is amendment No. 55.  In its current form section 55 provides that a hearing of a complaint before a panel of inquiry shall be conducted otherwise than in public unless the conduct committee directs that to safeguard the administration of justice it should be conducted in public.  A similar arrangement applies later in section 66 in respect of a hearing conducted by the judicial conduct committee in respect of a complaint that has been the subject of an investigation by a panel of inquiry and in respect of which a report has been submitted to the conduct committee.</p> <p>Amendment No. 55 proposes to amend the relevant section to provide that the default arrangement would be that a hearing would be held in public unless the conduct committee directs that to safeguard the administration of justice such a hearing should be conducted in private.  Amendments Nos. 51 and 53 are consequential upon this change.  They concern the notification requirements to the judge and the complainant.  Essentially, where a hearing is to be conducted in public, whether in whole or in part, both the judge and the complainant are given an opportunity to request that some or all of that hearing may be conducted otherwise than in public.  This is an exceptional provision.  Section 51 specifies that the conduct committee shall not accede to such a request in the absence of reasonable or sufficient cause.  Amendment No. 66 mirrors amendment No. 55 in the event that there are any court proceedings arising out of the making of a complaint.</p> <p>Amendment No. 60 relates to section 66 and is a new provision specifying that a determination is to be published where it arises out of a hearing that is being held in public.  By contrast, amendment No. 61 deals with a situation where a hearing has been held in whole or in part otherwise than in public.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In this case, the conduct committee has discretion as to whether a determination should be published.  The remaining number of amendments largely relate to the information which can be included in the annual report of the judicial conduct committee.  The changes being proposed flow from amendments which I have already outlined.  In amendment No. 59, which concerns section 66, the deletion proposed is consequent on the fact that by virtue of amendment No. 75, the annual report must contain &quot;the name of a judge to whom <i>section 66(11)</i>applies&quot;.  There is no longer any discretion in this matter, but by way of further background, the scenario contemplated by section 66(11) is one where a judge is required to make a report as to his or her compliance with a requirement contained in a determination and either does not make such a report or does not satisfy the conduct committee that he or she is indeed in compliance.  Amendment No. 75 also requires that the name of a judge to whom section 58 applies be published in the annual report.  The section in question deals with the case where there is failure or refusal on the part of the judge concerned to co-operate with a panel of inquiry.  The amendment also deals with reprimands which are issued under section 66, following the conclusion of the complaint process.  The default position is that both the name of the judge and the reprimand issued should be published.  However, there is something of a saver, where it is considered that in order to safeguard the administration of justice, such publications should not occur at all.  Amendment No. 70, however, will ensure that there is information about the number of cases where a reprimand was issued but the information about such a reprimand is not being made public.  Amendment No. 67 expands the provision on the annual report of the conduct committee, which is contained in section 69.  It underlines the fact that where evidence is given otherwise than in public, this does not prevent the publication in the annual report of the findings of a panel of inquiry or of the information required to be published by virtue of section 73 in relation to reprimands.  Amendments Nos. 73 and 74 are technical amendments which take account of the restructuring of section 73, consequent on amendment No. 75.<br/><br/>I merely wish to say that the objective of these amendments is to achieve balance.  Having regard to discussions that took place since the publication of the Bill, I felt that perhaps we could achieve a greater level of balance as far as information is concerned and that is why I proposed these amendments, which are not dissimilar to amendments tabled by other Senators.</p></speech>

The provision in the Bill relates to a particularly sensitive issue, namely, dealing with a referral by the conduct committee to the Minister for Justice and Equality of a matter which warrants the proposing of a motion under Article 35 of the Constitution calling for the removal from office of a judge, either for stated misbehaviour or for incapacity.  The amendment itself, however, is straightforward.  It involves the deletion of the provision for notification of the complainant that an investigation has been adjourned.  The rationale for the amendment is that such a notification carries with it the risk that it would alert the complainant to the fact that a referral to the Minister might be in play.  This would not be desirable, in particular because if a referral were not proceeded with, speculation as to what occasioned the adjournment could be damaging to the reputation of the individual judge concerned.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Charles Flanagan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=414"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=414&amp;amp;pid=CharlesFlanagan&amp;amp;year=2019&amp;amp;month=04&amp;amp;day=02"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If, under subsection (13), the judicial conduct committee is not satisfied that a referral should be made, the investigation by a panel of inquiry will proceed as normal and the complainant will be engaged in the process as if the question of a referral had never arisen.  On the other hand, if a referral actually occurs, provision is made in subsection (14) to ensure the complainant will be notified, but this will only happen once the relevant Article 34 motion has been proposed.</p><p>A panel of inquiry will have a general power to adjourn an investigation of a complaint under section 62 of the Bill.  In this instance, there is no notification requirement in respect of either the judge or the complainant.  It is only where the investigation is subsequently discontinued that the notification provision will kick in.

Having regard to the earlier debate we had on the role and function of prison, I have taken on board the fact that a penalty of this nature may be regarded as disproportionate in the circumstances.  Accordingly, I am proposing that the penalty available where such disclosure has taken place should be a monetary one.  The fine proposed is that contained in the Bill, as it stands, namely, a fine not exceeding &euro;5,000.  I hope Senators will agree that this represents an adequate and appropriate sanction to address those cases where the confidentiality requirements of section 69 have been breached.</p></speech>

Such a provision is made in many of the Acts which govern appearances before investigative or other bodies.  For example, section 49 of the Mental Health Act 2001, section 12 of the Criminal Law Insanity Act 2006 and section 83 of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 contain similar provisions.  In the case of bodies for which there is no explicit statutory provision such as the Medical Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Board and the Teaching Council, some make witness payments on the basis of custom and practice.  In this instance, it is not unreasonable to have an explicit provision in the interests of transparency.</p></speech>
