I welcome the &euro;750 billion recovery fund at EU level to help with the Covid pandemic.  It was a mammoth session in terms of meetings between member states that went on for an unscheduled day to show the seriousness and extent of the recovery package being promised.  There was a significant win for Ireland in that it is to be calculated on how our country is hit by the pandemic and not on past economic performance.  This will result in additional funding and supports for our country.  We have all read in recent days that there were divergences of views, but such is the power of the European Union, by the end of it all there was consensus and an ability to agree a deal and to move forward, which is extremely positive.</p> <p>It is worth highlighting that in order for Ireland to do well post-Covid or even during the recovery period, we need the European Union to do well.  It is not just about what Ireland gets back; we are an exporting nation and we export what we manufacture, so it is important for us how well the European Union as a whole recovers.  The package represents a really strong prospect that we will recover well but, more importantly, that we will recover quickly.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> I also wish to touch on the July stimulus package to be announced later today.  Many of the details have been released already and we heard news of it yesterday and this morning.  It is extremely positive that the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme will be extended.  This gives assurance and comfort not only to businesses but also to employees who are in a vulnerable position at the moment.  It must be worrying to be in a place where are one does not know if one&rsquo;s job will continue, if one will lose one&rsquo;s job in the near future and in what position one's family will be in the next number of months.  The extension of these two schemes is very important and welcome.  While this will cost a great deal of money, it will be worth it.  There will also be enhanced restart payments for companies that want to reopen and additional funds to help such companies restart.  There was an acknowledgement that while the restart grant was welcome, it fell a little short of what was needed.  That scheme will be enhanced in the next while.</p><p>I particularly welcome the tax refund scheme.  I know business argued for a VAT reduction but it is better for the economy and country to encourage people to get back out spending and to protect consumer confidence.  If people get scared and worried, they will stop spending and we will be in bother if that happens.  If businesses have footfall and people are coming in the doors of hotels, restaurants and caf&eacute;s, that will help us to recover more substantially and faster.  All in all, the package that will be announced will be positive and broadly welcomed. </p><p>There has been some confusion about the green list that was announced.  The message remains clear - please do not travel unless it is essential.  There is no ban on travel as such.  That would not be practical.  What we are asking people to do is to staycation and travel within Ireland.  We are asking that they do not travel outside Ireland unless it is essential either to care for a family member or for work purposes. </p></speech>

Senators are at a disadvantage if we come into the House and we do not have a copy of the Order of Business in front of us.  I respect the Leader and her office.  It is all very well for her to come in here and tell us what she has decided.  We are challenged in both Houses in the current political landscape, but particularly in this House of which I am a Member, because we are up against a vast Government block of people.  That is the Leader's right and that is democracy.  A courageous and ambitious programme for Government has been negotiated and I wish the Government well.  However, we on this side of the House are also challenged and we have to challenge.  We have to call out and support good government and when it is bad we have to say so.  We too have busy schedules and work to do.  We also hope to participate, if we are given the chance, in the joint committees and in other areas.  Let us not stymie democracy.  Let us have new government.  The slogan of the previous Government was that it would be a new Government.  Let us get it right here.  Let us respect one another and show that respect for each other outside this Chamber.  Will the Leader agree to provide, before 9 a.m. on the day of all Seanad sittings, a schedule that she proposes to bring to the House in order that we can discuss it among ourselves?  That would allow us to amend the schedule if we so wished, which is important.  I am happy to discuss with the Leader outside the Chamber how we can continue to work well together.</p> <p>Yesterday, the cervical cancer campaigner, Ruth Morrissey, was laid to rest, having died on Sunday.  She was one of many courageous women.  I also think of people like Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na and Irene Teap.  How sad that none of them reached their 40th birthday.  Why are women being dragged through the courts?  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, gave an undertaking in the D&aacute;il that the court cases would cease and these women would not be dragged through the courts.  These courageous, brave and determined women were not going to be set aside.  I read the transcripts of statements made in the D&aacute;il at the time by Opposition spokespersons and the then Taoiseach who said that would not happen and that there would be a tribunal of inquiry, as recommended by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan.  That inquiry has still not been established.  If one read any of the newspapers in the last few days, one&rsquo;s heart would go out to these brave, courageous women.  Let us support them.  I ask the Leader to have the relevant Minister come to the House next week to make a statement on how the Government will stand by its promises with regard to CervicalCheck. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-23a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1688" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072300002#D00100"><p>Last year over 900,000 passport applications were made to the Irish Passport Office.  Over 94,000 of them came from the North and Britain.  In one day in 2018 the office received over 10,000 applications.  I acknowledge that currently restrictions are being placed on people and we know about the advice regarding international travel, albeit it is confused and calamitous at times.  However, as we navigate a way through the current restrictions people will, please God, begin to travel again and it will hopefully become an important part of life and our economy.  Even aside from all of that we all know the importance and the significance of a passport as a form of documentation.  The Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said that Passport Office staff have been facing unprecedented demand and many of us know the first-class work that the staff there do.</p> <p>I am calling for positive and practical future planning for better infrastructure for our Passport Office and its service delivery.  We currently have an office in Dublin and one in Cork.  There is an identified increase coming from the Six Counties, from people of every tradition.  Brexit is part of that but it is the natural course of things as well.  At the minute 19,617 people have signed an online petition calling for a new passport office to be opened in the North that would service that geographical area, from Gweedore over to Warrenpoint.  It makes sense, it is a practical call.  It is prudent for the Government to plan ahead for what will no doubt be a continued pattern of increase in applications.  As restrictions are lifted we will see a further surge.  It makes good sense and would be good practice for the Government to plan ahead, to listen to those very rational, reasonable and logical calls for that new service.  Initial research has shown that it would be cost-neutral so it would not put any additional financial burden onto the State.  It would also create jobs and improve services for us as elected representatives and for the many people out there in the public who have to engage with the Passport Office should a problem arise.</p></speech>

For the information of Members, those are Labour Party Bills which were both introduced and passed by the previous Seanad on Second Stage.  The first is the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Naturalisation of Minors Born in Ireland) Bill 2018 which would restore certain citizenship rights to children born in Ireland.  It was passed by this House in November 2018 with support from Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party and we very much hope that we will see it pass all Stages in the lifetime of this Seanad.  As such we are restoring it to the Order Paper so it may go to Committee Stage.</p> <p>Our second Bill is the Convictions for Certain Sexual Offences (Apology and Exoneration) Bill 2016 which likewise passed Second Stage in the House in February 2017 with unanimous support.  The State has issued an apology since then, in 2018, but it has not exonerated or expunged the records of those men who were convicted of the relevant historical offences.  I know the expungement is contained in the programme for Government but we wish to assist the Government by bringing forward our legislation again and restoring it to the Order Paper.  I thank the Leader for that and hope all parties will support the two Bills.</p> <p>I wish also to renew a call for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy O'Gorman, to come into this House after the recess but early in the September session, to have a debate with us on disability services.  This debate would in particular concern the necessary legislation to be passed in the lifetime of this Government to ensure we are fully compliant with our international obligations on the rights of persons with disabilities.  The Justice for Wards of Court organisation has been in contact with me and pointed out a number of different gaps in our current law.  These are well-recognised but we want to hear about a timeframe for the passing of such legislation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ivana Bacik:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2248"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2248&amp;amp;pid=IvanaBacik&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I would also like to ask the Minister about residential services and the reopening of day services.  In the meantime, I will be submitting questions to the Minister on that matter because I have been inundated by messages from people who are deeply concerned, people with Down's syndrome and others who have real difficulty with accessing residential and day care services.<br/><br/>Finally, I ask the Leader for information on the report by Tom O'Malley SC, the renowned academic who was commissioned in 2018 to carry out a report into necessary reform of our law on sex offences, in response to the Belfast rape trial.  The report was due to be published by tomorrow, when the most recent deadline given lapses.  On 3 July, <i>The Irish Times </i>announced that the report, which has been delayed a number of times, would be published within two or three weeks, and that deadline lapses tomorrow.  We know from Rape Crisis Network Ireland and the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre how much of an increase there has been in reports of rape and it is therefore important that this report is published without delay. </p></speech>

It is comforting to see my fellow Senators, Oireachtas Members and staff wearing their face masks at this crucial stage of the Covid crisis.  Nobody needs reminding that this crisis has gripped our country since the middle of March.  It has wreaked havoc on our day-to-day lives, shut down schools and businesses, impacted jobs and livelihoods, and sadly, cost many people their lives.</p> <p>At the beginning of this crisis, the collective community-based approach was very evident and there was a strong sense that we were all in it together.  People went out of their way to support one another, and my colleague, Senator Garvey, was filmed by RT&Eacute; delivering groceries and water to people who were cocooning.  There was a great sense of pulling together and there are many examples of that from up and down the country. </p> <p>During the lockdown, many of us saw and noticed things we had not noticed before.  People were tending old graves, rejuvenating their gardens or doing some DIY around the house.  More people walked and cycled, and many of us got out into nature and observed it with fresh, appreciative eyes.  That was something positive that came from the lockdown. </p> <p>However, despite our best efforts, we have seen an increase in cases over the past number of weeks.  Perhaps an element of complacency has set in.  We have perhaps relaxed our vigilance, and so the virus still grips us.  We need to reignite the community spirit that kept us going so well at the start, that connected us and made us attentive to what we needed to do.  At the moment, that includes adhering to the public health advice, heeding the Government's guidance on foreign travel, contacting our GPs if we are feeling unwell, or downloading the Covid tracker app.  Quite a few people have downloaded it and the more people have it, the better.  We must do it and we must pull together. </p> <p>We also need to reignite that sense of meitheal that was so prevalent in the early days.  For example, we can support our local charities, many of which are without their usual mechanisms for fundraising.  We can and should support Irish businesses, and can buy local food, arts and crafts.  Most importantly, we should be holidaying at home this year, whether through an excursion along the Wild Atlantic Way, a day trip to the Slieve Bloom mountains, or a trip around one of our many wonderful towns and cities.  We need to be that tourist and that local customer, and we need to ask everyone to stay at home this summer.  We are all still in this together. </p></speech>

With formal annexation of the West Bank now explicitly promised after 50 years of occupation, my goal has been for Ireland to take a more meaningful stance against this, to move beyond condemnation and to offer leadership.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Frances Black:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2474"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2474&amp;amp;pid=FrancesBlack&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I do not want to look back in 20 years and say that we did not do everything in our power on one of the most defining human rights issues of our time and that we failed to show the moral courage and vision we showed against apartheid South Africa in the 1980s.  I tabled the occupied territories Bill for this purpose.  It is a peaceful, human rights-focussed measure that reflects international law and UN resolutions.  It was passed in full by the House and voted for by the D&aacute;il and foreign affairs committee.  I did it on a cross-party basis and worked closely with many in Fianna F&aacute;il, who strongly supported the Bill in both Houses and shared platforms with me at packed public meetings throughout the country.<br/><br/>When the previous Attorney General raised questions about EU law, I shared detailed legal opinions from some of the most eminent lawyers in the world on why we could do this.  The party of now Taoiseach, Miche&aacute;l Martin, was rightly undeterred.  It introduced the Bill to the D&aacute;il and committed explicitly on page 146 of its pre-election manifesto to progress it if elected.  Just a few months later, it is disappointing and highly inconsistent to see the Taoiseach suggest the Bill his party tabled may breach EU law.  I would like to know what has changed.  EU law has not changed in the past five months.  With annexation of the West Bank looming, we need leadership and commitment, not inconsistency.<br/><br/>As one of the few countries without the shame of a colonial past, we should be at the forefront of opposing the occupation and settlement project that underpins it.  This must move beyond mere condemnation.  It has not worked and soon it will be too late.  Recently, I listened to the head of one of Israel's largest human rights organisations urging the international community to recognise and oppose what his State is becoming.  When two peoples inhabit the same land but are subject to different laws, that is apartheid.  Last month, 47 UN special rapporteurs called for urgent action, sharing that annexation would be the crystallisation of a vision of 21st-century apartheid.<br/><br/>In a briefing I hosted on Monday, the UN rapporteur on Palestine told Deputies and Senators that the seat we won on the Security Council was in no small part due to our principled positions regarding Palestine.  We must now show this support is warranted.  He urged the Government to progress the Bill.  The Taoiseach rightly speaks about his party's historic support for Palestinian rights.  In 1980, we became the first European country to call for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and the rest of Europe soon followed.  The Taoiseach's party brought the Bill to the D&aacute;il and committed to it in its manifesto just a few months ago.  He asked it if will be a game changer; I firmly believe it can.  Every journey starts with a first step.  Let us stick to our promises and be brave enough to take it.  If the Taoiseach has an alternative plan beyond the failed <i>status quo</i>, I ask him to unveil it.  I am sure he would get the support of the majority of the Irish people.</p></speech>

In 1996, the great British retailer opened its first shop in the Jervis Shopping Centre in the constituency of Dublin Central.  It had a great business, grew and was profitable, and then moved to the site of Roches Stores.  On 9 April this year, it tactically moved its business from being a high street, shopfront business to being an online business.  It still trades today and has a half-price sale, for anybody who is willing to spend money with the company when it resolves this issue.  A total of 1,500 low-paid front-line workers, most of them women and many of them mothers, have been left high and dry by this great British retailer.  I ask the Seanad and the State to support these workers.</p></speech>

This is a tactical insolvency.  I ask the House to ask the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to write to the liquidator to ask, and if possible instruct, that in the hierarchy of creditors the employees be placed at the highest level so they can be properly compensated according to the agreement the employer entered into with them.  I also ask the Minister to take immediate action to ensure we do not have a repetition of this situation in the lifetime of the Government.</p></speech>

The package of supports includes &euro;15 million in funding to purchase laptops and devices to enable the most disadvantaged students to continue their education, an additional investment of &euro;3 million in mental health services for students which, we will all agree, is of critical importance, a doubling of the student assistance fund from &euro;8.1 million to &euro;16.2 million and an additional &euro;1.9 million in supports for students with disabilities.</p> <p>Another area on which I would like the Minister with responsibility for higher education and the Government to focus is a technological university for the south east.  This has been debated for as long as I can remember.  The south east is the only region in the country without a university.  It is critical that a renewed focus is placed on assisting the institutes of technology, IT, in Waterford and Carlow in resolving any differences that remain.  </p> <p>I have suggested to the Minister that it may be helpful for the Government to appoint someone to drive the process forward with a view to the application being made before the end of the year.  This must be a firm deadline and the south east Oireachtas Members from across the parties, who have met on several occasions in recent weeks, are certainly of this view and will articulate that message to both institutes next Monday when we meet them in Carlow IT.  There is certainly momentum from the political side, but the process needs to be expedited by the Government.  As I said, it would be helpful to appoint someone who will drive it.  A technological university for the south east has been talked about for too long and action is now needed on this matter.</p> <p>I would also welcome a wider debate on the higher education sector and its difficulties in the face of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.</p></speech>

I had experience of the centre after a liver transplant and the facilities and care provided by the staff are absolutely outstanding.  I am sorry to say it has gone into liquidation with the loss of more than 60 jobs.  As section 39 employees, they have all been bound by the same rules and regulations that are applied to HSE staff.  However, when it comes to redundancy they are not being afforded the same rights and entitlements as HSE section 38 staff, despite a precedent being set by another section 39 institution, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, when it was compelled by the Labour Court in 2018 to provide enhanced redundancy payments under the Public Service Agreement 2010 to 2014.  I would like this matter to be addressed.</p><p>The second issue is that of education in schools about the gay issue.  I had communication from a young woman who said that when she was in school, the word &quot;Gay&quot; was a derogatory term and people were made to feel ashamed.  A national study carried out in 2016 showed levels of extremely severe stress, anxiety and depression were four times higher among 14 to 18 year old LGBT teens in comparison with a similar age group of 12 to 19 years.  Some 60% of LGBT people have seriously thought about ending their lives, with 60% of their suicidal thoughts relating to their identity.  We should have an equality programme in schools.  It is not sufficient for schools that receive State money, although they are controlled by the church, to duck out of these programmes.  The green flag, which was very good, was introduced in schools and it is about time we had an equality flag and programme in schools.</p></speech>

Shannon Airport, as the Cathaoirleach will know, is in urgent need of assistance.  Unfortunately, the issue if Covid-19 has placed enormous pressure on all airports.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Timmy Dooley:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2015"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2015&amp;amp;pid=TimDooley&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Long before the Covid-19 crisis hit, Shannon Airport and its affiliated businesses were under significant pressure.  Since separation from the DAA, the airport's performance has been abysmal.  It has failed to meet all its passenger targets since long before the pandemic crisis.  It is lagging behind the performance of Cork and Dublin airports in terms of growth.  All of this happened at a time when an unprecedented number of tourists came into the country.   Now we need action.</p><p>There has also been a failure to develop the tourism attractions which are part of the Shannon Group.  People will be familiar with the great Shannon Heritage brand which includes Bunratty Folk Park, King John's Castle, Knappogue Castle and Craggaunowen.  I could go on at length.  Wonderful facilities have not been developed in a way that would attract tourists to the region.  We want a change of direction.  There are opportunities.</p><p>The tenure of the current chairperson comes to an end in August and it is incumbent upon the Government to look for somebody new with a new vision who will put in place a new direction for the entire operation, supported with an appropriate level of financial assistance.  If we are serious about balanced regional development, we need a thriving engine of growth through the airport.  It provides that.  Its ancillary facilities, including Shannon Heritage and fantastic tourist attractions, can be the catalyst for the rebirth of tourism in the region.  I ask for a debate at the earliest possible opportunity with the Ministers with responsibility for transport and tourism to try to ensure we get a new direction and some activity back into the region.</p></speech>

I invite the new Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to come to the Seanad to debate this very important issue.  Following the publication of the strategy for the future development of national and regional greenways, a group was established in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to develop a code of best practice.</p> <p>Progress on greenways has been frustratingly slow in many places.  The Connemara greenway, in particular from Galway city to Moycullen and Oughterard, and the greenway from Galway city to Salthill and Barna offer significant potential but have been hampered by delays, including in the case of the Connemara greenway the lodging of planning and accessing routes to enable a planning application to be lodged. </p> <p>Greenways and cycleways will benefit local people and communities, as well as visitors, by providing safer cycling routes, as well as recreation, for communities.  We have seen that in Mayo and Waterford.  However, it is very clear that the current approach to developing greenways is not working.  Salthill in Galway is one such example.  While I appreciate the concerns of some local businesses, I was disappointed by the decision not to proceed with a temporary cycleway in Salthill. </p> <p>I also have concerns about the use of emergency measures due to Covid-19.  This is not best practice.  Emergency measures can be challenged, and often successfully so.  We need to recognise that greenways, like the Connemara greenway, the Dublin to Galway greenway and the Galway to Barna greenway, constitute critical infrastructure that will benefit everyone. </p> <p>We need proper consultation to find the best routes and compensate householders, landowners and property owners.  Ultimately, we need a code of best practice and leadership to progress greenways.  I hope the Minister will be able to come to the House to debate this very important matter.</p></speech>

However, what slipped under the radar was the slashing of the just transition fund and an undermining of its implementation.  The flagship just transition fund was promoted by the EU and was set up to start help carbon intensive economies ditch fossil fuels.  On Tuesday, its total budget fell from almost &euro;40 billion to &euro;17.5 billion.</p> <p>A just transition has to be central to climate action.  We have to be able to ensure that for those most directly affected by policy decisions, a carbon neutral future will offer them decent working conditions and a living wage.  Instead, on Tuesday what we have said to those workers is that when the going gets tough, projections for their future are the low-hanging fruit that can be cut.  We have also sent out a worrying message to the international community on collective climate action. </p> <p>EU countries that have not committed to carbon neutrality by 2050 will still be able to access 50% of the funds available.  Fundamental to international climate action is the need for every country to play its part.  The EU is in a unique position to be a climate leader, yet with this deal we have facilitated a two-tier approach to ambition.  I welcome the decision to increase the funding committed to climate policies from 25% to 30% of the budget but there is no guarantee that the other 70% will not undermine climate action and fossil fuel subsidies have not been ruled out.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lynn Boylan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=LynnBoylan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The European Court of Auditors has issued more than one warning about the need for climate spending to be backed up by robust tracking and performance indicators.  </p><p>I hope that when the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment comes before this House again, he can reassure us that affected workers in Ireland will be guaranteed a just transition and that he will work at EU Council level to ensure all EU policies are climate-proofed.  There is no point investing 30% of a budget in climate action while the other 70% is simultaneously undoing those efforts.</p></speech>

We were all hugely saddened by Ruth Morrissey's passing.  We express our deepest sympathies to her husband, Paul, and her darling daughter, Libby, to whom she always referred as her little butterfly.</p> <p>Ruth was brave and courageous.  Along with other great people, such as Vicky Phelan, Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap, Ruth shone a light on horrific incompetence within our health service.  Those people fought for truth and justice to try and ensure women in the future would not go through what they did.</p> <p>Ruth fought a long, hard battle with her illness but also fought a long and public battle for the vindication of her rights.  One can imagine that it would be extremely difficult for anybody in their full health to talk about personal and intimate details in a public setting, so I can only begin to imagine what it was like for somebody who was vulnerable and ill to have to expose their life to try to seek absolute justice.</p> <p>Ruth and others worked to highlight the diagnostic failings in this country's CervicalCheck screening programme so that others would not have to go what they went through.  There was a litany of failures regarding the operation of the service.  Too many women who should be alive today, enjoying lives with their families, are not here because of those failings.  We have a duty to learn the lessons, reform the system and make sure those failings do not happen again.</p> <p>The Government committed to implementing the recommendations of the Scally and MacCraith reports.  I ask the Leader where we are at with regard to the implementation of those recommendations.  I would like the Leader to ask when the statutory tribunal will commence.  That tribunal was, of course, based on recommendations made by Mr. Justice Charles Meenan.  The cervical cancer screening programme has recommenced, but only in a limited manner.  We in the Seanad need to call for the programme's complete restoration.  Ruth gave voice to many women.  We absolutely must honour that in our cause to ensure the right thing is done.</p></speech>

The concept has been championed by Deputy Richmond as a means to ensure the State gives all newborn babies an equal start in the form of a box containing all of the essentials, including blankets, recyclable nappies, thermometers, clothes, and information on nutrition and health for mother, baby and all of the family.  The box itself can convert into a cot for a newborn because it has a good quality mattress within it.  That is not only a practical provision for first-time or second-time parents, but is a good example of the State cherishing all of its children equally and welcoming them into the world with a lovely gift that provides for an excellent start in life.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary Seery Kearney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarySeeryKearney&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is a strong message of support and welcome from the State to every child as well as an excellent opportunity to ensure an equality of provision and a universal standard of information.

Younger people and people working in the sectors most affected by Covid-related job losses will next week be thrown back into the insecurity of living in the private rented sector, where tenants' rights are poor.  The last few months have provided security to renters.  While the rest of the country is urged to be vigilant, not to travel, to maintain social distance and to wear masks, the Attorney General's advice to the Minister is that the rights of property owners are more important than keeping people in their own homes during a pandemic.  Before the Covid pandemic, most people entering homelessness came from the private rented sector.  This crisis continues.  The common good, both legal and political, should prioritise keeping people in their own homes rather than the rights of landlords and private property owners.  Renters are losing out in the legal wrangling, which has not been tested in the courts.  This is a political decision hidden behind legal advice.</p> <p>Next week, Members are expected to pass legislation in this House, which we are told will protect the rights of renters yet we have not seen any heads of the Bill, only an order.  I want to invite the Minister to the House to discuss this matter.  The ban will run out on 31 July, the day on which the House is due to rise.  </p> <p>On a second issue, the Minister needs to address the issue of rent relief and a mechanism for people who, through no fault of their own, have gone into arrears during the course of the pandemic.  While the pandemic unemployment payment is welcome, it does not nearly cover the current high rents, particularly in Dublin where the average rent is more than &euro;2,000 a month.  The Minister should address the House immediately with regard to the issues affecting renters and should extend the eviction ban and rent freeze beyond 31 August, at least until the pandemic has passed.</p></speech>

Despite the previous reviews he cited ruling out underground options, such options will be considered as part of another major electricity upgrade project announced by EirGrid yesterday, which will run between Kildare and Meath.  There are therefore clear contradictions in the manner in which the physical infrastructure for this country's electricity supply is being progressed.  There are other examples of this in the west.</p> <p>The Leader will be acutely aware, as am I, of the resolute opposition from people in the affected counties of Meath, Cavan and Monaghan to the overground option to be pursued for this particular project.  If the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, really wants to electrify Meath, he should start by electrifying the rail line from Dublin to Dunboyne and then complete it into Navan.  We would then see proper electrification of the county.  He knows this but he should be reminded again.  I ask the Leader to work with me in conveying that message to him and I trust that she will.</p></speech>

On Monday, instead of coming up to Dublin, I joined hundreds of workers protesting at the airport.  In this time when all of us, not just the Green Party, are really conscious of the need for a just transition, it is really important that we look at balanced regional development.  Instead of looking at increasing the number of flights, we need to look at redirecting flights coming into Dublin to places like Shannon.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Shannon Airport is like a ghost town at the moment.  In the west, we are very dependent on transatlantic flights from America.  The fact is that if one lands a flight from America in Shannon as opposed to Dublin, carbon emissions are immediately reduced by 3%.  That is something positive with regard to tourism, sustainable transport and the just transition.</p><p>I call on the House to promote the idea that we look at proper, balanced regional supports.  We are looking at staycations and laethanta saoire and everybody is talking about their importance, yet the Shannon Group has decided to close the heritage sites at the end of August and some of them have not opened at all.  I am very pleased to announce that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has committed to visiting the airport with me in the coming weeks and that the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has agreed to visit the heritage sites with me.  That is a good starting point considering it took us three years to get the previous Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport down to the airport.</p></speech>

Over a quarter of voters told the exit poll during the general election in February that their key concern when casting their ballot was housing.  We are all acutely aware of the hardship being experienced by families throughout the country due to the chronic shortage of housing.  We all agree what a scandal it is to have 10,000 men, women and children living in hotels, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We talk about the need for people to have outdoor space to exercise, and the importance of being able to meet at a social distance, for mental health.  Young people want to leave the rental trap and own their own home.  They want to live and work in the areas where they are from and not to leave and move closer to larger cities.</p> <p>While everybody agrees with these key points, we have a major issue when it comes to residential land being dezoned, with the proposed new development plans throughout this country.  Galway City Council hopes to purchase lands for social and affordable housing worth &euro;15 million.  Meanwhile, in Meath and other parts of the country, councils are recommending that large amounts of serviced land be dezoned from residential back to agricultural land for no clear reason.  There is no clear policy from the Government on its plans regarding the availability of housing.  This means the decisions made in that regard at local level all around the country totally lack cohesion.  Project Ireland 2040, which is supported by the Planning Regulator, puts a full stop on rural development.  This is a massive error when we can see the clear benefits of rural living, as demonstrated by statistics on clusters throughout the pandemic.</p> <p>The dezoning of land is not the only problem we face at the moment.  Covid-19 has created many urgent challenges within this sector.  The Minister recently extended the ban on evictions until 1 August but what will happen then?  If people cannot pay the deferred rents that have been racked up in recent months, an eviction crisis looms.  However, if landlords are asked to swallow some of the loss, many of them may choose or be forced to leave the rental market causing absolute chaos within the already strained market.  The Government's actions at this moment fly in the face of all the promises we have been given on building houses, the provision of homes and the creation of a country where people do not live in fear of becoming homeless due to the lack of quality housing in their area.</p></speech>

In the past three or four days we have seen vast crowds go to many amenities throughout the country.  However, there is a serious lack of infrastructure.  Large crowds flocked to beaches in west Cork last weekend where there was a lack of amenities such as toilets and lifeguards.  The issue must be examined for the coming month.  Investment by local authorities, in particular in toilets at beaches, must be promoted in the next four weeks as, I hope, we will see a major influx of Irish visitors come to our beaches.  It is a basic but important issue for society that people can go to the beach to enjoy themselves without worrying about toilet facilities.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is bizarre.

In Harbour View in west Cork, in particular, 3 m or 4 m of sea algae have been washed on to the beach and is staying there.  We need a programme for cleaning these beaches in the next few weeks.  If we do not, the beautiful amenities we have cannot be enjoyed to the full.  We need to promote it but also to add the services that are required for a modern society to enjoy a beach location.</p></speech>

I refer to the words of Dr. Samar Fatima Ali about her father, who worked in Tallaght University Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and the Mater Hospital.  She stated in an RT&Eacute; interview:</p> <blockquote> 	There are no words for the pain that we are experiencing.  We did not think that at such an age that we would experience this pain but our father has been incredibly selfless not only through this pandemic but his whole life ... It has been a very difficult time for our family.  He has been incredibly brave.  He has pushed through and the last three months have been incredibly difficult ... He has been the best dad that we could have ever asked for. </blockquote> <p>They are some of the words of Dr. Syed Waqqar Ali's daughter.  If ever we needed a reminder in this House or anywhere else how devious and destructive this virus is, we have it there.  We see selfless people on the front line like that doctor.  He fought the virus but there are after-effects.  Three months later, he has been taken.  My sympathies today go to his family.  He leaves a wife, five children and a mother behind, and, I am sure, other relatives as well.  Looking at that interview clip, one can see the sadness in his daughter, who is just qualified as a doctor, and even more sadness on the face of his 8-year-old daughter.</p><p>I will not be judgmental but an incredible effort has been made by the majority of people on this and a small minority still wants to bring us down and open up everything, which we cannot do.  We must follow the medical advice.  I appreciate the pain, suffering and hurt in businesses and communities but we must stick with it.  I ask the Leader in consultation with the Chair that we have a silent minute of prayer or reflection, whatever people are happy with, in this Chamber in remembrance of Dr. Syed Waqqar Ali and all who have died.  We have had the rounds of applause but it would be nice to have that minute of reflection, if the House agrees, and we should consider it for today or tomorrow.</p></speech>

I will give a brief outline of the background.  The Togher community project group has operated a community employment scheme and continues to run a community cr&egrave;che in a rural part of County Louth.  They took over the local parochial hall on a long-term lease to open and operate the cr&egrave;che and it has been running as a not-for-profit company for the past 20 years, providing an important service in the area.  On Monday, 6 July the manager advised all staff by text message that it was closing the next day and that the company had ceased to trade.  The parents were advised on Tuesday, 7 July, also by a three-line text message, that the cr&egrave;che was closing.  That was it - game over.  This left approximately 40 parents in the local community with no cr&egrave;che and no more after-school childcare or anything like that.  The most galling aspect about this is that the cr&egrave;che was so successful.  Accounts for the year 2017-18 showed retained earnings of &euro;53,000 and cash reserves of &euro;450,000.  The business, therefore, was hugely viable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John McGahon:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnMcGahon&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->On the governance, and this gets on to the point I want to make, there is currently a board of four people who run this company.  Three of the four people are from one family.  Indeed, a number of board members have been removed and replaced by family members, which is completely allowed under the Companies Act 2014.  However, there was no effort whatsoever to try to seek advice to maintain this service.  There are so many viability plans and so many options with Covid restart schemes that could help.  To conclude, it is very odd and very disturbing.  It is very important that we invite the Minister into this House for a debate about the transparency and the regulations surrounding the childcare sector.</p></speech>

We have all seen how hard they have worked.  When we think of front-line workers, we think of those who are at the front line in the health services.  Without wishing to take away anything from those workers, I would like to acknowledge today the work of our postmen, An Post's workers.  During lockdown they were asked to take on extra activities, such as dropping in to the elderly in rural Ireland, in the communities they attend on a daily basis.  They were also asked to take on the role of reading meters for the ESB.  For many postmen it was a natural fit because it is what they do day in and day out.  It needs to be acknowledged.  I hope the Government and An Post acknowledge that, particularly when it comes to the future of An Post's services.  Postmen are not just a delivery service; they are much more than that and it needs to be acknowledged.</p> <p>I wish also to acknowledge the start the Government has made.  It took many months and weeks to have a Government established but it has to be said that this Government has hit the ground running.  I very much welcome the July stimulus that is coming and to which I will return in a moment.  It is imperative that our schools open in September.  It is really imperative that we do everything in our power to ensure our children get back to some normality at the end of August or in early September.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, is doing a lot in this regard.  The July stimulus is very welcome and much work is going on behind the scenes.</p> <p>I wish to refer quickly to the tourism sector.  The need for the new unit that has been set up in the Taoiseach's office has probably become more evident given the difference in the VAT rate for the tourism sector north and south of the Border.  If that joined-up approach was there before, it would have made life much easier.  It has made it very difficult regarding the July stimulus.  I hope we start moving more collectively in future.  We need to look at the abolition of rates for the rest of the year.  I hope medium-sized businesses with more than 50 employees are included in the stimulus.</p></speech>

Abandoning our Palestinian friends in their hour of need represents the very worst form of betrayal.</p> <p>This morning I want to raise University Hospital Limerick.  There are 43 patients on trolleys there this morning.  If one looks at the records over the last number of weeks, one will see that University Hospital Limerick is consistently top of the list by some distance.  The next nearest this morning was Sligo University Hospital with 18 people on trolleys.  I have been in contact with a number of staff there who have told me there are people sitting and sleeping on chairs.  There are no bedside tables, which means patients cannot even be given a cup of tea.  The message from staff is "if this is what it is like in July, what on earth are we facing into this winter?".  There are beds finally coming on stream, but this is where it gets really disturbing because the staff are naturally concerned to ensure the hospital is properly staffed for this winter season.  However, they have found that management will not speak to them.  They have referred matters to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, but the management of University Hospital Limerick has refused to meet the WRC.  Let us think for a minute about what we have been quite rightly hearing this morning about the heroism of our front-line workers - how they save lives and put their own lives on the line.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->They are doing it in University Hospital Limerick and their own management will not speak to them or even engage with the industrial relations machinery of the State at the Workplace Relations Commission.

It is a viable business and it must be reopened.  I hope to work with the Minister and Senator McGahon on that case.</p> <p>I wish to highlight some good news.  I congratulate the Taoiseach on the hard-won funding agreed in Europe this week, particularly that under the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  We have been informed that current levels of funding have been maintained and a special allocation of &euro;300 million has been promised for Ireland for structural challenges facing our agricultural sector.</p> <p>Another good news story this week was the creation of a &euro;5 billion contingency fund for Brexit.  As someone from a Border county who knows the negative effects Brexit could have on our exposed Border economy and agrifood sector, I welcome this contingency fund.</p> <p>There has been much chat about the convergence of single farm payments.  Equitable distribution of funds is very important.  However, I urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to be aware that convergence needs to be truly equitable and that it often affects the small family farmer negatively.  Productivity and livestock rates should be considered because the base point of these single farm payments is now out of date as it is based on data from 20 years ago.  I ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss how the Department will structure fair and minimally bureaucratic schemes to ensure our rural economy and our high-quality agrifood sector are protected and grown. </p></speech>

We have a cross-party Oireachtas group and we are united in our belief that a university for the region has to come about.  We are meeting Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology on Monday and we expect them to give us a clear commitment that they will lodge an application this year.  However, if they fail to take action, I ask that the Minister with responsibility for further and higher education, Deputy Harris, arrange external intervention.</p> <p>I also raise the annual report of the Adoption Authority of Ireland, which stated that nine of the 46 adoptees who applied for access to their birth certificates last year were refused.  I ask that any new legislation in this area guarantee that adopted people have access to all their records, including their birth certificates.</p> <p>Senator McGreehan mentioned the success of the &euro;1.8 trillion fund agreed at European Council level for this year.  I congratulate the Taoiseach and the officials on their work at the end of that marathon summit.  What has been achieved was a real example of solidarity among those countries that are willing to work together in order that all of our citizens right across Europe can benefit.  Solidarity is a core principle of the European Union, but so are the rule of law and respect for democracy and human rights, about which I am particularly concerned.  I want assurances that regard will be given to those principles in the allocation of that funding.  I refer to recent actions in Hungary and Poland, in particular.  In Poland, there have been threats to judicial independence and minorities such as the LGBT community have been badly treated, while in Hungary, academic freedom and other democratic freedoms, including freedoms for journalists, have been restricted.  A link has to be established between the rule of law and funding.  I ask that the policy of appeasement adopted by the European People's Party towards Viktor Orb&aacute;n and Fidesz be discontinued and that the sort of standards we expect of other countries be equally applied at European level within the Union. </p></speech>

I respectfully suggest the business of the day should not be a revelation when the Leader gets up to speak.  I know that there is goodwill on all sides and that it will take time to get these things sorted but I think what Senator Boyhan said is important.</p><p>The HIQA report into the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted a number of issues with which most of us are now very familiar, such as the delays in testing, a lack of adequate personal protective equipment, failures in infection control and, of course, the arm's length relationship between the HSE and the private nursing home sector.  Questions have also been asked of HIQA, given that only one nursing home was closed in recent months.</p><p>One issue has struck me very much.  I wrote an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>in mid April commenting on this particular crisis.  It was probably one of the earlier contributions to the debate but it was a full month into the lockdown.  For some weeks previously, I, among others, had been calling for arrangements to be made to prevent cross infection by providing alternative accommodation arrangements for people working in nursing homes and going into private homes to give care.  It struck me the media was also struggling to know how to ask the hard questions of the Government at the time.  For example, I knew several weeks before it was revealed in the media about the extraordinarily high number of deaths in particular nursing homes.  Even though I was in contact with the media about it, the story was struggling to get traction, although there was this very real issue of public concern, namely, whether measures needed to be taken to provide alternative accommodation.  As we examine this issue now there has to be a thorough look - not in the spirit of finding blame - at the forces, tensions, pressures and doubts that contributed to our failure to grasp properly the problem that was going on in nursing homes and, sadly, to deal with it in a timely fashion.</p></speech>

Many of them hope to attend universities and colleges in this city and other cities throughout the country.  This third level academic year will be like no other that has gone before it.  I heard the heads of some universities recently state a university hall that would normally accommodate 250 people will now be able to accommodate only 50.  Some students may be lucky to attend college two days a week with the lectures on the remaining three days a week being delivered online.  With this in mind, I wonder whether there is a need for families and students living in rural Ireland to rent accommodation in cities such as Dublin and elsewhere.  Every year, they make the annual pilgrimage to this city to walk the streets trying to find a property.  They also have the burden of trying to afford to pay the rents being asked.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Harris, to call on the university heads to publish their calendar for the academic year ahead.  If it is the case that students may only be required to be in college two days a week is there any need for families to find properties in cities such as Dublin?  Can we imagine the savings that would be accumulated by those families who, in some cases, have to find &euro;1,000 per month for their sons and daughters to attend university or college in this city or elsewhere?  It is a huge burden.  This burden could be alleviated and that money could be spent in the towns and villages where they are from.  I would very much like the Leader to take this on board and ask the Minister, Deputy Harris, whether this timetable can be published to enable children and their families to make a call on whether there is a need to rent accommodation.</p></speech>

If that is agreeable to Members we can put it on the Order of Business tomorrow.</p><p>On Senator Boyhan's point, there is no problem.  It may have been done in the past and I did not know and have not started it, but I will make sure the Order of Business is emailed to everybody on the morning of the order so it gives Senator Boyhan ample opportunity to make changes, if that is what he wants.  I apologise if it was something that was done before and has not been done since I was appointed to the House.  I will make sure it starts from tomorrow morning.  It is fundamental that Senators should have the ability to make changes and amendments if that is what they wish to do.</p><p>I will follow up on the various debates that have been asked for today by writing to the relevant Ministers, but the issues around aviation, Shannon and heritage sites have been brought up by a number of Senators from that region over the last number of weeks.  I have written and have not received a response yet but everyone will concur that a vast amount of legislation is going through both Houses at the moment.  I will get that done as quickly as I can.  Of the two debates we are having next week one might suit those Members from that region because the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is coming in.  It might give ample opportunity for Senators to be able to raise the concerns they have. I believe we need a task force on aviation, therefore, I will continue to look for a separate debate on that.</p><p>We will also have the Minister for Education and Skills in the House next week, not least, to discuss the transport issues going back to school.  Given that the protocols were announced yesterday by the Department of higher education on the return expectations of our higher education sector, the return protocols for both our second level and primary schools will be announced by the Minister next week.  </p><p>It makes absolute sense, and we will do it here from today, to call for universities that have not already done so - I know DCU in my neck of the woods has already done so - to set out their schedules so people can actually make those decisions as to where they will spend their hard-earned money and not waste it.  That, in itself, will cause another issue in campuses around the country that rely heavily on income from student accommodation.  The &euro;163 million announced yesterday by the new Minister with responsibility for higher education is welcome but it will still see a massive deficit in the fund required for those educational facilities.  We will have that education debate on the return to school protocols for both our primary and secondary schools next week.  </p><p>I know many people, not least me, are keen to get their children back to school full time, not one or two days a week.  We should also have a programme of events to alleviate the impact, and I say negative impact, notwithstanding some of the tremendous work our teachers have done over the last couple of months, because many of our children now suffer from anxiety where they never would have before.  Given that before Covid-19 was a reality in February, our educational welfare officers will tell us that some 40% of the cases they dealt with on an average normal week were children who suffered from anxiety.  We need a programme of well-being and care that is extra, over and above our standard civil, social and political education, CPSE, curriculum for our children going forward in September.  I would like the Minister for Education and Skills to address that for us next week.</p><p>I do not have an answer for Senator Black as to why things have changed.  I happen to have been a member of a Government that would always have opposed the Senator's Bill on the grounds it was against EU regulations and EU law.  I certainly know there is a difference between Opposition and Government and now the current Government concurs with the same advice, even though it comes from a different Attorney General.  The EU regulations and the law have not changed but that is no solace to Senator Black and other Members who have supported the Senator's Bill in the past.  I will get the Senator a written reply if that is okay.  I do not have the full facts in front of me at the moment.</p><p>Senator Cummins made the highly appropriate call to have an appropriate lead appointed to the university for the south east so that person can drive the application.  I will write to the Taoiseach today and ask him for it. </p><p>Every time Senator Moynihan stands to her feet in the last number of weeks she has brought up the eviction and residential tenancy provisions that have been secured in the last number of months by the pausing of the rights of landlords.  I know Senator Moynihan has not seen it yet but that Bill is going to be published today.  The Senator will have that Bill and we will debate it in full in the House next week.  I hope it provides the Senator with the solace she needs because the last thing we need is an onslaught of people losing their homes, particularly when they do not have the financial supports available to them to find replacements.</p><p>My county colleague brings up the North-South interconnector and the new application that was made by EirGrid yesterday.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Regina Doherty:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2295"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2295&amp;amp;pid=ReginaDoherty&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Long before I was ever elected to either House, I attended public meetings where there was a huge outcry and aversion to the North-South interconnector building overground pylons.  I did not have much confidence in the ability of that project to be delivered back then, and I probably have even less confidence now. </p><p>The announcement yesterday is welcome and it very much brings into the debate the fact that there is an acceptance of having overground in certain areas and underground in others.  EirGrid has finally come to the realisation that immovable objects, such as the will of the people of Cavan, Monaghan and Meath which has not changed one jot in the past number of years, cannot be moved.</p><p>I want to acknowledge that the review of the rail project to Navan, a project which was instilled in our hearts many years ago and was interrupted by a lack of funds, is currently under way.  It was brought forward from 2021 to 2020.  I have no doubt that the review will justify the need to build a train line to Navan.  All of us, in particular our county colleagues here, will support that.</p><p>In response to Senator Keogan, I do know not know what is wrong with county councils who have not bought land to build social housing.  It has certainly not been because of a lack of funding from the last Government and it will not be because of a lack of funding from this one.  Councils are refusing to buy land and I do not understand that.  That, coupled with the dezoning of serviced land in our county, makes absolutely no sense.  We need to work with our council colleagues, not just in Meath but in Galway, Sligo and other areas where land is being dezoned, to find out what the rationale for that is.  Such decisions make no sense when we are already behind on our targets to build social, affordable and private housing this year.  I do not know why land that is fit and ready for building would be dezoned.  We might follow up on that collectively.</p><p>I will change the Order Paper tomorrow to reflect the wishes of the House to hold a minute's silence.

The &euro;2 billion scheme is a cornerstone of the suite of supports being announced by the Government as part of the July stimulus package.  It is focused on SMEs, which is key.  I want to be absolutely clear that the aim of the Government is to make money available to SMEs, including producers, farmers, fishers and so on who have not previously been included in such schemes.  We need to make money easier to access at a lower cost.  That is what we are trying to do.</p> <p>This scheme is about businesses and specifically SMEs.  I have listened to some conversations where people have said this legislation is about the banks.  It is not.  This is about using the banks to get money out.  This is a business support, not a banking support, and I want to be absolutely clear about that.  Some of the conversations I have heard seem to misinterpret what a credit guarantee is about.  Similar schemes work very well all over Europe and beyond.  We have used such a scheme here for the past number of years.  Much of the criticism of the scheme that has been in place here since 2012 has focused on the eligibility criteria for that scheme.  Those criteria will be completely changed by this legislation.  I wanted to be clear on those points in case I do not get a chance to say it later on.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->People often use the statistics from the last seven or eight years but they are in no way reflective of what the scheme being brought forward now, during the Covid pandemic, should be like.  They would be completely different.  The purpose of this Bill is to make certain amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 in order to help businesses access the additional finance they may need as a result of the Covid-19 crisis.  SMEs, primary producers and small and mid-cap companies have an immediate and urgent need for liquidity in order to meet ongoing expenses and to prepare for a return to more normal economic trading conditions.  These businesses are essential to employment throughout the country.  The debate we had here two weeks ago recognised the value these SMEs and microbusinesses of all sizes bring to our local communities, towns, villages and cities.  They are essential and they are major employers but they are also part of our communities.  It is important that we reach out to them.  As a Government, we recognise that they need different kinds of supports and that it is not just a matter of access to low-cost finance or loans.  This is only one part of the toolbox.  We have already announced many other supports including various funds, the wage subsidy scheme, restart grants, online trading vouchers and so on.  We also recognise that businesses will also require access to funding and that is what this guarantee is about.</p><p>According to the Central Bank's third quarter report for 2020, real-time data about the Irish economy pointed to a trough in activity in April.  Activity is now, thankfully, above this low point as the economy has started to reopen.  Activity, however, remains significantly below pre-Covid levels.  Again, the levels are different in different parts of the country and in different sectors.  We recognise that.  There might be a quick return to activity for some but it may be a very slow journey over a long period of time for others.  We want to be able to reach out to the different sectors that need that support.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office, CSO, survey measured the impact of Covid-19 on business in Ireland.  Data from more than 3,000 enterprises were collected on 1 June 2020.  The survey reports that almost nine in ten enterprises that responded were trading at some capacity as of 31 May.  Just over one in ten had ceased trading either temporarily or permanently.  Fewer than one in ten enterprises closed temporarily while 1% closed permanently.</p><p>The impact of Covid-19 on SMEs has not been uniform across different sectors.  As the country has reopened over the different phases set out by the Government, different businesses have required different supports.  We recognise that this will continue.  Initially, supports were focused on cutting costs for businesses.  These took the forms of the very successful wage subsidy scheme and the pandemic unemployment payment, alongside commercial rate deferrals from local authorities.  These same businesses now have different needs.  They need to buy stock and to make changes to comply with Covid-19 working conditions.  They also need to refinance loans, where necessary.  </p><p>Data from the CSO show that, in 2017, SMEs accounted for 99.8% of the total number of enterprises and nearly 70% of all persons employed.  We went into those data when we debated the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020 but I will now add further detail.  When these figures are broken down further, we see that microenterprises accounted for approximately 26.5% of persons engaged and the greater number of enterprises, at 92.1%.  Small and medium enterprises combined accounted for 42% of total persons engaged in employment in 2017 and just under 8% of the total number of enterprises.  Again, the statistics back up what we all sense, feel and know from the streets regarding the importance of SMEs to our country.</p><p>According the 2019 OECD review of SME and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland, the total number of people employed increased across all SME firm size bands over the period from 2011 to 2016.  This was during another jobs-led recovery.  We are probably back in that space again as we come out of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is to say we need another jobs-led recovery.  That is why there is great demand for businesses to reopen, restart, re-employ and build capacity again so that we can recover from the effects of Covid-19 over the next year and a half or two years through a jobs-led recovery.  I keep stressing that we need people at work and businesses open if we are to be able to collect the taxes we use to enhance and build upon all public services, including health, education and roads.  That is often missed in many parts of this House.  If we do not have economic activity, we cannot have the services we all want and demand for our counties every day.</p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s SME market monitor for 2019 notes that loan application rates by Irish SMEs are quite similar to euro area averages, but rates for overdrafts are lower.  Credit demand remains low compared with previous years.  This is probably expected in light of what has happened over recent months.  A large majority of micro, small and medium firms finance investment from internal funds.  Working capital remains the most common reason for credit applications among micro and small firms, whereas credit for growth and expansion is more common among medium firms. </p><p>We are now, however, in a much different environment.  We must anticipate an increased need for liquidity by companies and that this will in part be satisfied by way of debt.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I know there will be a discussion about more grants and more of everything else, but what we need is a combination of supports, grants, access to loans and equity.  We will stretch the taxpayers' purse as far as we can to reach and support as many people as we possibly can to get back to work and to keep businesses open.  The Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme will be available for the products most utilised by SMEs, especially small and micro firms.</p><p>I wish to use this opportunity to give Senators an overview of other supports available to SMEs, because each business has different needs.  I will not go into too much detail but I remind the House that we have the Covid-19 working capital scheme, which is a &euro;450 million fund.  We have the future growth loan scheme, which has an additional &euro;500 million.  It can fund for longer terms than the credit guarantee scheme, which is for six-year loans.  The future growth loan scheme can extend to more than ten years.  The sustaining enterprise fund is a &euro;180 million fund that is specifically aimed at firms operating in the manufacturing and internationally-traded services sectors, with ten or more employees.  There is a range of funds.</p><p>The pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund is also operated by the strategic investment fund.  Its focus is on investment in medium and large-scale enterprises in Ireland.  The fund is worth up to &euro;2 billion.  There are also grants available, including the &euro;250 million restart grant, the enterprise support grant for self-employed people and the Covid products scheme of &euro;200 million in targeted support to facilitate the research and development of Covid products.  The Department is constantly trying to push the agenda of investing in research and development, and in innovation.  The companies that do that are the ones that will expand, create more jobs and survive for longer.  We also promote the online agenda and try to get people thinking about trading online.  The trading online voucher is another support that was enhanced by the Department and the Department of climate action, communication networks and transport, under the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in recent months.  I want to keep enhancing those schemes along with the retail online scheme grant.  I wanted to bring this to the attention of Senators because the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme will be one of the largest funds available to SMEs.  It has an allocation of approximately &euro;2 billion, with a potential draw on the taxpayer of &euro;1.6 billion.  It is a significant investment in business.  The investment is in business, not the banks.  It is about getting money out to businesses at a lower cost and with better conditions.</p><p>I will refer briefly to the July stimulus package.  I have been working with the T&aacute;naiste, the Department and with other Departments in recent weeks to build it to a stage where it can be announced today, with the approval of the Cabinet.  It will be radical, of scale and far reaching.  It will build on the &euro;12 billion in supports in taxpayers' money that were already announced in recent months, but it will also lead us to an economic plan that we will produce around budget time in October to build on more supports and long-term strategies over three years.  The stimulus package is about having an impact now, in the next couple of months to give businesses a chance to reopen, restart and to build capacity as well.</p><p>I thank all the Senators who contributed to the previous debate we had on the Microenterprise Loan Fund Bill.  At the time we asked Senators to send their ideas for the July stimulus package, which many did.  Many Members took the opportunity to highlight problems as well as solutions and we did listen to and analyse all of that.  All of those ideas will not necessarily be in the July stimulus package but we will work on them and use them in the recovery plan we will bring forward in October.  I thank Members for their feedback.  Many others have engaged since then, some of whom have been in touch with departmental officials.  That is a great system and I would encourage more of the same.  I am very happy to engage with Members as we proceed in the coming weeks and months.</p><p>In considering the various analyses, I see five areas which we should focus on in helping our enterprises in the future: income support; direct grants for businesses; cheaper finance; new opportunities for future jobs; and support for the hardest hit sectors.  That is where we will try to target the July stimulus, but also our ongoing supports as well. </p><p>I will now focus on how the credit guarantee scheme will work.  The policy objective or mission statement is to maximise the impact of the scheme for borrowers in the short to medium term to address the liquidity requirements of small businesses.  The main features are as follows.  This is a scheme for SMEs, primary producers and small mid-caps with up to 500 employees.  SMEs are expected to be the main beneficiaries.  In order to qualify for the scheme, the borrower will have to declare an adverse impact of a minimum of 15% of actual or projected turnover or profit due to the impact of Covid-19.  In reality, this will not be difficult for most businesses to demonstrate because they have already had three or four months of adverse economic conditions.</p><p>The total amount available under the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is up to &euro;2 billion. The guarantee rate is 80% for the State with the lenders retaining 20% of the risk of the loan.  We believe that is the right balance or blend.  I heard references to what different countries are offering but the majority are in the same space of roughly 80:20 and we think it is the right place to be because we want the lenders to do their job properly too and to also take some of the risk, which reduces the exposure of the taxpayer as well.</p><p>There is no portfolio cap for lenders in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  Members might note that a portfolio cap has been a feature of the previous schemes and they might quote statistics from today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The removal of the cap is essential to ensure lenders provide an interest rate reduction to borrowers and also comply with capital requirements regulations.  That is probably a game changer.  We could achieve lower interest rates by removing that cap.  Many in this House and beyond have called for that as have our own officials and agencies.  We targeted it there and we believe it is the right decision.<br/><br/>The facility size available is for financial products ranging in size from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1 million, which is a fair offering and will help generate activity. <br/><br/>The products covered under the scheme will include a broad range of credit facilities including overdrafts, working capital and term-loan facilities up to six years.  There have been calls to go beyond that.  I will be clear in case I do not get an opportunity to respond later that under the EU framework, six years is the maximum.  We cannot go to seven years.  We agree with every Member that the longer the better but in this scheme under this EU framework, it is six years as it stands.  If that changes, we will change accordingly.<br/><br/>The scheme will permit lenders to refinance and to roll over credit facilities, which will be beneficial for many people in difficult circumstances at the moment.  Capital or interest moratoria for up to one year will be permitted under the scheme but it is important to emphasise that any decision regarding this will be at the discretion of the lender on a one-to-one basis with their customers, whom they know best.  Naturally, we will monitor that and work with the banks as we introduce this scheme in the next weeks and months.<br/><br/>I can confirm that, based on recent discussions between the T&aacute;naiste and the three main pillar banks, the banks have indicated that an interest rate reduction for facilities will be included in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  Precise reductions are still under discussion.  That work will be completed over the next couple of weeks and it will be transparent to everybody on what the difference in interest rates is and what the reductions are because it is important that lower interest rate products are developed out of this.  That is the aim of the scheme.<br/><br/>Members will ask why it is the three pillar banks.  I want to be clear that this applies to all the banks, the credit unions, An Post and anybody involved in lending.  Our engagement so far has mainly been with the three pillar banks because they have used this scheme so far and they are responsible for about 90% of lending to SMEs.  The initial part of this will be for the three banks and then there will be an open call involving more than 70% of the funding under the scheme for anybody who wants to avail of it and supply good products to the SME sector.  <br/><br/>There has been considerable comment on the schemes being operated in other countries.  I will take a moment to compare our scheme with those in the UK and elsewhere around Europe.  There is a lot of misinformation and it is important that we understand what we are comparing.  Sometimes, one hears people comparing apples and oranges.<br/><br/>The UK's bounceback loan is targeted at very small businesses and covers loans of up to &euro;50,000.  It is 100% guaranteed by the UK Government and there are no fees or interest to pay for the first 12 months.  After 12 months, the interest rate will be 2.5% a year.  It is similar in structure to the Microfinance Ireland loan discussed in this House a couple of weeks ago, when I said we are looking, in terms of that scheme, at a lower interest rate for the first 12 months of 0% or the best we can do, but that the effective rate would be 2.5% to 3% over a three-year loan.  The product is similar and in a similar space at about &euro;50,000.  The UK's coronavirus business interruption loan scheme<b></b>is very similar to the proposed Irish credit guarantee scheme.  It is 80% guaranteed by the UK Government with no portfolio cap.  Through that scheme, lenders can provide an eligible business with loans of up to &pound;5 million, with repayment terms of up to six years.  It is pretty similar to our scheme and people can choose to use the other one when comparing to our scheme, as opposed to using like-for-like.  This will help the debate.<br/><br/>Denmark and Austria&rsquo;s guarantee schemes are also operating as 80% guarantees.  People often tell me they are great countries and we should learn from them.  To be clear, we are on the same level as them.  Portugal is operating different schemes depending on the business size, with microbusinesses able to access a guarantee of 90% and small and medium businesses, 80%.  France is operating its scheme as a 90% guarantee.  Some schemes in European countries such as Spain and Sweden are lower than the Irish guarantee at 70% and others are lower again at 33%.  We will monitor all these schemes.  We keep an eye on what is happening and if we see something working better in another country, we will naturally try to adapt our own schemes to match that but we think we are more or less on the right track with this.  We will monitor the results of this and it will be transparent with regular reporting. <br/><br/>The Irish scheme will also fulfil the criteria set out in the European Commission&rsquo;s state aid temporary framework.  It is a temporary framework and if it changes, we can change.  The framework allows for the relaxation of state aid rules for participating enterprises.  It means that the Government can raise the thresholds of state aid to &euro;800,000 for an SME and &euro;120,000 for a primary producer.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It also allows for small mid-caps and primary producers to take advantage of the credit guarantee scheme and I hope they do so.  It is something that is not permissible under normal state aid rules.  Members have been calling for years for Governments to allow these players to have access to this fund and that will now happen.  As such, not only can the businesses be supported to a higher level but the breadth of businesses being supported has been also greatly improved.  The businesses can also use the guarantee scheme with other loans and grants from the Government and there are the new raised cumulative totals within the temporary framework until the end of 2020.  Companies have a window of six months or so to avail of these schemes and I hope they do so.  I also hope they use the other supports we will announce as we go along.</p><p>I do not know how much time I have left but it might be helpful to Senators if I go through each section briefly.  Section 1 provides that references to "Act of 2012" means the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.  This is not brand new legislation.  We are adapting existing legislation from 2012 which was amended in 2016.</p><p>Section 2 amends section 2(1) of the Act of 2012 to provide for the inclusion of a new definition of "COVID-19 credit guarantee scheme".  For clarity, the existing credit guarantee scheme, which has had a much smaller impact than this one will have, continues on its journey.  This is a new element but all of it comes under the same legislation.</p><p>Section 3 amends section 3 of the Act of 2012 to allow for the extension of classes of enterprises which can qualify for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  As I said, these include small mid-caps and primary producers, albeit in the statutory instrument when we name the producers.</p><p>Section 4 amends section 4 of the Act of 2012 to include the new Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme within certain subsections of that section, thus giving the Minister the power to give guarantees.  This section also disallows subsections (3) and (4) of section 4 of the Act for the purposes of the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, as different provisions are being made for those aspects through the new section.  We can discuss that further on Committee Stage.</p><p>Section 5 introduces a new section 4A into the Act of 2012, which gives power to the Minister to give guarantees in accordance with the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  I addressed this earlier but the gist of it is the six-year timeframe, the sum of up to &euro;2 billion and the 80% guarantee.</p><p>Section 6 amends section 12 of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act of 2016 to ensure that the maximum liability of the Minister in relation to the existing credit guarantee scheme shall remain as not exceeding &euro;15.6 million.  It is a much smaller scheme with a maximum drawdown of &euro;150 million.  If it were all drawn down and all the loans were unsuccessful or did not work out, the taxpayers' exposure would be &euro;15.6 million.  That scheme is separate and is still in play.  We are talking here about additional guarantees with an exposure of &euro;1.6 billion to the State.</p><p>Section 7 contains the Short Title and commencement arrangements.</p><p>That is a quick description of the Bill.  I look forward to Senators' contributions.  I hope I will have time to answer any questions but, if not, I will be pleased to engage with Senators afterwards.</p></speech>

This legislation is vital to the overall economic response to Covid-19.  I have been speaking to business owners in Galway city and county and across the west since the crisis began.  Now that businesses are reopening every week, we need to show them support and be flexible in our lending, as the Minister of State outlined.  In challenging economic times, credit, be it cash flow or whatever the case may be, can dry up fairly quickly so it is imperative that we support business.</p> <p>As the Minister of State noted, the scheme will be available to SMEs, primary producers and businesses with up to 499 employees.  Thankfully, SMEs are expected to be the main beneficiaries of this scheme.  The inclusion of primary producers is very welcome.  The agrifood sector is a vital part of Ireland's economy and society and is especially important in rural and coastal areas.  Farmers, fisheries and food companies played a major role during the pandemic in ensuring a supply of quality food and beverages despite very challenging times.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Ollie Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=OllieCrowe&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are living in extraordinary times and we need to take extraordinary actions.  The length of these loan terms, which is up to six years, will provide businesses with the flexibility they require.  I also welcome the structure of the guarantee, with the State guaranteeing 80% of the loan.  It is the right balance because at the end of the day, the taxpayer must be protected as well.  We do not need to give 100% guarantees to banks and if we did, there would be a very real risk to lending thereafter.  It is vital that the scheme is up and running as soon as possible.  I know the Minister of State will take that into account.  Of course, we need to ensure the scheme is thorough and that applications are well vetted, but we do not need too much red tape and we must operate in a straightforward fashion that is easily understandable for both SMEs and banks.  The applications should be made in a speedy manner and the banks should reach their decisions quickly.</p><p>I again thank the Minister of State for his participation in this debate.  He already outlined this in his speech but I ask him to give further consideration to expanding the grants available, because many SMEs and businesses across Ireland are struggling with the level of loans they have.  I ask him to prioritise the grants, although I heard him say he is doing that.  A number of supports have been put in place, including the restart grants and the July stimulus package which we will hear more about today.  That will further enhance the supports.  There is no question that the wage subsidy scheme has been excellent but having spoken to businesses in the hospitality sector, their main point is that there needs to be an increase in the level of grants.  It is something they feel would be a significant boost in the long term and for the sustainability of their businesses. </p></speech>

He opened his doors last night for the fist time in four months, and I opened mine about a month ago.  We are living examples.  We are both living through this so we have a full understanding of the huge benefit this credit guarantee scheme can bring.  I welcome it.  It is the largest guarantee scheme in the history of the State and will hopefully facilitate low-cost borrowings through products, overdrafts, term loans and working capital.  That is what is required at the moment.  I welcome the change in the portfolio cap and the increase in the size of the scheme.  The exposure to the State of &euro;1.6 billion is significant.  It is 80% of the loan fund and we must remember that when we are dealing with the banks.  The State is taking the high risk of 80% here.  The last thing businesses want to do at the moment is go further into debt.  Any businesses that have been closed down are looking at a reduction of 80% in turnover figures.  They are trying to service their existing borrowings out of a reduced income and the last thing they want to do is increase their debt further.  Grants and tax incentives help give businesses that extra margin to pay suppliers or employees.  That would be the preferred way to go.  In business, as we all know, we need working capital.  In my industry we get HSE, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and fire reports every year saying that work needs to be done.  This could be targeted towards such funds, and the small working capital required could be repaid over a six-year period although we would prefer if we did not have to incur further debt because it questions our viability.</p> <p>The Minister of State mentioned the banks.  This is not about the banks but they are a key actor in this and they have to deliver as well.  I do not think they have delivered through the credit guarantee scheme since it was initiated.  There are some fundamental problems there.  The Central Bank stated yesterday that while almost &euro;160 million was applied for through that scheme, less than &euro;5 million has been approved, and the working capital scheme is similar.  All the other schemes, which actually help the bottom line of businesses to survive, have been oversubscribed.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Pat Casey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2431"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2431&amp;amp;pid=PatCasey&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The timeframe for this is the end of December.  Small and medium sized business will put together a business plan, get it to a financial institution, receive a negative outcome and go through an appeals process, which is the same process as that of the original application, with the same people making the decision.  There is a need for some independence in the process in order that those in the SME sector can feel it has been fair and equitable.  Some of us have chequered histories with the banks and we need to move on from this because some people have the potential to be very successful and they need to be treated in a fair and equitable manner.  It is in everyone's interest that this works.  There is no point in the Government backing a scheme to 80% and not getting the results it and the SME sector need if the sector is to survive.  I have other suggestions but I might speak on them on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

I also welcome the Bill before the House, which is the largest credit guarantee scheme in the history of the State.  It has been brought in on the day we are announcing the largest stimulus package in the history of the State.  It certainly shows the Government is recognising the supports that businesses throughout the country need.  This is significant because I have spoken to businesses and the chamber of commerce in County Tipperary and what they need are supports such as low cost loans and grants, and recognition of the challenges they have had in recent months.  While they are very grateful for measures such as the temporary wage scheme, which has kept an awful lot of people throughout the country employed, the big challenge in the coming months will be restarting businesses and moving into the next phase of Covid-19 from a business perspective.</p> <p>It is very important to recognise that 80% of this loan is guaranteed by the State and a ratio of 80:20 is a good balance.  It would not be right to fully guarantee loans because the banks should carry some of the responsibility.  However, it is also very important that the State guarantees a high enough percentage to encourage banks to give a low interest rate so that businesses feel comfortable taking out loans to restart.  This is all about restarting businesses and giving them the confidence to get going again after an extremely difficult four or five months.</p> <p>The credit guarantee scheme is part of the July stimulus package, which is the second of three stages of the pandemic.  The number of measures introduced by this Government and the previous Government to support people and businesses since Covid-19 arrived on our shores in February and March is staggering.  Approximately 600,000 employees were on the temporary wage subsidy scheme and 66,500 employers registered with Revenue for it.  Almost 600,000 people were on the pandemic unemployment payment at its height.  This number has almost halved, which is very welcome, and even in the past two weeks we have had a reduction of approximately 200,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, which is very encouraging.  This means people are going back to work, which is very good.  Many loans have been announced, including the &euro;450 million Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Covid-19 working capital loan scheme, the &euro;2 billion pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund and the &euro;118 million sustaining enterprise fund.  There are also grants and loans, including the &euro;2,500 trading online voucher scheme, which has been extremely popular with businesses and I encourage it to be brought forward even more.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Garret Ahearn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=GarretAhearn&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is the &euro;2,500 lean business improvement grant from Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland and the &euro;5,000 business financial planning grant from Enterprise Ireland.  Then there was a range of different supports from the local enterprise offices, a stay of three months on commercial rates, which I suggest be continued, the &euro;75 million funding package for the reopening of early learning and childcare services and the &euro;50 million support scheme for beef farmers.  That sets the context for the measures introduced in recent months to support different sectors.  They are almost like a list setting out what a Government would do in five years rather than four months.</p><p>We are now moving into the second stage of this process, the third stage being the budget in October.  One of the things I often hear from business owners in County Tipperary, who understand the Government has been supportive of them through this time, is that increased grants are needed.  The restart grant is currently between &euro;2,000 and &euro;10,000.  There is a real need for it to be increased to a much more significant figure and extended to more businesses such as bed and breakfast accommodation and sports clubs.  These businesses will take up the grants because these types of grants are needed.  </p><p>I spoke to a business owner yesterday who was in the unlucky position of having invested a substantial amount in opening a restaurant in a bar.  He was ready to open in April and applied for a loan from the bank amounting to approximately 20% of his investment in the business to finish off the premises.  He told me he fell into a bracket of people who were unlucky.  As he recognised, a large number of grants were available for businesses that are up and running but not for businesses that are about to open.  These businesses have to restructure their premises, whether restaurants or pubs, just like any other business would have to but they were not necessarily trading at the time of the Covid-19 outbreak.  We should recognise that.  The investment in these businesses is small money in the grand scheme of things but it is recognition these businesses have had to go through the same changes as every other business.  The credit guarantee scheme, as the business owner in question would recognise, gives him the opportunity to secure a loan at low interest to finish off his own premises, safe in the knowledge that the cost will be much lower than he initially expected.  That is encouraging and he was very positive about that.  </p><p>I was pleased to note in section 3 that small and mid-caps and primary producers have also been included in the credit guarantee scheme, meaning farmers, fishermen and those in the horticultural sector will be covered.  As someone who comes from a farming background, I know that farming is the one sector that is well able to take risks and get loans to spend on new machinery or investing in land or produce.  It is well able to get loans.  The fact farmers have been brought into this scheme is hugely welcome because they invest locally.  The scheme is about encouraging people to spend locally and keep businesses up and running.  Including the agricultural industry in that means money will come back into local areas, which is welcome.  I welcome the Bill.</p></speech>

Whatever view one takes on the details of the Bill, it is clear the effects of Covid-19 on our economy will be profound.  I am not convinced that debt through loans is the way to proceed.  That is certainly what the SMEs I have contact with are all indicating.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Taking on further debt through loans, in any form, is not something that they want to do.  </p><p>In the shorter term it may be more effective to focus on the implementation of grant schemes which will help SMEs get back to work, and then begin to drive forward some level of economic recovery.  In the longer term, however, loans are an essential part of driving the economy forward and it is with that in mind that I look to the legislation before us.  The Bill, while quite technical, essentially makes changes to the Covid-19 guarantee scheme by increasing the amount of credit that will be guaranteed and increasing the cap on such credit from 50% to 80%.  Given the effect of this on future generations and the speed at which the Government wants to enact this proposed legislation, which will prevent close scrutiny of it, the Government has an obligation to be straight with the people. </p><p>It is absolutely right for it to take the necessary measures to protect and sustain jobs in the SME sector, but we cannot be blind to the problems with the Bill.  When risk was shared evenly between banks and the State, there was a disappointing take-up.  Even at a 50% take-up, the banks in this country were unwilling to take on the risks involved and advance credit.  Opposition parties such as Sinn F&eacute;in said this would be the case.  The Government has now had to move the cap to 80%.  Is there any principled reason the banks here, unlike those in Australia, are resisting sharing the risk with the State?  If so, we should be told.  </p><p>Why do we continue to enable the same banks that are treating SMEs so badly?  This is a firm indication that the Government needs to consider community banking as an alternative to this proposal to prop up the banks.  My colleagues in the D&aacute;il have described the proposed system as socialism for the banks and capitalism for the taxpayer.  I cannot put it any more bluntly and aptly than that. </p><p>Much is made of the fact that the banks are applying their normal underwriting decision-making processes to applications for loans.  How realistic, or even desirable, is it to expect that these standards will be applied if the banks are only on the hook for 20%?  The T&aacute;naiste said the revised cap will ensure that banks have skin in the game, that is, they will share the risk of default with the State.  He is entitled to believe anything he wishes.  If the banks truly have skin in the game, on what basis does he know that they will release funds if the cap is set at 80%?  If moving the cap to 80% means the banks do not perceive themselves to have taken on any real risk, would it not be more honest to take the same approach as England and simply accept that the State will have to shoulder the entire burden of defaults?</p><p>Some &pound;30.9 billion has been approved through the loans scheme in operation in the UK, a scheme which is widely regarded as being significantly less risky and easier to access than the Irish scheme which, by contrast, has issued a mere &euro;1.6 million in loans.  It is apparent that there must be multiple underlying issues if a scheme with funding of &euro;2 billion has issued so few loans.  Instead of serving SMEs, this Bill only serves the banks.  They are the only ones in this situation that are being insulated from risk. </p><p>Under this scheme, the banks will become what could be termed middlemen.  It seems logical, then, to do what many do in circumstances involving middlemen, namely, cut them out.  We will be picking up the bill for the significant number of potential defaults coming away over the coming months.  Why allow the banks to profit from the potential success of the scheme?</p><p>I understand the objectives of the Bill are to protect and support employment in the SME sector by counting credit.  The problem is not those objectives; rather, it is how it is proposed to go about them.  I seriously question whether it is an effective way to go about serving those objectives.  The failure of the loan scheme will lead to the failure of our SMEs, an outcome that cannot be allowed to happen.  I urge a complete and candid statement from the Minister of State on these matters.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Sharon Keogan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=SharonKeogan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Two issues are important.  Who can qualify for the guarantee scheme?  For example, a firm in difficulty, FID, cannot access funds because that would be state aid under EU law.  A FID is an accounting exercise and affects one's balance sheet while ignoring one's profit and loss, cash flow and growth plans.  An FID will not be eligible for the scheme.  More than 90% of Irish companies do not qualify because of the FID criteria.  Who will be eligible?  These loans have been around forever.  They were provided by the EU in 2008 and only 15% of them have been distributed. </p><p>The other question that must be asked is: will the banks lend?  The banks treat the applications as normal business loans.  They test a company's ability to pay and its security.  The Government provides security through the guarantee but most companies will not meet the repayment criteria the banks apply, well outside the terms of the credit guarantee system loans.  </p><p>I understand the objective of the Bill is to protect employment and the SME sector.  I urge the Minister of State to address the issues I have raised.  I would also like him to address the issue of the enterprise support grant that was put in place and announced more than a month ago.  Under that grant, non rates-based payers who are self-employed can access a grant of &euro;1,000.  That grant has not yet been made available by the Department.  There is &euro;1,000 available for each self-employed company that is not a rates-based payer.  When will that grant become available to small businesses?</p></speech>

On behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, I welcome the Bill.  The main reason for it is to remove the 50% portfolio cap under the Government's Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  The removal of the cap is a welcome move by the Government.  It negates a problem relating to the scheme whereby banks were refusing to lend to small businesses in dire need of affordable credit.  This aspect of the scheme was a problem that Sinn F&eacute;in identified many months ago and outlined in a letter to the Ministers for Finance and Business, Enterprise and Innovation of 13 May.  That letter stated that the design of the scheme was not fit for purpose and had resulted in negligible take-up from businesses and negligible loans issued from banks.  The portfolio cap meant that banks saw it as unattractive to loan moneys to SMEs through the scheme.  It also resulted in extremely high interest rates where banks did loan moneys.  The removal of this cap should make it easier and more attractive for banks to lend to SMEs.</p> <p>However, in addition to the removal of the caps, the Government should consider 90% to 100% State guaranteed loans with no repayments from businesses in the first 12 months, the State covering the cost of interest over that period and severely reduced interest rates thereafter.  We believe that should be the case because of the depth of the crisis into which we are facing.  Such measures would make the credit guarantee scheme much more attractive to business during this unprecedented and extremely difficult period.</p> <p>There have been rumblings in the media that the Government will also follow up with changes to the scheme along the lines of what Sinn F&eacute;in has been suggesting, namely, no repayments for businesses over the first 12 months and the State covering the cost of interest over that period.  The Government is also proposing low interest rates but we have not been told what "low" means.  We have proposed capping interest rates at 2.5%, with a preference for interest rates to be much lower than that.  The Minister of State might comment on that.</p> <p>The removal of the portfolio cap by the Government shows it is willing to listen to economic proposals from Sinn F&eacute;in.  I, therefore, ask the Government to go further and consider the full suite of measures laid down in our letter to the Minister for Finance of 13 May.  I will briefly run through those proposals.  Our scheme is called the back to business loan scheme.  It is a &euro;2 billion scheme that would have the following features: businesses would be able to borrow between &euro;2,000 and &euro;800,000, up to 25% of their annual turnover; zero interest with no repayments for the first 12 months; affordable rates of interest with no more than 2.5% applying after the first 12 months; no portfolio cap applied, with a 90% Government guarantee on loans; the level of guarantee to be reviewed each month with consideration given to the guarantee to 100% based on lending performance under the scheme; and no premium required to be paid for the cost of the guarantee.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->To be eligible under our scheme, businesses would have had to have suffered a 25% reduction in turnover as a result of Covid-19, to employ fewer than 250 people, and to have a turnover of &euro;50 million or less.  Those are our alternative proposals, which we believe would make the scheme much better.</p><p>I refer to the banks.  One issue our party has been very clear on is that the banks should not benefit from this scheme.  We do not believe they should defer any tax on profits.  Every year, Sinn F&eacute;in seeks to amend the finance Bill to disallow banks from deferring tax on their profits.  They especially should not be allowed to defer tax on a Government-backed loan scheme.  Under previous schemes similar to the scheme before us, they have charged commercial interest rates to businesses even though the loans were backed by Government with negative borrowing rates from the European Central Bank.  If the banks make profit under this scheme, they should pay tax on it and not be allowed to defer one cent.  </p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy English, has agreed to meet with my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, with regard to the interest rates charged, which is the real issue.  The Government has said it has a commitment to ensure interest rates for loans under this scheme will be low.  That is essential.  The interest rates charged on loans under similar Government-backed schemes are subject to normal business loan rates from the respective banks with an additional 0.5% charge because of the Government guarantee.</p><p>Businesses themselves have pointed out the flaws in this scheme as have organisations such as Chartered Accountants Ireland.  This organisation has highlighted first-hand reports of the problems businesses have had in accessing loans with interest rates as high as those under this scheme.  In its document, "The Next Financial Year: Making Irish Business More Competitive", it states that the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme is "too onerous and complex to administer and that the interest rates are prohibitive."  It also states that interest rates charged for any Government-backed schemes "need to be closer to ECB rates than commercial interest rates."  </p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has called for similarly low interest rates for a number of months.  We have been calling for interest rates to be capped at 2.5% and preferably for interest only to be applied at the level necessary to cover the overheads of administering the loans scheme.  Low interest rates for this scheme will encourage SMEs to take up the available loans.  We have heard that at first hand from businesses and their representatives.  They have also said that it would be a significant incentive and help if the loans were to be given free of interest and if repayments did not have to be made for the first 12 months.  I ask the Minister of State to consider the points we have made as he progresses the Bill further.</p></speech>

I also take the opportunity to wish all of our SMEs well on their reopening and to welcome the Minister of State to the House once again.</p> <p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I am sure we all recognise the importance of providing finance as quickly as possible to all businesses that have been affected by Covid-19.  This pandemic has had a devastating effect on every corner of this island.  Every small village, rural town and city has been affected.  It is vital that the Government responds quickly as we all know it is much easier to maintain jobs than to create them.  </p> <p>During debate on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill 2020, we discussed the importance of SMEs to our local communities.  They played a vital role in supporting us in the past and are doing so again at this, our most vulnerable time.  It is time that Government recognised this and supported this most important sector.  It is beyond time that these businesses can access essential finance through their banks and other financial outlets.  The impact of Covid on our SMEs cannot be underestimated.  We all know that, as has been said on many occasions, SMEs are the backbone of our economy.  They employed 1.3 million workers when the number in employment stood at 2.3 million.  </p> <p>The success of this Bill, which the Labour Party will support, will be judged on how well it makes finance available quickly and effortlessly to those who need it most.  We must see a greater volume of lending than occurred at previous times.  I mentioned during the debate on the other legislation the amount of assistance provided by LEOs throughout the country under the microenterprise loan scheme.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure the financial institutions involved in the administration of this loan assist those who need it and do not put unnecessary obstacles in the way of those applying.  As has been said by other speakers, the companies in need of this finance do not need red tape at this time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mark Wall:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarkWall&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I ask the Minister of State again to ensure the Government guarantee, as part of this loan, is met with similar assistance and help during the application process from the main financial providers.</p><p>He mentioned in his address the much-talked about, but more important, much-needed July stimulus package.  I continue to hear words such as "radical", "of scale" and "far-reaching".  It is simply the case that the stimulus has to be as such.  The Labour Party will judge the Government's July stimulus package and economic plan on the basis of five tests.  We have suggested a stimulus package of &euro;10 billion.  Whatever is announced today, there can be no going back.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a modern Ireland where a living wage is the norm rather than an aspiration.  It is an opportunity to target and address, once and for all, the weaknesses in Ireland's public infrastructure, including proper and resourced public transport, public housing and public care services including, most importantly, childcare.</p><p>I was pleased the Minister of State mentioned in the D&aacute;il the other day, on proposing the Bill, the enormous problems we have in this country with youth unemployment.  He indicated in the Seanad debate on the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Bill that the July stimulus package would address what is simply a national disgrace.  I use this opportunity to highlight once again that 45% of young people are unemployed, and of those employed, some 40% are in insecure work.  We have one of the highest youth unemployment rates in Europe.  We must address this through the stimulus.  Every 25 year old not currently in employment must have a guaranteed access to decent work and training.  We must recognise and develop a proper apprenticeship scheme, develop in-work training and provide access to remote learning for all those that need it.  We all recognise that the youth are our future; it is time that this recognition was translated into a youth work guarantee.</p><p>In his contribution in the D&aacute;il and again today, the Minister of State indicated that the T&aacute;naiste has made it clear in recent meetings with the chief executives of the three main banks, namely, Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, that the Government expects a significant reduction in the interest rates charged to enterprises for the loans and other financial products covered by this scheme.  In his reply, the Minister of State might elaborate on what he and the Department consider to be a significant reduction in the interest rates charged.  Surely, at a time the cost of borrowing is at an all-time low, the pillar banks should show their commitment to this country by charging a rate of interest that will encourage applications and, more important, reflect the fact that we as a nation assisted them when they needed our help.  The wheel has turned and now SMEs, which employ more than 60% of people working in this country, need our help.  I will not hold my breath waiting for the banks to respond.</p><p>The Bill should put in place a State-backed guarantee for companies and SMEs with up to 499 employees to enable them to go to their banks and access much-needed finance.  The business owners I speak to in Kildare are tired of applying for loans, taking on a further burden on themselves and, in many cases, their families.  The Minister of State rightly indicated that SME owners are the backbone of our communities, employing so many in the workforce, and from whom we seek support for voluntary clubs and associations.  In fairness, they have never been found wanting in supporting their communities.  They are the ones who worry in these exceptional circumstances how they will continue to operate or even to keep their doors open.  We will support the Bill to expedite the loans but we ask the Minister of State to consider further grant assistance rather than loans to this sector.  Notwithstanding what the Minister of State has outlined, perhaps it is time for a State guarantee of 90% or even 100%, as is happening in other countries.  We have all said that it is much easier to maintain jobs than to create new jobs.  The template has been created by the owners and management of SMEs.  It is the Government's job to ensure that template is maintained.  Perhaps the Department could look at the models outside Ireland and work to take the burden of debt away at this time.</p><p>I welcome the commitment by the Minister of State to track the guarantee in other countries.  We all appreciate that we are in unprecedented times.  We have a record number of people in unemployment and in receipt of State assistance.  It is the job of the Government to create the conditions for recovery, to ensure that citizens return to work and that young people have an outlet for employment rather than the local Intreo office.</p><p>The tourism sector is on its knees.  The Government must ensure that the conditions for the loans are clear and painless for those who so badly need help.  The interest charged by the banks must be minimal.  I thank SMEs for their ongoing support of our communities in the past and assure them of all our support in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-23a.91" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072300002#JJ00100"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This is another piece of legislation in the context of stimulus, which is badly needed for society and the economy in Ireland, across Europe and across the world in the aftermath of the Covid crisis.  As we identified many years ago, stimulus is the best response to a period of potential recession, rather than the austerity that was chosen in the past.  In that context, it is important to note that yesterday the European fund was put in place.  There were some disappointments in the decisions made about the EU recovery deal yesterday.  It is important and good that a deal was struck.  That is something everybody welcomes.  It was disappointing, however, to see that the portion that was grants rather than loans was reduced.  Many people in the House today have spoken about the fact that there are times when grants, rather than loans, are the right tools.  The portion that was grants was reduced from &euro;500 billion to &euro;390 billion.</p> <p>With regard to that portion of the &euro;390 billion that is for the recovery and resilience fund, each country will put in place a national plan.  It seems likely that the portion Ireland will get in the national plan for grant money - not for loans - may be &euro;3 billion to &euro;4 billion.  I hope that money is given to public expenditure.  This is a chance to have public expenditure, public employment, capital schemes and national infrastructure.  There will be many parts of all the schemes.  We heard all the measures today and they are appropriate for SMEs of the private sector but it is vital we invest in the public sector and in public jobs.  As described earlier, we have huge youth unemployment and it may have to be, in some cases, the State employing people to do important work.  The State may have to build and buy things.  That is part of the economy.  That is a crucial part of keeping our economy vibrant.  It is something we have control over and can actually do.  We have heard lots of measures in relation to some parts of the economy but we need to hear the Government's plan on public spending, services, infrastructure and employment.  How will we increase that and make sure that creates the jobs, stimulus, dynamic change and new public goods that we will have for generations into the future and that the State needs?  Will the national plan under the recovery and resilience fund be one of those instruments?</p> <p>In relation to the legislation before us today, everybody supports the need for loans to the SME sector, especially with regard to some of the smaller businesses, as has been talked about here.  I welcome, as everybody has, the idea that was spoken about of primary producers.  We know many primary producers during the period of Covid have had to become their own retail.  It has been interesting to see many primary producers going directly into communication, sales and relationships with customers.  That is cutting out the middleman, which sometimes has to be done and it was put eloquently by Senator Keogan.  The issue with this Bill and the concerns around it relate to the banks and the fact the banks have not been lending and are not taking risks.  We have businesses that are taking risks.  We have workers who are turning up and standing behind counters, taking real personal risks to keep businesses afloat and keep their families provided for.  Businesses, workers and the State are taking risks and banks are still not taking risks of any kind.  However, when they make profits, they also do not contribute.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a situation with the credit guarantee whereby the State underwrites 80% of the risk.  Many of these loans may allow businesses to succeed and thrive if they are managed right, with long-term vision and the 12-month suspension as recommended by Sinn F&eacute;in.  If the banks make profit from those loans, they are going to keep all of that.  This is because the banks in Ireland have been using the deferred taxation asset scheme to write off all their taxes and effectively pay zero taxes for a long time.  They have been using the losses of the last crisis as an excuse to not pay tax on very large profits they have been making for many years.  Now we have a new crisis and the banks have an opportunity to be part of the stepping up and the taking of risks to contribute and help support the society and economy in which they exist.  Once again however, they are not doing so.  We as a State, every citizen, took a risk for them but they will not take one for us.  Despite this they want to keep every penny of their profits.</p><p>I have tabled two amendments but as one is going to be ruled out of order, I will mention it now.  It was a simple thing.  It provided that if the State is taking 80% of the risk and the banks are taking only 20%, then they should only be able to write off 20% of the profit.  That is very reasonable.  If we are basically putting up the stakes then why should everything go back to the banks when something is profitable?  Again, my suggestion in this regard will not be taken up but I am seeking a report on this.  We are going to have a chance to discuss that with the amendments.  We need to have a conversation on the direct economic, moral, political policy link between the State guaranteeing the banks and the banks not contributing to the State.  Those two things are not compatible.</p><p>I am suggesting a report which will look at this guarantee and at the previous guarantees.  In the past, Fianna F&aacute;il very reasonably had it at 50% at one point, in that deferred taxation could only be used for the write-off of 50% of the profit.  That is a reasonable measure compared to using it for 100% of the profit.  Apparently it is estimated that the deferred taxation asset scheme will be used to ensure that Permanent TSB does not pay tax until 2038 and AIB will not pay any tax until 2037.  The overall loss in forgone tax revenue from the financial sector is &euro;12 billion, which is substantial.  That money coming into the State could be used for direct State loans.  It could be used, for example, to make the State a major customer of small businesses through public procurement.  It could be used for State-supported and subsidised employment.  It could be used to cut out the middleman and have direct State support for enterprise, business, SMEs and primary producers.  It is one thing for us to protect them from the risk associated with the loans they give out but it cannot be both things.  If we are giving with one hand, the State needs to be able and willing to take with other hand when it comes to taxation and to make sure that whatever revenue is available in this State is directed where it should be, namely, into our society and into our economy.</p></speech>

Some good points of view are being expressed and some genuine concerns are also being expressed right around the House.</p> <p>Like my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, I welcome the legislation, which provides, as has been said, the largest credit guarantee in the history of the State.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eugene Murphy:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2444"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2444&amp;amp;pid=EugeneMurphy&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I welcome the Minister of State.  I have no doubt he will give all his energies to ensuring this scheme is a success.  As everyone knows, we are in a unique situation.  We all know what has happened to businesses up and down the country and the struggles and worries they have.  Employees in those businesses are also unsure of their futures.  It is crucial that additional lending is made available to businesses seeking to restart.  The SME sector has already endured massive challenges in dealing with previous economic difficulties and more recently, in preparing for Brexit, which is another challenge on the way.  SMEs have shown that they are flexible, pioneering and nimble in how they rise to many challenges.  They also have clear requirements when compared with other areas of the economy.  Those needs are what we are trying to address.</p><p>The measures in this Bill are vital and must be progressed through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  We welcome the move to take all Stages of this Bill in both Houses this week.  This comes in the wake of the speedy passage of the Financial Provisions (Covid-19) Act 2020 last week and the Microenterprise Loan Fund (Amendment) Act 2020 the week before last.  The Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Covid-19) Bill 2020 is also due to come before us soon.  All this indicates the seriousness with which the new Government is facing up to this economic challenge.  There is no hanging about here because we cannot afford to do so.  We have to show every bit of support we can to businesses at this point because if the businesses cannot survive and re-employ people, a whole new problem will be created for workers, their families and communities.  SMEs, which can have up to 499 employees, will be the main beneficiaries of this legislation.  I am glad to see that agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, fishing and all those areas will be included as well.</p><p>This Bill is mostly about overdrafts, term loans and working capital, but I will briefly refer to the banks.  Like others, I hope the banks will be very honourable in this situation and that they will not come up with excuses that lead to them deciding some businesses are not viable for the future.  The Government, and therefore the taxpayer, is taking the main part of the risk here through the 80% guarantee.  It is very important that banks do not dictate, use red tape or deny a company because a direct debit bounced during the extraordinary situation we have been in recently.  That all needs to be cut out because if that starts to happen, many of the smaller businesses will not survive and will not be part of our reviving economy going forward.  That is the reality. </p><p>I am glad to see that the local enterprise offices, LEOs, will be expanded.  The LEOs in every county are very important for local businesses, connections, contacts, groups and mentoring.  Much of that is very important and I am glad to see it.</p><p>I do not see anything about credit unions having a role in this.  Maybe they have-----</p></speech>

The Minister of State might give us an explanation of that role.  The most important thing now is getting this legislation through the Houses and implementing it as quickly as possible.  That is so important.  We must move forward and help those businesses and the many small business people to whom I have spoken who are so determined to get back, to survive and to take back their employees.  They want that helping hand from the State.  This legislation and the stimulus package that will be announced this afternoon should give them great hope, which will drive the country on.  Hopefully, in time, this virus will disappear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-23a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1665" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072300002#LL00400"><p>The Minister of State is welcome to the Chamber.  I welcome the publication of this legislation and the opportunity to say a few words on it.  As the T&aacute;naiste has highlighted, this scheme will be the largest credit guarantee scheme for businesses in the history of the State.  That is not by accident.  The impact Covid-19 continues to have on businesses of all types and sizes in Ireland is unprecedented.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Se&aacute;n Kyne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=32&amp;amp;MemberID=2343"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2343&amp;amp;pid=SeanKyne&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It demands an unprecedented response from the Government and for all of us in the Houses to do everything we can to protect jobs and businesses throughout the country.  This scheme is different in that it is targeted primarily at SMEs as well as the agribusiness and marine sectors.</p><p>The importance of SMEs to our country cannot be overstated.  Last year, the Seanad Public Consultation Committee compiled a report on small and medium-sized business in Ireland.  That report, on which some of my colleagues worked, examined the SME landscape in Ireland, the challenges and stresses facing SMEs, the type of supports needed and the opportunities.  The report emphasised that the SME sector is the backbone of the economy.  It is the main source of jobs and enterprises, in that SMEs operate in a wide range of sectors.  The data back up these facts.  For example, in Galway, more than 92% of businesses are microenterprises that employ fewer than ten people, and more than 50,000 people in the city and county work for an SME.  It is clear the new guarantee scheme will benefit the vast majority of businesses and, in turn, workers in Galway should it be needed.  Another important observation from the report is that larger companies and multinationals have access to funding from international sources so when there are difficulties in accessing credit and financial support domestically, SMEs are the businesses that suffer.  Through the credit guarantee scheme the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland will support the provision of financial products through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank to SMEs whose actual or projected turnover or profit has been impacted by a minimum of 15%. </p><p>Earlier this week, following lengthy negotiations, a &euro;1.8 trillion agreement, including at a new seven-year budget and Covid support package, was agreed by the European Council.  It is timely, therefore, to note the credit guarantee scheme will operate through the EU's temporary framework for state aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak.  While I fully understand the need for a level playing field in the Single Market, in my time as a public representative I have seen up close the negative impacts that state aid rules can have.  That communities in the west, such as Gaeltacht areas and islands, face completely different challenges to communities in the conurbations of the continent cannot be ignored.  These challenges exist at the best of times.  At the worst of times, they can mean the demise of businesses and jobs with knock-on consequences for communities.</p><p>The recent developments regarding vaccines, particularly from Oxford, are very encouraging but we need to accept that Covid-19 will continue to be a serious challenge for our country, and for all countries, for some time to come.  Use of the word "current" in the EU framework to describe the Covid-19 outbreak is an acknowledgement that a solution to Covid-19 is not imminent.  In this context, the time limit of the end of this year for lending under the guarantee scheme is a concern.  It would provide much needed certainty for businesses if we agreed that section 5(2) be extended until the end of 2021.  Is it is anticipated, based on the calculations, that the fund will be exhausted by the end of the year?  What direct engagement with businesses will the Department have on awareness and promotion of the fund?  I certainly welcome the Bill and the fund it incorporates, as agreed by the Government last May.</p></speech>

As many Members have said, it is important legislation given the gargantuan impact that Covid-19 has had on our SMEs.  They are run by people we all know in our communities such as the hairdresser, the restaurant, the cafe and the play centre.  Senator Kyne and the Acting Chairman also referenced various communities.</p> <p>It is important that access to finance be made available.  I concur completely with Senator Murphy that there cannot be red tape.  There must be prompt immediate access to credit and finance.  We speak about stimulus, and the stimulus plan being announced today is important.  It will be a strong key pillar of the recovery.  Access to credit is profoundly important.  If we are to do anything differently, and Senator Higgins made reference to the banks earlier, we must get the balance right between how the banks behaved in the early part of the century and now.  I agree with the Senator that they must take some risks now to help employers.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Jerry Buttimer:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=2225"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2225&amp;amp;pid=JerryButtimer&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I agree with Senator Higgins.  They must take some risks now to incentivise and help people who are employers.  </p><p>Tourism, hospitality and aviation have been the hardest hit in this pandemic.  The scaffolding we put around all sectors of our economy, whether it is overdrafts, term limits, working capital or Government saying, through local authorities, to put a long-term pause on rates, is one that we should consider.  I welcome the decision of the European Council this week.  There must be a balance between the loans and grants referenced by Senator Higgins.  I agree with her that there must be a balance.  If we are to be resilient as a country then our national plan is important.  </p><p>It is not the Minister of State's responsibility but the aviation sector has been particularly hit.  I am referencing Cork Airport, the second busiest airport in the country and a key economic driver of jobs in the southern region.  The half-year results show that Cork Airport will potentially lose &euro;23 million this year with passenger numbers, as we know, plummeting and jobs being lost in a variety of ways.  The aviation sector is a key enabler of our biggest indigenous employer, namely, tourism and hospitality.  I hope the Government will consider the economic impact through the task force report on aviation recovery and start looking at its implementation.</p><p>The path to rebuilding our economy begins with us and through the work the Government undertakes today with this Bill and the stimulus plan, but also through working with people to rebuild our economy.  Our economy is about the men and women who are risk-takers but who are also employees.  We must ensure that we get our country back in a safe and sustainable way.  Members have referenced the numbers of people involved in employment being approximately 2.3 million, or 238,000 small and medium enterprises.  It is critical, in fact it is essential, that our banking sector is not just spoken to, but is given targets to meet, and is held to account in how it deals in a fair way with business owners.  We all have stories of how banks treat people.  It is absolutely essential that the banks work with people.  I know we must get the balance and we cannot go back to where we were.  The Government should look at the credit union movement and how it can work with it.  Money is sitting on deposit in credit unions that can be used to rebuild our economy.</p><p>I will conclude on this.  It is about income support, grants, access to cheap credit and ensuring we can retain and create new opportunities for jobs.  I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to youth unemployment.  I thank him for his work and wish him well.</p></speech>

How small-sized and medium-sized businesses will survive in the future is one of the key issues.  That is why this legislation is so important.  I welcome the indication that the primary producers are being included.  The fishermen, farmers and food companies are all very much a part of our rural enterprise and rural economy and the ability for them to access the actual funding is welcome.</p> <p>Going forward, we need more of these schemes.  To have a scheme with this ability to have an 80% guarantee to the State is a really important initiative.  In many ways, it gives confidence to the sectors that they can actually go out and invest again.  The pressure the tourism industry is under at the moment is immense.  Hotels would say if they are opening at 20% capacity they are probably losing drastic sums of money.  The ability for them to invest and keep going, particularly during the winter period, will be an enormous challenge.  In particular, the rural parts of this country, whether it is the west or south, really need to have that stimulus package required for our tourism industry because if we do not, we will not have that industry going forward.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tim Lombard:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2466"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2466&amp;amp;pid=TimLombard&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If it is not provided, the industry will not continue to exist.</p><p>The food industry has been included in the package.

The Bill is putting confidence back into these sectors.  That is why it is important.  We are in troubled and unbelievable times.  We are living through history and because of that, we need a different approach which this Bill provides.</p><p>I welcome the Bill.  We need to enact it as soon as possible.

I will also deal with Committee and Report Stages.</p> <p>I thank Members for their support for the Bill.  I sense that there is general support for it, although some have concerns and worries about the ability of the banks to respond to the situation.  The discussion is similar to that which we had here two weeks ago.  It is a recognition by Members of the importance of supporting businesses and reaching out to them as best as we possibly can.</p> <p>It is important to remind Senators that this is only one part of our toolkit to support businesses.  There are a range of supports.  The July stimulus plan will be announced later today and if it is agreed by the Cabinet, it will enhance those supports, including the restart grants mentioned by Senators.  There will be confirmation in respect of the wage subsidy scheme, as well as support for the tourism sector, which has been mentioned by many Senators.  Ongoing supports for certain sectors are needed.  We will be able to build on what is in the Bill.</p> <p>The Bill addresses liquidity and access to finance, which companies need and want.  We would all prefer for there to be grants rather than loans, a point made by Senators Casey and Crowe and many others.  We have to introduce a combination of both.  It would be great if, as a country, we were in a position to grant aid everything but we are not.  I do not think any country in its response to this crisis is able to do that.  It is important to have the right combination of grants and loans.</p> <p>We must recognise that the initial response to Covid-19, after the health response, involved support of about &euro;12 billion.  The wage subsidy scheme alone comprised over &euro;2 billion in taxpayer subsidised support as of yesterday.  The July stimulus will build on that.  The &euro;2 billion fund in the Bill is part of previous announcements and is now coming through.</p> <p>We will add to this in the budget and the economic plan.  The previous Government and this Government, as well as future Governments, will add, respond and make changes to the Bill where necessary.  This should not be seen as being just one intervention.</p> <p>I want to allay fears around what will happen with the banks.  The T&aacute;naiste and the team in my Department and other Departments have already sat down with the banks, and will do so again in the weeks ahead once the Bill has been passed, to go through the details of the scheme.  The requirement of the scheme is that there is an reduction in interest rates and greater access for SMEs in order that they can draw down funding under better terms and conditions. </p> <p>As I said, there will be a range of policies.  Senator Gavan asked for this to be put into legislation, but that cannot be done.  There will be different schemes and solutions, and a table will show the better offerings available compared to what was previously available.  That will be very clear and transparent.  We will monitor that through the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and our own network. </p> <p>Senator Kyne asked about engagement.  We will engage with the sector, through representative bodies, individual businesses, our Department and all our networks and we will keep an eye on and monitor the situation to ensure the scheme is working.  We can come back to the House if it is not.  Most Senators will recognise that we cannot put everything into the Bill.  There can be discussion and debate.</p> <p>Senators Crowe, Casey and others are in business and can see what is happening.  They know how difficult things are and understand the nature of the response will involve a blend of solutions that can be adapted and increased as we go along.  As Senator Crowe said, the most important thing is that the scheme is up and running as quickly as possible.  That is why I want to thank the House for facilitating the debate today and fast-tracking the Bill through the House.  We want to reach out to businesses as quickly as we possibly can.  Ideally, this would have been signed off on in May.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We were not here in a formal capacity as a new Government so we could not do that but we are here now.  It is important that we react and that is what we are trying to do.</p><p>Everyone welcomes the wage subsidy and it is important that we recognise it as a subvention for jobs and businesses from the State through the taxpayer.  Everyone benefits from that.  We are looking to expand grant levels, which was an issue that many Senators raised.  We are looking at the restart grants to make them more accessible and include a different range of businesses and make a larger amount available than that in the July stimulus package.  That will have to pass at Cabinet level and we will see how that goes.</p><p>I totally get Senator Casey when he says that businesses do not want more debt.  I get that.  Part of this scheme will involve refinancing existing debt and making loans cheaper.  </p><p>Issues about grants, deferral of tax and many other matters were raised.  Senator Casey also asked about an independence in the system, which is a fair point.  The Credit Review Office is there and has worked quite well over the past number of years.  That office is there to bring independence.  There is an appeal mechanism within the existing bank network and a credit review for all credit decisions.  That can be utilised more because it is a good service.  I think decisions are overturned and a loan issued in approximately 50% of the cases with which that office deals, although I stand to be corrected on that.  I think that figure is roughly correct but I will check it when I meet with representatives of that office next week.</p><p>Apart from the usual system of monitoring what is happening with bank loans and the issue of lending, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, which will administer the scheme on behalf of the Government, will also monitor activity.  The way the scheme works is that banks will be apportioned some of this guarantee funding and if they do not use it or draw it down, or if they make their terms sufficiently unattractive that their customers do not want it, we can reapportion it and the guarantee will be given to another bank.  That is what we will try to do there.  We can monitor things and that should bring the independence the Senator wants.  I know what he is saying overall about independence.  There is a doubt and mistrust of the banks from most people, and I accept that.  We are trying to work on that issue.</p><p>Some Senators have talked about restaurants and bars.  Senator Ahearn raised the example of a restaurant that was ready to launch but was not an existing business.  We will look at that area and see if we can do anything.  There is an effort with the restart grant to try and accommodate businesses that were not rate payers.  It may be under that space that a restaurant that was not a rate payer, such as the one the Senator mentioned, might come in.  We were looking to increase that from &euro;2,000 so there may be space there.  Others are probably able to give examples from around the country.  We try to adapt or look at schemes where necessary.</p><p>Farmers and producers are very happy that they are to be involved in this scheme.  Senator Lombard, Senator Ahearn and others mentioned those types of people.  It is important that farmers and producers are included and that is the change in criteria.  Many Senators have referenced the existing credit guarantee scheme, saying that it has not been effective enough and has not worked.  I reiterate that the schemes are totally different.  The Senators who have drawn the comparison are comparing two different schemes, the old one and the new one.  Farmers and farm producers will be a part of this scheme and we will try to reach out to them as best we possibly can.</p><p>I recognise the network of LEOs, be they in Tipperary, as mentioned by Senator Ahearn, or anywhere else.  LEOs are doing great work.  We are trying to find ways to beef up their staffing and give them more resources to allow them to do more work.  LEOs have an even greater reach now, since the Covid-19 crisis, and have been helping many more companies with financial products and drawing down available supports through filling out financial application forms and so on.  LEOs have been offering advice on the different funds available and online trading.  We will try to work with LEOs because they do great work.  We will do work through local authorities, along with Enterprise Ireland and our Department.  LEOs will be well stretched and we recognise the increase in their reach and in the demands on their time, along with all other agencies, over the past few weeks.</p><p>There was a request that the restart grant would reach out further to include bed and breakfast accommodation and sports bodies.  Many Senators made that point today and in recent days.  GP surgeries were also mentioned.  There is a range of areas that were not catered for in the existing grant scheme for which there will be an attempt to cater in announcements to come in the days ahead.</p><p>Senator Keogan raised a couple of issues.  Some of the information she has about the scheme is probably out of date and she might want to check some of her sources.  It is absolutely not true to say that 90% of businesses cannot avail of this grant.  That is not the case whatsoever and I am not sure where she is getting that statistic.  If it is helpful, the term she used referring to "firms in difficulty" is to do with old state aid rules.  Under this framework, some of those state aid rules have been adjusted in part.  This temporary framework recognises that firms are in trouble and the majority of them will need help.  To be eligible this time around, firms must show that their turnover has been affected by more than 15% in the past few months or the time period ahead.  I would like the Senator to recognise that change.  She stated as fact that 90% of businesses cannot avail of the grant but I will state as fact that it is not true.  This scheme will be very accessible for SMEs and will be used but they will have to address the turnover issue I have mentioned.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Some Senators have expressed issues with the banks.  We want to get this support out as quickly as we can and the best, most effective and cheapest way to do that is to use the existing bank network.  If we were to set up an entirely new system, we would not have the offering out to the companies before December and we would not be able to do it at this cost.  We are not giving the banks additional profits.  The aim is that the benefits of the scheme be passed on to businesses through low interest rates.</p><p>A number of speakers have a concern that we are de-risking the banks and taking all the risks with the 80:20 arrangements whereas some want 90:10 and so on.  The reason we give a guarantee and de-risk is to have a lower cost of finance and to reach out to the companies who cannot borrow under existing terms and conditions.  There is a reason we take that risk.  The reason the taxpayer is potentially on the hook for &euro;1.6 billion is the banks will pass on a reduction in the interest rate and make available lower cost money.  The banks do not have to do that if they do not want to.  If they want to draw down our guarantee, it will come with a request to them regarding interest rates, availability and terms and conditions.  That is what it is about; it is not about the banks not taking risks.  We are subsidising their risk because we are asking them to do something they might not want to do or be in a position to do.  That is the difference and that is why we have a credit guarantee scheme and why it has been successful all over Europe and will be successful here.</p><p>Many Senators are quoting figures from recent months or years.  They are not comparable because they refer to a different scheme.  Under this legislation, we are amending the credit guarantee scheme.  The portfolio cap is a major difference and that is why money will be made available cheaper and we fully expect to see a massive increase in the drawdown on this scheme.  It will be a much more successful scheme.  The credit guarantee scheme was introduced in 2012, not 2008 as stated by some Members and it was amended in 2016, but there was not a massive draw on it because it probably was not needed.  We had a jobs recovery, and businesses and the economy were doing well.  It was brought in to deal with a problem of the 2008-2012 period but by the time it was up and running and with different conditions, it was not of great benefit.  It was not needed and there was no big demand in either House to change it but there is now because of Covid-19.  We need a new scheme and that is what we are getting.</p><p>As I said would probably happen, Members used the UK scheme to compare ours, without going into the proper details.  There are two schemes in the UK.  One is for microloans below &euro;50,000 and it is similar to ours.  Above that, there is another scheme, which is also similar to ours, for loans ranging from &euro;10,000 to &euro;1 million with an 80:20 guarantee.  There will be lower interest rates and it is comparable to the UK model.  I would rather people did not compare apples and oranges.  They should compare like with like and if we are still different, we can row over that.  However, there are two different loan schemes in the UK.  The bounceback loan is for under &euro;50,000.  We have a similar scheme here from Microfinance Ireland.  We debated it in the House two weeks ago.  There is a massive draw on that.  Applications are up eightfold.  It is a successful scheme and we are building on that, as we said we would last week.  We committed to working on the interest rates, and we are doing that as well so we are making good progress there.</p><p>The enterprise support grant, which Senator Keogan asked about, is not administered through our Department.  The grant is available to self-employed people who close their PUP claim after 25 June.  It is administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is in charge of it.  It was available to those who had closed their PUP claims and who had employed fewer than ten people.  It was only available after 24 June, which is literally four-----</p></speech>

I am telling the Senator what it is about and I will check it with the Minister.</p> <p>Senator Higgins asked about the EU recovery plan and what it can be used for.  She made a good point about using that funding for public investment and public services.  A major part of the response following Covid-19 will be building public capacity and investing in our public services, our public response and our public capital spend as well.  It is different from what happened following the previous crash.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We had the austerity versus stimulus conversation two weeks ago.  We were not in a position after the previous crash to invest in capital.  No one would give us money; we could not get it.  Thankfully, we are now committed to spending more than &euro;150 billion on capital and we will increase that figure.  There is plenty of capacity for public investment, both capital and current, and also for investing in our ability to respond as a country to health scenarios and so on.  The Senator is right to flag that but it is well flagged in the programme for Government that it is also our intention.  Senator Keogan has put it in clearer, more straightforward terms but we are on the same page.  We need to make sure it happens and businesses have access to different types of funding.  This could be our own funding or, as the Senator said, maybe we could draw down some funding from the EU recovery plan.  I am sure that is being looked at.  The plan was signed off on by the European Council this week but it still has to go through the European Parliament.  We have to ensure that happens as well.  I have no doubt Irish MEPs will have a say in that as well.  That European funding will not be used for the credit guarantee scheme but in other areas.  I have no doubt Ireland will be able to benefit from it.  We worked hard on that scheme to ensure there was the right balance of grants versus other funding, although I know people have different concerns on that.</p><p>I think I have covered nearly everything.  Senator Wall mentioned the living wage and youth unemployment.  There are strong commitments to a living wage in the programme for Government.  It is a matter of setting out how we get there.  I will be honest and say that these initial efforts were to aimed at providing a quick response to all the businesses.  When everything has stabilised, we can focus on the plan to have a living wage in place in the lifetime of the Government.  That is what we are trying to do and there are different ways of achieving that.  A motion on this was tabled in the D&aacute;il last week and there are different versions of the living wage.  The minimum wage system has worked well so we might see how we can use that scheme or other schemes.  Some people have called for a task force on the issue.  While that is a conversation we need to have, it is not one for the next couple of weeks.  We want to get the July stimulus plan out and get businesses reopened, stabilised and growing again.   We want to get people back to work and that is happening, thankfully, every week but we need to built on that.  That conversation is definitely one to be had.</p><p>Senator Wall correctly raised youth unemployment and I fully support him on the issue.  There will be some initial responses today and we will build on that.  I totally agree with the Senator that young people have to be protected during this crisis.  They are a very vulnerable cohort in employment terms.  They are highly skilled and motivated and we need to work with them to ensure they are either in education or in a job.  That could involve a form of youth guarantee or whatever it takes.  There are different ways of doing this but we must do it.  The Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and others are very much committed to that and the Minister for Social Protection and Employment Affairs, Deputy Humphreys, and Minister with responsibility for Higher Education, Deputy Harris, will probably lead the charge on it.</p><p>Senator Wall mentioned apprenticeships.  I firmly believe in education on the job.  We have much to gain from the further education and training sector.  The conversation is too often focused only on higher education.  That is a mistake that many countries in Europe have made.  The further education and training sector has much to offer and it certainly offers a very affordable way to access education.  Many careers are best served by on-the-job training as opposed to a higher education course in college.  The blend provided in further education is correct.  We should look at what the job and career need.  The conversation too often focuses around a person and what they want or need whereas it should be what is best for the particular career.  People often forget that some very high profile people like Alex Ferguson were apprentices.  There are loads of different ways to look at this.  In fairness to the Labour Party, it has done considerable work on this.  Five or six years ago, I worked with the former Minister for Education and Skills, Ms Jan O'Sullivan, on changing the whole story as regards apprenticeships.  At that time, there were fewer than 29 routes to apprenticeships.  That figure is now well over 60 and there is a commitment to go much further.  More than 4,000 new apprentices have signed up this year, which is a very positive story.  We need to build on that and ensure those apprentices are protected during the Covid pandemic.  There are strong commitments on apprenticeships and funding has been allocated.  The Senator was right to identify this issue.  Apprenticeships are available for everybody, not only young people, although there is a particular focus on young people.  We need to have a plan of action so young people know where they are going and how they can develop careers across various sectors.</p><p>Senator Higgins spoke about building resilience, which is what we are trying to do with these supports.  While I recognise that some people want grants rather than loans, loans give businesses a bit of space.  If businesses get a low-cost loan over six years, they will have time to reaffirm what they are doing and respond, adapt and grow.</p><p>Irish SMEs have shown great resilience over the years.  We need to build on that.  The Department also wants to encourage those same SMEs to think bigger and to think of growth plans.  That is why we invest a lot in research and development, and innovation.  We want businesses, especially in retail, to trade more online.  A massive amount of money is being spent daily, or even hourly, on retail abroad and that money is leaving the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Damien English:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=1781"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no reason our retail sector cannot take part in that because we are a very successful exporting nation.  Even in retail, there are many opportunities to win some of the market share of other countries, as well as holding on to some of our own market share.  The Senator is right about recovery, resilience, and investing in business.  That is what we will do and keep doing.</p><p>I will come back to the banks in a moment but Senator Gavan asked about the 90:10 guarantee ratio.  We think a 80:20 ratio is the right place to land, although different countries are doing different things.  I referred to Denmark, Austria, and a few others but I acknowledge that France has a 90:10 ratio.  We think we are in the right space here, but we will monitor it.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, is there and we are working with the banks.</p><p>Senator Murphy asked about the credit unions.  The initial conversation around this scheme was with the three main pillar banks because they cater for 90% of the market.  However, more than 70% of this guarantee will be made available in an open call to all lending institutions.  Credit unions and other sectors can compete for that and I hope they do.  As a few Senators, including Senator Buttimer, mentioned, credit unions have a lot of money available, which they want to either loan or invest.  There is great potential to tap much more into the credit union movement.  From a housing point of view, there is a lot of capacity for credit unions to invest in housing for people who are ageing and to get into that market, so we look forward to that.  They can access this guarantee, as it is for them as well. </p><p>Senator Kyne noted the significance of microbusinesses and SMEs in Galway.  That importance is common to all our areas because that is what we are trying to achieve.  He requested that the Department link in with all businesses about this guarantee fund and the other supports we have.  That is something we try to do regularly and we use a network of our various agencies to do so.  However, it is an ongoing battle.  For example, many companies which are entitled to the restart grant still have not claimed it.  We have to constantly reach out to companies and we do so through all Departments and through Government messaging.  We all have a role in that because these businesses are coming to us every day of the week and that is our job as public representatives.  We get the message out through our councillor network to try to reach them, but we will get it out directly through the Department as well.</p><p>Senator Buttimer raised play centres, leisure centres, activity centres, caf&eacute;s and all those different sectors, which often fall between two stools.  I am committed to working with those sectors to ensure they get the supports they need because it is a difficult space.  Some businesses will find it very hard to get their customers back in the door again and they will need us to help and protect them through that.  They have a great organisation themselves, namely, Play Activity and Leisure Ireland, PALI, which is doing good work.  We need to be able to work with them because there are issues in respect of restart grants, wage subsidies, insurance costs and so on.  We believe the restart grant is a decent amount of money to help with some of those initial fixed costs and we will try to build on that with rates and so on as we go along.</p><p>The deferred tax credit for banks was raised and is the subject of some amendments.  However, it is not overly relevant in this piece because the profits are to be passed on to the SMEs.  This scheme is not for the banks to make a profit.  I want to be clear on that.  The deferred tax assets scheme, which Senator Higgins and others raised, is not really impacted by the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme because the benefits of this guarantee are going to the enterprises and not the finance provider, in line with the requirements of the European Commission's temporary framework for state aid.  That is what this is about.  It is about supports for businesses, not banks.  Senator Higgins has tabled an amendment on this issue so we will touch on it in that discussion as well.  The loss relief for corporation tax is a long-standing feature of the Irish corporate tax system.  It allows for losses incurred in the cost of business to be accounted for when calculating the business's tax liabilities and this mechanism is a standard feature of corporation tax systems in all OECD countries.  We have it here.  Senator Higgins raises this issue quite a lot when it comes to banks and we can discuss it again.  Banks can bring forward that trading loss for a number of years.  It is not really a conversation for this Bill because it is a matter for the Department of Finance but the benefits of this credit guarantee scheme go to businesses, not to banks.  The Senator's issue is-----</p></speech>

My hope was that it would have been a potential saving for the State.  Earlier, the Minister of State called for accuracy from others in the House.  With regard to being accurate, I know the policy intent is that the SMEs benefit but if there is interest on the loans there is still a profit mechanism built into that money and finance.  In a scenario where these loans are successful and the businesses thrive, the profit would go into the banks and would be part of their annual profits.  The focus is not the amount, as I think that will probably be small, but there is an important point of principle.  The point of principle that applies here also extends to other credit guarantees that have been given.  There are also questions about the bank guarantees.  There is a strong link.  This is the principle that those who do not take the risk should not be allowed to keep all of the profit.  Unfortunately, the amendment has been ruled out of order.  With great respect, I understand the Cathaoirleach is bound in this regard so I will wait to make further points on the other amendment I have tabled.</p></speech>

After the legislation passes through the Houses we will complete agreements with the banks.  Agreements will be signed between the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, ourselves and the banks, which will detail what they intend to do.  We will have tables that will show the benefit of the scheme and the guarantee.  The legislation is intended to provide assistance from the State to qualifying enterprises.  It leverages financial institutions in the network to provide much-needed liquidity to SMEs.  The benefits under the EU framework are for SMEs and not for banks.</p> <p>The Senator mentioned the banks making a profit if the loans are successful.  If the loans are successful there will be no drawing on the guarantee because it is to guarantee the loan.  It is used if the loans are not successful.  To be clear, this is not to give the banks increased or excess profits.  It is to introduce an interest reduction.  That is what we are trying to do.  This is the benefit to the SME.  There is no benefit to the bank if there is an interest reduction because it will receive less interest.  The guarantee puts them in a position to lend.  We want banks to loan the money at a lower cost in a greater capacity.  This is why we are choosing to do this.  We are asking the banks to loan this money.  We are giving this guarantee because we want SMEs supported.</p></speech>

I have accepted this.  The Minister of State called for people to be factual earlier and he needs to be factual.  Of course, it would only be called on if there were a loss.  This is the legislation whereby the State says if there is loss it will take that hit.  What I am pointing out is that there is still a profit even at 2% or 1%, and I hope it is very low.  I would be delighted if the Minister of State were to inform me, for example, that any interest made on those loans that are successful goes back in some way to other enterprises that might be struggling more.  Perhaps any profit that comes from those who use the scheme and succeed will be redirected to give leniency to those who might be struggling or take a longer time.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2020&amp;amp;month=07&amp;amp;day=23"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That would be a situation in which there was not profit and it was redirected within the scheme.  That is certainly not in what is before us today.  I look forward to seeing the statutory instruments when they are drawn up, but at the moment there is the potential for loss which the State absorbs 80% of.  There is a potential for profit, which the banks will hold.  That is a fact, that is how it is.  We should be clear on it.  I absolutely realise that the policy intent is that the State wants to drive this to happen but let us be clear.</p></speech>

They might fail and we would lose jobs.  We want to do this, it is a business support and that is what we are trying to do here.  Most people understand the necessity of doing that because this lending might not happen without this guarantee.  As such it is about saving jobs and businesses.  That is what we are trying to do and it is important that we do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2020-07-23a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2020072300002#UU00300"><p>On the area of the guarantee, the big game-changer is that the State is now backing these loans to 80%.</p> <p>A lot of the SMEs have been through a horrendous time with the banking industry.  There is very little trust between the SME sector and the banking sector.  The banks were offering the SME sector millions of euro in 2008 and 2009 but would not even give them a &euro;50,000 overdraft in 2011 or 2012 when they needed it to survive.  The banks asked the SMEs to put their own pension schemes on the line and to put their children's education fund on the line to keep their businesses going.  As such there is an element of mistrust between the banking industry and the SME sector.  I want this to work.  The Minister of State wants this to work.  Everybody wants this to work because it has to work for us to survive.  This goes back to the independence of the banking sector in making decisions.  I am the last one who wants to add layers of bureaucracy to this process.  I want to get access to this funding as quickly as possible.  However, the funding provided to the sector must stand up and must be credible.  There is no point in us funding businesses that probably cannot survive.</p> <p>This is where the industry lead, which in my industry is F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has a great role to play as the intermediary.  Perhaps I should be going to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for approval of my potential loan with a banking institution, whether it be for improvements to the business, health and safety improvements that need to be done and so on.  I could walk into whatever bank I choose with an 80% guarantee under my arm which says: "I have a guarantee of 80%, all I am asking you to do as the retail bank is to take the risk on the other 20%".  It might help create better trust in the system.  It is very late in the day to bring this but these things can evolve over time.  As the Minister of State said, this is a different scheme.  The old scheme clearly did not work for the SME sector and the figures are there.  This is a change.  I want it to work.  I am the last person who wants to add layers of bureaucracy to this but perhaps there is an independent way where our lead body, in my case F&aacute;ilte Ireland, has a role to play in this process.  It would be a greater role to play than they had before.  Years ago they were funding hotels to the tune of &pound;100,000 to &pound;250,000.  They had no problems in doing that.  As such, the capacity is within the organisation to identify what the industry needs specifically, what it should be funding, and perhaps how viable that particular business is, because they understand it.  Not all banking institutions understand industries.</p></speech>

We have been clear that we support the Minister of State on this Bill today.  It is important, however, to get the facts correct.

That is an ideological difference between us on the left and those on the right.  The idea that they can defer tax, particularly in this scheme which will be backed by the State, is fundamentally and morally wrong.</p></speech>

That is what we are trying to do.  There is no cost to the State if the loan is successful, and that is a success all around because we want businesses to be sustained, to survive, thrive and grow.  I accept that the banks still have a lot of work to do to rebuild that trust between them and their communities and the business community.  There is no doubt about that.  In their response to Covid-19, the banks have a chance to build those relationships and rebuild that trust.  That concern about the banks comes up in every debate.  We will track and monitor this scheme through the SBCI and it will be visible to everybody that the banks are passing on an interest rate reduction.  Customers will also vote with their feet.  If banks have competition among themselves and one does not pass on as great a rate as the next, people will move banks and follow that rate.  We will track this and we can reapportion the share of this guarantee to banks in response.  After this legislation is passed, there will be negotiations with the banks, building on the ones we have had already, to make sure we can track what is happening and see what we want to see coming out of this scheme, which is lower-cost finance for businesses.</p> <p>The deferral of tax for banks and other companies has been in place for a long time.  Every functional country has such a system for business, though people might not always like it.  While it did not come up in the discussion in the D&aacute;il last night, Senator Higgins has led the discussion on it here today and it is an ongoing debate.  It is a matter for different legislation and a different conversation with a different Minister because this Bill is not about banks' profits.  It is about businesses' survival and that is what we are trying to achieve.  I do not want to labour the point.  I was happy to make some comments on this matter, although I was not really supposed to.</p> <p>I welcome industry bodies such as Tourism Ireland or F&aacute;ilte Ireland playing a role in loan applications.  Having worked with businesses for many years, both as a politician and otherwise, while many businesses are brilliant at what they do, whether that is running a hotel or window manufacturing, they often need additional guidance as regards cash flow statements, financial products, form-filling and so on.  They often need advice when putting in applications for future growth or putting together a growth expansion plan, and there is no one better than the representative bodies of those sectors to give that advice.  They should always have a role and we encourage that.  Many of the Department's clients work through LEOs and Enterprise Ireland to get that expert advice and guidance.  Each sector brings its own expertise and that should always feature on loan applications because they can often fall down on detailed financial plans, cash flow statements and so on, which do not always make a positive judgment possible.  In the microenterprise loan space, we work with our clients on their application forms to fill in more information and adjust them because the quality of the application has a big impact on the success of the loan drawdown.  The credit guarantee puts banks, credit unions and everybody else in a stronger position to deliver a better financial product, which customers now need if they are going to get through Covid-19 and keep their business doors open.  That is what we are supporting and focusing on.</p></speech>
