The Minister of State always comes into this House with good intention and he will be delivering an answer on behalf of the HSE.  As the Minister of State knows, the north Wexford area is one of the fastest growing in the country when it comes to population and that has meant there has been a lot of pressure on healthcare.  There was a commitment by the HSE to develop a primary care centre there and excellent medical services are provided by the GPs in the Gorey and north Wexford area but they are under pressure because the population continues to expand.  There was a clear commitment given that we would have a primary care centre and a community healthcare network put in place and indications were given 12 months ago that this was all on track and proceeding apace, that a community intervention team was being appointed and so on.  There does not seem to have been much progress in the past 12 months.  At the time we were told that a developer had been appointed, that plans would be laid out and that construction would take 12, 14 or 15 months.  That was the answer 12 months ago and I asked for a meeting with the HSE about a month ago and followed up with emails.  I did not get a response but on tabling this Commencement matter, I got an email response last night, which gave me much the same answer I was given 12 months ago.  I was told that agreement has been reached for lease and construction work to commence on site and that the construction programme will take approximately 12 to 14 months but that a detailed programme would be issued by the developer prior to the commencement of work.  If it will take 12 to 14 months I want to know when the developer will be on site.  When is the end of that 12 to 14 months programme when we will see the primary care centre built?</p> <p>In 2014, the HSE decided to close the health centre down the road in Camolin.  That was greeted by a lot of annoyance from residents in the Camolin area and there were discussions with Wexford County Council about the council possibly acquiring it.  The council assessed it and decided not to proceed with acquiring it at that stage.  At the time, in 2018, my colleague, Councillor Joe Sullivan, raised this issue at the regional health forum in Cork and he was told that this centre would be offered to various agencies but that if the various agencies did not want it then it would go on the open market.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 2018, the HSE stated it was in the process of disposing of the property.  In the email I received from the HSE yesterday in response to my queries, it gave the same answer it gave in 2018, stating it will talk to the various agencies to see if they are interested but if they are not, it will put it on the open market and dispose of it.  That is basically the same answer, four years later.  This is something others have been raising as well, such as Councillor Donal Kenny and Jack Redmond of the local community development association in Camolin, because they want to make use of the facility.  For eight years the HSE has sat on a building that is in very good nick in the heart of Camolin village and done nothing about it and we are getting the exact same answer we got in 2018 as to what it is going to do with the property.  I hope the Minister of State can use his good offices to advance the challenge with regard to both the Gorey primary care centre and the Camolin HSE building.</p></speech>

The ongoing development of both community and primary care is core to the Sl&aacute;intecare vision.  The Government is committed to ensuring local people are provided with the care they need as close to home as possible and have access to a wider range of health and social care services within their community.  The development of primary care centres in communities such as Gorey is a practical illustration of this.</p> <p>The HSE has advised that a third primary care centre for Gorey is currently under development.  This centre is with a local GP practice which will extend and develop its existing building in line with HSE requirements.  I am happy to be able to inform the Senator, and he may have been informed last night by email as well, that floorplans have been agreed, that planning permission has been granted and that HSE estates are currently awaiting completion of the agreement for lease.  I am also advised that the HSE is currently working with the developer on the issue regarding the quantity and location of car parking being offered.  Further to this, a proposal has been presented that is currently under review.  All in all, this primary care centre is a very welcome development.  It will act as a single point of access for health and social care delivery.  The primary care team will include GPs working alongside public health nurses and other healthcare professionals, including occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists.  This team will also link in with wider community network services, including dental care and hearing specialists, amongst others.</p> <p>The Senator also asked about the HSE clinic building in Camolin, County Wexford, which was formerly a health centre and is currently vacant.  This is a detached building on its own site which is owned freehold by the HSE.  The HSE is currently checking the title of the property with the intention of disposing of the site.  The various State agencies are to be advised in the next few weeks on the pending sale in accordance the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform circular 11/15 on the protocols for the transfer and sharing of State property assets.  If there is no interest from these agencies, the property will be put onto the open market.</p> <p>The Senator said this issue has been ongoing for the last four years.  It is simply not acceptable that four years later we are in the same situation.  I will raise it within the Department and within Government.  The Government is committed to continued investment in the development of primary care centres nationwide, in both urban and rural areas.  We know how important they are around the country.  Senator Murphy has seen it in his own area and I have seen it in mine.  They take the pressure off accident and emergency departments and many other facilities and provide a very valuable service.  They have a crucial role to play in enhancing and expanding capacity in the primary care sector to deliver high-quality, integrated care to people in their own communities.  I am sure this new primary care centre in Gorey will be a valued community asset.  This process has been far too slow.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue again in the House.</p></speech>

There is excellent healthcare provision from the local GPs in north Wexford but we have been promised this additional primary care centre in Gorey and have been waiting a long time, and there does not seem to be progress.  I would be particularly grateful for anything the Minister of State can do to expedite the matter.</p> <p>On the building in Camolin, I am very concerned that the Minister of State's answer, and I appreciate that he is only reading what was given to him, states, "The HSE is currently checking the title of the property with the intention of disposing of the site."  One would imagine, given that it has a freehold, that the HSE would know the detail of the title.  It closed the building in 2014 and has been talking about trying to dispose of it over the last eight years.  You would think that over an eight-year period the HSE would have worked out where the title is.  I ask the Minister of State to expedite that in order that the community in Camolin can see that building put to good use. </p></speech>

The Senator makes a lot of sense.  In the eight years since 2014, that title should have been investigated.  We should not be in this situation and I will raise it with the Minister.  Good progress continues to be made in the development and roll-out of primary care centres and 150 are now operational.  Some 12 of these opened in the last 12 months despite the challenges posed by Covid, and a further 21 are at various stages of the construction and equipping process and are expected to open in 2022.  I am sure the Senator is aware that Wexford has benefited, and will continue to benefit, from our investment in primary care.  In addition to the new primary care centre for Gorey that we have been discussing today, a centre in New Ross is in the early stages of planning while a primary care centre in Enniscorthy is due to become operational by the end of the third quarter of this year.  These are in addition to the three Wexford primary care centres that are already operational, with one in Wexford town and two in Gorey.  I am sure we can agree that these multi-purpose facilities have a key role to play in supporting the health of local communities and in transforming the way we deliver healthcare in Ireland.</p></speech>

The census has now taken place and has hopefully reached the stage where the last few forms are trickling back to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, either via the census enumerators or by post.  It is important that we get some clarity on an issue that arose before the census took place.  Senator Malcolm Byrne raised this matter at one point and I have also raised it a few times in the House.  In March, the CSO issued some rather strange guidance regarding the question on the census form that asked a person's sex and whether they were male or female.  On its website, the CSO advised people as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	If you are uncomfortable ticking one of these options you may signal this by marking both boxes.  However, for statistical analysis purposes all entries will be assigned a sex ... at random. </blockquote> <p>This advice was truly bizarre.  Regardless of what one thinks of the debate about the easily labelled but not so easily defined issue of transgender rights, this issue raises two significant problems.  First, to assign sex at random is ridiculous since it will skew the result of the census to some degree.  While mathematically, with a 50:50 chance of the correct sex being randomly assigned the difference might be very small, the whole idea of the census is that it should be as accurate as humanly possible.  That aspiration is predicated on the legal requirement for people to give accurate information.  That CSO advice seemed to deliberately incorporate, envisage and encourage inaccuracy in the results.</p><p>Second, and far more serious, is the issue I just mentioned.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2250&amp;amp;pid=RonanMullen&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The advice from the CSO to mark both the male and female boxes appears to induce or encourage people to fill out the census form in a way that commits a breach of the law.  The census form itself references section 43 of the Statistics Act 1993, which states that any person who knowingly provides false information "may be subject to a fine of up to &euro;44,440.".  There are no ifs, buts or maybes about that.  It is a serious breach carrying a serious fine, to knowingly provide false information and anybody, as I have said, who knowingly provides false information is subject to such a fine.  There is no exemption in the Act for anybody who is "uncomfortable" about answering truthfully and yet anyone who followed the guidance on the CSO website would be clearly breaching the law.  It is not possible to be both male and female at the same time.  To say that one is both male and female is completely false.  It is clear breach of the Statistics Act and in this case, a breach encouraged by the CSO.</p><p>A statutory agency appearing to condone a breach of the law governing its own statutory functions is a serious matter and I ask the Minister of State to address a number of issues arising from this.  First, how does the guidance from the CSO possibly accord, in the Government's view, with the provisions of the Statistics Act of 1993?  Does it not fly in the face of section 43 of that Act?  Second, why was the CSO encouraging people to break the law by giving false information in a census form?  Third, was the Taoiseach consulted before such advice was issued?  Fourth, are there any other sections of the census form which people could disregard if they are "uncomfortable" with answering accurately or does the exemption only apply to people who consider themselves to be transgender and if so, what is the logic underpinning that?  </p><p>Those are my issues and I hope I have stayed within the allotted time.  I think I have, by 23 seconds.  I have set a record for myself.  I try not to do that too often.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#C00200"><p>Under Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/543, the CSO is legally obliged to produce data on sex, with response options limited to male and female only in census 2022.  This is reflected in question No.2 on the census form which asks "What is your sex?" with response options of "Male" and "Female".</p> <p>The CSO launched a public consultation on the content of the census 2022 questionnaire in late 2017.  As part of this consultation, members of the public and interested stakeholders were invited to submit their requests for new questions and revisions to existing questions.  To assist the CSO in assessing the submissions, a census advisory group, CAG, was formed.  Membership of the CAG was drawn from organisations and groups who regularly use census data.  The CAG made recommendations on which new and revised questions should be tested during a census pilot survey which was held in September 2018.  Following the pilot, the CAG assisted the CSO in deciding which questions should be recommended to Government for inclusion on the census form.</p> <p>During the consultation process, several submissions were made requesting a new question on gender identity.  As gender identity is an emerging area for statistical data collection, the CAG proposed that the CSO should test and develop a new question that would capture robust data on gender identity before it should be considered for inclusion on a census.  Subsequent to the consultation, the CSO has introduced a new gender identity question on both a household survey and as part of the new PULSE surveys.  The CSO's view is that the new question has performed well and that it will be recommended for pilot testing as part of the preparations for the next census.  Inclusion of the new gender identity question in the next census will be subject to approval by the CAG and ultimately, by the Government.</p> <p>The CSO is aware that in the absence of a question on gender identity on the census form, some members of the public may have difficulty in responding to the question on sex as it appears on the census form.  In order to make the census as inclusive as possible, the CSO has advised that for people who have such a difficulty, they can mark both male and female boxes.  In order to meet the aforementioned EU regulation, the CSO is legally obliged to categorise the sex of all persons on the census as either male or female.  When both response options have been marked on the census form, the CSO will be required to impute a value of either male or female to each digital record.  The imputation of these values will reflect the distribution of the sex variable across the population, which is approximately 50:50. The digital data will be used as the basis for census statistical publications and will only be released in aggregated form.  The CSO will not make any amendments to the paper forms returned from the public.  Thus, should someone mark both boxes in the sex question on their census form, this paper record will remain unchanged and will be what is made public 100 years after the census, in line with section 35 of the Statistics Act 1993.</p> <p>Census 2022 also contains a new time capsule section which provides a space on the form where households have the option to write a message of their choosing.  Along with the rest of the census forms, these messages will be placed in secure storage until the release of the forms after 100 years.  The time capsules provide an opportunity for members of the public to record information not otherwise captured on the census form.  SI 637 of 2020, the census of population order, outlines which questions on the census questionnaire are required to be responded to for each person present in the State on census night.  The set of questions will vary depending on factors such as the age and economic status of the respondent.  All questions relevant to the respondent require a response.</p></speech>

Phrases like "the CSO has advised that for people who have such a difficulty, they can mark both male and female boxes" suggest that this is an old script, written at the time that this was first raised and before census night.  It suggests to me that the Government has not actually considered the issue I have raised at all, which is about the illegality that I propose was a part of what the CSO recommended.  It also illustrates that the CSO knew and foresaw that this was going to be an issue for a long time and yet it went ahead with proposing an illegal approach to the filling out of the census form.  Was any consideration given to encouraging people to just not fill out that box?  Would that have been a legal satisfaction of the requirement on the citizen filling out the census form?  Would that not have been a better solution?</p> <p>The issue here is that if transgender people can choose not to answer a question on their sex because they are uncomfortable about doing so, then what other sections of the form can be ignored because people are uncomfortable with them?  The census asks very personal questions about people's health and relationship status, for example.  Indeed, asking farmers to state the acreage of their farms, as everybody knows, is to go where many farmers would not seek to go.  If such respondents were uncomfortable about answering the questions accurately, would they be entitled to a dispensation from the CSO?  If one question can be answered wrongly, deliberately, then surely all questions could, theoretically, be ignored or answered wrongly.  That is the key point.</p></speech>

During the last number of weeks, the CSO has received queries and observations from members of the public and other stakeholders about the sex question, the advice relating to the sex question and the lack of a gender identity question on this year's census form.  These observations will be a valuable input as the CSO embarks on the public consultation process which will ultimately lead to decisions on which questions will be included on the next census.  The consultation process is expected to begin later this year and there will be an opportunity for any parties to give their views on all aspects of the census questionnaire, including which new topics should be included in census 2027 and which existing questions should be changed or removed.</p></speech>

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated these pressures considerably.  We have also seen significant increases in energy prices which are driving even further price increases and leading to great uncertainty around the delivery periods for certain construction materials.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator John Cummins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=JohnCummins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->According to the main indices for building and construction materials, the significant movements in timber and steel prices experienced in 2020 have accelerated even further and broadened to include other materials such as plastics, insulation and electrical and plumbing fittings.  The breadth of the price increases is in excess of anything experienced in the past decade and they continue to fluctuate almost weekly.  The all-materials category of the detailed wholesale price indices for building and construction materials saw a 16.9% increase in the 12 months to the end of March 2022, with some subcategories such as structural steel and rough timber experiencing increases of 64.1% and 46.3%, respectively.  As we know, energy prices showed marked increases in the latter half of 2021 and since January, they have increased even further.  This has a direct impact on costs in the construction sector, particularly for those projects with a significant reliance on heavy machinery, while higher energy costs have an indirect impact through the increased costs of manufacturing and transporting materials, which is driving even further price inflation.</p><p>I acknowledge that as a consequence of the challenges experienced during 2021, amendments to address further price volatility were announced by the Government in November of last year but that these applied only to new contracts.  The amendments did not address energy price volatility, the delays caused by supply chain disruption or inflation in respect of new materials that has occurred since then.  They did not apply to projects that are currently on site.  As a result, as the Minister of State will be aware, many housing projects throughout the country will come in at a cost well above that in the fixed-price contract, which was signed before the project got under way, through no fault of the developer.  Many developers simply cannot afford to risk sustaining significant losses, so some builders have downed tools and withdrawn from sites, which, obviously, we do not want to see at a time of acute housing need.  This is an area on which I have been calling for significant action over a sustained period, so I was delighted yesterday to see our Government colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, announce the introduction of a new inflation co-operation framework for those parties currently engaged in public works contracts.  I understand it is intended the framework will operate on the basis that the State will burden-share the inflationary costs on a 70:30 basis with a developer after both parties have carried out an open-book exercise detailing the additional costs being experienced to bring the project through to completion.</p><p>I am sure the Minister of State will expand on that in his reply.  In addition, he might explain what was announced yesterday and touch on how the 70:30 figure was arrived at and why it was not 60:40, for example, or 80:20 in order that I can understand the thinking of the Department.</p></speech>

It is always fantastic when students come to the Houses and see how our democracy works, so they are very welcome.</p><p>A key priority for the Government is that everybody should have access to sustainable, good-quality housing for purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard, located close to essential services and offering a high quality of life.  The Government plans to increase the supply of housing to an average of 33,000 units per year over the next decade.  This includes the delivery of 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost-rental homes by 2030.  Housing for All is supported by an investment package of more than &euro;4 billion per annum.</p><p>One key challenge being faced during 2022 relates to the significant level of construction inflation, which has led to delays in some projects because contractors face difficulty in meeting contracted prices.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and departmental officials have been working closely with stakeholders, including the local authorities, approved housing bodies and construction industry representatives, and there is clear evidence of the impact inflation is having on public housing projects, as the Senator outlined.  The Minister has been engaging on this matter with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, who has responsibility for public procurement policy.</p><p>In January, the Office of Government Procurement, which is under the latter Minister&rsquo;s remit, introduced measures applying to new public works contracts.  Under these arrangements, the fixed-price period for public works contracts was reduced to 24 months and mutual cost recovery is permitted within the fixed-price period for material price changes in excess of 15%.  Provision was also made for the indexation of the materials element of the tender sum from the point at which the tender was submitted to the award of the contract.  In the interests of further safeguarding public projects already under construction and to mitigate the risks of significant losses being sustained by contractors, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform yesterday announced further measures to address the impact of construction material inflation on public work projects.  This includes the introduction of an inflation co-operation framework, which the Senator referenced, for those parties engaged under a public works contract, including public housing.  This framework will facilitate both parties to engage with each other for the purpose of addressing the impacts of the most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption, and will operate on an <i>ex gratia </i>basis.  The framework will set down the approaches and parameters within which the parties to a public works contract circulate additional costs attributable to material and fuel price fluctuations, using price indices published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO.</p><p>In recognition that neither party is responsible for the global events that have given rise to this inflation, it is proposed, subject to budgetary constraints, that the additional inflation costs will be apportioned between the parties, with the State bearing up to 70% of the additional inflationary-related costs.  The framework will apply to payments made from 1 January 2022.  The Department will work closely with our delivery partners to support the implementation of this framework.</p><p>I do not have details on the rationale as to why the ratio was set at 70:30 and not 80:20, although we can revert to the Senator with that response.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  If he could correspond with me in respect of the rationale, I would appreciate that.  The inflation co-operation agreement announced yesterday is a significant and very welcome move by the Government to address this issue, which has been raised by the sector for a considerable period.  I welcome the fact it is to be backdated to the start of January this year, given there has been a significant level of inflation within the sector over that period, which was one of the other points I wanted to address.</p> <p>Another matter on which if the Minister of State does not have an answer to hand, he might let me know at another point, relates to who will be responsible for carrying out the assessment.  I acknowledge it will be indexed to the CSO in terms of the main indices and the inflation that will have been recorded by that office, but in the case of housing projects, whether social or affordable, will individual local authorities carry out that open-book assessment with the developer or will there be national oversight of the assessments?</p> <p>I welcome the moves made by the Government, which are very significant.  They will ensure that much-needed housing projects will continue to be delivered throughout the country.</p></speech>

There was a debate last night in the D&aacute;il on housing affordability, at which one side of the House argued we were subsidising too much for the construction sector while others maintained we were not doing enough.  The Government is trying to strike a balance and that is what we have done here.  We have acted swiftly given global events that have been outside our control, with construction costs increasing even before the war in Ukraine.  We have a significant challenge on our hands and are responding as we go.</p> <p>The Senator asked me how we arrived at the proportion of 70:30 and who will be responsible for carrying out the assessment.  I do not have that information to hand but I will revert to him in due course with a response.  I reiterate we recognise the considerable challenges facing the construction sector and the fact developers have managed to absorb those costs insofar as they can.  There is no doubt we want to work together to deliver on Housing for All and to deliver sustainable housing for communities, which is why this intervention was vital.</p> <p>I again thank the Senator for his contribution to the matter.</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity to get an update on these really important projects.  Last year, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, announced an allocation of a whopping &euro;11 million for Castlebar for two key projects.  One is the redevelopment of what we call the historic town core of Castlebar, including an upgrading of the old post office, the mall area and Daly's Hotel.  It is really the centrepiece of Castlebar and it is very important, with much history attached to the area.  There is over &euro;8 million allocated to that specific project.  The second project is very close to my heart and it involves the redevelopment of Castlebar Military Barracks.  I started my military career in the FCA in Castlebar Military Barracks many years ago when I was only a teenager.  That place in Castlebar town means a lot to people.  Many a youngster passed through those gates and came out a much more well-rounded and developed individual heading off into the big world.</p> <p>These two areas of Castlebar are centrally located and getting that amount of money for redevelopment had the aim, really, of improving the public realm in the area and making it a more attractive place to visit, live, work and invest.  Ultimately, it is about benefiting the people of Castlebar and surrounding areas.  Castlebar is the county town of Mayo.  Anything that benefits Castlebar extends its reach beyond the town to the rest of the county.  This is very important work.</p> <p>This was announced last year and the citizens are asking, correctly, at what stage are these projects.  There is much recognition and admiration for the work that Mayo County Council has done in putting together the application.  As we all know, funding like this is not allocated without a substantial, worthwhile and well-drafted application from the local authority.  In that context, I commend the work of the team in Mayo County Council.  Citizens are asking for an update on the work nonetheless.  Has money been drawn down or when will that happen?  What stage of development are these projects at and when will we see the projects delivered for the people of Castlebar and Mayo?</p> <p>I ask this in the context of inflation and rising costs of building materials and labour.  There is also a difficulty in getting tradespeople, especially when we are looking at restoring old buildings.  I think particularly of Castlebar Military Barracks, and a specialist expertise would be required to carry out those types of work to the standard we all expect to see.  It would be good to get an update from the Department on the overall project.  Does the Minister of State foresee any potential difficulties or challenges?  It would be remiss of me not to put on record that if there are to be escalating costs for the local authority, the Department should work with that local authority in Castlebar to try to bridge the gap between what the estimated cost of the work was a number of years ago against a realistic price today.  As we all know, whether it is a small garage, house or a significant building project, everybody is feeling that pinch.</p> <p>I reiterate that these are very important projects for Castlebar and Mayo.  That &euro;11 million might not seem like much if we stood in Dublin city centre but in Mayo and its county town of Castlebar, it is a huge amount of money and significant delivery for the town.  It is the biggest allocation of funding we have seen in a very long time.  I place on record my thanks to the Minister for allocating that funding and for working with the local authority to advance these really important projects.</p></speech>

It is critical that we support projects like this and it is what the funding is doing.  It is a similar case with Castlebar Military Barracks.  The Senator had a military career in those barracks.  I was born in James Stephens Barracks in Kilkenny and I grew up on the campus there.  I am aware of the immense cultural and heritage value of these barracks and what they mean to local communities in particular.  I also recognise that Castlebar is the county town of Mayo .  I am due to visit the county in the next couple of days.  I am looking forward to that because it is a wonderful county.</p> <p>The urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, is one of four funds established under the National Development Plan 2018-2027.  It was launched in 2018, primarily to support the national planning framework's growth enablers for the five cities and other large urban centres.  The URDF is providing part-funding for applicant-led projects that will support more compact and sustainable development and enable a greater proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and large towns, while also ensuring that more parts of our urban areas can become attractive and vibrant places in which people choose to live and work, as well as to invest and visit.</p> <p>In keeping with the aims of the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040, the URDF demonstrates a new and more tailored approach to the provision of Government support.  Over its planned duration up to 2030, URDF support in excess of &euro;2 billion will be targeted in an integrated, dynamic and responsive way to support the regeneration and rejuvenation of our towns and cities.  Through the URDF, successful applicants receive targeted integrated support for innovative holistic solutions to the issues that have hindered the regeneration and rejuvenation of our large towns and cities.</p> <p>To date, there have been two calls for proposals under the URDF with a total of almost &euro;312 million allocated so far in respect of the 87 projects approved under call 1, while in March 2021 URDF funding support of &euro;1.3 billion was announced in respect of a countrywide programme of a further 45 proposals approved under call 2.  The 45 proposals approved under call 2 in 2021 build on the existing pipeline of URDF-supported projects launched under call 1.  This URDF-supported programme of projects will ultimately contribute significantly to the transformative regeneration and development of our large towns and cities and to the achievement of national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040 objectives.</p> <p>Under call 2 of the URDF, a total of a little more than &euro;11 million has been provisionally allocated to Mayo County Council for the two projects to which this matter relates.  The Castlebar historic core reactivation initiative project was allocated &euro;8.527 million and the Castlebar Military Barracks project was allocated was allocated &euro;2.5 million.  The URDF support for the Mayo County Council's projects, as with all other successful URDF proposals, is approved in principle subject to appropriate appraisal, justification and advancement in accordance with the public spending code.</p> <p>The Department works closely with the successful applicants in respect of project funding but responsibility for the advancement of URDF-supported projects through the various stages of planning, development and completion is, in the first instance, a matter for the sponsoring agency, which in this case is Mayo County Council.  All URDF-supported projects must be carefully developed and managed by the sponsoring agency in accordance with the normal conditions and arrangements that apply to public sector-managed projects, including exercising appropriate cost control and delivering projects as approved, and managing its advancement through the various decision stages set out in the public spending code.  As part of this public spending code process Mayo County Council has submitted a preliminary business case in respect of each of these two projects and following their evaluation the Department will be in touch with the council on the matter in due course.</p></speech>

I will touch again on the stage the projects are at.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's comments in that the primary responsibility for advancing this work lies with Mayo County Council.  We all accept that and there is absolutely no difficulty there.</p> <p>Now the council has submitted a preliminary business case, what is the next stage?  When does the Minister of State envisage his Department will have evaluated that business case?  When will his Department be in touch with the council on the matter?  On behalf of the citizens in the area, I am looking to establish an approximate timeline that we can work to, acknowledging that it has been more than a year since this was first announced.  People are, understandably, asking questions.</p> <p>I have a second question.  The Minister of State mentioned that the local authority must exercise appropriate cost control.  That is exceptionally difficult for any organisation, business or local authority in the current climate.  In this reply, will the Minister of State touch on what the Department is doing to deal with inflation and the excessive rise in costs of building materials and labour, which will of course affect the local authority as well?  In the interests of the public good, these are the types of projects in respect of which the Department will have to take a more hands-on approach.  It appears from the reply that it is currently taking more of a hands-off approach.  In dealing directly with rising costs associated with projects like this, the Department will need to get around the table with all its expertise and see how we can assist the local authority in managing escalating costs.</p></speech>

It is critical for the Department to engage in such a way.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Malcolm Noonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmNoonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I will revert to the Senator with a response on that.  Appropriate cost control is important, given the inflationary pressures, which were mentioned in the previous Commencement matter as well.  We are in exceptional times and it requires a high level of engagement between our Department, the local authority and other local authorities on this.  We commit to that engagement.</p><p>The Senator made a point on trades and traditional skills in respect of the barracks and the historic core.  These buildings require a specific set of skills and in many cases there is a deficit in those skills, which we are working to address in developing a national programme for traditional skills, which is an important measure.  Bridging the gap and dealing with those escalating costs is something the Department will sit down and work with the local authority on in this specific case.</p></speech>

This morning, I want to speak on community facilities.  I welcome the Government fund that has been launched by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys.  There are three categories, the first being for small-scale projects and improvements to facilities worth between &euro;10,000 and &euro;25,000.  The second category is for large-scale projects worth between &euro;25,000 and &euro;100,000 and the third category is for major projects worth between &euro;100,000 and &euro;300,000.  These categories offer a range of capital works to community facilities, including upgrading to lighting systems and stage areas, works to address safety concerns, works to improve disability access, improvements to assist and provide additional or better services to communities such as meals for the elderly and youth facilities, and essential maintenance works such as repairs to roofs and so on.  There is great potential under this fund, which I believe will be with us for many years because it is vitally important.</p> <p>The fund is something I have advocated for.  I welcome its establishment.  However, a point I have made on numerous occasions in this House, and to the Minister, is that there is a need to go further.  There is a need for a fourth category for new community facilities, especially in growing communities, in areas where the population is growing and where there is a dire need for additional community space.  Currently, small rural communities can apply under LEADER and smaller schemes but, as it stands, there is no scheme open to urban communities.  They can try to cobble together an amount under various schemes, but I have urged the Government to consider a fourth category in next year's budget which would include projects for new community facilities.  I will continue to advocate for that.</p> <p>We have some fine community halls around the country associated with primary and secondary school buildings.  There has been a significant level of capital investment across the country by the State.  These buildings need to be available to the community at night and weekends for whatever purpose is deemed necessary.  There is an onus on all boards of management and patrons to work with communities to ensure that facilities which have been provided using State investment are open for the community - the elderly, the young, for sports, after-school activities and a range of activities, including for disadvantaged communities.  There are myriad possibilities where these buildings can be provided.  The Government and the Department of Education must grasp the nettle on this issue.  The State is going to invest in new school buildings and we need to ensure that the associated general purpose rooms or sports halls are available at all stages for communities, including at night and weekends.  I urge the Deputy Leader to engage with the Department of Education on that.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom dh&aacute; &aacute;bhar a ard&uacute;.</p><p>I was fortunate enough to be at the launch last week of <i>Pandemonium</i>, the book by Jack Horgan-Jones and Hugh O'Connell.  I have started to read the book, which is quite well written, and tells the story of the events of the past two years.  Unlike certain other journalists, they do not put themselves at the heart of the story and they allow others to tell it.  It does stress again the importance of trusted journalism and evidence-based research to provide the stories the media tell us.  I am very conscious that we are in an era where we have seen Elon Musk buy Twitter.  There is a big debate around plurality within the media.  I remain concerned about the fact that we still have not seen sight of the report of the Future of Media Commission.  We will be debating the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill again this afternoon, but we have been promised this report by the Government for many months at this stage.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not about the Government having to accept all the commission's recommendations but that the findings of that report would inform a debate.  I am asking that we schedule a debate in this House around the future of media and journalism.  It is essential.  We have seen the importance of combatting fake news and information.  We have seen the importance of trusted journalism.  Many media outlets in this country are under pressure.  We need to have that full debate.</p><p>I also want to return to the issue of Seanad reform.  I am conscious that Senator McDowell is in the House.  The first Bill that I brought to Second Stage here was on the question of enacting the seventh amendment to the Constitution which was passed 43 years ago extending the franchise to other higher education graduates.  We rightly celebrate the many new technological universities around the country and the rapid expansion of higher education and yet we still have not had progress on the issue of addressing the broader franchise on the universities panel.  I support broader Seanad reform but I want to highlight again the lack of progress.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, indicated that he thought that as part of the electoral commission Bill, we would see some progress on this but nothing has been put forward as part of that Bill as yet.  I would ask that time be set aside so that we can have a discussion around extending that franchise and on the broader question of Seanad reform.</p></speech>

Senator Buttimer will have his opportunity.</p> <p>The Minister of State told me that there was a proposal to establish among the Government parties a group that would come forward with proposals which I would be shown last October.  That group has not been established let alone come forward with any proposals.  I have come to the conclusion that this is an elaborate smoke screen for nothing to happen.  Senator Malcolm Byrne suggested that we should implement the universities amendment.  That is part of the Bill that is before this House but let us remember that would give, depending on what third level institutions it is given to, the right to roughly 1 million people to vote for six people in this House, whereas 43 seats would be elected by roughly 1,200 people.  That difficulty will not go away and it will not be wished away.</p> <p>Ministers can keep giving us assurances and they can keep coming into this House and sending in their junior Minister to give us timetables for reform but some time the truth must be spoken in this House.</p></speech>

Let us remember that.</p> <p>The point I want the acting Leader to take on board is the need to discuss the outcome of the Northern elections.  Some 63 of the 90 people elected are comfortable with the Northern Ireland protocol and yet the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and his Cabinet are trying to use it as leverage to get an advantage in their broader negotiations with the EU.  By the same token, less than one third of those elected want a Border poll in the next five years.  That is a reality.  This House needs to discuss how we get the institutions up and running and how we get everybody to co-operate on the bread and butter issues and end the polarisation of politics into this ridiculous dispute of demanding action on the protocol, when 63 of the MLAs are happy with the protocol and represent a majority of the people of Northern Ireland, and demanding an early Border poll, which is bound to be defeated.</p></speech>

It will be seconded by my colleague.</p> <p>I agree with the point about a debate on the Assembly elections.  The changing demographic in Northern Ireland must be taken into account.  It was not taken into account in the Good Friday Agreement and has landed us in a position where it is difficult when people disagree on forming a shared Executive.  I note the increase in the vote share for the Alliance Party.  It probably did have an impact on the Green Party.  There is no doubt about that.  However, it shows a shift where people are voting for different reasons other than sectarian reasons.</p> <p>I wish to speak briefly on a Private Members' Bill we will bring forward next week.  There are pockets around the country where groups form an alliance to not have election posters in the area.  As a Green, I very much welcome that we would have a reduction in election posters.  However, it leads to a non-systematic approach to where we can and cannot have election posters.  Someone who is a councillor in one area may have no election posters and yet in another area, they might put up 500 or 1,000.  It makes it difficult financially for those who do not have the means to compete with the big boys or girls.  Therefore, for many reasons, the primary one being environmental, it is time to significantly reduce and restrict election posters in this country.  People are crying out for it.  That is what our Bill is about.</p> <p>I want to refer back to Senator Kyne's points with which I wholeheartedly agree.  We have funds to renovate community centres but nothing to start them.  I have seen it in Galway.  It is incredibly difficult to get grant funding.  The urban regeneration and development fund had been suggested for one particular community centre in Newcastle but it was impossible for the community centre to go through that because there is nothing there.  It is a bare piece of ground.  It cannot get funding through the renovation fund.  Therefore, I would ask that the House call for new streams of funding for community groups, particularly coming out of the pandemic.  Many of us will have been at a presentation by the Irish Men's Sheds Association.  What I took from that was the impact and deep scar that still exists for many from the isolation across our towns and villages and in rural Ireland.  Now is the time to invest in community supports and centres and places for people to get together.</p></speech>

She was an Al Jazeera journalist aged 51 years.  She was shot down by Israeli forces.  I know there are many people who feel passionately about Palestine in this Chamber.  We need to figure out what else we can do as a country about this.</p> <p>I will have the privilege of chairing a session with Amnesty International in the audiovisual room today at 1.30 p.m.  It will highlight its report on why Israel is an apartheid state.  Crucially, we will also have representatives from the Jewish Voice for Just Peace there.  That is important because whenever we raise the issue of apartheid in Israel somebody accuses us of being antisemitic.  It is so important to hear the voices of Jewish activists such as those who are going to be in the audiovisual room today.  I really hope that it is not just the left that turns up today.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Paul Gavan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2469"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2469&amp;amp;pid=PaulGavan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I really hope we see representatives of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il there to listen to and, if they want to, challenge our colleague, Colm O'Gorman from Amnesty International, in that regard.</p><p>The second topic I will raise today is that of housing.  Last Friday, I was shocked to see someone I know who works in this building at Heuston Station.  I asked him what he was doing there and he told me that he no longer lives in Dublin.  He and his girlfriend now live in Thurles.  These are two professionals working in Dublin who cannot afford to live here.  They have no choice but to commute each day.  They spend two hours on the train from Thurles and then get the bus.  It shows the reality of how the marketplace has been failed by successive Governments when two people with good jobs choose to live in Tipperary and commute each day rather than live in the city.</p><p>This week, I discovered that the Government's target for affordable housing in Limerick is 264 houses.  That is 53 houses a year.  There is a massive problem whereby, if you earn more than &euro;32,500 a year, you do not qualify for social housing.  The Government's response to a city and county the size of Limerick is to say "Do not worry, we are going to build 53 affordable houses this year."  Of course, it is not actually going to build them.  The reality is that it will buy most of them from the marketplace, further crowding out private buyers.  There is a fundamental disconnect between what we hear from this Government in respect of housing and delivery on the ground.  The figures I am quoting are Government figures.  Indeed, I could quote figures for a whole series of counties.  Perhaps the most shocking is that, over the next five years, there are to be just 450 affordable houses here in Dublin.  The Government is failing.  Its targets are too unambitious.  The housing policy is not fit for purpose.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called for a doubling of investment in that regard.  I once again call for an urgent debate on housing.</p></speech>

This morning, Senators Kyne and Pauline O'Reilly have made reference to community funding and men's sheds.  This morning, we received a very informative briefing from the Irish Men's Sheds Association, which has produced a document on the support it needs.  There are approximately 360 men's sheds across Ireland, supporting and providing an outlet to 10,000 men every week.  A staggering number of men are involved.  It is good for their communities, for themselves and for our country.  What is worrying is that 70 Irish men's sheds have not reopened since the pandemic.  This is for a combination of reasons including funding and the lack of a person to be the leader of that community group.  It is important that we support the Irish Men's Sheds Association in a variety of ways.  I do not refer only to resourcing, which is important, but to the appointment of regional organisers, allowing for succession planning and ongoing support.  I hope that we can have a debate on the Irish Men's Sheds Association.  It has four key asks.  It wants a sustainability grant, support for start-up sheds, measures on security of tenure, VAT and commercial rates, an enhancement of the core grant and a national recruitment campaign.  I encourage Members to support our Irish Men's Sheds Association, an organisation which does great work.  It is an important prebudget submission.</p> <p>My last point - and I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence - is that the whole area of prebudget submissions is one in which we, as a House, can play a role.  We can articulate requests, advocate, listen and present different facts to Government.  </p></speech>

Schools predominantly finish by 5 p.m.  The buildings then stand empty.  There are buildings that have been the subject of investment from the Department and the Government over many years.  I know the Minister, Deputy Foley, has committed to carrying out a review.  Where I am from in Limerick, the Limerick Lifelong Learning Festival is coming up on 23 May.  This event is run for a week every year.  Many events are run in libraries, schools and other buildings.  Those kinds of festivals can be built upon, especially if facilities are available for use.  Senator Buttimer referred to men's sheds.  I met with a women's shed group recently.  It wants to start up and is looking for a permanent home.  We could look at using school buildings for community uses.  The Irish Men's Sheds Association has been very successful.  Women's sheds also have an awful lot to contribute.  We could look at organisations like that using buildings when they are vacant in the evenings.  I would like to see the review carried out as quickly as possible because there are many community groups out there that are looking for buildings to use.  It would be very positive for the community especially because different funding schemes come up from time to time but, if groups do not have permanent use of a building, they can fall between the cracks.  I would certainly like that review to be carried out sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

I repeat that measures on legacy issues need to be victim-centred and that all families of victims, regardless of the perpetrator, must have access to effective investigations and processes of justice.</p> <p>The news came yesterday that a proposed blanket amnesty has become conditional on co-operation with the new independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery and that immunity is to be decided on a case-by-case basis.  Existing civil cases may continue but there could be a bar on new civil claims and inquests that are open may proceed but ones that have not progressed will move to a new body.  Members of this House will know that we stood in opposition to the previous proposals to introduce a general statute of limitations and an immediate end to criminal investigations, civil cases and inquests that amounted not only to a suppression of prosecutions, but to a suppression of truth.  What will this process achieve for truth, for justice and for victims?  Unless it delivers on all three, it is not a credible position on legacy issues.  The British Government cannot stand in the way of standard criminal justice investigations under the guise of truth recovery.  Investigations are needed to get to the truth.  Experience tells us this, including the experience of the Savile inquiry, investigations into the disappeared and cold cases that have come into focus again because new evidence has been found.  </p> <p>Sandra Peake of the WAVE Trauma Centre has said that this proposal gives a choice to perpetrators that is denied to victims.  I stand with her.  The Truth and Justice Movement says that the British Government is fooling no one and that it wants truth and justice not fairy stories from the state and murderers.  I stand with that group.  The rule of law must be at the core of legacy proposals and victims must be at the centre of this process.  We need more information on this as it is currently lacking.  This is not a blanket amnesty.  Is it just a long-winded one instead?</p></speech>

I thank the Senator and our coalition partners, Senators Chambers and Doherty, for their work on this Bill.  It is very important.  It is such a waste.  We have a climate emergency.  We all know that all plastics come from fossil fuels.  The game is up.  This is long overdue.  It comes up as a debate during every election campaign and we do nothing about it.  It is great to see these three women coming together, taking action and making something happen about this ridiculous waste of money.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator R&oacute;is&iacute;n Garvey:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RoisinGarvey&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Apart from using the odd poster and turning them into good henhouses, it is a complete waste of precious fossil fuels.  Turning them into posters is litter.  It is also unfair because the more money a person has, the more he or she can plaster his or her face around the place and, unfortunately, that is like product placement, which we know works.  Therefore, it is often the person with the most money who might be successful in politics instead of the person who maybe deserves the seat most.  This is long overdue.  I really commend the three Senators on putting this forward.  I am very happy to second the motion.</p></speech>

This searching will be done by way of algorithm artificial intelligence, AI, and carried out in a blanket manner.  Everyone's messages will be scanned all the time, which will result in the end of secure online communications within the EU.  If an algorithm considers a message suspicious, its content and metadata are disclosed automatically and without human verification to a private US-based organisation.  The reported users are not notified.  While this may seem to be a case that if a person has nothing to hide, he or she has nothing to fear, there are many grave concerns with this move towards what has been seen as Chinese Government-style surveillance.</p> <p>The aim of this legislation is to combat the sharing of child sexual exploitation material.  The experience of national and international agencies that combat this material online, however, shows that mass surveillance is the wrong approach to fighting child abuse material and sexual exploitation.  This is because abusers do not share their material via commercial email messaging or chat services but organise themselves through self-run secret forums on the darknet, which would not be caught by these controlled algorithms.  Abusers also typically upload images and videos as encrypted archives and share only the links and passwords, which these chat-controlled algorithms would not recognise.</p> <p>The implications for the privacy of 500 million people are stark.   We in this House passed a law last year to criminalise the sharing of intimate photographs without consent yet if an algorithm now classifies the content of a message as suspicious, an individual's private or intimate photographs may be viewed by staff and contractors of private international corporations and police authorities.</p> <p>According to Swiss federal police authorities, 86% of all machine-generated reports turn out to be without merit.  We need a human task force to tackle this problem.  Of course, 72% of EU citizens oppose the measure, as per a YouGov poll of more than 10,000 people last year, with only 18% supporting the plan.  Again, this is something that is coming down the line.  We ought to have debate on what we want our standard of online privacy to be for our citizens.</p></speech>

As many will know, there are something like 450 men's sheds throughout the country and each week, approximately 10,000 men pass through their doors.  The sheds have an open-door policy to men of all ages.  It does not matter whether someone is 25 or 95, there will be a smile there to greet that person and the kettle will be on the boil.  It does not matter if someone is married, widowed, separated or recovering from an addiction - their doors are open and they are only too glad to see more people coming through.</p> <p>In County Monaghan, we have five men's sheds in Carrickmacross, Castleblayney, Ballybay, Monaghan town and Clones.  In County Cavan, there are up to 15.  They are hugely popular in County Cavan with great participation.  Like many voluntary organisations, however, they are now suffering through lack of funding and particularly with Covid-19, many of their premises were closed down for up to almost two years.  They are now in need of funding to keep them going.  Two main themes came from the association's basic message, the first of which was funding.  It talked about Government allocating ring-fenced funding each year of approximately &euro;2,500 to &euro;5,000 per shed.  That would be hugely beneficial to them.</p> <p>The association also wants the Government to initiate a national campaign to recruit more members, which I thought was quite important.  Great work goes on in the men's sheds.  Regardless of where people are or what is going on in their lives, there are people there they can talk to and as I said, the sheds have an open-door policy.  I would welcome if the Leader could organise a debate with the Minister regarding not only the funding of men's sheds, but their promotion nationally so that more members will be able to participate.</p></speech>

I am sure everyone knows him but for those who do not, Alan Gillis was the former president of the IFA.  He was someone I knew well.  I told this story during an interview yesterday with the <i>Wicklow People</i>.  When I was first elected to the Seanad, I received a letter from Alan wishing me well.  He said he was not going to give me advice and then proceeded to write 12 foolscap pages of a book on how we could have progressive agriculture in Ireland and how we needed to reform it.  I thought that was strange and wondered whether that was advice or the introduction.  On the very last line in the correspondence, he said that in summary he would give me one bit of advice, which was that better farming practices, better animal husbandry and better cultivation will yield better results for us all.  That was his real caption and his simple message.</p><p>He was a remarkable man.  He was an engineer who then went on to own a 30 acre farm in Kill.  He clearly got ambitious and realised that he wanted to be a farmer by choice.  He always said that he was an engineer by profession but a farmer by choice.  He gave it up and he accumulated a 375 acre farm next door to my grandfather, actually, in Grangecon in County Wicklow, which is on the Wicklow-Kildare border.  It is a truly beautiful part of the world, and he set up there.  I did not want to let the opportunity go without saying a few words about him.</p><p>He was in many ways a combination of three things.  He was political and he was a proud Church of Ireland man. He was on the board of Adelaide Hospital and the Government subsequently appointed him to the board of Tallaght Hospital.  He was a major advocate for choice in education and in health.  He was pioneering in many ways and naturally, Fine Gael picked up on all of that.  Of course, then he ran for Fine Gael and became a successful MEP.  I would just like to say sorry, particularly to the Fine Gael community, of which he was a very strong and active member, and to the farming and agricultural community.  They have lost a wonderful advocate.  The Church of Ireland has lost a wonderful church man who was faithful to its tradition and proud of its heritage.  As I said, it was that mix of politics and the church, although he was clearly very much in favour of the separation of church and State and always respected that line.  He will be greatly missed by his family, his community in counties Wicklow and Kildare and the agricultural community.  May he rest in peace.</p></speech>

Alan Gillis did this country great service by his work on our behalf in Europe but also on behalf of his own community and the farming organisation that he led so well.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1671" speakername="Erin McGreehan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#K00600"><p>There are an awful lot of issues I would like to discuss but I will raise a local issue this morning regarding Irish Water.  The people of the Cooley Peninsula have been struggling with water pressure.  I have been ignored by Irish Water for nearly two years now.  I am not getting any help or assistance and have been gaslit, which I suppose is the popular word, by the organisation, which told me it was going to raise pressure and did not do so.  There are people in the Cooley Peninsula who cannot even work their showers because Irish Water does not know where the leaks are.  It will not turn up the water pressure because of leaks.  I believe this is happening around the country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Erin McGreehan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=ErinMcGreehan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I hope that Irish Water will start listening to people when people contact them.  Multiples of people who live in the area of the Cooley Peninsula and around the country have asked Irish Water to raise the water pressure and have emphasised it is not a domestic issue.  Irish Water has a policy of reducing water pressure to prevent leaks but I am afraid that such a policy is no good if people cannot use showers or it takes five minutes to fill a kettle.</p></speech>

He spoke about the announcement that the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, made yesterday.  She announced a &euro;15 million fund for community centres to assist them to refurbish any buildings and carry out essential works.  The Senator said that there was a gap as centres in urban areas were not included in the funding and has requested an extension of the scheme.  I suggest it might be appropriate for him to table a Commencement matter and we can look at it further, if needed.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne congratulated journalists Jack Horgan-Jones and Hugh O'Connell on the recent publication of their book entitled <i>Pandemonium</i>, which looks back at the last two years of the pandemic.  The Senator then spoke about the overdue report of the Future of Media Commission.  He requested a debate on the future of media and journalism.  We have made that request through the Leader's office and we will arrange a debate at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Senator Malcolm Byrne next spoke about Seanad reform, as did Senator McDowell.  I think that we have waited 18 months for the establishment of the committee and Senator Malcolm Byrne sought an update on progress.  Perhaps a Commencement matter on the issue might move this matter along.</p><p>Senator McDowell requested a debate on the outcome of the elections in Northern Ireland.  I have communicated that to the Leader's office and we will get that debate at the earliest opportunity.  There will be an opportunity this evening, through the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion.  We will request a separate debate specifically on the outcome of the election and the acknowledgement that there is clearly majority support in Northern Ireland for the protocol, which has not been acknowledged by all the stakeholders, including the British Government.</p><p>I am pleased to accept the amendment proposed by Senator Pauline O'Reilly, which was seconded by Senator Garvey.  Senator O'Reilly also spoke about the changing demographic in Northern Ireland and the big story where the Alliance Party more than doubled the number of its seats.  </p><p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly spoke about the Bill on election posters that she intends to introduce.  I believe it is a good thing to have fewer election posters.  Senator Garvey mentioned it is the people who have the most money who can afford the most posters.  I suggest, however, that it also benefits the incumbent to not have election posters because he or she is already known.  I recall that had I not had posters for my first local election, that might have made it a bit more difficult to get elected.  Posters have a role to play.  Perhaps posters could be made from different types of material and have set places to erect them yet give everybody a fair chance because posters have a role to play when one is starting out in politics.</p><p>Senator Gavan spoke about the killing of an Al Jazeera journalist.  I extend our sympathies to her colleagues, family and community following her shocking death.  I also thank Senator Gavan for alerting the House about a briefing today and extending an invitation to attend.</p><p>I note his comments about housing and community.  There are ongoing difficulties.  There is no point in denying that there is a housing crisis and I suggest it has been with us for more than a decade.  The Government has allocated a record amount of more than &euro;4 billion to the Housing for All policy.  We are seeing an increase in the commencement and building of houses despite the past two years where construction was closed down for periods.  Obviously we must also deal with inflation pressures in terms of building materials and a lack of labour supply.  There are significant challenges but despite that, there has been an increase in the commencement and building of houses.  The number of housing units is going in the right direction.  We are starting to turn that ship but it is a challenge.  Senator Gavan also spoke about the affordable housing scheme in Limerick.  Social and private housing will be built and affordable housing is just one element of the housing plan.  I acknowledge his remark that he believes the number of social housing is not sufficient for his community and we will request a debate on housing at the earliest opportunity.</p><p>Senator Buttimer requested a debate in advance of the budget.  We know that budget negotiations will kick off pretty soon and will be in full swing during the summer recess.  Therefore, I think that it would be helpful for us to have a debate in the House before the summer recess and we will request that debate.</p><p>Senator Buttimer, like other Senators, spoke about men's sheds and the briefing that some Senators attended today that took place across the road in Buswells Hotel.  In my own community in Mayo, there are many men's sheds in operation.  There is no doubt but that the establishment of the men's sheds movement has saved lives across the country and has helped tackle the scourge of mental health issues across communities but particularly for men who do not have the same outlets that women sometimes have in terms of meeting friends and having somewhere to go.  The movement is really important and needs our support.  I acknowledge the comment the Senator made about how 70 men's sheds have not re-opened since the pandemic.  There is an onus on us to assist the organisers of those men's sheds to get them up and running.  I also note the point made by Senator Gallagher that the Irish Men's Shed Association would like assistance to initiate a national campaign to recruit more members, raise awareness of their work and encourage other men to join their local men's sheds.</p><p>Senator Maria Byrne spoke about the review announced by the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, to assess school buildings that are lying vacant and empty after school hours and to consider ways to repurpose or re-use them for community reasons while vacant for a few hours.  It is a good initiative and I suggest to the Senator that a Commencement matter would be an appropriate avenue to get an update on when the review is due to be completed.</p><p>Senator Currie spoke passionately about the victims of the Troubles and the proposed amnesty from the British Government.  Almost all, if not all Senators, would concur with her remarks in that regard.</p><p>Senator Garvey, as I mentioned, spoke about the Green Party's Private Members' Bill on election posters that will be taken next week.</p><p>Senator Keogan spoke about the proposed legislation, from a European context, that regulates the control of chat forums.  I do not have the full details on the proposal.  I take on board her comments around whether it is right to have a policy of mass surveillance.  My view is that it is not.  While I do not think the ends justify the means, I understand the reasoning for the legislation.  I am sure we would all agree that we need to tackle and try to address the issues she raised around child pornographic material and abusive material.  I believe we should alert citizens to these proposals.  I also believe that such policies and laws should come from the citizens they will affect.  I take on board the Senator's remarks in that regard.</p><p>Senator Boyhan put on the record of the House news of the passing of Mr. Alan Gillis and paid tribute to his immense contribution to public life plus his expertise in agriculture.  I am impressed by the fact that Mr. Gillis owned 375 acres.  He seems like a man who had a very good and fulfilled life.</p></speech>

Alan Gillis achieved a lot according to what Senator Boyhan put on the record this morning.  The Senator paid him a very fitting tribute and I concur with his remarks.  I extend our sympathies to his family, community and the Fine Gael Party on the passing of Alan Gillis.</p> <p>Finally, Senator McGreehan spoke about Irish Water.  She has previously raised this issue that concerns the inhabitants of the area around the Cooley Peninsula.  I urge the representatives of Irish Water to engage with the Senator and other people in the community to ensure there is adequate water pressure in order that people can run showers.  I do not think that it is too much to ask that people have basic water services in this day and age.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of visiting Pelletstown Educate Together National School in Dublin West with the T&aacute;naiste and the Danish ambassador.  I very much look forward to hearing Senators' contributions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.97" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#P00100"><p>It is very fitting that today's statements in the Seanad and yesterday's statements in the D&aacute;il coincide with the 50th anniversary of the week in which we held a referendum in Ireland to join the European Economic Community, EEC, as it was known at that time.  We voted by 83% in favour and why would we not do so?  It was a huge opportunity for us.  There was also the reality that our trade with Britain was very high at that time.  We were very dependent on Britain so when it decided to join the EEC, we had no option but to do so too.  The same held true for Denmark at that time.  After we joined, our trade diversified massively and our opportunities also diversified massively.</p> <p>That high level of support for the EU in the referendum 50 years ago, at 83%, has increased or at least been maintained over the years.  A survey this week found that 88% of Irish people wish to remain in the European Union, one of the highest scores in any similar surveys done across the EU.  I thank European Movement Ireland for carrying out that research through Red C.  The findings are in line with views expressed by citizens who have taken part in events related to the Conference on the Future of Europe.  </p> <p>Over the coming year the Government, through the EU50 programme, will be providing opportunities to reflect on 50 years of Irish membership of the EU and what this means.  Citizens will be engaged in discussions on Ireland's place in the world.  I was very happy to launch this programme with the Taoiseach at the National Archives in January, where we saw a copy of the accession treaty signed in 1972 by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Patrick Hillery.  I also went to the archives in Brussels where I saw the originals.  The original signed copies of the treaties are in Rome, where the repository of the Treaty of Rome is also located.</p> <p>On Monday, along with many of my ministerial colleagues and several ambassadors, I visited schools to mark Europe Day.  I also hosted the Danish ambassador in Ratoath and a representative of the European Commission in Dunshaughlin.  We also went to Eurofound with a number of schools.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, hosted the Croatian ambassador on Monday.  All of these events showed the knowledge, interest and enthusiasm of young people for all things European.  People really do feel that they are both Irish and European.  </p> <p>It was a courageous decision in 1972.  Indeed, it was courageous to even look to join the EEC.  We had only gained our independence 50 years earlier and in terms of political parties, only Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael supported accession.  Everyone else was against it.  We were called sell-outs and were told that the Irish language and rural Ireland would be destroyed but the truth is that our membership has led to transformative change.  I heard a Deputy in the other House complaining that the EU did not get to the regions or to the rural areas.   Perhaps the Deputy never heard of the Common Agriculture Policy, CAP, or rural development funding.  Up to 80% of the EU budget for decades was spent on rural areas and the rural areas of Ireland benefited disproportionately and were transformed over that time.  Ironically, the EU enabled us, by supporting agriculture, to diversify from it and from our trade with Britain.  Membership has brought benefits such as freedom of movement.  We can live, work, and holiday in countries across the EU and we use the same currency as those member states that are in the eurozone.  Of course, we should never forget the simple things that were put through like the sanitisation of mobile phone roaming costs.  It is not that long ago that Irish people came back from holidays, having watched a few YouTube videos, only to find themselves with a bill for hundreds of euro.  The European Union got rid of that.  It is starting to creep back into Britain and one is reminded of the song line, "You don't know what you've got 'til it's gone".  That is the situation following Brexit, as the British will discover more and more.  </p> <p>The Erasmus+ programme has opened up huge opportunities as well.  We can live and study anywhere in Europe, an option that past generations did not have.  From a university point of view, Erasmus should be at the same level as the Horizon programme.  Those opportunities are equally valuable to our universities and to society.  The research is different, equally valuable, but different.  Universities should be giving equal status, in terms of their administrative structures, to Horizon and Erasmus+ because education is key.</p> <p>We also have career opportunities in the European institutions that I am always trying to remind people about.  We started an EU career strategy last year and are constantly working on that to make sure that more Irish people go to work in the EU institutions.  Unfortunately, about one third of our staff will be retiring in the next three years, which is incredible and in that context, we need more Irish people to go into the institutions.  They need to be encouraged as well as made to realise that demand for language skills is very high.  That is a national challenge facing us all.  We want to see 100 additional Irish officials placed in permanent posts in the institutions by 2030.  This is really crucial but is separate from the people who are in language jobs.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and I met Commissioner Hahn yesterday to discuss this.  </p> <p>The EU is not perfect.  It is a democracy of 27 countries coming around the table so we should not expect easy or quick answers.  What we can expect, and what we have seen over many years, and I have given some examples already, are solutions for citizens.  Almost everything the EU does is in the interests, and for the benefit, of its citizens.  Almost all of the allegations about the EU warmongering and so on are simply fake news.  The founding declaration of the EU is the Schuman Declaration dating from 9 May 1950.  What Schuman proposed was the joining up of the coal and steel industries of France and Germany for two purposes.  One was economic development and the other was to ensure that they could not physically go to war against one another if coal and steel production was merged and brought together.  Coal and steel are obviously crucial for fighting a war, for making weapons.  The idea that there is a military-industrial complex within the EU, although I accept that there is within individual countries, is completely false.  In fact, if the EU were involved in such, we would probably have far less spending on defence but that is a debate for another day.  It is not something that Ireland is taking part in at this time.</p> <p>On the big issues in recent years, including Brexit, Covid-19 vaccines and the Ukraine invasion, the EU has gathered together as one and spoken with one voice for the benefit of its citizens.  On climate change, the EU is the only organisation in the world where everything it does feeds into its climate change agenda.  The EU brings climate into absolutely everything it does and that must be acknowledged.  On Brexit, the protection of the Good Friday Agreement has been the Government's priority.  An election has just happened in Northern Ireland and approximately 60% of MLAs support the protocol.  I acknowledge that there are unionist concerns about it but that is exactly what the EU is trying to address in its discussions with the British Government.  We want to help but we need to see an Executive formed and the protocol applied.  The UK Government needs to engage constructively because while a one-sided, unilateral approach has been mentioned and the waters have been tested for it over a number of years, they have always come to the conclusion that it cannot be done.  I have no doubt that will be the conclusion in this instance too but unfortunately, in the meantime, a lot of time will be wasted.  We need to get with the programme now, make sure the protocol is in place, deal with the genuine concerns that exist and let Northern Ireland flourish and its economy progress.  That is what we all want.  </p> <p>I look forward to hearing the views of Members here today and thank them for their ongoing interest in what is our European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1642" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#P00200"><p>It has been 72 years since the Schuman Declaration was presented by French foreign minister, Robert Schuman, on 9 May 1950.  Celebrating Europe Day annually allows us to remember where we started and to reflect on how far we have come.  Remembering our history and bringing it to new generations is important because there was a very good reason for the development of the then European Coal and Steel Community, what is today the European Union.  The original aim and purpose of the Union was peace and to ensure that we never again witnessed the devastation brought about by the Second World War.</p> <p>In the period following the war, the European Union has been transformed into a progressive, united and democratic Union based on the values of human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights.  We can be very proud of the fact that Ireland has been part of that since 1972 and 1973.  The Irish people supported our membership overwhelmingly and were very happy to join the EU.  It is 50 years since the then Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, signed the treaty of accession and the Irish people voted in a referendum to join.  A poll back in 1972 showed 83% support.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Lisa Chambers:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2449"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2449&amp;amp;pid=LisaChambers&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A similar poll today shows it at 88%.  Not only have we maintained that support in the past 50 years, which is no mean feat, we have increased support in this country.<br/><br/>The Schuman Declaration of 1950 states: </p><blockquote>	Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan.  It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a<i></i>de facto<i></i>solidarity. </blockquote><p>That statement is as valid today as it was 72 years ago.  We must always remind ourselves that what we have built in our European Union community is fragile and a work in progress.  We must protect the European Union and all of its values and continue to work to ensure all citizens are served by our policies.<br/><br/>From its core economic beginnings, the European Union has grown to be an advocate and champion for workers' rights, equality, climate justice and social justice and it has ensured that across member states, standards of living have increased with better homes, cleaner water, fresher air and higher wages.  When we think of the transformation Ireland has undergone since it joined the European Union 50 years ago, in some ways, our country is unrecognisable and for the better.<br/><br/>The founding members of the European Union spoke about the need for solidarity.  They understood the absolute necessity for member states to be economically linked and to rise and prosper together.  When one member state is hurting, we all hurt and there is an incentive to protect and support one another because of this interdependence.  Brexit is a perfect example of the value of this solidarity.  As a small member state, Ireland received full and overwhelming support from our European colleagues.  The challenge to our small country was viewed as a challenge for the European Union and the guard came up right across member states.  Despite an attempt to divide and conquer, there was no chink to be found in the European armour and Ireland found itself with the backing of the European Union and the United States.  Not only did this protect our interests in what could have been a devastating event for our country and economy, it sent a clear message that we are a Union, united in our support for each other and the values that we as members have chosen to subscribe to.  Smaller member states and citizens of smaller member states needed to hear this message and see the actions that flowed from it.  We knew that after the Brexit vote our solidarity would be tested and the future as a bloc questioned.  We have answered our critics and secured the EU's future.<br/><br/>The European Union is being tested yet again with the war in Ukraine.  Our response to the Russian invasion of a sovereign democratic country in Europe at our borders will be crucial.  Not only are we dealing with a large-scale humanitarian crisis and a level of migration not seen in Europe since the Second World War, we are also dealing with an energy crisis and impending food supply disruptions.  Stronger together is still our message.  The European Union will have to respond to protect our citizens, to uphold the values we ascribe to and to make sure that we do the right thing by the Ukrainian people.<br/><br/>Maintaining solidarity among member states and among citizens is as crucial today as it was in 1970.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1674" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#Q00200"><p>I appreciate Senator Chambers giving me a little of her time in order that I can express on the record today my ongoing support for the European Union.  Like the Minister of State and Senator Chambers, all of us, including those who have reservations about Europe, have to acknowledge that the development that has happened in this country over those years has been significant.  I wonder if we were not in the European Union where we would be in terms of emigration, unemployment and our economy.  </p> <p>Back then, and since then, many of the people who were opposed to the European Union spoke about military alliance.  The reality is 50 years on, Ireland is still neutral.  I would not like to see Ireland join NATO but nobody in Europe has tried to force us into it.  It is important to make that point because it has been falsely used over the years to frighten people off the European project.  A great deal of money has been invested here in education, our towns and villages and agriculture.  There have been problems along the route from time to time, but realistically our economy has benefited largely.</p> <p>The European Union has opened up huge opportunities in regard to our exports.  That is evidenced in the level of exports from this country.  Irish people are brilliant when they get an opening.  They will continue to grow that export market.  I believe Europe has been the real reason we have had this progress.  As stated by Senator Chambers, the Irish people are in favour of Europe.  We all have reservations from time to time, but it has been a good project.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.101" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1692" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#Q00300"><p>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this very important debate in that it is a recognition of our maturity within the EU, a celebration of its success and a level of reflection on the future.  It is a worthwhile exercise in that regard.</p> <p>The sad backdrop to this debate is that we have war in Europe.  That is outside of the control of the EU, but it is a tragedy.  We must remain responsive to the displaced persons and, later, supportive of the reconstruction of Ukraine.  We must respond to the economic impact of the war and be uncompromising in our sanctions and condemnation of it.  It is an unfortunate backdrop to what has been the greatest peace project in the history of the world, namely, the European Union.</p> <p>It is also an unfortunate backdrop to this debate that we have the Brexit question still looming.  The point made by Senator Chambers in regard to European solidarity with us on that is well made.  It is a tribute to our diplomatic service, the Irish Government and to all of us who in our own individual ways have managed to secure the solidarity of Europe with us on the Brexit question.  That needs to hold up.  It is a pity we still have the protocol issue.  On this auspicious occasion, my message to the Minister of State is that we have to hold the line on the international agreement dimension but we should exercise every imaginable flexibility to get the protocol operational and, as a consequence, get the Assembly in Northern Ireland operational.  I think I am pushing an open door in that regard, but, perhaps, when he is concluding the debate the Minister of State would reference where we stand on the protocol.</p> <p>I am in an extraordinarily strong position to speak on this matter.  I am happy to admit publicly - this might be apparent - that the very early years of my life were in a pre-EU Ireland and all of my adult life has been in a post-EU Ireland.  As I said, I am in very good position to speak about this.  It has been transformative for Ireland.  To paraphrase the Minister of State, it has been totally transformative.  In terms of the social reform that has arisen from the EU, women's rights have been advanced beyond recognition.  We are talking of two different planets and two different times in terms of equality, gender equality, equal pay for equal work, the right to equal work, the right to quality employment and the barbaric strangulation of women in regard to issues such as jury service and bizarre antiquated legislation.  All of that went by the wayside.  Women's rights were propelled in this country by virtue of the EU.  That in itself is enormous.  It alone would justify our continued 88% loyalty to the EU.  </p> <p>It has been transformative in terms of infrastructure around this country on our roadways, canals and buildings and the many peace projects around the country by way of the provision of the money for the peace process and rural development.  One has only to drive around Ireland to see the many developments that have been funded by the EU.  They have enhanced our country greatly.  That funding was provided by the EU through many bodies.  I acknowledge that we have become a net contributor.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are now a net contributor by virtue of the success of the funding exercises.</p><p>CAP has been extraordinarily transformative for the county from which I come, namely, Cavan.  It has given farmers support and got them a proper price for their produce.  There is still work to be done in that regard &ndash; there always is &ndash; but CAP has created a European market of 500 million people for our produce.  It has delivered decent pricing, support and regulation.</p><p>Social policies, rural development policies, social cohesion exercises and CAP have been very important.  As a consequence of our economic success thanks to Europe, we are now the technology capital of the world, with companies like Google and Facebook headquartering here.  This is extraordinary.  The Minister of State mentioned the important Erasmus+ programme.  I occasionally have the privilege of meeting some of its participants informally when I attend Council of Europe events in Strasbourg.  How much they enjoy it is wonderful to see.  Importantly, European values are permeating our country.  We are a wonderful catalyst or agent for the rule of law, democracy and the rights of human beings because we insist on those in accession treaties with new countries.</p><p>We could discuss this subject for a long time, but I have to conclude.  I would like the Minister of State to speak about the accession of Ukraine and Georgia, which should be accelerated in every way possible.  He might also reference the military question and the fact that there is no military obligation on Ireland.  It is the wish of the people that there not be.</p><p>This is a wonderful day.  We are celebrating something that has changed people's lives, which is something that I know that from both sides.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1667" speakername="Vincent P Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#R00200"><p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Sometimes, we forget that the primary success of the EU has been peace.  Monday was Europe Day, when we celebrated the Schuman Declaration.  The Schuman plan was to establish long-term peace in post-war Europe.  It has been a considerable success, as Senator O'Reilly stated.</p> <p>Europe has grown in strength at a time of crisis, with what Bono called "one man's war" bringing Europe together like never before.  Although it has been the Continent's darkest hour since the Second World War, it has also been one of its proudest hours, with European countries working together.  Since the Second World War, the Continent has been an entirely more positive landscape than it was beforehand.</p> <p>On Europe Day, it was poignant to welcome dozens of displaced Ukrainians to Barretstown Castle in Ballymore Eustace, where they had a wonderful engagement with the Ukrainian ambassador and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman.  The irony was not lost on us that, while we were celebrating Europe Day, we had as our special guests Ukrainians who, although we had made them welcome in this country, would have loved to have been able to return to their own country.  Imagine being moved out of your home and told that you were heading to Ukraine.  It would turn your life upside down.</p> <p>Ironically, we have to thank Putin for bringing Europe closer together.  He has also indirectly had a positive impact on the world and Europe's view on fossil fuels.  Sales of fossil fuels to Europe supply Putin with tanks and bombs.</p> <p>Yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of the people of Ireland voting by referendum to take their place among the nations of Europe.  It was a lifetime ago.  I commend "The Late Late Show" of the time, which put on a mock trial, although I am not old enough to remember it.  In recent weeks, Mr. Justice John D. Cooke passed away.  He had served in the High Court and in Europe.  He was one of the actors in the mock trial, as were Mr. Justice Donal Barrington, Mr. Justice Thomas Finlay and other judges.  That trial extrapolated the issues.  The broadcast was ahead of its time and drilled down into what accession would mean for Ireland.  Thankfully, Ireland gave Europe the thumbs up.</p> <p>We look to Europe for workers' rights and a lead on climate change.  We must do more, though.  Some of the issues that my colleagues, Ms Grace O'Sullivan MEP  and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe MEP, have raised in the European Parliament are important, for example, limiting toxic industrial chemicals in our products, given that such chemicals pose a threat to the environment.  Ms O'Sullivan was rapporteur on the Environment Action Programme, which will phase out fossil fuel subsidies in ten years' time.  Mr. Cuffe has been leading the way on the issue of embodied carbon in buildings and measuring it over a building's lifespan.</p> <p>Europe Day provides us the opportunity, not only to reflect on the successes of the past, but to look to the future.  I was intrigued to read President Emmanuel Macron's vision &ndash; I congratulate him on his recent electoral success &ndash; for the EU.  In a speech he delivered recently in Strasbourg, he argued for a multi-speed Union.  This idea can be controversial, but the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.  Certain member states could go further than others in certain policy areas.  President Macron also argued for a broader European neighbourhood community, which would be available to those that were considering joining the EU, like Ukraine, and those that had left but would like to co-operate in a greater way, for example, the UK.  In the latter respect, I am also thinking of a special dispensation for Northern Ireland to have its voice heard in a more formal way.  This idea would have the advantage of granting some level of co-operation to countries that may require years or decades to meet the strict criteria for joining the EU.</p> <p>Today is about embracing and celebrating the EU.  It is wonderful to be here today and to have all of these parliamentarians speaking positively about a growing, living project that changes by the week and year.  It is important that Ireland be at the forefront of that project.</p></speech>

We believe that Ireland's future is at the heart of a just and equal EU and we will continue to engage with its institutions actively and critically.  While there is much good in the EU, there are areas where we should continue being critical.  We are concerned about the continuing and increasing militarisation within the EU.  We believe it is important that Ireland maintain the freedom to develop its own independent foreign policy.  It is also important that there be a core space for militarily non-aligned neutral states within the EU.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in believes that, although Ireland remains committed and invested in the EU, we should preserve the capacity to maintain areas of sovereignty, particularly over fiscal policy.  To that end, we support the maintenance of unanimity in voting on EU policy, which protects the rights of smaller states like Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We believe in the further expansion of the EU, and, as colleagues have mentioned, we support the current applications for membership of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.  Sinn F&eacute;in has condemned the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and we continue to do so.  We stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.  We also believe the EU and this State should be doing more to help countries, especially Moldova, which is one of the poorest countries in Europe.  Moldova is shouldering the majority of the effort of dealing with refugees from the conflict.</p><p>The impact of the war in Ukraine is being felt right across the world, as the Minister of State knows.  The global south, which must also contend with the impact of climate change, political instability and the failure of the developed world to provide adequate supplies of Covid-19 vaccines, will be faced with enormous food shortages.  Some countries are 100% reliant on Ukraine and Russia for grain supplies and the supply interruption as a consequence of the conflict has the potential to contribute to famine in the year ahead if measures are not taken and taken now.  The EU responded rapidly and robustly to the Russian invasion, and Sinn F&eacute;in supported that.  However, it is important that the values central to the EU ideal, which has been used to guide its response to Russian aggression, are also used to guide the EU's response to the abuse of human rights in other countries and regions.  The EU has repeatedly failed to act in any significant way on human rights abuses in Palestine.  Amnesty International and the UN have produced reports that clearly show Israel's policies towards Palestinians amount to apartheid.</p><p>The EU has, as the Minister of State acknowledged, played a significant role to date in defending the protocol.  This will remain important in the time ahead as the British Government tries to undermine and subvert the protocol, which it signed up to, negotiated and agreed.  Many participants at events in Ireland and the Conference on the Future of Europe felt that people in the North should receive continued support from the EU.  The assembly election results represent a historic milestone, with Sinn F&eacute;in holding the position of First Minister and being the largest party in the assembly.  The election demonstrated again the majority support for pro-EU and anti-Brexit parties.  We welcome the conclusion of the Conference on the Future of Europe and many of the recommendations that were brought forward.  We believe the EU should become more autonomous in energy production and Ireland is strategically placed to become a major producer of wind energy from offshore wind farms.</p><p>Ba mhaith liom a aithint agus a mholadh go bhfuil an Ghaeilge anois aitheanta mar theanga oifigi&uacute;il de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh.  Crutha&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo sealanna faoi choinne post agus tuilleadh idirghn&iacute;omhaithe idir Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; anseo in &Eacute;irinn agus institi&uacute;id&iacute; de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh.</p><p>While we celebrate the EU on Europe Day many of us sadly must look on as rights, entitlements and representation we once had as result of a Brexit we voted against.  I think, in particular, of the DiscoverEU programme, which I have raised a number of times in the House.  The programme in question gave 35,000 18-year-olds across the EU a one-month free Interrail pass.  What a fantastic, valuable and positive initiative.  It gives young people the opportunity to explore, learn, develop and grow.  Sadly, this scheme is denied to EU citizens in the North.  That opportunity has been shut down to them.  Is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.  I hope this can be reflected upon and that similar welcome schemes are open to all EU citizens throughout all of Ireland.  Ireland's place in the EU is safe and secure and Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to play a positive role in developing its future in an egalitarian, just and progressive direction.</p></speech>

This year more than ever we realise Europe was set up as a peace project.  That was the main driver of it.  Ireland has specifically benefited from that peace project, economically, infrastructurally and culturally.  This year we are having these statements in the shadow of the invasion of one neighbouring state by another.  For the second time since the Second World War, we are seeing crimes against humanity brought to our Continent.  This underlines why Europe has been and continues to be so important.  We have not been under threat in the way we are now since the Second World War.  We are entering a phase where the countries that have traditionally been the powerhouses of Europe, such as France, have a growing number of people who are questioning the European project.  This is a critical time for us to prove the value of Europe as an ethical, democratic counterweight in world affairs to other more nefarious countries.  If we do not hold Europe together we potentially have the threat of a much more powerful Russia and a powerful China.  Europe needs to be the leader in taking a democratic, ethical and human rights-based approach.  It needs to be human rights-based player in diplomatic and world affairs.</p> <p>We have the challenges of Brexit on this island.  Every Senator regrets that the UK decided to leave the EU and saw itself as having a stronger place in world affairs outside it.  It is very much the last gasp of a dying empire.  Over the last number of years, given what is happening with living standards falling, food not being available on shelves and the UK's petrol crisis, we see the value being a member of a co-ordinated EU can bring.  I hope the UK revisits its decision, but it is important for us, in the context of that decision, to reiterate our commitment to the EU and that we are strong Europeans and very much part of the Continent.</p> <p>As a final point, I raise the climate response and the potential for the EU to address the climate challenges facing us by means of a co-ordinated effort.  Part of the political discourse that has become popular is that small, individual actions do not matter, that it is all about the top number of companies that are emitting and that, somehow, it will be somebody else's actions that solve the climate problem.  The latter will only be solved by co-ordinated action by everybody at individual, national, global, institutional and corporate level.  The EU, as one of the big economic powerhouses, has the opportunity to force companies to take proper, sustained and viable climate action.  As Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile said, Ireland is strategically placed as far as wind energy is concerned.  We have wind in the north of the country and we have solar in the south.  Central Europe is reliant on that energy.  It creates a great opportunity for Ireland, but also Europe, to move to net zero by 2050.  We will be able to realise that only by sustained and co-ordinated action on the part of all member states.  A global challenge requires a global response, and a strong EU will be able to deliver that.</p></speech>

I also welcome the students from St. Joseph's College, Lucan.  It is always brilliant to see young people in the House.</p> <p>I am going to put a different spin on marking Europe Day.  I would like all of us to look at this as a day of reflection, as Senator Chambers has already said.  Ireland, as a small nation, has made our voice heard at the highest level during our 50 years in the EU.  We have benefited from membership of the EU in many ways.  The EU and the Council of Europe have been strong allies in keeping pressure on the State in respect of issues affecting the Traveller Community.  The EU has highlighted in its reporting violations in Ireland around accommodation, education, health and other issues impacting on the Traveller Community.  The EU has played a key role in Travellers being recognised as an ethnic minority group in Ireland.  If Europe had not played such a key role, we still would not be recognised as an ethnic minority group.  I wish to be clear about that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Eileen Flynn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EileenFlynn&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Europe has also provided Traveller organisations with valuable tools in some of our campaigns for equality.  We still find ourselves waiting on the Irish State to deliver in many areas.  I wonder whether there may be a further role for Europe in ensuring follow-up and accountability in areas of equality.  When we think of the solidarity and unity the EU represents, we must make sure no one is left behind &ndash; not here, and not anywhere in Europe.<br/><br/>We have seen how quickly the EU can respond to a refugee crisis and I would like to see it extend that same welcome to all refugees and people seeking asylum who are fleeing war and violence.  However, Roma women and children fleeing Russian aggression in Ukraine are still struggling to find homes.  I read in <i>The Guardian</i>of a Roma woman who fled to Poland with her son&rsquo;s wife and her adult daughter.  They had seven children between them.  She said: &quot;I just wish landlords would meet with us before they reject us&quot;.  The women have been able to find work but not homes.  Roma refugees face not just a lack of support; they also face discrimination.  That is not fake news.  From talking to Pavee Point, we know violence against Roma communities is rising across Europe.  The Roma community in Ireland also reports high levels of discrimination.  We cannot allow this.  When we talk about European unity we must mean everybody, including Roma and Traveller people.<br/><br/>On Europe Day this year, it is important to reflect on the Conference on the Future of Europe, which has just ended.  My colleague Senator Higgins was proud to be one of four representatives of the Oireachtas at the conference.  The Civil Engagement Group recommends that we have a debate on the outcomes of the conference in the Seanad over the next few coming weeks, while it is hot on the agenda, to discuss the recommendations on how to live together as Europeans in the future.  We need to look at the implementation of the recommendations from the conference etc.  We talk about being proud members of Europe but we also have a responsibility to make sure this includes all people of Europe.  No person from the Roma community should be treated wrongly or in an ill manner at borders.</p></speech>

I wish him a belated happy Europe Day.  Today is important for reflecting on what 9 May means.  It is important that we celebrate our membership of the European Union as citizens of Ireland and of the European Union, and as a nation with a proud tradition of being in the European Union.  We should look at the European project in its entirety and always look objectively, as Senator Flynn said, at how we can improve the lives of people who may have been left behind, who might not have benefited as they should have from the European project and our economic and social development as a nation.</p> <p>I am a very proud European person.  I am also a proud Irishwoman, a proud Louth woman and a proud Cooley Peninsula woman.  All those identifications do not dilute our reject other identities.  We should all stand tall in our identities and embrace and be proud of each one of them.</p> <p>We need to acknowledge the importance of our elevation into the European Union.  The Irish nation was not always welcomed at a European level.  After the First World War, we went to Paris to ask for recognition of this Irish nation and we were denied that.  We were denied support for our right to self-determination as a small nation but now our place is in Europe and our voices are heard.  That did not happen by accident.  It came from decades of strong diplomatic performances by our diplomats, civil servants and successive Irish Governments.  Modern Ireland did not happen by accident.  It began when Se&aacute;n Lemass took over as a Fianna F&aacute;il Taoiseach.  He looked to the future and changed how we looked beyond Ireland, to make Ireland a modern nation.  In 1961 he first applied to Europe under a Fianna F&aacute;il Government and it took us 11 years to become members.</p> <p>People always ask what Europe has done for us.  It has done an awful lot.  Peace has been mentioned - peace on the Continent but also in Ireland.  People often do not give the European Union recognition for the Good Friday Agreement and the important role it played in its success, the signing of it and how it came about.  Without that, we would not have the strong Good Friday Agreement we have.  The European Union gives us a voice on an international stage.  It gave us legitimacy on an international stage when Ireland was seen as a small nation on the outskirts of Europe.  Now we are a small nation at the heart of Europe.  It has also given us funding.  Nobody can deny the impact of the regional and structural funds we have received over the past 50 years of our membership, the infrastructure it has created and supported or the peace funds it has supported.  There is also the Common Agricultural Policy and the impact it has had on education and communities.  We learn from other countries and create links with other nations and our friends all across Europe.</p> <p>The European Union has shown us how we can work collectively together on climate change.  Now we see how we need to work and stand tall against the Russian aggressor.  The Russian war has drastically exposed issues around energy security.  I would criticise Germany's position over the past couple of years as we have slept on this and walked ourselves into this reliance.  We allowed the bigger nations of Europe to not listen to experts and move towards greater reliance on gas and coal from Russia.  Thankfully, the war has exposed that but we need to be stronger in moving collectively as a European Union, looking inward and outside the European Union as well.  The European Union also needs to stand far taller on human rights abuses.  There are countries both in Europe and outside it where it has not been strong enough.  We need to be stronger and we need to call out people who are talking out both sides of their mouths on an awful lot of issues, in the European Parliament and other places of authority.  They are not standing tall or proud and are not being progressive in looking after all the citizens of Europe.  I could go on.  It is a good day to stand tall as European citizens and celebrate Europe Day.</p></speech>

The European Union was a vision of bringing our countries together after the horrors of the Second World War for peace, understanding that all nations have to work together for success.  Some 50 years ago, Ireland voted to join the European Union and seek peace and prosperity.  That was in the 1970s, at a time when there was so much poverty.  There was so much poverty in the 1940s and 1950s.  When I was doing my Irish oral and aural exams for the leaving certificate, they were all about emigration and people leaving our country.  In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, hundreds of thousands of people were leaving our shores.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We were told the best and brightest were leaving.  While we have an important diaspora, we now have something to offer at home.  That is what the European Union has brought about for us here in Ireland.  We have world-class people in Ireland.  These are people who shine in every walk of life.  Whether it is in arts and culture, enterprise, research or agriculture, our people are there at the top.  Ireland has taken its place among the nations but that is thanks to some of the incredible representatives we have had in Ireland over the decades.  We have Mairead McGuinness, previously a Vice President of the European Parliament and now in a highly influential role as European Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union.</p><p>This Union is also about peace.  We have seen that in what we have achieved in Northern Ireland.  A quote from John Hume was highlighted for Europe Day.  He stated, "the European Union is the best example in the history of the world of conflict resolution".  It has shown how countries can come together and work together for peace but it also shows how countries can stand up and protect what we have here, a democracy.  We are fighting for democracy on all levels.  Here in Ireland, we know what we have but we look to the likes of Ukraine and see how its people are suffering.  We see that it is for everyone to fight for democracy today and every day and that it should not be taken for granted.</p><p>It is always about someone with a vision.  We have seen strong leadership, particularly in the case of President Zelenskyy, but it is always the visionaries who bring us our future.  Robert Schuman had a vision when the European Union was being developed.  It was about looking at the ruins of Europe coming out of the Second World War and seeing how we could develop an economy that would bring prosperity to all nations and peoples across Europe.  </p><p>As a woman, I am aware that the European Union has also had a great impact in respect of women's rights.  If it was not for the European Union, where would the women of Ireland be?  There was a school group in here earlier with young women.  When I was a young woman in school, it was incredible to me that women did not get equal pay.  Why would we not get equal pay for doing the same job?  We are still fighting for that today.  We are still looking at gender equality and gender balance.  We are looking at our universities.  For the first time in Ireland, three of our university presidents are female.  That has only happened in the last year or two.  We are looking at the 30% Club and its aim of ensuring that 30% of the members of all boards are women.  </p><p>We have come a hell of a long way, and not by basing ourselves on the Ireland of the 1940s and 1950s.  The men and women of Ireland stand proud of what we have now in 2022, which comes from what we started in the 1970s.  Prosperity is key, as is our economy and our enterprise.  Coming from the west of Ireland, I know that the regions are very important.  We are a region in transition.  As a result of membership of the European Union, over &euro;40 billion has been invested since the 1970s.  Over 40% of our exports are to the European Union.  If we did not have that investment in our road infrastructure to open up our regions, to allow vehicles and trucks to come to these areas and to allow people to export from the likes of Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, there would be no way for the economy in the regions to survive.  I am thinking of the outer areas and even the islands.  That investment has been crucial.</p><p>As a European Union citizen, the European Union has meant everything to me growing up.  I had the opportunity to take part in the Erasmus programme when I was in college.  I was doing history and learning French and I had the opportunity to study for a year in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.  It was my first time ever leaving the country.  That was through what was University College Galway, is now the National University of Ireland, Galway, and will soon be the University of Galway.  I got to stand tall as a woman from the west, coming from a small town, going abroad and learning before bringing that learning back to Ireland.  Over the last two years, there have been lockdowns and people have not been able to travel.  One of the most important things for our young people is being able to travel and to go abroad.  One can travel freely within the European Union.  One can live, work or take time out in any country of the EU.  We have such a wonderful region.  People working can create a Europass CV and travel and work.  It is incredible to think what that can bring to a country.  It opens up the mind.  </p><p>I spoke about fighting for democracy.  One of the other key things about the European Union relates to how we are open to accepting all types of people, all types of backgrounds, all the new nationalities coming to live in Ireland and the new communities, to making sure that we are welcoming and open to new thoughts and perspectives, and that our country will be better and stronger as part of the European Union.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1638" speakername="Malcolm Byrne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#U00200"><p>It is quite momentous to mark Ireland's 50-year membership of the European Union.  From a Fianna F&aacute;il perspective, this is something of which we have always been very proud.  It is something that Se&aacute;n Lemass and Jack Lynch led on.  It is interesting that the only two parties sitting here are the only two parties that have consistently supported our membership of the European Union over those 50 years and campaigned for its enlargement and for enhanced co-operation.  As colleagues have said, it is very much a union based on principles of peace and prosperity.  Those were the driving forces behind its establishment and remain its guiding principles today.</p> <p>I will make a number of suggestions as regards things we can do to enhance understanding of the EU and encourage greater co-operation in areas where that can work.  I will also address some concerns that have been raised.</p> <p>I know the Minister of State is passionate about greater teaching of languages and a greater uptake of modern European languages, which are important.  We need to invest in a European languages initiative from primary school onward to a far greater extent.  While I know that efforts are being made, we should seek to ensure that every Irish citizen will, in the future, be fluent in Irish, English and at least one modern European language.  We should set and pursue that objective for ourselves for the medium to long term.</p> <p>Many colleagues have spoken about the Erasmus programme.  We need to continue to broaden the appeal of the Erasmus programme.  One of the challenges has always been that Ireland takes in twice as many Erasmus students as we send out.  We have to encourage far more Irish students to avail of the programme.  The DiscoverEU programme, which has been very successful, is limited to 35,000 18-year-olds.  I believe we should set a goal of every 18-year-old within the European Union being able to avail of that programme.  </p> <p>Robert Schuman famously talked about how a lot of the European Union would be forged through crisis.  We have seen a number of crises over recent years, from Brexit to Covid and the war in Ukraine.  The European Union has moved and addressed issues in a way that many of us thought it would not do.  It did so in response to those crises, particularly that in Ukraine.  We should be proud of the leadership shown by Ireland, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs with regard to Ukraine.  Like my colleagues, I strongly support the rapid accession of Ukraine, Georgia and, indeed, other countries in the Balkans.  </p> <p>There has been a useful initiative whereby the Cathaoirleach has invited Members of the European Parliament to the Chamber to exchange views.  I would certainly like to see that continue.  However, we need to look at the broader question of enhanced co-operation at EU level.  Co-operation on issues such as the war in Ukraine and Covid has shown that solutions that benefit all citizens of the European Union can be found and that such co-operation is advantageous.  I am thinking of areas that have already been referred to including the areas of food security, energy security, the climate and biodiversity crisis, and cybersecurity.  It is absolutely essential that member states co-operate very closely.  </p> <p>Every so often, we hear this nonsense that comes up about an EU army.  In every single European referendum campaign since the start, Sinn F&eacute;in has raised this nonsense fear about an EU army.  Let us be very clear; every country and member state will maintain control over its own defence forces but there has to be co-operation between member states.  I particularly encourage greater co-operation with the non-aligned member states such as Finland, Sweden and Austria on some of the issues that are really important to this country.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have to collectively be able to address food and energy security and particularly now.  We have discussed the idea that it is better Irish wind than Russian oil and gas.</p><p>Ireland has always played a very constructive role at the European table.  However, we need to address some of the voices at European level which are bringing shame on Ireland's reputation, particularly where we stood up for the rule of law and for human rights.  I am talking in particular about some of our MEPs.  While we can criticise them inside this House, action also must be taken by the hard left GUE/NGL group in the European Parliament.  In the same way that some of us criticised the EPP for its tolerance of Viktor Orb&aacute;n for a long time, so Sinn F&eacute;in and the other hard left parties need to be called out for continuing to tolerate the membership of Mick Wallace and Clare Daly in that group within the European Parliament.  They are bringing embarrassment on Ireland.  They are not adhering to the European spirit of co-operation and respect for the rule of law and human rights.  In our vision for where we see Europe going those remain fundamental to Ireland's role at the heart of Europe.</p></speech>

I will refer to a couple of lines from two speeches.  In this very Chamber on 14 July 1966, the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald, then a Senator, said: </p> <blockquote> 	If the Government fail to pursue this aim as thoroughly and as efficiently as we think is desirable, we will be pressing them from behind &hellip; It will do no harm to our position in Brussels and in this country if it is seen that this House is concerned about this matter. </blockquote> <p>That was in 1966 before 21 March 1972 when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch said, &quot;Surely it is self-evident that if we were to remain outside the Community we would be conferring on the Border the status of a frontier, both economic and political, between ourselves and the rest of Europe&quot;.  Those are very important words from two great leaders from this country.</p><p>I know many have acknowledged the role that both Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il played in their representation in Europe.  We have had some very fine MEPs who have represented us in the past.  We have very fine MEPs who represent the majority of us and the majority of the MEPs are very honourable.</p><p>The role of Sinn F&eacute;in in Europe was mentioned.  I served on the Committee of the Regions for some years.  While there was a representative from Sinn F&eacute;in there at that time, they would abstain on all the votes because they were not part of a group.  They actually never voted in that time.  That is a terrible indictment.  When one is there one is wearing the Irish jersey.  Ireland has benefited so much from Europe over the years.  Even going back to the local authorities we can think of the amount of European projects that have taken place.  There is money that comes for greenways and blueways.  There are so many really important things like many of our roads.  Ireland had very poor roads for many years.  Only for funding from Europe we have connectivity and other projects.  There is education.  Then connectivity between Ireland and Europe.  There is actually a GAA club in Brussels.  People from Croatia play alongside people from other European countries.  That shows the very strong role that Ireland plays over there.</p><p>Back when I was mayor of Limerick around 2010-11 it was the European city of sport, one of three such cities.  The GAA international convention came.  People from all across Europe came to Limerick to play GAA over a weekend.  It was a really positive event.  It just shows the importance of sport in terms of uniting different countries.  </p><p>Others have mentioned the applications of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia to join the EU.I support the acceleration of their applications.  I met the Moldovan ambassador last night.  Moldova wants to become part of Europe and thinks it has a strong role to play.  The ambassador made some very valid points.  It is something that I would like to strongly support.  Peace and harmony is very much part of the ethos and theme of Europe Day 2022.  With the war which has been ongoing for the last two months it is really important that peace is there.  Peace was there on the agenda 50 years ago and it is still there today.  It is something that does unite a lot of our countries. </p><p>Becoming a member of a party in the European Parliament is about working together collaboratively to support projects but also learning from each other.  The experience of other countries is something that we in Ireland have benefited from.  It is important that we mark the day.  I congratulate the Minister of State for the job he is doing in representing us in Europe.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I was born on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 rising.  Fifty years on from that I was born into a republic that could have been characterised as one of a pitchfork and candlestick.  Ireland was quite a poor country in European terms.  In the 1970s after we joined the European Economic Community, as it was then, it transformed Ireland on a number of fronts in everything from environmental protections to equal status and equality legislation.  It really brought Ireland into the 20th century.  As we enter the 21st century in the wake of Brexit we are the only English-speaking country in the European Union so we are a vital part of the transatlantic link between the United States and Europe which was traditionally there and in which Britain was traditionally the linchpin.  There is a great opportunity for us there.</p> <p>In the 1980s Europe really opened up.  The Berlin Wall came down followed by the reunification of Germany.  Ireland played a particular role in that process and helped to accelerate it and bring it together.  I will return to the unification of the GDR and West Germany in a moment. </p> <p>We had a major problem on the island.   There was an internal security problem that many of us may have forgotten about in the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace dividend that we have all enjoyed so far.  It was one of the reasons I joined the Defence Forces back in the 1980s.  It was because Ireland was a basket case economically but also from a security and defence perspective.  Happily due to the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and everything that has gone on we have enjoyed a peace dividend but we really need to look to Europe for the lessons of its peace processes and conflicts to predict what might happen next on this island because I believe we are on the precipice of great change on the island, particularly after the events in Northern Ireland over the weekend with the changing demographics and the change in voting patterns.  </p> <p>As an Army officer I was proud to serve Ireland in the Middle East in the mid-1990s.  Part of the culture shock for me was the experience of conflict for the first time.  During my tour of duty there was a very violent deployment of the Israelis into Lebanon, Operation Grapes of Wrath, which resulted in the mass murder of hundreds and hundreds of innocent Lebanese men, women and children in much the same way as is happening in Ukraine at the moment.  There was indiscriminate shelling, air strikes, missile attacks and so on.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tom Clonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=TomClonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It made me appreciate, as a young man, the value of the peace we enjoy in Europe.  That was the <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre </i>of the European Union or the European Economic Community, as it was in the beginning.  Its original architects wanted an ongoing peace process for Europe.  We must be very careful not to take that peace for granted.<br/><br/>After Lebanon I went to Bosnia just at the end of that conflict as an election supervisor.  I was based in a Serbian-held area in a town called Prijedor, which I believe holds the record for the highest number of crimes against humanity and war crimes anywhere in Europe.  Again, it was quite clear to me the Serbs, the Croats and those now referred to as Bosniaks or Bosnian Muslims were all wonderful communities made up of great people but conflict arose around historical reasons, going right back to the Ottoman Empire.  There were issues around identity, difference and othering that brought them first into public disorder and civil disturbance and then to killing.  Once the cycle of killing starts, it is very difficult to stop it.  Those groups now have a power-sharing agreement.<br/><br/>This brings me back to my first point.  I have recently heard some politicians, journalists and commentators say that what happens next on this island will be akin to the reunification of West Germany and East Germany.  I do not agree with that assessment, based on my life experience and what I have experienced in Europe and elsewhere.  The position on this island is more akin to what I would have encountered in the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia.  We must be very careful, as Europeans, about how we proceed.  In 15 or 20 years, for example, I do not believe An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann will exist.  They will have been replaced by something like &quot;police service Ireland&quot; or &quot;land forces Ireland&quot;.  Who knows?  We must plan for this as Europeans.<br/><br/>Who is preparing for and thinking about all the architecture and infrastructure around the administration of justice, policing, security and defence, as well as public expenditure and reform, social protection, education and health?  If we do not plan for those on this island, if we do not speak about them or have a citizens' assembly, we may fail our children and grandchildren, if precedents in Europe tell us anything.  If we prepare and plan, Ireland and what happens on this island could be a major international success.  We need to think hard about that.<br/><br/>Based on events in Ukraine, it is great that Ireland is providing political and material support.  I echo Senator Maria Byrne's comments about supporting the accelerated entry of Moldova and Ukraine into the European Union.  Now is not the time for Ireland to join a military alliance.  Our unique influence, including our diplomatic and diaspora's influence, would immediately disappear on our joining any military alliance.  As a fan of Europe, I wish the European project well in the coming years.  For the first time since the Second World War it must stand together for its values and its principles.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1629" speakername="Garret Ahearn" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#W00200"><p>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak in the debate.  It is good that we are able to celebrate Europe Day and make statements on it.  Ireland as a country is the perfect example of why the European Union is a success and we have benefitted on the back of that.  It is important to acknowledge that if it were not for Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il supporting this country in joining the European Union, it would not have happened and all the benefits on the back of that would not have happened either, or at least not until later.</p> <p>We must remember that there are people, including children, dying today simply because they want to be part of the European Union.  There are thousands of people in Ukraine and all they are seeking is freedom for their country and to be part of the European Union.  They have simple requests, which have been mentioned by a number of people.  They want more weapons but clearly Ireland does not play a role in that.  We can play a role when it comes to equipment etc.  Ukrainians want more sanctions on Russia, and the European Union has been very supportive on that matter.  Ukraine is seeking more sanctions to defeat loopholes or other countries facilitating Russia or giving it opportunities through such loopholes.</p> <p>Ukraine also wants sanctions against Russian media.  One of the main points Ukraine wants to make is that this is a war by Russia and not just Mr. Putin.  It is supported by the Russian people, although the information they are getting is one-sided.  It is being supported by the Russian nation and until there are sanctions on television stations and people who work in media in Russia and the narrative is changed, the support for Putin will not change.  Until that happens he will not be overthrown.</p> <p>One of the key roles we can play in the next number of weeks is to support Ukraine with its candidate status in joining the European Union.  It is a massive deal for the Ukrainian Government to ensure that goes through in June and is not delayed.  The public perception is that European countries have been very supportive of Ukraine joining the European Union - Ireland has been more supportive than anybody else.  People said this last week when I spoke with them.  However, the Minister of State knows better than anyone that a number of countries are, at best, sceptical about Ukraine joining the Union.  It is imperative that Ukraine receives candidate status for joining the European Union at the end of June.</p> <p>The Minister of State knows that in war, propaganda and perception are just as important as anything else.  If Ukraine does not receive that status in June, the propaganda put out by Russia will be that Europe does not want Ukraine.  The argument from the start by the Russians is that Ukraine should come back to Russia and many Ukrainians want to be part of Russia.  It is utter rubbish but the argument will be strengthened if, as sometimes happens in Europe, we say we need a bit more time to think about it and the issue is complex.  All the matters can be resolved and this is just about giving candidate status to Ukraine.</p> <p>We are a small country in Europe but we are very influential in our role.  The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, have done phenomenal work over the past number of months in flexing their muscles from a diplomatic perspective and ensuring the people of Ukraine are supported.  It is imperative that they receive that status at the end of June.  I spoke with Ukrainians last week and I know that would re-energise the Ukrainian Government and justify the fight being put in by its army.  They will be able to see a future for themselves and their people.  If the European Union can do that, the Ukrainians are utterly convinced they will win the war.  On the back of that, they are utterly convinced that after that, Ukraine will be able to join the European Union.</p> <p>I am drifting away from the topic of Europe Day but this is a critical point for the European Union.  I understand the scepticism from some countries around taking in Ukraine but it will not survive unless it joins the European Union.  That is the simple fact as Russia will always see it as an area it can occupy.  Once it joins the European Union, that option will be gone.  There is scepticism from what are predominantly larger countries - although they are not all large - but there is no other option than to take in Ukraine.  We can play a massive role in persuading those countries to do that.  I am thankful for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

As usual with these debates, there have been many facts aired but also some fake news.</p> <p>Senator Flynn was giving us stark facts about the European Union and how ethnic minorities and the Traveller community have been protected by the Union.  They continue to be and I pay tribute to the chief executive of the European Fundamental Rights Agency, Professor Michael O'Flaherty from Galway, who is based in Vienna and who has done so much work on Traveller and Roma protections in the European Union.  Following from that we must acknowledge that pretty much all of Irish equality legislation is derived directly from the European Union and European directives.  That is very important.  On day one we were obliged to introduce equal pay rates for men and women.  Before we joined, in Ireland and some other countries, women could get &pound;2 per hour when men were getting &pound;4 per hour for the same job.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Thomas Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2203"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2203&amp;amp;pid=ThomasByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was a condition of our EU membership that we would change that.  It was Dr. Patrick Hillery, then European Commissioner for Social Affairs, who drove that on within the European Union.  It is not just that the European Union drove us on a path, Irish people within the European Union did that.  As a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister of State, I am very proud of my party's role in that path.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael were the only two parties that supported European Union membership.  In fact, we are the only two parties that continually supported European Union membership at every referendum that has taken place.  Consider all of the scaremongering that has happened at every referendum: there would be a European army and we would all be conscripted, and that the Irish language would be dead.  Is &eacute; a mhalairt at&aacute; i gceist anois leis an nGaeilge.  T&aacute; an Ghaeilge ag dul &oacute; neart go neart san Eoraip.</p><p>While I have good respect for Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile, this whole thing about the militarisation of the EU is wearing a bit thin, quite frankly, because they have been promising this for years and years and it is untrue.  We only have to give the two most famous examples.  The European Union was a peace project preventing war between France and Germany, and - to a party that is very strong in Northern Ireland and I congratulate it on that - absolutely essential to the Northern Ireland peace process is that every move the European Commission makes on the protocol in Northern Ireland has peace at the top of the agenda.  I know this because I am dealing with them.  So, let us move away from this militarisation thing.</p><p>The truth is that other EU countries spend more on their militaries than other parts of the world.  Why is that?  It is actually because every EU member state is doing it themselves.  It is precisely because the EU is not doing it.  I am not advocating for the EU to do it.  Ireland is not part of a common defence and we will not be, unless we had a referendum.  That is the truth of it.  It is because there are no efficiencies.  If we all got our military vehicles from one supplier we would be spending more money on schools and hospitals than on the military, but of course one cannot explain that.  We must move away from that discussion.  It is wearing thin.  It is wearing thin with the Irish public also.  The public do not believe it.  Irish people really value their European identity, so when the Opposition and some other parties say "Oh we support Europe, but...", there is always a "but".  Of course not everything is perfect but the benefits that European Union membership has given to Ireland over many years have been absolutely tremendous.  Really, where would we be without it and where would Europe be without the European Union?</p><p>In this Seanad centenary year I pay tribute to Senators who have served us very well in Europe.  I am thinking in particular of Senator David Norris who, while it was not through the European Union but through the Council of Europe, went to the European Court of Human Rights to change laws, which ultimately made us as a country change for the better, and ultimately making gr&aacute; the law here in the State.  This flowed on directly from Senator Norris's actions of decades ago.  The President of Ireland talks about the EU being a street and I would say that it is a two-way street.  The European Court of Human Rights, to which Ireland is associated through the European Union and through our Constitution, gave Senator Norris his case and Ireland had to change the law.  Then, decades later, Ireland was the first country in the world to legalise marriage equality by referendum, and others followed us.  While the EU pushes us along in a certain direction, we in Ireland have done that too.</p><p>I pay tribute also to some of our Senators who served in the EU.  I refer in particular to the late Senator Michael Yeats, the son of W.B. Yeats.  Senator Yeats was on Ireland's first parliamentary delegation to the European Union.  I must also thank Senator Alice-Mary Higgins for her work with the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I attended a meeting with colleagues on that and they were asking me who is this Senator Higgins.  They said the Senator works very hard and is doing incredible work checking that every t is crossed and every i is dotted.  This is a tribute to her work and the work that Senators typically do when they go to these institutions abroad and represent Ireland so well.</p><p>On membership applications, we do support Ukraine and Moldova very strongly in their aspirations to join the European Union.  Ukraine has made huge progress.  I had a video call this morning with my Moldovan counterpart and with the Moldovan ambassador at the office.  During the meeting we gave very strong support.  Moldova is a very poor country but they really need our support.  They are very determined to go on the European Union path.  We must help them go along with that and give their people hope.  I pay tribute to all of the Moldovan people living in Ireland.  They are a credit to their country and they have done tremendously well here.  They are very welcome here.  Georgia is certainly on that list but they must look very closely at issues around human rights and the rule of law there.  I strongly urge our Georgian friends to continue on that path and I would ask Senators when they are dealing with Georgian representatives that they would remind them of the importance of what is required for candidature for membership of the European Union.</p><p>While the Conference on the Future of Europe has officially concluded, it is really only getting going now because the debate is starting.  We must consider carefully all of the recommendations there.  I do like to hear some, not all, from the Opposition here and in the other House welcoming the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe.  They obviously have not read them.  Nobody could welcome them in general as there is always something one could pick out that one might not like.  There will be issues for us in defence and unanimity.  We should read and carefully consider them before we make any statements, which is exactly what the Government is going to do.  It is very important that we do so in a constructive way.  We very much want to be at the heart of Europe.  The veto unanimity is very important for us, but I do not know if we will ever use it.</p><p>People say to us that we need an independent foreign policy, which I hear from Sinn F&eacute;in here and in the other House.  What difference do they want in foreign policy that we do not have today?  We go along with the foreign policy of the European Union.  Yes, we have a right of veto on that and we can stop it, but what is it they want us to change from what we are doing at the moment?  We are pursuing peace.  We are pursuing reconciliation.  We are being robust in defending human rights.</p><p>Reference was made to Israel and Palestine.  We in Ireland have a very robust policy on that, which is not shared by all member states.  The policy has not been forced upon us by Europe and we make our own decisions.  When Members say we need an independent foreign policy, what policies do they want instead of the ones we have today?  Our foreign policy today is neutrality and active engagement at the Security Council, at the UN, and at the Council of Europe.  Our policy is about peace and helping to develop countries.  What do they want to change?  It is alright to throw out this lingo but what does it mean in practice?  The European Union has been so important to us and is very important for young people.  We must be very wary of those who come in and say, "We support it but...".  Be wary of that.  It does not mean we do not have critical engagement, but sometimes I believe it is code for "We really do not support it".</p></speech>

On Second Stage, a number of issues were raised.  I want to make Senators aware of work that has been done on foot of that debate.  Several Senators questioned why civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are not included in the new scheme for Garda compensation in view of the increase in civilianisation of the organisation.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I have looked again at this issue and are currently engaging with stakeholders with a view to bringing proposals to Government for approval to amend the Bill to include civilian staff.  It is unfortunate that we have not been in a position to finalise these proposals in advance of Committee Stage.  However, if the proposal is agreed by Cabinet, it is the intention of the Minister to introduce amendments to the Bill in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Those amendments will subsequently come back to this House for approval.  Some further minor amendments will also be introduced in the Lower House.  As I indicated on Second Stage, these are to sections 11 and 16 and relate to the requirement for the application forms to be prescribed by way of regulation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#AA00500"><p>I am speaking today on a number of motions that exercise Ireland's option to opt into certain EU measures under Protocol No. 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, TFEU.</p> <p>Senators will be aware that if Ireland wishes to take part in an EU measure with a legal basis that falls under Title V of the TFEU, Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution is required.  The three measures before Senators today all have a legal basis which falls under Title V  of the treaty and, therefore, it is necessary to secure Oireachtas approval.</p> <p>The first motion refers to a draft proposal by the Council of the European Union to determine the date from which personal data relating to DNA-profiles and fingerprints, which is also known as Pr&uuml;m data, may be supplied by member states to the United Kingdom.  This is an essential tool for law enforcement across the European Union.  Of course, it is of particular value to law enforcement co-operation between Ireland and the United Kingdom.</p> <p>The EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement, TCA, stipulates that member states may continue to supply Pr&uuml;m data to the United Kingdom pending the outcome of evaluations required by the TCA until 30 September 2021.  This interim period was extended until 30 June 2022.  It is worth noting that a measure providing for this extension was before the Houses in September 2021.</p> <p>Since then, the European Commission has completed an evaluation of the UK and concluded, in its reports, that the co-operation with the United Kingdom on DNA profiles and dactyloscopic data meets the relevant requirements.  These reports were submitted to the Council in March 2022.  They paved the way for the Council to allow the Union to declare that member states may supply personal data regarding DNA profiles and dactyloscopic data to the United Kingdom as referred to in Article 540(2) of the TCA.</p> <p>Without this Council decision, Pr&uuml;m data will cease to be shared between the EU and the UK from midnight on 30 June 2022.  As Senators will understand, if this were to happen it is something that could, potentially, have serious repercussions in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases.</p> <p>The views of the Office of the Attorney General were sought and the legal advice received has confirmed that Oireachtas approval, under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution, is required.</p> <p>I would like to emphasise that the effective implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement is an EU priority.  Ireland will play its full part in that.</p> <p>Ireland's role in the EU has changed in recent times and will continue to evolve in the coming years.  The full implementation of the TCA is necessary for us to not only play our part as an EU member state but also to ensure that our post-Brexit relationship with the UK continues to grow and develop.  Part of this relationship is ensuring that the safety and security of our citizens is protected and this measure is necessary to do that.</p> <p>The second motion relates to Council Decision (EU) 2021/430 on the Kyoto Declaration on Advancing Crime Prevention, Criminal Justice and the Rule of Law: towards the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p> <p>The United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is held every five years.  It focuses on the topics of crime, crime prevention and criminal justice.  At each congress, a high-level non-binding declaration is adopted, which consists of statements collectively agreed by United Nation member states.</p> <p>At the 14th congress held in Kyoto, Japan on 7 March 2021, the Kyoto Declaration was adopted and covers a variety of wide-ranging topics, including: "Tailor-made crime prevention strategies"; "Mainstreaming a gender perspective into criminal justice systems"; and "Safeguarding victims' rights and protecting witnesses and reporting persons".  For the first time, the Council of the European Union took the approach of publishing a Council decision approving the adoption of the final draft Declaration, which has necessitated this Protocol No. 21 process.</p> <p>As Senators will be aware, provided for in Article 3.1 of Protocol No. 21, Ireland has three months from the date a proposal or initiative is presented to the Council to consider the proposal, and notify the Presidency of the Council in writing of its wish to take part in the negotiation, adoption and application of any such measure.  However, on this occasion, in order to support the speedy adoption of this proposal, Ireland waived its right to have three months for consideration before the decision was adopted.  That is why we now propose to opt-in post adoption under Article 4 of Protocol No. 21.</p> <p>Ireland's support for international frameworks, policies and strategies, including adherence to the principles contained in the Kyoto Declaration, is reflected in the programme for Government, which commits to various reforms to prevent crime, make communities safer and support victims of crime.    The importance of collectively agreed and collaborative responses to criminal activity globally is vital to ensure best practice initiatives are shared and jointly implemented.</p> <p>To give just one example of Ireland's innovative approach to crime prevention, I would like to mention the Greentown Project.  It is a research project and pilot initiative that is aimed at disrupting the recruitment of children by criminal gangs.  The project was recognised at the European Crime Prevention Awards when it was awarded first place among the initiatives submitted on the theme of "tackling family-based crime, particularly for young people and new communities".  This success shows the international recognition of Ireland's innovative approach to developing crime prevention measures, and displays our willingness to engage and share our experience with international colleagues.</p> <p>Nevertheless, while my Department leads on criminal policy matters generally, many current national strategies and policy initiatives require a whole-of-government response.  That means many Departments and agencies share roles, and responsibilities, in this area.  They will contribute to Ireland's role in the implementation of the declaration thus leading to the advancement of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.</p> <p>The third motion relates to an EU civil justice regulation, which was adopted in December 2021.  It is an amending regulation, which makes technical updates to the two annexes in the 2015 Recast Insolvency Regulation.  Ireland has already opted into the Recast Insolvency Regulation.  Under the protocol, a fresh opt-in is required in respect of any measure that amends the regulation.</p> <p>The Recast Insolvency Regulation applies to company insolvency, personal insolvency and bankruptcy.  It provides for mutual recognition and enforcement of insolvency proceedings between EU member states in cases with a cross-border dimension.</p> <p>The Recast Insolvency Regulation sets out agreed common rules on which member states' courts will have jurisdiction to deal with a cross-border insolvency case, and to which national insolvency law will apply.  The regulation also deals with the recognition of court orders.</p> <p>The changes made by the amending regulation are to replace Annexes A and B to the 2015  regulation with updated versions.  These annexes list, respectively, the types of insolvency procedures and insolvency practitioners in each member state that are to be recognised under the 2015 regulation.  These updated annexes are required due to changes in national legislation in EU member states.  In addition, the relevant UK listings have been removed post Brexit.  The lists of recognised Irish insolvency proceedings, in Annex A, and of Irish insolvency practitioners, in Annex B, are unaffected by these changes.  For reasons of timing, it did not prove possible for Ireland to opt into the amending regulation under Article 3 of the protocol, within three months of its presentation.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy James Browne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2443"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2443&amp;amp;pid=JamesBrowne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As a result, the intention was to propose an opt-in under Article 4 following the adoption of the measure and subject to the necessary approval.  It is recommended that Ireland should now opt in to this regulation so we apply the same updated list of insolvency proceedings and practitioners as other EU member states.  It is important that Ireland is seen to confirm the recognition of updates to the relevant laws in other member states.</p><p>The recast insolvency regulation is also an important and well-established part of civil justice co-operation between EU member states which ensures a more coherent and predictable approach in cross-border insolvency cases.  It is desirable that Ireland should exercise its right to opt in to this amending regulation post adoption in accordance with Article 4 of the protocol.  I trust the House can support the exercise of Ireland's opt-in in respect of these three measures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#BB00200"><p>These motions are self-evident and make perfect sense.  I welcome the fact that the Government has taken steps to fast-track them and opt out of the delays that might have come with the updating regulations and the new ones, and with the opportunities available to Ireland.  International co-operation benefits Ireland in particular.  As a small and geographically peripheral country, that level of interaction with our international colleagues is of great importance to us in terms of all the areas included in these motions.  It benefits us in terms of experience, information and information sharing, intelligence gathering and sharing and other opportunities such as training that might arise from time to time.  There can be no overstating how important it is for Ireland to form part of this international co-operation network because without it we will quickly become isolated.  I am happy to support the motions and restate how important they are for Ireland, which benefits to an even greater extent than most countries in Europe and around the world because we are a small country and because we benefit from the experience and work already done by other countries on this.</p> <p>Although the motions are all justice-related, they have slightly different applications but each one benefits Ireland.  They are clear examples of the necessity for us to engage in international co-operation and to become full players on the international stage, because that is how we benefit from them.  Everything from insolvency to crime prevention, detection and, perhaps most importantly, prosecution is made easier and more effective through joining these international agreements, which give us an opportunity to maximise what we take away from them, which is more than a large country would.  I have said that in this House previously.</p> <p>I welcome the fact we have a more internationalist Government than those of past generations, one which engages properly in its international obligations and is open to the opportunities that brings for this country in law enforcement and the different systems within the justice system.  I am happy to support these motions on behalf of the Fine Gael group and welcome their passage through the House.</p></speech>

On behalf of the Fianna F&aacute;il group, I am delighted to support these three motions which have been clearly outlined by the Minister of State and Senator Ward.  It is essential we have the highest possible level of co-operation with our nearest neighbour and with our EU colleagues when it comes to crime prevention, investigation and, perhaps most important as Senator Ward said, prosecution.  We are delighted to support these motions and look forward to their being incorporated into law in order that the highest possible level of co-operation with our closest neighbours in the UK and with fellow EU member states will take effect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.154" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#BB00400"><p>I have a couple of concerns.  I hope they can be addressed and reflected.  We are talking about a combination of the three.  My primary concern regards the exchange of Pr&uuml;m data with the UK.  There are concerns when we look at things like the fall of the privacy shield.  The UK is effectively a third country in terms of EU data in certain circumstances.  There are concerns about how data may be treated.  The goal is to be able to exchange data in as many ways as possible and, in terms of crime investigation, that is important.  However, Chris Jones, EU director at the Home Office, has spoken about how standards may evolve and states the UK will "have a choice as to whether or not to move its standards to meet ... requirements under the Pr&uuml;m system.  There is no compulsory requirement for us to align with the EU Pr&uuml;m system."  It is similar in terms of the UK parliamentary committee.  They are clear from the UK perspective that they regard as a moveable piece the extent to which they need to align with EU standards on addressing this data.  There was an evaluatory visit in November 2021 by the EU evaluation team on DNA profiles and dactyloscopic data.  Such information falls under the GDPR and into the special categories of personal information, so it is particularly sensitive.</p> <p>There are concerning elements in UK law over the past two years which need to be thought through and addressed.  Specifically, there is the Covert Human Intelligence Sources (Criminal Conduct) Act, which was passed very rapidly at the end of 2020 and which gives impunity to covert human intelligence agents in the UK to commit any crimes.  That means impunity for any crimes committed by those working as human intelligence agents for the UK state.  Many people in civil society raised concerns.  Ireland should have had significant concerns because it was indirectly affected by the culture of impunity in human intelligence areas in the past in the UK, with the spy cops scandal.  That scandal concerned a situation where, over three decades, undercover officers created false personas and, in some cases, deceived people into sexual or political relationships, in one case fathering a child with somebody under a false identity.  They would effectively have had a form of impunity and, instead of addressing this, it is being cemented into law by the covert human intelligence sources Act.  Ireland was affected by that because some of those agents operated in the Irish State.</p> <p>In that context, will the Minister of State address two matters?  It is almost a double protection.  First, will covert human intelligence operatives in the UK be immune?  Will they be subject to this?  Will their DNA and so forth be exchanged if it is sought in relation to crimes they commit?  Second, will these intelligence operatives have access to DNA or other sensitive information through this mechanism of exchange, which they can use with impunity and without regard for the normal caveats of law that anybody, and certainly servants of the state, should be subject to?  It is a specific but important issue.  I would like if it had been better addressed in the EU scrutiny of this matter.</p> <p>I have heard concerns from people who contacted me.  We have all seen the phenomenon whereby those who are wealthy become insolvent and are wealthy again a few years later, with a number of creditors, including sometimes employees and labour creditors, who are vulnerable.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How can we ensure that this new exchange concerning insolvency practice will not contribute to insolvency shopping, whereby people choose to go bankrupt or seek insolvency in certain circumstances.  In Ireland, we have some protections for labour creditors, namely, the employees of someone who becomes insolvent.  We must ensure their rights do not become diminished through any form of insolvency shopping.</p></speech>

As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the Pr&uuml;m measures are essential to ensure the continuation of the close law-enforcement co-operation between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It is vital that we meet the highest standards possible when it comes to the investigation and prosecution of crimes.  The ongoing transfer of Pr&uuml;m data helps to ensure that.  In the absence of a decision to facilitate the sharing of these data with the UK, the arrangement will expire at the end of June 2022.  The EU has evaluated whether the UK meets the Pr&uuml;m requirements.  It was satisfied that it did.</p> <p>With regard to the Kyoto Declaration, Ireland&rsquo;s opt-in to the EU Council decision reaffirms the strong belief that we share with other EU member states that the international community should build on established standards and further develop multilateral solutions, which the Kyoto declaration aims to achieve.</p> <p>Ireland and the EU are very committed to taking an holistic, collaborative to prevent crime through targeted strategies, legislative reforms and operational activities via international collaboration with the EU and UN member states.  The implementation of actions in Justice Plan 2022, which is very much in line with and supportive of the EU Council decision and the principles of the Kyoto Declaration, will ensure the criminal justice system in Ireland is fair, respectful and inclusive.  In addition, these aims align directly with advancing sustainable development goal 16, which is to promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.</p> <p>The Minister and I are committed to supporting innovative policies and legislative reforms, such as the community safety innovation fund and the Greentown Project, to which I referred.  The latter will continue to be rolled out to target those children most at risk of being recruited by criminal gangs.  We are committed to the enactment of new criminal legislation that will outlaw the grooming of children to commit a crime.  Once again, I ask all Senators to support this motion and Ireland&rsquo;s continued engagement with its international partners.</p> <p>With regard to insolvency regulation, I mentioned in my opening remarks that the recast insolvency regulation is an important and well-established part of civil justice co-operation between EU member states, which ensures a more coherent and predictable approach in cross-border insolvency cases.  It is important that Ireland now opt in to the amending regulation so it will be applying the same updated lists of insolvency proceedings and practitioners as other EU member states.  All it is doing is providing updated lists of insolvency proceedings and practitioners to match those of other EU member states, and nothing more.  Therefore, it is desirable that Ireland should exercise the right to opt in to the amending regulation after adoption in accordance with Article 4 of the protocol.</p> <p>Once again, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank all the Senators for their contributions.</p></speech>

As I said when speaking to amendment No. 26, this section will enable an coimisi&uacute;n to engage with a range of body within the State if it will assist an coimisi&uacute;n  to discharge its functions.</p> <p>The section also provides that an coimisi&uacute;n may co-operate with bodies outside of the State if they are to provide similar function an coimisi&uacute;n, as section 32(3) indicates.  This may, in particular, include members of the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, ERGA.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has been an active member of the European regulators group and I expect an coimisi&uacute;n will maintain this strong tradition by co-operating and working with other European national regulatory authorities.  Amendment No. 74 would amend section 32 4) to require that where the commission enters into an agreement to co-operate with a body, it should provide not only the Minister, as provided for in the Bill, but also the relevant Oireachtas joint committee with a copy of the agreement.  </p> <p>I thank the Senator for her amendment and I am absolutely in favour of the oversight of public bodies by the Oireachtas.  That is why section 28 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, contains strong provisions requiring the chairperson and individual commissioners to appear before an Oireachtas committee to give account of the performance of their functions.  I cannot accept the amendment as drafted because reference cannot be made to specific Oireachtas committees in legislation in the manner in the amendment.  However, I will reflect on the amendment with a view to further consideration in the context of Report Stage.  In doing so, I will consider the appropriate balance to be struck between parliamentary oversight and any provisions that may impinge on the independence of an coimisi&uacute;n, which is provided for in section 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill.</p></speech>

There is a difference between coming to account to a committee which, as we know, involves a minimal amount of time to deal with the huge number of issues, and having the appropriate document in order that it can be scrutinised and issues identified in order to provide accountability for the public.  I hope there is co-operation.  In some of my other amendments, I have referred to bodies like the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and Screen Ireland.  There are many areas of potential domestic, as well as international, co-operation.  I am not against that.  I want to make sure that the basis of that is clear.  I am happy to work with the minister to determine which amendment might work.  I will withdraw the amendment with the leave of the House and return to the issue on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Personal data may be disclosed to a number of different bodies.  I am trying to ensure in amendment No. 75 that it would be very clear that it was only to happen where that is necessary and proportionate.  I recognise there are some further caveats, which I will come to, in the section.  In effect, the necessity and proportionality tests are important.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The tests slightly differ and do slightly different work.</p><p>On amendment No. 76, the Bill states: "The Commission may ... disclose personal data to ... (d) a broadcaster or a provider of an audiovisual on-demand media service", where a person has made a complaint under section 33(2).  It is not clear to me why the personal data of the person who is making the complaint would be disclosed because either the complaint has merit so needs consideration or it does not.  In terms of disclosing the complaint, this is not an interpersonal thing but people who do a public service by making a complaint, and we also have this in terms of the whistleblower legislation.  It should not be the case where persons are concerned or feel concerned enough to make a complaint.  For example, one may have situations where persons may be the employees of a body yet wish to make a complaint about some of its practices or persons who have had business dealings in any form.  I am concerned about the sharing of personal data, and especially given that we know the vulnerabilities of individuals versus the immense power of some of the actors who will, potentially, be regulated with this provision.  As the Minister will know the individual complaints mechanism is something that we really need to be part of this legislation.  Again, I would not want to have anything in the Bill that has the potential to impinge on such an individual complaints mechanism when we put it in place.</p><p>Amendment No. 77 seeks the deletion of section 33(e).  Again, this is quite an immense power that is given by the Minister because the Bill states that the commission can disclose personal data to "a body prescribed in regulations made by the Minister".  Again, I am not comfortable with us, as a Legislature, giving the power to not just the current Minister but any future Minister to prescribe that any body should have access to personal data and that the commission would share it, including, potentially, any private body or actor in that context.  The provision is not even constrained to a public body in that sense.</p><p>Amendment No. 78 concerns 33(2)(d) whereby the commission may transfer personal data "to the broadcaster or provider of an audiovisual on-demand media service ... for the purposes of transferring the complaint".  I am concerned about the provision as follows.  If persons wish to make a complaint to a broadcaster then they can do so as there is a range of imperfect mechanisms across different broadcasters or providers of on-demand services.  If a person wishes to make a complaint to the commission then he or she is making a complaint to a public body so should enjoy all of the associated protections and safeguards and I am concerned about the transferring of that information.  Again, it is not clear to me that such transfer would only happen, for example, with the consent of the complainant.  I think that would be a necessary and an appropriate bar in that regard.</p><p>Amendment No. 79 is similar.  It says that perhaps there may be circumstances where it is appropriate to transfer but that transfer should be done explicitly with the consent of the relevant complainant.  The amendment recognises that a transfer may be anonymous because it states: "having made all reasonable effort ... to contact and seek the consent of a relevant complainant".  Simple efficiency or easiness for a public body does not meet the necessity and proportionality tests.</p><p>Amendment No. 80 seeks to insert a new subsection (2A), which makes it clear that where a person's personal data has been disclosed, under any of the provisions of this section, every reasonable effort shall be made to inform the person that his or her data has been shared.  That is sought because otherwise one has the situation whereby somebody shares information with the commission and his or her personal information is shared onwards yet the individual may not be aware of that fact.  My concerns are not solely confined to whistleblower scenarios but they are a good example whereby we know there are protections.  I mean we know that there is a long record of punitive measures, of targeting and other ways that persons may be targeted.  If somebody is not even aware of a complaint then he or she is operating blind.  Such a person may be vulnerable to situations, cases or other actions, yet not know of his or her vulnerability so thus are unable to take appropriate measures for self protection or exercise his or her rights against penalisation.</p><p>Amendment No. 81 seeks to insert a new subsection (5A) which states: "Prior to making regulations under subsection (1) or subsection (2), the Minister shall subject the proposed regulations to a data protection impact assessment".  We have gone through a lot of data protection impact assessments.  It is simply not enough to have the legislation or bodies at a core point because regulations, if any, should be subjected to a specific data protection impact assessment in terms of their potential effects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1471" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#NN00200"><p>I thank the Senator for the amendments and acknowledge her expertise in the area of data protection.</p><p>Section 33 of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, is intended to specify the circumstances under which, and the bodies to which, the commission may disclose personal data.  I believe that the intention of amendment No. 75 has been captured in section 33(2) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill.  Throughout section 33(2) it is specified that the commission shall only disclose personal data where it considers that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes set out in its various paragraphs so, therefore, I do not accept the amendment.</p><p>I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 76 to 78, inclusive.  Amendments No. 76 and 78 have the collective effect of preventing the commission from disclosing personal data to a broadcaster or a video on-demand service in respect of a complaint made against those services.  I believe that would impact the functioning of the complaints mechanism set out in section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 11 of the Bill, which enables people to complain to the commission regarding a failure by services to comply with media service rules and codes.</p><p>The complaints system is an important mechanism that has been operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and is applicable to broadcasters under the extent of the Broadcasting Act 2009.  It has been extended to video on-demand services by the Bill.  It is underpinned by the requirement that a broadcaster or a provider of a video on-demand service prepares and implements a code of practice for the handling of complaints, which is a requirement of section 47 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 10 of the Bill.</p><p>Section 48(3) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 11 of the Bill, provides that an coimisi&uacute;n may refer a complaint to the broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service in the first instance.  This is a continuation of the existing provision applying to the complaints system operated by the BAI.  It ensures that the broadcaster or video on-demand service should attempt to address a complaint, in the first instance, in accordance with its codes of practice for the handling of complaints.</p><p>It is often not immediately clear to people unfamiliar with the complaints system operated by the BAI to whom a complaint should first be made and about what matters.  This provision also ensures that an coimisi&uacute;n, when it is established and comes to expand the BAI system to video on-demand services, can transfer a complaint to a broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service where those service providers are best placed to respond.  If the complaint is not dealt with to the complainant's satisfaction then it can then be dealt with by an coimisi&uacute;n.</p><p>Amendment No. 77 would prevent the prescription of further bodies to whom the commission could disclose personal data.  I believe that it is important that the Bill is future-proofed such that, and only after careful consideration in accordance with section 33(4), a Minister may prescribe further bodies as necessary.</p><p>Amendment No. 79 would require an coimisi&uacute;n to make best efforts to contact and seek the consent of a complainant prior to transferring a complaint to a broadcaster or a provider of a video on-demand service.  I do not propose to accept this amendment for a number of reasons.  The first reason is that the legal basis for data processing, relied upon by this section, is not consent but that the &quot;<font color="#333333">processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller&quot;.  This has been set down in the </font>Article 6(e) of the general data protection regulation, which obliges member states when using this legal basis to set down the purpose of that processing in national law.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This is what the section does with regard to the processing of personal data for the purpose of transferring complaints.</p><p>The public policy rationale for using the public interest legal basis rather than the legal basis of consent was that requiring complainants to resubmit their complaints to the appropriate body is burdensome and especially onerous for vulnerable complainants.  In this regard, I am conscious of the work of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism.  This section may need to be relied upon to transfer online safety complaints between public bodies if the group recommends to me, and I accept, the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill.  If there is concern about a lack of communication with complainants I think amendment No. 80 may address it.  I will come back to this shortly.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 79.</p><p>Amendment No. 81, which would require a data protection impact assessment to be undertaken prior to any such prescription, might be an important safeguard.  For this reason I propose to return to further consider this on Report Stage if the Senator agrees.  In a similar vein, amendment No. 80 could provide another important further safeguard in legislation.  It provides that where disclosure of personal data is made by the commission to be broadcast on video-on-demand service or to a body prescribed by the Minister, all reasonable efforts shall be taken to inform the complainant of this disclosure.  While I propose to reject the amendment now, I will consider it further and return to the matter on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Many of the concerns I have outlined in the amendments could be addressed by an appropriate data protection impact assessment.  I recognise there is some necessity for proportionality in subsection (2), but I still have concerns with regard to regulations downstream.  Data protection impact assessments are not necessarily long or arduous processes, especially when they are applied regularly in new provisions and regulations.  I hope our capacity as a State to use them effectively and regularly will continue.  It is always better than dealing with concerns after the fact.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for her engagement on amendment No. 80.  While it is the decision of the State to use a public interest rather than a consent basis for the sharing of information, the Minister is aware that many who will reach out or contact the commission will believe they are in direct communication with it but they may not be.  This is why the question of the information is very important so that people are clear.  They must be clear about the purposes for which the information they are sharing may be used.  This is part of the transparency.  It is separate from consent but it is important that it is clear.  This is where looking to proper and appropriate information is important as it is with regard to penalisation, which we know occurs.  For many whistleblowers and individuals highlighting their personal experiences can have a significant negative impact.  Everything we can do to ensure people are aware is important.</p> <p>Much of this would be addressed if we have an individual complaints mechanism that is very clear.  Part of the problem is that there is almost an element of preparing for an individual complaints mechanism, but we have not received the proper expert group guidance on such a mechanism.  This is something all of us want to see happening in the legislation.  We would prefer to see it happening when the Bill is going through the Seanad, if possible.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate whether we have a further narrowing down of when we can expect the expert group to come back on this matter.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 83 proposes to insert a provision in the Bill whereby the commission will not co-operate with self-regulatory systems or any other non-statutory mechanism that is not part of the legislative framework.  The key issue is that either we are serious about regulation or we are not.  Self-regulation has been shown not to work.  If we are serious about the commission being a truly independent body then it is about ensuring that it does not involve itself with self-regulatory systems.  In a self-regulatory system there will always be a conflict of interest.  We know in particular from research into food and beverage marketing that self-regulation has proven to be weak and meaningless.</p> <p>The clear issue in this country is that online advertising is, effectively, self regulated.  Television advertisements are not.  It is telling that we have clearance system for advertisements for television whereby they must go through the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland in advance.  For online advertising we are dependent on citizens bringing complaints in respect of breaches of the code after the advertising has happened.  We are dependent on a vigilant public speaking out.  The amendment is to ensure no time or resources are spent by the commission on the regulation of commercial communications and in particular self-regulatory commercial communications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.213" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1662" speakername="Alice-Mary Higgins" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#PP00100"><p>Amendment No. 82 was co-sponsored by my colleague, Senator Black.  The Minister would be aware of the excellent and extensive work Senator Black did in the past on the legislation on alcohol control and that area.  We had very lengthy discussions on advertising and self-regulation and on the very significant concerns in that area around the inadequacies of self-regulatory mechanisms.</p> <p>It is one example, but there is a very significant concern that I would urge the Minister to weigh up in relation to section 34.  There seems to be a kind of muddying of the ground.  Under the media services codes, which we discussed earlier, it needs to be clear that the commission would have the power to make regulations, restrictions or, potentially, prohibitions, in respect of commercial communications.  The one thing I would add to this amendment relates to the fact we have agreed we need to have a clarity that commercial communications and advertising should be covered by that issue so, again, the media services codes would allow for codes in respect of advertising in its fullest sense, not in just its narrow sense of commercial communications.</p> <p>We have these media services codes that we are putting in place, and yet we have this kind of separate thing which is a self-regulatory system.  We are in a situation where we may have some kind of self-regulatory systems that are perceived as being given the imprimatur of the commission and are operating separately from, and kind of in parallel with, the media services codes, which are the proper and appropriate regulatory mechanisms and signals that the commission may make.  The commission can set out media services codes, and the media services codes or other policy coming from the commission may be drawn upon by those putting in self-regulatory systems.  However, the framing of this section, even framed in terms of co-operation with and giving assistance to a person or group of persons, creates a kind of weird dynamic between sectors that need to be regulated and the regulator.  It is one thing, as we said, for us to set standards and to look at things in terms of how they meet those standards, but the idea of the standards being prepared by groups of persons outside the commission and the commission assisting them could pose problems.  We could have a situation where we are being told that the groups' standards that industry may put together for itself can be said to have been prepared with the assistance of the commission and somehow be in line with the media services codes or with anything else.  It seems it is a very muddying piece of the relationship.</p> <p>If we think about the Data Protection Commissioner and the importance of that role and the kind of a challenge Ireland has had at EU level around the need for real, absolute clarity of independence and of a separation of that role, again, anything that muddies the clarity in relation to the commission and its regulatory function is potentially dangerous and could undermine its credibility.  I am very concerned about this area in terms of the commission and its work.</p> <p>That leaves aside the separate concern, which I know Senator Black and others have, which is the general principle of self-regulatory solutions to these issues.  We know they are a very significant concern because there are very significant interests in play.  In a way, the fact that in Europe we have these directives coming down, such as the digital services directive and the audiovisual directive, with the algorithms, is because there has been a decision that we need to regulate.  In the United States and other countries, there has been a self-regulatory approach for a very long time.  I refer to anything that gives us a self-regulatory approach, and particularly in relation to commercial communications and interests.</p> <p>I have been speaking on, for example, the marketing mechanisms of the breast milk substitute industry &ndash; the formula industry &ndash; over past week or two.  We have seen some very concerning practices.  There is a World Health Organization code that should be, but is not being, fully applied.  That is a voluntary code that many companies have signed up to, and yet we see practices that breach it all the time.  That is why we look for actual law and actual regulation, such as the media service codes.</p></speech>

We need to move away from self-regulatory codes.  It is important, though, that when the new regulator, the media commission, is established that it does not operate entirely behind an Iron Curtain.  It needs to understand the industry and the sectors and how they work.</p> <p>It would be useful, perhaps, if we could get clarity.  I can understand where this system may be relevant, where, for instance, there may be systems of arbitration and so on that may be in existence within particular industries and if there is an overlap.  I am thinking about work, say, the International Chamber of Commerce does.  It is not that I am necessarily opposing it.  However, around some of those areas where there are systems of arbitration within an industry, I certainly would not like to see those excluded.  If we are looking at a situation where an industry is entirely self-regulating, that should not happen.  However, if there are mechanisms in place that mean we do not have to go into very formal structures, I certainly think that should continue to be allowed.  I get where both amendments are coming from.  However, I would have concern that we do not in any way inhibit any arbitration systems that may exist.</p></speech>

The amendments appear to have the same effect in preventing the commission from co-operating with groups in the establishments of standards or self-regulatory systems.  I wish to point out that it will always remain open for people to complain to the commission under the relevant media service codes and rules.  Section 34 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amendment by section 7 of the Bill, is drafted in line with the audiovisual media services directive and allows the commission to co-operate with self-regulatory mechanisms.  Articles 9(3) and 9(4) of the directive set out the requirements on member states to encourage self-regulation in respect of commercial communications, including advertising.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments that would appear to contradict the directive.</p></speech>

That is part of the concern.  I would like an indication from the Minister on whether she is looking at the language that is being used in terms of the way the commission is to engage with the self-regulatory systems and if that is an area that she feels she may be able amend it.  Again, where this states "co-operation with, or give assistance to, a person or group of persons" and "the preparation of that by the person of a group of standards" feels a little bit too hands-on.  I appreciate that the amendments, as they are put forward at the moment, are quite a blunt removal, but I also think there is a difference between encouraging and giving a risk of a perceived imprimatur of endorsement to a self-regulatory system, which could arise from the way this is worded.</p> <p>I appreciate the Minister made a strong point on the audiovisual directive and encouraging self-regulation.  It would not be appropriate to have an amendment that states "shall encourage that there will be self-regulatory systems in addition", but would take a step back from this kind of assistance and co-operation language.</p></speech>

I want to speak directly to what is in the legislation and the proposed amendments.  If we are thinking about the commission when it is up and running, I would certainly hope it would not regulate behind an Iron Curtain.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If a sector wants to set up its own system to try to address some of the problems at an early stage, the commission should work quite closely with the sector to try to allow that to happen.  It does not prevent, if that self-regulatory system fails or is in breach of codes, action being taken but if a sector is looking to regulate itself effectively to try to avoid having the full force of the commission coming down on it, it is worded reasonably well in the legislation as "may co-operate with".  When the commission is up and running, I would like to see the relevant sectors talking to it and saying that they want to be in compliance with the legislation, the codes and the directives and asking what they need to do.  For example, if it is an industry representative body, what does it need to tell its members?  How can the body ensure there are appropriate arbitration mechanisms in place?</p><p>While I understand the proposals in the amendments - I am speaking specifically to the wording - it will not help.  It should remain as it currently stands in the legislation.</p></speech>

I hear also what the Minister and Senator Malcolm Byrne said but we need to reinforce the point that there is a significant distinction between co-operating with and giving assistance to.  I agree with Senator Higgins's question on whether the Minister would be open to a change of that particular language.  Obviously, the language in the two amendments is much more black and white, but giving assistance to the establishment of a group is a fairly significant step for a commission.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Malcolm Byrne that it should not be acting from behind an Iron Curtain.  Of course, it has to be aware and engage.  Any commission worth its salt has to engage with those it needs to engage with, but what does "give assistance to" imply with regard to resources of the commission?  I think that is-----</p></speech>

We need to be honest.  These are sectors where at the last moment self-regulation has been brought in.  I could cite multiple examples.  For example, as soon as there was to be an EU regulation on 40% women on boards, suddenly the 30% club appeared as a voluntary mechanism where we were all suddenly keen to voluntarily have 30% women on boards rather than have a rule that there should be 40%.  I recognise it is a process but that is where I still have a concern.  There is the question of whether it would be used in terms of regulation but also around that language in terms of how it is done, even in terms of assisting in the preparation by the group of standards.  There is a perception that a set of standards developed by a sector could be perceived as having been agreed to by a regulator or by the commission, or in terms of the administration of it.  That is too hands on.  That is different.  One creates a dynamic where the commission has a double role.</p> <p>This is different from an Iron Curtain.  It is not about a Soviet Iron Curtain but if there is engagement with self-regulation, there needs to be at least some form of a Chinese wall or something so that one is not having it that the commission signed off on 30% being grand in regard to self-regulation but the commission now saying there should be 40% or whatever it might be.  It is a little muddied in terms of the language.  I will come back with amendments on this on Report Stage.  I hope we can find language which is satisfactory to everybody in that regard.</p> <p>As it stands, I am a little concerned by the potential effect in terms of how this would pan out but also in terms of the perception of the commission.  The last thing we need is a perception that the commission is deeply embedded with particular industries or sectors.  The commission could work with them but it should not be seen to be in such a close relationship that it could be seen as endorsing the standards that it chooses to apply because it must represent the public interest fundamentally.</p></speech>

That directive also requires member states to foster self-regulation.</p> <p>This section also covers, apart from advertisement, for example, co-operation with the Press Council.

Section 37(2) states that requirement for a disclosure of interests does not apply to a person who is entering a contract or proposed contract of employment or a contract or proposed contract of services in relation to the commission.  The reason that is a concern, as we have discussed previously, is that there are small numbers of relevant experts in some of the areas which will be subject to the commission.  The commission may well have to draw on persons who also have, for example, either significant shareholdings or significant interests within the bodies to be regulated, and may even have significant contracts of service with the bodies to be regulated.  This is not to preclude such persons from working for the commission or, indeed, providing services to the commission because the nature of it is that as the commission seeks to draw in expertise, there will be potential overlap.  The fact is that one will have individuals who are the absolute specialists in a certain form of profiling or content.  However, it is important that there would at least be disclosure of such interests.  It is not precluding but is saying that there should be a disclosure of interests.  For example, if somebody is hired on a contract of service to look at a particular area of nuanced regulation and he or she has significant interests in relation to the sector or some of the companies to be regulated, that should be known and it is important and appropriate that it would be known.</p><p>I imagine the commission will be drawing on such expertise in certain areas.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In the context of content regulation, there may be a need to draw on the expertise of companies and others who have provided such content regulation services to major online broadcasters.  For transparency, it would be appropriate that disclosure would be made.  Section 37(2)(b) refers to contracted services.  The contract with the commission could be one out of 20 that someone might have.  Given that ten of those 20 may be far more financially significant than the contract with the commission, it is important that people would be aware of that.</p></speech>

The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 39: <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	<b>&ldquo;Duties with regard to regional balance</b><br /><br /><b>39A.</b>(1) All public bodies engaged in the distribution of State moneys for the production, screening and broadcast of audiovisual or sound content, including but not limited to RT&Eacute;, Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, Screen Ireland, and the Commission, shall ensure that these funds are distributed equitably and proportionally across the whole island of Ireland with particular regard to the need for regional balance in investment and representation in audiovisual content, screen and sound, including in programmes relating to news and current affairs, culture, and sport, of communities across the whole island.<br /><br />(2) The Commission shall prepare and publish a report every 3 years from its establishment detailing the regional spread of investment and representation of regional voices and communities by State bodies in audiovisual content, screen and sound across the whole island of Ireland, including specifically in programmes relating to news and current affairs, culture, and sport.<br /><br />(3) The reports referred to in subsection (2) shall be laid before the Minister, both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Joint Oireachtas Committee, RT&Eacute;, Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, and Screen Ireland, upon publication, and shall include recommendations on how to improve the regional balance of investment and representation in the subsequent three-year period.&rdquo;.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote> <p>This amendment is about sharing the public funds from a range of organisations, some of which we have mentioned, but just those organisations.  Such funds would be evenly distributed, equitably and proportionately, throughout the whole island of Ireland, with particular regard for regional balance in terms of investment and representation in audiovisual and screen content, sound, news and current affairs, culture and sport.  I wonder why this has not been ruled out of order because we are also asking that a report be published every three years.</p></speech>

For a number of reasons, I will not be accepting it.  At its widest, and taking the specific bodies referenced in the amendment, a definition of "public bodies" could cover the Revenue Commissioners, in its role regarding the application of section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland, in regard to making development and production loans available, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, in the context of the Sound &amp;amp; Vision scheme, TG4, regarding its role in commissioning content, and RT&Eacute;, in terms of funding for independent production through the independent production account established under section 116 of the Broadcasting Act.  Each of the funds disbursed by those bodies may come from two sources.  The first is the Exchequer, in the form of funding from section 481, Screen Ireland loans and TG4.  The second is from the licence fee, in the form of funding from RT&Eacute;, and the Sound &amp;amp; Vision scheme.</p> <p>While I appreciate the intent in regard to ensuring more balanced regional development and representation, the amendment contains a number of fundamental elements that would render it unworkable due to the nature of the audiovisual sector in the State and potential issues relating to EU Law.  In the case of TG4, for example, as a publisher broadcaster, it commissions all of its content production from Gaeltacht-based companies, largely in Galway but also in Cork and Waterford.  Obliging TG4 to distribute funding equitably and proportionately throughout the whole island of Ireland could undermine its current commissioning model and the range of independent production companies that support this.  It is natural that production companies providing for TG4 would be concentrated in Gaeltacht areas because more fluent Irish speakers live there.  I would be worried about the unintended consequences for TG4 if we are providing that funding should be spread evenly.  This amendment would also impact on the operation of the section 481 film tax credit.  The relief is distributed by the Revenue Commissioners and is technically open to any EU-based company that meets the qualifying criteria.  As a result, restricting the application of this relief to the island of Ireland, as suggested in the amendment, would actually appear to be a contravention of EU law.</p> <p>I agree that seeking balanced regional development is important, and it is an objective of the Government.  That is the objective behind the national planning framework, and it underpins the national development plan.  However, I do not think it is appropriate to place such an objective in legislation as proposed by the Senators.  The amendment actually appears to be contrary to EU law and could give rise to a number of unintended consequences.</p></speech>

Prior to Report Stage we could think about how we might write into legislation how the coimisi&uacute;n might recommend on how to improve the balance of investment from a regional perspective, which is also there in the amendment.  Perhaps we could have a discussion about that prior to Report Stage and come back to the House regarding how the coimisi&uacute;n would advise and report.</p></speech>

I have particular concerns about a requirement on TG4 in this regard.  However, the Senator is correct when it comes to trying to ensure that we seek to address questions relating to regional diversity.  I wonder if, when she is reflecting on the Bill, the Minister could look at the section relating to the powers and functions of the commission.  Under the powers and functions section, we could look at trying to ensure that there is greater diversity and so on.  The intention behind this amendment may possibly be reflected in some of the provisions contained in other sections.  Reflecting on the matter could prove useful.  I certainly agree with the intent.  Obviously, it is very tempting for me to talk about the Dublin-based media, especially in certain circumstances.  Even in the development of online media, however, it would be very difficult to police what is proposed.  When we look at the powers and functions of the commission, something could be built in there in the context of ensuring that the regional diversity of Ireland could be reflected.  That may be where we could incorporate those points.</p></speech>

However, I would be concerned about accepting an amendment that would be so prescriptive as to what RT&Eacute; and TG4 could or could not display.  Under section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, both public service broadcasters are required to be independent in their day-to-day operations, which includes editorial independence as regards programming content.  The purpose of this independence is to prevent political interference in the operation of RT&Eacute; and TG4.  Prescribing the format or content of any programming in such a detailed manner, including how data is presented, no matter how well-intentioned, would run contrary to the principle of editorial independence and I do not think it is appropriate for us as legislators to determine the type of content that should be displayed so specifically.</p> <p>While this amendment is clearly seeking to prevent the recurrence of something that offended and hurt many people, it could set a wider precedent for the regulation of very specific types of content in primary legislation.  As that is something we should seek to avoid in principle, I cannot accept the amendment.  </p></speech>

Amendment No. 90 would require the commission to furnish a copy of this register to the relevant Oireachtas committee annually.  I am not sure I see the value in this amendment, given that the register will be made publicly available by the commission under section 46A(6) and through the European Commission under Article 2.5b of the audiovisual media service directive.  I propose to reject the amendment as it would appear to require the provision of information that will actually be in the public domain.</p></speech>

In that context, I will not press the amendment, although I would prefer an ongoing dialogue between the Parliament and the Executive.  However, I know we have the discussion on "laid before" and "shared" and so forth, so in that context, I will not press the amendment at this point.</p></speech>

I propose that the annual sale threshold be &euro;500,000 in order that more providers are captured.  I am conscious that some of the areas of concern we hope will be addressed in terms of media service codes are areas where there is misinformation, poor practices or harmful conduct and the rewarding of that and which may be somewhat smaller.  I appreciate and think it appropriate that the audiovisual directive distinguishes between large and smaller.  I will come to this later.  It is one of the reasons I am concerned about the very wide provisions in terms of cloud services or interpersonal communications.  I know the audiovisual directive is specifically designed not to access and regulate everything that happens online but to regulate a certain scale of activity.  We may have sufficiently impactful media service providers, including ones that may have poor agendas where the reward may not be in threshold or turnover.  The effect and the benefits to those running those services may come in other ways.  I am concerned that the &euro;2 million threshold might leave a lot of things in limbo.  Is there the potential to lower that?  I respect the small to large component within the audiovisual directive but I wonder whether even within that, if &euro;500,000 might not be a more appropriate threshold, particularly given the context of Ireland as a smaller country with an intrinsically smaller market.  </p></speech>

The figure of &euro;2 million is derived from the definition of a media business set out in Part 3A of the Competition Act 2002, as amended, which provides for the media mergers framework.  For reasons of consistency and proportionality, I believe that we should continue to use this figure and cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Section 46I of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as inserted by section 9 of the Bill provides for a definition of "relevant media service provider".  This is important as some of the duties and aspects of the media service code set out in section 9 of the Bill, such as those related to objectivity and impartiality, apply to this category of provider rather than to all providers of audiovisual on-demand media services.  I believe consistency is important in these matters, as is alignment between the Bill and the media mergers framework.</p></speech>

I have highlighted the issue of harmful content and, as the Minister will be aware, I have also advocated for addressing harmful conduct.  There are concerns, however, in respect of how widely this might be interpreted and how it is framed.  We need far more clarity on this.</p><p>Section 46J(1)(a) refers to &quot;anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence&quot;.  That is so wide and potentially widely interpreted that it could lead to a significant curtailment of any form of engagement and could also create an unfair and unequal power dynamic whereby those who are resourced to assert their rights under this legislation can effectively have a chilling and silencing effect on those who may not have those resources.</p><p>I recently launched a new respect policy in NUI, Galway.  It has a new process for the development of a respect charter.  It is a really positive initiative.  One of the interesting discussions there in the context of discussing respect and what is harmful or offensive was that one does not want it to be framed as offensive if one does not use exact, perfect and polite language, and for that to, effectively, be weaponised against those who are marginalised already in order to inhibit their voices.  A power analysis is needed, effectively.</p><p>In considering respect, offence and power, we need to also consider what is the situation.  For example, the legislation may have a silencing effect.  A person with significant power and resources could effectively silence any individual who may not have any of the same equipment of power and who criticises that person or asks a question.  That is my concern.  That is why amendment No. 93, which is, perhaps, the more nuanced of the two in this grouping, seeks to get to what I hope is the intention, that is, to address harmful practices.</p><p>I say this as one who supports hate legislation and action on hate speech.  I believe that is something we need to do in order to ensure an equality of participation in public life.  It is part of freedom of expression that we address issues such as abusive contact, harassment or hate speech because those silence people and prevent them from being able to participate in public life equally.  That is why amendment No. 93 seeks to replace the language in the section.  The amendment would prohibit the broadcast of &quot;anything that may reasonably be regarded as causing harm to a group of persons, or a member of a group, based on any of the grounds referred to in Article 21 of the Charter&quot;.  That mirrors the language in section 46J(d), which refers to &quot;anything which may reasonably be regarded as likely to incite to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons, or a member of a group&quot;.</p><p>I accept that the incitement against hatred provision has been too narrow and inadequate in addressing the targeting and harm that is done.  That is why I can see there is need for something more than that, such as the provision in 46J(d).  However, this very wide provision in the section as it stands in terms of &quot;harm or offence&quot; will basically allow the stating of offence to be a mechanism for those in power, possibly those making important decisions that affect people's lives, to silence criticism.</p><p>Amendment No. 93 is clear that it is doing what we need to do, which is to build on and go further than the incitement against or hatred or violence and nip it in the bud by addressing messages that cause harm or offence.  It does not mean that every interaction on the Internet is covered.  It really means that we are protecting those who are vulnerable and have been recognised by the equality Act as needing protection in terms of their equality and equality of participation.  </p><p>Amendment No. 92 involves a straight removal, while amendment No. 93 takes a nuanced approach.  I am concerned that the current phrasing is so wide that its interpretability could mean that it ends up disadvantaging or even being weaponised against those who may fall under those protected categories under the charter or, potentially, equality legislation.</p></speech>

The intention is clear but it will be a matter of interpretation.  The difficulty with the section relates to the specific language that, "A broadcaster shall not broadcast ... [or] make available in a catalogue ... anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence".  The question there is who will determine what is reasonably viewed as causing harm or offence.  It is certainly the case that some people take offence to programmes on RT&Eacute; or other radio or television stations.  We could all watch the same programme and some people would consider it perfectly normal while others would find offence.  It will be a question of interpretation.</p> <p>It comes back to the fundamental debate we had in respect of the powers and functions of the commission and how we ensure a balance between freedom of expression and the responsibilities around protecting privacy and reputation and other rights.  I am conscious that many people who speak about the right to freedom of expression tend not to also speak about their responsibilities.  Freedom of expression involves a responsibility not to spread misinformation or disinformation.  One has a responsibility to take into account how one's words can harm others and so on.  Equally, there is a responsibility to accept that things will be uttered with which one disagrees and takes offence.  It is about getting that balance right.</p> <p>I have sympathy with much of what Senator Higgins is trying to do, not just through these amendments but also the subsequent ones.  I refer to the point in respect of "tending to undermine the authority of the State".  I agree with the principle in that regard but it needs to be more clearly defined.  I do not have a problem with a person suggesting that Government policy in a particular area is wrong and there should be major protests against it but if a person goes beyond that to engage in personalised abuse of a Minister or seeks to organise a protest outside the home of a Minister and uses broadcast media to do so, that is stretching over the line.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->What really needs to happen more is that there needs to be a reflection on some of the language in the Bill.  It is clear within the section what it is intended to achieve but I share Senator Higgins's concern because some of this is a question of interpretation.  We might have in our head what it means but I am concerned that, down the line, one may have a commission that will exercise its powers in a particular way.  A Minister or commission that is not as keen on free speech and freedom of expression might seek to interpret this in a different way.  This entire section just requires a bit more clarity.</p></speech>

In many ways the speaking of truth always risks offence but this should not be a reason for truth not to be spoken.  Many excellent pieces of media deal with difficult and divisive topics such as films or documentaries that may well cause offence to some but there is no right not to be offended.  We must ensure that free speech remains free and that the messages found in art are available to the public to be assessed according to their merit.</p></speech>

This reference is to give effect to Article 6 of the revised audiovisual and media services directive.  Going further than the directive in reference to the charter, without a firm basis in existing EU legislation, may give rise to unintended consequences.  Given one of the grounds in Article 21 of the charter is a, "political or ... other opinion", the amendment may inadvertently prevent criticism of political groups.  Accordingly, I propose to reject the amendment.</p> <p>In terms of the outright deletion proposed by amendment No. 92, I cannot accept this for two reasons.  One of the reasons is that this requirement, in part, transposes the requirement in the revised audiovisual and media services directive for member states to ensure that media service providers do not make available programmes which may impair the mental, moral or physical development of children.  The second reason is that I believe it is correct that media service providers are held to a high standard in terms of the programmes they, as editorial services, make available to the general public and as such, this provision has value and serves the public good.</p></speech>

There is no indication in terms of what will be determined as reasonably causing harm or offence.  Would harm include harm to interests?  Would a documentary that exposes bad practice by a particular actor or corporation and affects it financially be harm to interests?  Is that reasonably-caused harm?  It is not clear.  In terms of offence, is it offence against a person's views?  We know that there are those who are very offended by other people's weddings.  We heard much of that during the marriage equality referendum.  It is still very widely framed.  I understand how the Minister believes it might be interpreted but it is an extremely wide and interpretable phase which needs clarity.</p> <p>If the concern is the reference to the charter, I have sought to be constructive in the amendment with regard to mirroring the language.  This is not a replication because section 46J(1)(d) specifically relates to incitement to hatred or violence.  The other provision relates to harm or offence.  It is not replication but I sought to mirror that language.  Would it be appropriate to use the language in respect of our equality grounds?  Can we put in provisos with regard to being reasonably interpreted as causing harm or offence?  There is a danger that we come to a point, even though we are trying as a society to move ourselves forward towards more equality and human rights, at which this legislation sets in place an absolute reification of existing power structures whereby anything that might offend or harm existing powers or interests could effectively be challenged.</p> <p>We have seen the weaponisation of poorly-drafted measures that were meant to be used for equality but have actually been used and targeted against minority groups.  That is why we need to be very clear.  The language is very wide.  The Minister may not wish to accept my amendments but I hope she will listen to the point that this is extremely widely interpretable at present.  I am not assured as to where "reasonably considered" comes in.  It may be just a fact that it causes offence, harm to interests or harm in another form but it is almost a necessity or proportionality test.  Is it a disproportionate harm or offence that is caused that is disproportionate to the public good?</p></speech>

The language was not appropriate in the Broadcasting Act 2009 and we should be putting forward appropriate language now rather than taking a proviso from the past.  Many other measures in the past silenced different voices within Irish media.</p><p>I know that the language comes from the Constitution but, to be clear, the language in the Constitution already exists.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It does not need to be replicated in legislation.  If it is put in here, however, one is creating almost a tension with the constitutional interpretation, which is there and is available to anybody who wishes to go to the Supreme Court.  In the case of the Constitution, however, it is balanced by all of those other rights on expression.  It is not a sentence floating on its own but is placed in that context.  Instead, we have some of the language of the Constitution being given here for the commission to interpret, effectively, rather than by the Supreme Court.  </p><p>I know that that was the case in the 2009 Act, which I believe was an error.  We need to be clear in how we address these issues.  There is a concern.  For example, if there are criticisms of the actions of the HSE, does that undermine the State's authority.  We also saw a documentary on local authorities and their governance.  Where will the interpretation of the tendency to undermine the authority of the State be?  Are we effectively giving power to a body to interpret a constitutional phrase?  We have, as is proper, translated those measures already into very properly nuanced and thought-through legislation and that is what my second amendment in this set of amendments addresses.  This is the one where we talk to the Offences against the State Act.  This Act was there to give the legislative framework in interpreting what are offences against the State, including the undermining of the State&rsquo;s authority.  </p><p>It would be more appropriate if this legislation was to say anything which may reasonably be regarded as an offence, or a potential offence, under the Offences against the State Act 1939.  Yes, that is an appropriate caveat that would be applied, which is of the concern or risks to the Constitution.  At least in that Act, one is talking about a proper piece of legislation that can be referred to rather than simply a phrase taken from the Constitution and placed here out of context to the other pieces.  </p><p>A potential tension is also created between the Offences against the State Act and this proviso.  Again, this proviso was in the 2009 Act but it was not appropriate or nuanced enough in that Act and we would be better to link it to an actual set of concerns that are enumerated as offences under the relevant legislation.  This is my attempt to make it clearer and to avoid unfortunate over-interpretation but perhaps there are other ways to approach this.</p></speech>

She knows the exact background to this in respect of amendments Nos. 94 and 95.  I agree on first examination that some of the wording in the Bill does look old-fashioned, particularly the language in section 46J(1) which requires: &ldquo;A broadcaster [or] an audiovisual on-demand media service [not to broadcast or] make available &hellip; anything which may reasonably be regarded as tending to undermine the authority of the State&quot;.  As the Senator has correctly pointed out, that language has been carried over from existing provisions set out in section 39(1)(d) of the extant Broadcasting Act 2009 which, in turn, reflects previous legislation and, ultimately, Article 40.6 of the Constitution, which sets out that:</p> <blockquote> 	The State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State. </blockquote> <p>I would note that while the understanding of the country of the meaning of this article has definitely changed over time, it does contain and imply a number of fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, while acknowledging that such rights may be limited in the public interest.  This notion of fundamental rights needs to be balanced, depending on the facts on the ground, and that they are not absolute is something that we can all agree on.  This article requires the State to limit freedom of expression in certain instances and the courts have since set a high bar as to when it is appropriate for the State to do so.  It is right that this language and associated jurisprudence is carried forward through the Bill.  As such, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 94 and 95 but I understand the Senator&rsquo;s position.</p></speech>

I was keen to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response before making my contribution.  Again, this relates to the principle or language around this and it is important that we have something that reflects this in the legislation.</p> <p>My concern is around when we talk about the broader media environment and how we can effectively regulate what is happening in respect of those who are in receipt of broadcasting licences and so on.  As a general rule, most of those behave responsibly and would not look at broadcasting something that will undermine the authority of the State.  Unfortunately, they are competing in many cases with online or digital services which, frankly, do not have to deal with such regulation.</p> <p>This issue is around how we can ensure that we get the balance right which is a little tough.  If we are hammering RT&Eacute; around perceptions as to whether or not a particular programme may or may not be looking to undermine the State, one may also have online websites and platforms, which I will not describe as news providers, that do not believe in trusted journalism or in evidence-based stories, and which will put ideas out about undermining the institutions of the State.  We have to look at an appropriate balance.</p> <p>It is important that we have something in the legislation along these lines.  I appreciate that this is the language of the past and of how we are trying to apply it in a modern environment.  In that sense, I am agreeing with both Senator Higgins and the Minister.  I am reflecting on how we can ensure that when we have the media commission up and running, the institutions of the State are protected but that we allow, at the same time, for justified criticism.  It is a question of getting that balance right and it may be just a case of looking again at some of the language.</p></speech>

In the Constitution, this language is very carefully caveated.  That is what I meant by taking a small section, but out of context.  The Constitution realised the risk of an over-interpretation of the undermining of the State clause.  It therefore has the language which says: "preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy", and goes to that trouble while continuing: "shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State".</p> <p>Perhaps it is important that the language that is there in the Constitution, if we are using constitutional language, has a clear caveat of: "preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy" and that this is also reflected as an appropriate counterbalance to the undermining of the authority of the State.  This is an important caveat for the interpretation of that proviso.</p> <p>I completely agree that that should apply to all and should be reflected with broadcasters as well as those new online media providers who are coming under this legislation.  That may already be the case as this section amends the Broadcasting Act more generally.  </p> <p>That is a potential way to ensure that there is a clarity or perhaps it is around adding a clause that says that this provision should be interpreted in line with whatever caveat one wishes to use.  That criticism of Government policy piece is very important and it is very important that there is no risk.  I am aware that the Minister has said that the courts have set a high bar but as legislators, we are not lawyers, we should always endeavour to have the safeguards built into the legislation we pass and reflected in there rather than simply leaving it to individuals to seek these rights through the courts.</p></speech>

I suggest that a new subsection be added to this section regarding news and current affairs that makes it very clear.  It would read:</p> <blockquote> 	Subsection (1) should not be interpreted as constraining a broadcaster or a relevant media service provider from appropriate examination, investigation, interrogation ... or questioning in respect to news or current affairs which&mdash;  	(a) concerns public policy, or<br /><br />(b) the actions of a Government, a Minister, a designated public official or a public body.  </blockquote> <p>There is a concern in that the way in which this is framed must be such that the treatment of current affairs, which includes matters which are the subject of either public controversy or current public debate, is fair to all interests concerned.  Public controversy and current public debate are very narrowly framed in that regard in that there is no consideration of, for example, public policy or the fact that there may sometimes be issues which are not the subject of current debate or controversy.  I would love to see the media cover issues not simply because they are the subject of controversy or debate but because they are issues of public policy that need examination or actions of Ministers that need interrogation.  There is a concern that, because of the way in which this is framed, there could be a sense that if, for example, a documentary were to highlight a new area of concern, it would be effectively through the fact of its interrogation by the media that it would become a matter of public concern or public debate.  Similarly, nothing should constrain the challenging of a Minister, a public official or anybody else by interrogation by an interviewer.  The present framing is a little strange.  I would like clarification to the effect that it shall not constrain a broadcaster from examination, investigation, interrogation, debate or questioning.  That would give a sense of a greater safeguard.</p><p>Is there a grouping or is this a stand-alone amendment?</p></speech>

Without free and independent media, a well-informed citizenry cannot exist and democracy cannot function in any meaningful sense of the word.  That is what the Constitution provides for and what this Bill reflects.  Within that framework, investigative journalism plays an important role.  I absolutely understand the intention behind amendment No. 97, which seeks to mitigate a perceived risk that the Bill, as initiated, would undermine the ability of media service providers to carry news and current affairs content which is critical of the Government or public officials or would have an adverse effect on investigative journalism.  I do not think, however, that section 46(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, needs to be qualified in the manner suggested by the amendment.  The language used in the section reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act, which has not to date exercised a chilling effect on broadcast journalism.  For the same reason, I do not accept amendment No. 97.</p></speech>

What is in section 46L comprehensively covers what is suggested in the amendment.  If we should look at anything as having a chilling effect on broadcasting, I suggest it is probably more the defamation laws than anything else.  It should be noted that no party leader or Government Minister is currently suing the broadcaster under the defamation laws.  It is the defamation laws that probably need to be examined more in some of this area, but section 46L, as currently worded, sufficiently covers some of the concerns the Senator Higgins raises.</p></speech>

This is about the treatment of current affairs.  I object somewhat to the framing of current affairs in such a narrow way.  That is a concern, even culturally, in that current affairs is framed as the fight of the moment.  I accept the Minister's caveats in respect of the Broadcasting Act, but I am concerned that we are missing the opportunity to strengthen and improve things slightly in respect of the Broadcasting Act by the wholesale transfer of many of its provisions.  I would be happier if there were a further clarification.

It is really important for public discourse and public debate that there be appropriate coverage.  This comes back to a point I made previously about the <i>exception culturelle</i>in respect of the recognition that there are public good and collective benefit purposes to broadcasting and that its regulations need to reflect that.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That related to the provisions in respect of certain programmes that have been identified by the State as involving a public entitlement of access.  Certain areas should not be broadcast commercially but, rather, should be available to all citizens of and everybody else in a state.  It is important that the whole island will be able to access things like, for example, the list of events including the All-Ireland Gaelic football or hurling final.</p><p>However, the amendment relates specifically to the obligations in respect of news and current affairs.  The Bill as it stands provides, "The Commission may authorise a derogation in whole or in part from the requirement" to give 20% of broadcasting time to news and current affairs and to ensure at least two hours of that time is within daytime hours.  That derogation is there but I worry that applications for a derogation will be made right after a licence is granted.  A station that is going to begin broadcasting may go straight in for the derogation and then have it forever.  Its business plan would be formulated on the assumption of an ongoing derogation.  The amendment is simple.  It does not take away the power of the commission to authorise a derogation but simply states that derogations would be for a designated period.  I have also suggested - this may be an overreach - that the Oireachtas joint committee would have to approve a motion in that regard.</p><p>It is not simply that it would be nice for stations to do news and current affairs broadcasting.  The provision of news and current affairs broadcasting is part of the purpose and intention of the broadcasting landscape.  It is not solely commercial.  I worry that, effectively, the derogation would be beneficial to the listeners of the service.  Sound broadcasting services could say their market does not care about news and current affairs but just wants Christmas music or 1960s music all the time.  The services may point out that is what their market or demographic wants but, in fact, a condition of broadcasting in the State is that it must contribute to the public good through public debate, discourse and information.  I am concerned about the derogations.  I am concerned they might be widely used and services may get a derogation and have it forever.   Derogations may be appropriate in some cases but they should be reviewed periodically.  I ask the Minister to indicate her views in respect of the time limit and the kind of political safeguard.  I am interested in her views on either or both of those provisions.</p></speech>

I refer to the points made by Senator Higgins regarding putting a time limit on the derogation to ensure that, as she stated, the business models are not on the basis of a continuing derogation in order to seek to fulfil what market research has indicated the station audience is.  Unfortunately, many of these commercial stations are now fighting to stay alive.  We saw that during the pandemic.  I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin,  because the sound and vision fund kept them alive.  In fairness to John Purcell, he appeared at the committee and stated that.  He stated that in the region of 30 stations were on the verge of collapse and would have collapsed were it not for the intervention of the Government and the sound and vision fund.  He stated that kept the stations alive.  On further probing in the course of those discussions, it emerged that the marketplace for these stations is becoming extremely tough.  There was a migration of advertisers to different platforms because of the pandemic and that has not fully recovered since.  The business models have changed.  When stations are reassessing their business models, they look towards what their marketplace is in an ever-competing world and the whole necessity for news, current affairs and sport broadcasting drops down the list.  The stations made that point to the committee in terms of advertising time and the requirement for news and current affairs and so forth.  This has also had an impact in terms of the diminution of radio station newsrooms.  That is very sad thing for young journalists coming forward in terms of the opportunities that present themselves.  The value placed on news and current affairs in the context of newsrooms has diminished, but that is not the doing of news editors.  God, they are fighting a losing battle.  They have become despondent as well.  The point made by Senator Higgins in respect of not facilitating an ever-running derogation is well made.  It is certainly worthy of debate, and I support that.</p></speech>

I add my voice in terms of thanking and acknowledging the Minister in the context of the interventions and support.  She will be aware that I engaged with her office on the issue of local radio in particular and the really important role it played and plays, particularly during Covid, but also its wider role.  I am speaking about this issue of news and current affairs because they are essential public goods.  We will, no doubt, later discuss the dangers of misinformation but we also need to speak about the importance of information and news and current affairs discussions.  One of the most real and constructive places in which those discussions happen tends to be at local level.  I acknowledge that the role of local radio in that regard is important.  It is often the case that when an issue is discussed in that concrete and place-based way, there can actually can be a lot of light and progress on it.  I am looking to that requirement but in the context of certain providers and certain terms of local radio, it also probably needs to be resourced in an ongoing way because it is part of the public good of broadcasting, as well as democracy and democratic engagement, that local radio stations are able to foster that kind of local news and local connection to policy decisions and local debate.  I acknowledge the resources the Minister has directed in that area.  There should be a resource support as well as this requirement support.  My core point however, is that there should not be endless derogations simply based on a purely commercial rationale.</p></speech>

The amendment requires an coimisi&uacute;n to receive the approval of an Oireachtas joint committee before authorising a derogation from the requirement that a sound broadcasting service shall devote not less than 20% of the broadcasting time on the service to news and current affairs programmes.  Granting such derogations is a matter that should be left to the commission to undertake as an independent regulatory authority and I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment.  The BAI currently grants such derogations.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I remind Senators that licences are for a finite period.  It is a key principle that an coimisi&uacute;n should be able to make regulatory decisions free from external interference, particularly from political bodies, as is required by the audiovisual media services directive.  Requiring specific approval, as the Senator referred to in her question on the political side, by an Oireachtas committee may represent undue interference in the regulatory independence of an coimisi&uacute;n, which would be likely to approve a number of temporary sound broadcasting contracts throughout the year, such as that for Christmas FM.  There is also the practical consideration that Oireachtas committees fall on the dissolution of the D&aacute;il and would therefore not be available to approve a derogation at certain stages.  Consider how long it took the past two Governments to form.  The committees were gone for some time.  That could be an issue.</p></speech>

They all do their different work.  Will the Minister address the first part?  I am looking to how we can progress this.  I accept the Minister's point on the committee and will not press that element.  As I intend to return to this on Report Stage, I would appreciate it were the Minister to clarify her view on the question of a time limitation.  There are periods, seasonal and others, in which it may be appropriate that there be a derogation but I believe it should be a time-limited derogation.  My concern is licences and derogations could be issued where the full identity of that sound broadcaster for a long period is in no way contributing to the public good. </p> <p>Even the fact it is limited to the listeners of that service is an issue.  The duty is not solely to the consumers because there is a duty to the wider public good.  News and current affairs cannot and should not be broadcast based only on the fact that people are crying out for them.  There is a reason for the requirement that they be broadcast.  It is not solely demand-led but also public good-led that there be news and current affairs components in broadcasts.  I accept the Minister's points on the independence of the commission and its function but ask her to address the question of a time limitation and the issue relating to the benefit to listeners of the service and the wider public good.</p></speech>

Sometimes we say that those in politics cannot express their opinions and it should be independent.  These Houses are where we formulate the framework by which people operate.  I know the Minister recognises that this is all the more important because the media world is changing and there will be casualties.  In the UK over the past ten or 20 years, particularly regarding local media and local newspapers, the death of the local press is frightening.</p> <p>I met the UK media secretary and discussed this at a meeting in Berlin where we tried to come up with ideas.  They have introduced ideas for the per cent scheme where they help through subventions to newsrooms to employ young journalists, in order to make sure young journalists continue to come forward.  We are seeing and will continue to see casualties, certainty in the local newspaper industry in this country.  I was in a newsroom when it went under.  That is equally the case for radio stations.</p> <p>The point made by John Purcell was that Government and the Minister kept those stations alive but that we should not fool ourselves into thinking they can stay alive.  There will be casualties.  Pressure comes to bear from these stations on the broadcasting authority to let them follow the business model that will satisfy their commercial interests and keep their product alive.  Here we get into the scenario of dumbing down the media.  We saw the necessity for good news and good current affairs during the pandemic.  RT&Eacute; ran magnificent ads concerning where people ascertain their news.  We are lucky to have a State broadcaster that did that.  It is important to maintain that level of integrity.  I monitor news organisations in different countries.  This country has one of the best but it is under pressure and when it comes under pressure, commercial interests can start to weigh because they are all owned, with the exception of RT&Eacute;, by private interests.  I accept what the Minister has said but it is right we had the debate and that we frame it in such a way.  That is why I think the timeframes Senator Higgins is calling for are worthy of consideration.</p></speech>

I am not accepting the amendment for two reasons.  There is the political interference and difficulties with the Oireachtas committee, which Senator Higgins accepted, but also the fact that the BAI already grants such derogations.  That will be carried over by an coimisi&uacute;n and licences are for a finite period, which has not caused an issue to this point.</p></speech>

The case was made eloquently by Senator Cassells concerning the danger of slippage into media and broadcasting solely as a product, rather than with a public good purpose.  This legislation is meant to transpose the audiovisual directive, which has goals around the cultural and public role of broadcasting, rather than simply its commercial purposes.  This is an opportunity to address that for all broadcasters.  Otherwise, there is a strong risk of a race to the bottom whereby people do not get news information or current affairs discussion from broadcasters within the State but will be pressed to seek information elsewhere, including from those who have other interests, such as disinformation.  I accept the first half of the Minister's concern but the second half in terms of not putting a time limitation on this runs a strong risk of normalising derogations.  I reserve the right to bring back an amendment on and I may bring amendments on a limitation on the proportion of licences that can contain a derogation.</p></speech>

Senator Wall, who is not here today, has been very active on this and others in the House have highlighted it in the past.  I refer to the advertising and promotion of gambling.  In the amendment, I seek to address the issue of speculative financial activities which pose a risk to the person and within that I include the trading of cryptocurrencies.  We have had discussions about gambling as an area that needs to be addressed in terms of advertising and promotion.</p><p>Gambling is a good example of the distinction we have spoken about in terms of harmful content and harmful conduct.  In terms of gambling advertising, we know there have been practices whereby persons are profiled.  Somebody who has stopped taking risks with gambling will be targeted with promotional materials to encourage him or her to start gambling again.  It is a clear example of where the issue is not solely about advertising content, but also the way in which the content is delivered and directed towards, and causes risk to, certain persons.  In that regard, that is what this set of amendments seeks to address in different ways.</p><p>We have also heard that there are practices which may not be labelled as gambling in the classic sense but, in effect, have a similar effect and are designed to instil the practices regarding gambling.  One of the issues which has been highlighted is the use of loot boxes in gaming, in terms of putting in place gambling incentives and structures for children at a young age.  I am also raising the issue of the trading of cryptocurrencies, which create a significant risk to many persons in terms of financial risks.  Cryptocurrencies are a risk to all of us in terms of their environmental impact.  They are an example of an issue which is increasingly clearly in need of financial and environmental regulations or, possibly, prohibition.</p><p>Amendment No. 126 was tabled by Senator Black and I will move it on her behalf.  It seeks to insert the regulation of these areas into the media service codes and identifies commercial communications regarding gambling as one of the issues which potentially affects the general public health interests of children.</p><p>Amendment No. 127, as I said, deals with gambling and the advertising of speculative financial activities.  I understand amendment No. 148 was tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in.  I will ask it to speak to that.  It has a similar intent.</p></speech>

The House will recall that during the first session on this Bill my colleague, Senator Cassells, spoke with a good degree of passion around how we need to regulate that space, in particular around how there has to be close co-operation between the commission and gambling regulator.  It is about more than advertising.</p> <p>I have a problem with amendment No. 102.  It refers to not allowing advertisements which seek to promote gambling or other speculative financial activities which pose a risk to a person.  Virtually every financial activity into which we enter or engage in is speculative.  Most radio advertisements refer to the fact that the value of something can go up and well as down, including pensions and so on.  The question also needs to be asked in respect of gambling about whether we include the national lottery.  Would the lovely lottery advertisements about winning holidays be included if we accept this amendment?</p> <p>We need regulation in that space.  We need levels of education so that people can understand what they are faced with.  This speaks to a broader question around people's level of financial knowledge.  Whether that applies to crypto or anything else, it is about people's own level of financial awareness.  A group of young people from south Dublin visited Leinster House today.  They would love to have much more of an understanding of the context around areas like savings and investments as part of the education system.</p> <p>Whether we are talking about financial or savings products or, arguably, insurance products, depending on how they are interpreted, any of those could be viewed as speculative financial activities.  I have a problem with how the amendment is worded.  We have previously proposed that there would be close liaison around this, whereby the commission would liaise closely with the new office of the gambling regulator to tackle some of these challenges, in particular the scourge of online gambling.  That would be a more effective way to address this.</p></speech>

I will never forget last summer.  One of my favourite things when I am not attending a match on a Sunday is listening to "Sunday Sport" on RT&Eacute; Radio One.  In between matches there are some very good documentaries and other programmes.  There was an absolutely fantastic piece with Ois&iacute;n McConville, one of the greatest GAA stars ever, whose life was, unfortunately, blighted by gambling.  He spoke extensively on Radio One for about half an hour on all of the various low points in his life.  It was a stirring piece.  I have great time for the man.  He came to my GAA club to talk to young people to warn them about the impact of gambling and what it can do to them.  He is an ambassador not just for our sport, but for our country.</p> <p>When the piece was over, Radio One said it would break and go to the opening day of racing at the Curragh, brought to the audience by BoyleSports.  I said, "Oh my God."  That goes back to the earlier point on the balance with respect to commercial reality.  I remember as a young journalist in a newsroom being told in no uncertain terms that commercial reality dictates whether we stayed alive.  RT&Eacute; did its public service by having a piece of programming that spoke to the heart of a matter of one of the greatest blights in our country, and skipped seamlessly from that into a feature race being sponsored by one of the largest bookies on the Continent.  It almost defied belief, but it did not really because that is the reality we are living in.</p> <p>This needs to be addressed.  It goes to why we have our amendment, which I ask the Minister to accept.  In terms of the Bill reflecting Government policy, we will establish a gambling commissioner to deal with all of this.  It has become entrenched in our society.  When sports stars are interviewed after matches there are gambling logos behind them.  There are a lot of difficulties about saying that we are going to ban, from a broadcasting sense, gambling products because they are so entrenched it will lead to many difficulties.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Shane Cassells:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2448"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2448&amp;amp;pid=ShaneCassells&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must look at this as a whole, which is why the gambling commissioner is important.  This is how we will tackle it.  It is why we asked for an amendment.  It was simply for this Bill to reflect Government policy on gambling because it will cross a multitude of things.  It can happen.  I made the point regarding how the French Government banned it for the feature match of the Six Nations.  They could not show the Guinness logo on the pitch because the French Government had banned it.  It can happen.  It happened in Formula One, snooker and places where tobacco had a stranglehold.  That was broken and the same thing can happen with gambling.  It must be addressed as a whole.  I support Senator Higgins 100% regarding what she is trying to do but I think we should do it through the gambling legislation and the gambling regulator.  It must be reflected in the Bill, which is why we are saying it should be reflected in Government policy.  </p></speech>

It was very passionate, as always.  We know how heartfelt the Senator is about the gambling industry in this country.  I must support what Senator Malcolm Byrne has said.  I take slight issue with this amendment.  I welcome so many provisions of this Bill, which advance gambling regulation.  However, I think that decentralised blockchain currencies have a role to play in the digital and financial future of the world.  It is education rather than censorship that is key in this area.</p></speech>

It was a recommendation by the joint committee in its pre-legislative report.  I know the Minister has given a rationale about how financial harm is not content, which is required to be regulated under the audiovisual media services directive.  We accept that Ireland is in the process of finally establishing a gambling regulator.  If this amendment is not accepted by the Minister, which presumably it will not be given her previous response, we can put in an amendment on Report Stage or later in the other Chamber calling for a relationship to be established in legislation between the media commission and the new gambling regulator.  Harmful gambling is a major problem in this country and online gambling has seen the problem explode and has made it much more secretive in nature and easier to hide.  Online gambling and the advertising of gambling on social media sites is an issue of concern, particularly when we consider isolation, the constant availability and hidden nature of online gambling.  It is clear that the media commission has a role to play in addressing this and this is the rationale for amendment No. 148.</p></speech>

I personally believe gambling should be banned but on the way this is stated, I note Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the national lottery, for which an exception must be made.  It is regulated separately and is not a for-profit business.  It is for good causes.  We may have to look at the &euro;160 million that was announced a number of months ago from that.  I am not in favour of that amendment.</p></speech>

I will give the reason while I have both of them.  I am very happy for them to be dealt with separately.  I am not happy for it to solely rely on engaging with the future commission because I do think gambling is one of the key examples of that harmful content and harmful conduct piece that needs regulation.  I think it is really important that it is clear.  Some of the amendments simply say that this may be one of the areas the commission would address.  I think it should be named and a signal sent because it is vastly profitable.  The profits of some companies have quadrupled during 2020 to 2021.  It is harmful to persons.  I was looking at some information and discovered that people in Ireland lose over &euro;1 billion per year.  People are losing significant amounts of money.  I, as, I am sure, everybody here, can think of multiple examples of people whose lives have been ruined and ruined very quickly by gambling and gambling addiction.  Ireland has a very high level of that addiction, which is where the harmful conduct piece comes in.  Even if some of my hard prohibitions may not be accepted, I want to be really clear that targeting in terms of addiction, including gambling addiction, needs to be really addressed as a form of harmful conduct.</p> <p>I will speak to the issue in terms of speculative financial activity.  It is slightly different and I recognise that they are not the same.  Regarding removing gambling from sports events, about which Senator Cassells spoke very passionately, it can be done because we did it with alcohol.  We were told it was impossible to do it for alcohol.  I pay particular tribute to Senator Black, who fought really hard around those issues in terms of the alcohol regulation Bill.  We were told they were so intrinsically entwined that it would be impossible to separate out alcohol advertising and sport but it can be done and similarly it can be done with gambling.  </p> <p>I am speaking to speculative financial activity and cryptocurrency because I am seriously concerned.  Regarding the driver of the crash in 2008, the bailouts we had to have, the State underwriting speculative activity on a massive scale, that kind of vulnerability and exposure we had in 2008 where those who effectively gambled ended up being bailed out by the State, I worry that we are seeing a new cohort and a new risk emerging that has not been identified early enough.  Again, there are very large interests with lots of money.  There is this same theme of trying to get people in on the stock market early.  I worry that we are creating a situation where effectively, sometimes very vulnerable people will be used as a human shield against the regulation of cryptocurrency because ordinary people will to be a small extent tied in and people will be vulnerable if there is regulation or an end to cryptocurrency mining, which environmentally we may need to do.  I worry that we will have that same situation whereby so many ordinary persons will find themselves tied into the fate of a speculative pyramid scheme that the State is effectively in a position where it needs either light-touch regulate it or bail it out.  I really worry that we are creating a major risk and that individuals will be vulnerable to that.  This is an area we need to regulate even from an environmental perspective, as well as from the perspective of financial risk.  I am worried that persons with very little money to spare will have been targeted by predatory advertising that promises them things that will not be delivered and they will be the ones who suffer from any negative outcome from crashes relating to cryptocurrency.  I am very serious about that area.  I accept that they are different areas but they have a similar target and way of operating but I am happy to address them separately in future amendments on Report Stage.  I am concerned about both.  </p></speech>

I agree with the Senators that gambling addiction poses a major challenge to our society, particularly when it involves children and young people.  This is why the establishment of a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being with the powers to regulate advertising gambling websites and apps was a commitment in the programme for Government.  The Minister for Justice published the general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill last October.  That Bill will establish a new regulatory authority, namely, the gambling authority of Ireland.  Specifically, head 109 of the general scheme sets out that the authority shall make codes concerning the advertising of gambling.  These codes may include restrictions or prohibitions concerning such matters as the times of day that gambling may be advertised on broadcasters, video on demand and audiostreaming services; an option for a customer of a video on-demand service to opt out of receiving advertising and a requirement that a video-sharing platform service should not display gambling by default but should require an opt-in mechanism.  The general scheme also requires the gambling regulator to engage with an coimisi&uacute;n on such codes to facilitate joined-up thinking on the regulation of advertising.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Catherine Martin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=2425"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2425&amp;amp;pid=CatherineMartin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Given that the Gambling Authority of Ireland will issue codes in respect of advertising, I do not propose to accept these amendments.  It would not be an effective use of resources or coherent policy to mandate two regulatory authorities to regulate the same matter.  Senators have spoken about this.  Given its remit, role and specialisation, the Gambling Authority of Ireland will be the best place to regulate the advertising of gambling.</p><p>As regards speculative financial activities, the Central Bank of Ireland regulates the advertising of financial activities by financial services firms under its remit.  The rules are set out in the consumer protection code published by the Central Bank.  To make a general point, I recognise that crypto-assets pose a significant challenge for consumer protection.  In that regard, I note the EU markets in crypto-assets regulation is currently under negotiation in Brussels.  It will set out a licensing regime for crypto-assets.  However, fundamentally, it will be for authorities other than an coimisi&uacute;n with specific expertise to set out the primary rules for regulating the advertising of crypto-assets.  While I do not accept these amendments, I recognise their intent and the points the Senators have made today.</p><p>Gambling is a scourge for many families.  On the broader issue raised by Senators Cassells and Byrne in amendment No. 28, which relates to the role of an coimisi&uacute;n regarding gambling addiction, I have committed to speaking to my colleague the Minister for Justice on the matter in advance of returning to that amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

I am aware that others have also highlighted this.  Amendment No. 103 would insert a new subsection requiring that a broadcaster should not broadcast and a relevant media service provider should not make available an advertisement that seeks to promote breast milk substitutes.  Amendment No. 120 &mdash; I am not sure whether it is in my name &mdash; would make it clear that the media service codes shall prohibit certain kinds of commercial communications.</p><p>I have an amendment in the section relating to the media codes that refers to &quot;the general public health interests of children, in particular those foods or beverages which contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars&quot;.  It relates to the concern that breast milk substitutes should be mentioned in regard to the general public health interests of children.</p><p>Amendment No. 124, in the name of my colleague, Senator Black, raises this issue also.  Amendment No. 125 is important because it lists breast milk substitutes as pertaining to one of the areas of commercial communication where media service codes might be made.  Amendment No. 128 provides that regulations would restrict, where media service codes might be made, the inclusion in programmes of commercial communications relating to foods or beverages considered to be the subject of public concern.  I am not sure if amendment No. 128 is my own, so I will let others speak to that.</p><p>This is a really good example of one of those core issues I have indicated.  In our initial discussion, the Minister indicated she understood and wanted to engage on the matters of harmful content and harmful conduct.  We have a public health good with breastfeeding.  It is immensely important to our public health goals for children.  In Ireland, we are absolute outliers.  It needs to be very clear that every woman will be making her choice between breastfeeding and the use of formula; however, as I believe was stated, it is not that they are equal.  There is one route that is better for public health.  It is appropriate that there be public health communication in this area.</p><p>In Ireland, 6% of persons breastfeed for six months by comparison with the global average, which is 40%.  Globally, the ratio of those who breastfeed to those who do not and may use formula is almost 50:50, but Ireland is only at 6%.  In Ireland, we have a long tradition of not promoting or supporting breastfeeding in the way it should be.  We are now seeing measures, which are welcome, on lactation, with an increase in the number of lactation consultants.  Again, we are talking about just over &euro;1 million for new lactation consultants.  That is a very small amount to be invested in the promotion of supports by comparison with the funds associated with the very active agents in this area, namely those with a commercial purpose.  Therefore, the fact of the moment is that in those periods when women are making decisions in this regard, the public health message must compete with one from the industry and those with commercial interests.  </p><p>There are practices related to the advertising and promotion of breast milk substitutes that are really concerning.  It is not simply a matter of products on a shelf.  We need to be clear that this is separate from the regulation of breast milk substitutes as products but that we are seeing marketing practices such as the creation of baby clubs where persons are going to access information about some other aspect of having a new baby and are effectively entering a space where there is commercial intent and where there are provisions in respect of online chats with expert mums.  There is targeting by way of competitions whereby pregnant people are encouraged to put in their names, details and due date so they can get week-by-week email updates.  This could become the price of entering a competition for a new cot.  These are very targeted activities that are designed to make use of commercial actors with commercial purposes and advertising in the first six months when new mothers are making decisions on whether to breastfeed.</p><p>The practices I have outlined directly breach the World Health Organization code.  This code sets out specific measures &mdash; for example, that one should not seek direct contact with pregnant women or new mothers.  It states directly that there should be no information function attached to a marketing function.  The breaches are genuine breaches of the World Health Organization's voluntary code.  They serve as a really good example of why self-regulation has not been working.  That is why the World Health Organization has stated specifically, in a new report issued in the past few weeks, that it believes online advertising and online promotion of breast milk substitutes and formula for commercial reasons are undermining a major public health goal.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Alice-Mary Higgins:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2480"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2480&amp;amp;pid=AliceMaryHiggins&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is important in Ireland because we have such low levels.  It is also important that Ireland sets a high standard internationally.  The WHO and others have estimated up to 800,000 infant deaths would have been prevented if its code on the marketing of breast milk substitutes had been fully applied.  Ireland exports one third of the formula manufactured here to the Chinese market.  The breastfeeding rate in China has halved over the past decade.  Let us be clear that advertising and commercial communication is designed to increase the market.  Its purpose is to increase the usage of a product.  This is the nature of advertising and its commercial communication.</p><p>This is not to diminish women's ability to make the choices they need to make.  When the WHO code first came out we had a situation where company marketing representatives almost appeared in hospitals.  They are not there now but they are appearing where people are trying to access information.  There is a very important message that we need more public information.  We need far more public support.  We need non-commercial alternatives.  For example, the only non-commercial breast milk bank here is in the north of the island.  This is an example that is a solution for women who are not able to breastfeed themselves.  It does not make anybody any money.  These types of solutions must compete.  It is one thing to say we need to increase them, and we do, but we should not have them in competition with those who have a commercial purpose in this regard.  This is because there is a public health cost if we do not address it.  The Minister will be aware of how strongly many women feel about this issue and how much people have had to fight to try to give greater visibility to breastfeeding and get greater support for it.  I hope she will consider these amendments.  I recognise Senator Sherlock and others have also tabled amendments on this matter.</p></speech>

I thought there may have been someone else who might want to speak about this.  Some Senators have been incredibly vocal when I have pointed out that I agreed with the recommendations of the report of the Oireachtas joint committee that we needed to ban online advertising of formula milk in this country.  My feelings on this are very much on the record as are those of other Senators who disagree with me on this point.  I am sure they will make their feelings known.  Let us make no mistake.  This is big business.  That is what this is about.  Online advertising and any advertising of formula milk is not about alerting people and mothers to the possibility they could formula feed.  We all know this.  It is about looking at a vulnerable time in someone's life and asking how to make money out of it.  This is what I believe the advertising of this milk is about.</p> <p>There have been workarounds when it comes to the WHO code.  Follow-on milk is one of these.  Follow-on milk is not necessary but because we have a code that includes infant milk follow-on milk is used as a way to bypass it and allow the type of advertising that will promote formula milk in general.  Let us think about this.  Nobody advertises for something unless they think they will get a return on the investment.  This is why people put money behind advertising.  Those who breastfeed cannot put any money into advertising because it is something we do naturally and we make no money from.  This is why we are competing against something in this country.  Public health is competing against something that is making money.  It needs to be heavily regulated.  I am supportive of the amendments and I thank the Minister and the officials for their engagement on this issue.  When we have a Bill such as this, which includes sugar and salt, it makes sense that we also include things that have been shown by the WHO not to improve public health in general.</p> <p>There are instances where people choose to use formula milk feed and there are instances where people have to.  These instances would still be facilitated.  We are not speaking about stopping the sale of these goods.  We are speaking about people at 3 a.m. desperately looking for a solution to mastitis or a child that will not sleep.  They go online to search for ways to get the child to sleep.  They should not be prompted with advertisements for the purchase of a product that will make somebody else money.  The formula milk industry is worth &euro;60 billion a year.  Not only does it make money but it leads to worse health outcomes.  We all know this and I can point to 1 million pieces of research but I will not do so.  In Ireland, it is worth &euro;1 billion year.  This is very much behind why we allow the promotion of these products to go ahead.</p> <p>There are clear instances where the code has been breached in this country.  I have gone into supermarkets and had to point out the code is being breached because they are not allowed to reduce the price of infant milk formula.  It is still being decreased.  This is why I am supportive of these amendments or something that would show it is an important issue.  Some of the wording in the amendments needs to be changed and this is probably acknowledged.  We look at sugar and salt and their promotion to children.  When we look at formula milk it is the promotion to their parents that has worse health outcomes for them.</p> <p>This is about choice.  We know this type of advertising has not provided the same type of choice for those who want support with breast milk, those who want support with feeding their infants or to have proper health advice from doctors on which is best substitute for them.  This is where I see it and not in advertising that makes a profit for people.</p></speech>

This is not entirely clear to me.  The Bill states that provision may be made for the purpose that may prohibit the inclusion in programmes of commercial communications related to trans-fats, fats, salts and sugars.  If I am reading the amendment correctly, it proposes changing this so it shall be restricted.  I am not sure about this.  I might get guidance on it.  I am quite happy with the idea that the Bill may prohibit it.  The language in the Bill is arguably stronger and I am quite supportive of it.  My particular concern is with regard to product placement, particularly sugar and trans-fat foods targeted at children.  It comes back to some of the earlier points.  We need to consider that while we are looking at licensed broadcasters and extensive restrictions on them, they are competing against online platforms.  We must ensure it is a level playing field.  There have been a lot of codes in place and I would like to see restrictions on sugary foods.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Malcolm Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;MemberID=1111"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1111&amp;amp;pid=MalcolmByrne&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There should not be targeted advertising based on children but the proposal in the amendment to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo; does not make sense.</p></speech>

I have not tabled over 200 amendments like Senator Higgins and simply wish to acknowledge the amount of work that the Minister has done on this important legislation.  Today, we are a speaking about something that an awful lot of us are passionate about whether that is in what we do in life or in society.</p> <p>I will now try to flesh out this amendment and must state that we all approach this subject from different angles.  I am first a dairy farmer, second a politician, third a father of four children who are in primary school and so I have a very busy house, and fourth I am married to a midwife.  Therefore, I have a unique insight, rightly or wrongly, in terms of my views on the proposals that have been brought forward and I shall start at the top.  As a farmer I know that farmers do an awful lot of work to make sure that the products that we make are safe and accountable to environmental concerns but are to the highest possible standards.  We have managed to do that over the last decades.  What we produce in Ireland is a credit to the education of the farming community, the advisory service and the people who have worked with us over the last few years.</p> <p>The average size of a dairy farm in Ireland is 79 cows.  In west Cork the average size of a dairy farm is 79 cows and we have small creameries such as Barryroe, Lisavaird and Bandon.  They all produce the milk pool that produces the butter, milk and baby food formula, which becomes a part of the basket of products that we sell nationally and internationally.  I am proud to say that we do this to the best possible standards in the world.  I do not know that there is any country that can do what we do and at the standards that we achieve.  Today, we must acknowledge, and I am open to correction, that 94% of people choose to bottle feed.  If one chooses to do so then one must realise that bottle feeding is a substitute.  We are all very much aware that breast is best but the baby formula products that we produce are of the highest possible standard.  This House needs to acknowledge that fact during this debate.</p> <p>I am a father and my wife breastfed our first two children, which worked very well but when our twins came along breastfeeding them became a different issue.  We, as a family, tried to continue what we did with our first two children but we found that there were no supports in our community.  The nearest lactation consultant to us was 79 miles away in Schull and meant a round trip of 150 miles so that did not work.  To be perfectly honest, we found it a chore to locate breast pumps and everything associated with breastfeeding.  At the time we were a household that had four children under six years of age and trying to breastfeed our twin babies is something that my wife and I regret in many ways because it did not work.</p> <p>Sometimes breastfeeding does not work and when that happens then the appropriate services need to be available but I do not think they exist.  I mean that I do not think that there are lactation consultants available in communities.  Covid has not helped as it has prevented support groups and everyone else in the sector from meeting.  Support is needed to make sure that breastfeeding is done right, and particularly when multiple births occur.  My wife and I did not have the support to make sure we could breastfeed our twins.</p> <p>This debate must be about lactation and mother and baby groups meeting in communities and not in a hospital setting, which is where they are based at the moment.  We need multiple lactation consultants on the road in order to reach mothers and their families.  Otherwise the supports for the families who want to breastfeed their children are not going to be available and that is a core issue in our argument.</p> <p>When one considers what this Bill seeks to achieve in terms of tackling issues like gambling and sugary foods, I fundamentally think that having baby formula attached to this legislation does not make sense.  In many ways it does not sit well with me given the amount of work done to make sure that the products that are made available to parents who want to bottle feed have an appropriate level of security around them.  I think that baby formula does not fit with this legislation.  </p> <p>Some Senators mentioned price.  The cost of rearing a family is an immense issue and breastfeeding is advantageous in that regard.  However, when it comes to the multiple purchase of nappies and everything else that is required there is no discount given to anyone who has a baby under six months because that is how the supermarkets run things.  I clearly remember that the cost of buying nappies and everything else for twins was horrendous for the first six months.  Therefore, I contend that more supports must be provided to families, and in particular to families with multiple births.</p> <p>This legislation seeks to regulate what we are trying to do with online safety.  We need to be fair to everyone in society.  The Irish dairy industry is based in 79 rural locations throughout Ireland.  Whether it is places like Ballineen or Mitchelstown, they do an exceptionally good job but it is only a supplement.  If we want to change the narrative for breastfeeding then I urge the Government to put the supports in communities and give support to the families who want to breastfeed their children.  The majority of families want to breastfeed their children.  To say that people fall for online advertising misses the point.  I believe that people choose not to breastfeed because there are no supports in their community, which has been the experience of my family.</p> <p>Senator Pauline O'Reilly is right.  For the past six months this issue has been the topic of conversation both inside and outside the Seanad.  Not a week has gone by without this issue being discussed at my kitchen table because my wife and I have all of the angles.  I mean that there is my wife's view, my view and everyone else's view.  If we want to change things then putting something in this Bill about online promotion will change nothing.  It might change the prefix but the real change must come by what we do in communities so I suggest that we provide lactation consultants and groups who will meet people in halls.  I make that suggestion as in my family's case a lactation consultant was located 79 miles away so to reach that person one would have had to endure a 150 mile round-trip so it was not possible to continuing breastfeeding.</p></speech>

I welcome section 46N(5) as it refers to making provision to prohibit advertising "in respect of the general public health interests of children, in particular those foods or beverages which contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars".  Our amendment No. 123 seeks to ensure that we talk about all children and not just those who have digital access.</p> <p>I am conscious that I may not have enough time to respond to everything that was said by Senator Lombard.  I wish to state that I defend any family's right to decide what way they want to feed their newborn baby.  However, I believe restrictions need to be put in place to curtail the aggressive marketing tactics employed that are purely motivated by profit.</p> <p>In response to Senator Lombard, nobody has said anything about the quality of infant formula or said it is harmful.  We are saying that the marketing tactics employed by infant product companies are designed to undermine the choices made by families.  We know from the latest report by UNICEF and the WHO, which have done extensive research on this matter, that infant formula companies have designed marketing tactics that play on the anxieties of families.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Marie Sherlock:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=MarieSherlock&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Any of us in this House who has had a baby will know the anxieties in the early days, particularly if trying to breastfeed.

However, this amendment is about ensuring that there is a level playing field.  Public health messaging does not stand a chance if there is relentless marketing by infant formula companies.</p></speech>

I will take ten minutes and she will take six.</p><p>I thank the Minister for being here tonight for the motion.  I think it signals the seriousness of the subject matter we are discussing and, indeed, his interest in it.  I also welcome Luna Lara Liboni and Grace Tierney from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Daniel Holder, deputy director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, who are in the Visitors Gallery.</p><p>I would like to take the opportunity to thank colleagues from across the House for their support for tonight&rsquo;s Private Members' business.  I know all Members share the same deep concerns that I and many others have about the implications of the British Government&rsquo;s Nationality and Borders Act on life in Ireland.  A very important public message we are sending to the British Government tonight is that this Chamber will be united and implacably opposed to this regressive and harmful legislation.  This shows the scale of opposition to the Nationality and Borders Act here.</p><p>This Act will fundamentally damage the Good Friday Agreement, the economy of this country, South and North, and directly effect the lives of countless workers, families, students, healthcare professionals and people availing of healthcare, who at the moment move freely South to North and North to South on a daily basis to work and live their lives.  A refugee child or someone from outside Britain or Ireland who has made this place their home and plays for their local GAA club has to apply for a waiver if they want go up North to play a match, take part in a c&uacute;l camp or watch a championship game.  That is a level to which this legislation can negatively permeate throughout the lives of our communities.</p><p>It will potentially disrupt trade, tourism, education, healthcare and day-to-day life, especially for communities along the Border.  The broader motivations and intentions behind its Act are repugnant, anti-refugee and run contrary to any kind of progressive, inclusive and positive politics, which my colleagues and I, and I believe a majority of people in Ireland, would aspire to.</p><p>This Act is rooted in the British Government&rsquo;s Brexit decision.  It is a decision that caused chaos among the people of Britain and continues to cause serious collateral damage to the people of Ireland up to this day.  We have only to look at the refusal of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, to form an Executive in the North because of its attitude to the protocol, itself a consequence of Brexit, and a necessary consequence to protect the economies of this country and the EU.  The people of Ireland are being punished by the Nationality and Borders Act and the DUP's approach to the agreed protocol, both products of the decisions by the British Government.</p><p>One of the few but very important successes of our collective opposition to Brexit was to ensure there would be no hardening of Britain's border in Ireland.  That was achieved because the Irish Government and the majority of parties in the North's Executive were opposed to such a border.  Crucially, that opposition had the support of President Joe Biden&rsquo;s administration and EU member states.  The decision was not to have a hard border.  It was not conditional; it was unconditional.  There was to be no border of any kind - physical or electronic.  Now, on foot of the Nationality and Borders Act, which has been passed by Westminster, we are facing a hard border for some.  However, it will very quickly become, because of its broader ramifications, a hard border for each and every one of us.</p><p>We are facing the imposition of an electronic waiver for non-Irish and non-British citizens travelling throughout this country.  It will affect tourists from all over the world, especially those many tourists who visit us from North America.  In practice, this Act could require President Joe Biden, should he choose to lead a delegation on a visit to Ireland, which will be for many their ancestral and much loved family home place, to have an electronic waiver to travel North.  How absurd and offensive is that?  Let us consider someone such as Congressman Richard Neal, for example, a proud Irish American who we hope will address the Seanad later this month and who has been absolutely steadfast and abundantly clear in his opposition to any hardening of the border and the consequences such move would have.  Are we seriously telling someone like Richard Neal, who travelled here throughout 1980s when the conflict was at its height, that he will now, in 2022, need a waiver to move from one part of Ireland to another?  How do we think that will go down?  How did the British Government think that will go down?</p><p>This will also the rest of us who live here.  We may be related to those who travel daily across the Border or who are visiting here as tourists or as our families.  The peace process brought with it many benefits, in particular the right to freedom of movement unhindered across this country.  The British Act that we are debating tonight effectively ends that freedom of movement for non-Irish and non-British citizens.  In that regard, it is a direct assault on the Good Friday Agreement, the peace process and the political processes and institutions that emerged from it.  Quite frankly, it is total madness.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2477"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2477&amp;amp;pid=NiallODonnghaile&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->As Members here will know well, I am of the view that there should be no border in Ireland.  The sooner we get rid of it the better for us all - nationalist, unionist and everyone else.  The imposition of this electronic border serves the interests only of the British Government.  Its imposition reflects that government's indifference to and, indeed, disregard for the needs of the people of Ireland, our peace and political processes and our economy.  It is ushering in a hierarchy of rights where the British Government - not the Irish Government, the North's Executive or the people who live here - is the arbiter and decision-maker of how we will live our lives, how people who come here for a better way of life live their lives and how visitors from all over the world relax and enjoy Ireland's famous and world-renowned hospitality.  </p><p>I am sure that much like the Minister, I often wish someone, somewhere, in the British Government and its parliament would actually read the Good Friday Agreement, GFA.  Tourism Ireland is a cross-Border body set up under the auspices of the GFA.  It does a world-class job in promoting Ireland internationally.  It promotes Ireland, as the Minister and colleagues will know, as a single tourist destination and as one unit, where people can visit Kilmainham Gaol and the Guinness Storehouse on Monday and the Cliffs of Moher and the Ring of Kerry on Tuesday, before finally making their way to the James Connolly Visitor Centre, Titanic Belfast, the "Game of Thrones" exhibition, the Museum of Free Derry and the Somme Heritage Centre on another day and enjoy them unhindered, uninterrupted and unimpeded, as it should be.</p><p>The Act we are debating undermines all of that and significantly and flagrantly disrupts the positive and transformative work of a GFA body, namely, Tourism Ireland.  Today the North's tourism alliance provided a detailed assessment of the damage the Act will do to the tourism industry.  The assessment said the Act be "hugely detrimental to tourism on ... [this] island".  The report identified that of those who will have to apply for a waiver and pay for the privilege, some 60% spend nights in the North and the South and 13% spend one night in the North.  The tourism industry was not consulted at any stage in the legislation process for this Act, despite being key stakeholders.  It is typical.</p><p>In all of this, we need to remember that the tourism industry is on its knees as a result of the pandemic.  It cannot take the unwanted imposition of this so-called waiver.  Tourism Ireland's research has continuously confirmed that hassle and expense are key deterrents for travellers when choosing their holiday destination and, therefore, consumer perception on ease of travel is paramount.  In addition, should the electronic travel authorisation, ETA, be implemented in its current format, EU nationals who arrive in the South using an EU ID will not be able to enter the North as a passport is a prerequisite for the ETA.  This will be an additional cost should they decide to visit Ireland.  The report also estimates that &pound;130 million is at risk from the imposition of the ETA for people who live in the South and who are not Irish residents, but are legally resident due to EU membership, should they wish to travel north.</p><p>On an industry-wide level, Tourism Ireland estimates the introduction and associated ETA costs could be &pound;160 million and affect more than 500,000 visitors.  Derry, in particular, because of its Border proximity could be hit hard.  Key visitor attractions could also be hit.  It is obvious on any sensible rule of thumb that this Act should not have become law, should not be implemented and that the Irish Government should use its high standing and status in the international community to mobilise international opinion to convince the British Government to bin it.</p><p>I thank the Minister's officials through him, especially in the Irish embassy in London, who have worked tirelessly to highlight the implications of this Act.  I am deeply sorry that they and many of the rest of us have once again been ignored by the British system and its insular agenda in pursuing the Nationality and Borders Act.  I hope, as the motion calls on him to do, that the Minister will lead strongly in mobilising international pressure and opposition to ensure that Ireland and our people, workers, students, communities and valued visitors are all protected from the potential impact of this British Government legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2022-05-11a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2022051100002#FFF00200"><p>I am delighted to second the Private Members' motion on behalf the Sinn F&eacute;in group.  The rationale for Sinn F&eacute;in bringing this PMB has been outlined by Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.  The island of Ireland is once again an afterthought in the minds of the right-wing, anti-immigration Tory Party.  Brexit was driven by anti-immigration, little Englander politics and the people of the North and the impact it would have on the Good Friday Agreement were not given a second thought.  The people living in the Six Counties overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU but their democratic wishes were ignored.  Now, the Nationality and Borders Act will effectively mean an end to freedom of movement.  There is not a single person living on this island who will benefit from an electronic border.</p><p>Tonight we have an opportunity to send a loud, strong and united message to Westminster that we will not accept it, just as we did on the reimposition of a hard border on this island post Brexit.  It was through our collective actions that we ensured that the EU and the US stood solidly with Ireland and made it clear to the British Government that a hard border or any threat to the Good Friday Agreement was a non-runner and would not be tolerated.  However, the Nationality and Borders Act will either mean racial and ethnic profiling or a hard border for all.  How else does the British Government intend to be able to identify who is Irish or who is a British citizen?</p><p>We have heard about some of the impacts such a Act could have on the likes of sports and tourism, but it will also have an impact on non-Irish or British citizens who work for all-Ireland bodies such as Waterways Ireland or <i>Safe</i>food.  How will those workers be expected to go about their business?  Will they be expected to apply for an ETA?  What about a non-Irish student living in County Donegal who wants to go to college on the Magee campus of Ulster University?  How much will that student be expected to pay for an electronic waiver?</p><p>The implications for the tourism industry as have been outlined are also considerable.  Day trips are regularly organised to the Titanic Quarter and the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; locations.  Will they now have to incur an extra cost?  We know that tourist agencies will just opt to go to other sights rather than going north at all.</p><p>Likewise there could be implications for research.  Only a couple of months ago, 62 all-Ireland collaborative research programmes between academics and institutions were announced.  Among the projects that were awarded funding was a collaboration between University College Dublin, UCD, and Queens University Belfast to examine the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.  Will international academics who work in UCD be expected to apply for the electronic waiver?</p><p>The reality is that we do not know the answers to these questions because we do not know how much the costs are or how long the waiver will be valid.  The ETA is unwanted and the British Government should be told, loud and clear, that it can stick it.  The island of Ireland will not tolerate any imposition of a border on the island and will not tolerate a racist, right-wing government in Britain passing laws without an iota of thought or concern for how it will be implemented or will impact on this island.</p><p>While much of the focus of this debate will of course rightly focus on the implications of this Act on our island, I express my solidarity with those progressive voices in Britain who are also trying to fight this Act because of the other deeply racist elements that are contained within it such as the two-tier system of refugees, the offshoring of migration and sending refugees to Rwanda.  The people of Britain are better than that.  They are better than the Tory government.  I sincerely hope that those progressive voices in Britain will prevail.  Tonight, at least the representatives of Seanad &Eacute;ireann can speak with one voice to say not here, not on this island.</p></speech>

The Act's provisions for an ETA scheme raise a number of serious concerns and merit further political consideration in the Seanad.  The Government will not oppose this motion as it raises concerns that we share, but it does not reflect a number of important developments since it was first tabled that need to be taken into account.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I am pleased to be able to address those issues here with Members today.</p><p>I will first discuss the ETA scheme.  The British Government's Nationality and Borders Act provides that the UK's immigration rules may require that non-Irish and non-British citizens obtain an ETA before travelling to the UK, including for journeys across the land Border with Northern Ireland.  The British Government has stated that there will continue to be no immigration checks on the land Border.  However, the introduction of an ETA scheme for cross-Border journeys could cause considerable disruption to the lives and livelihoods of many people across the island.  This is a matter of serious concern for the Government and I can ensure Members that we have let our views be known in London.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people cross the Border every day in the course of their ordinary lives, including to access essential services, for business, for family reasons, or for travel from one part of Ireland to another.  It is a uniquely shared space.  This is something that both the Irish and British Governments recognised and committed to supporting in strand two of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>From an early stage, the Government engaged with the British Government at both official and political level to highlight the complexities such an ETA scheme presents in the context of Northern Ireland and the serious implications it would have for daily lives and livelihoods on the island.  Late last year and again in January this year, our ambassador in London wrote to the British Home Office outlining our concerns and the significant impacts the proposed scheme would have.  I wrote to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in February and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, met the Minister, Kevin Foster, later that month in London to address directly the challenges regarding the UK's ETA proposals.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, also wrote to her British counterpart, the British Home Secretary.</p><p>At the British&ndash;Irish Intergovernmental Conference, BIIGC, in March, I raised the ETA proposals once again with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The Government has continued to engage closely with the British Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office on the ETA proposals.  In statements made on 20 April, the UK Minister for Safe and Legal Migration, Kevin Foster, acknowledged the potential impact of ETA requirements on the day-to-day lives of those who cross the Border on a regular basis and expressed willingness to have a "detailed and constructive" engagement with the Irish Government on this issue.  While the UK's draft UK Nationality and Borders Bill received royal assent in the UK and became an Act of Parliament on 28 April, this does not mean that the arrangements for the proposed ETA scheme are finalised as a number of things can be done by way of exemptions through secondary legislation.  The Government will continue to engage at both official and political level with our British Government counterparts to encourage the British Government to reconsider its approach and to apply exemptions to their ETA proposals.  </p><p>The kinds of exemptions on which we are getting traction are that all residents in Ireland would not have to apply for an ETA and would, in other words, benefit from an exemption.  That does not, of course, deal with tourists who are visiting or people who are here temporarily who would normally, in many instances, travel into an airport like Dublin, hire a car, travel to Belfast for a day, and go across to Donegal.  Movement around the island as a whole is something that many of our visitors just take for granted and this will be a completely unnecessary disruption to that movement.  </p><p>I believe it will be Northern Ireland that will suffer the most in the context of the impact it will have on all-island tourism, if I can put it that way.  We market this island on an all-island basis from a tourism perspective and there are many fascinating reasons to visit Northern Ireland.  While people will still continue to visit Northern Ireland, there will be more disruption involved, potentially, in doing that and more cost.  If one looks at how the tourism industry works with bookings, travel companies, and so on, a reduction of cost is an issue and that this is going to disadvantage Northern Ireland in a way that is completely unnecessary.  </p><p>We will continue to work with the British Government to try to win those arguments but the main focus in the short term will be to ensure that people who are resident south of the Border are not required to apply for an ETA and to have that cost and disruption in their day-to-day lives.  None of this, to be honest, is good.  It is not justifiable from a security point of view but it is, unfortunately, something where sensible amendments were rejected.  These were the amendments which came initially from the House of Lords and this Bill is now passed and is an Act.  We are now, therefore, relying on secondary legislation but we will work as closely as we can with the British Government to try to get that accommodation.</p><p>This is an opportunity for me to update this House on the Northern Ireland institutions and on some of the other issues that are going on.  The distinct challenges presented by the ETA to Northern Ireland, underline the importance of Northern Irish voices being heard.  This is best done through the devolved institutions in Stormont.  Following last week's Assembly elections, we are now in a period of Executive formation.  The challenges that we face are too great for Northern Ireland to be left without a strong voice and with a functioning Executive and Assembly.  This is what the people of Northern Ireland both expect, deserve and voted for.  It is for the parties now to come together to establish an Executive that can deliver for all of the people of Northern Ireland.</p><p>Earlier today I met senior figures in Sinn F&eacute;in, the UUP, the SDLP, and the Alliance Party.  I have also spoken in some detail with Jeffrey Donaldson as leader of the DUP, separately, in a phone call.  In each discussion, I emphasised the importance the Irish Government attaches to the quick formation of an Executive.  One of the things that I have learned in the context of the politics in Northern Ireland is that things do not get any easier over time.</p><p>I want to give my word to the House that whatever challenges we will face in the period ahead, I will continue to work in support of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and in preserving and building upon the successes of the peace process.  We have to remind ourselves sometimes here of the success of almost 25 years of an extraordinary peace process on this island that has delivered, by and large, an imperfect peace but, nevertheless, a peace and prosperity on the back of that which many people simply thought was impossible before it was done.  Many other countries in the world use what Ireland has achieved as a template to inspire their own political decisions.  We have, therefore, a challenge to protect the institutions of that peace agreement from political pressures and disruption, some of which have been linked to Brexit and others which have been linked to other issues.  There are landing grounds in respect of the need there is for compromise and policy that can allow us to do that.   I will certainly be focusing on that in the days and weeks ahead.</p><p>On the issue of legacy, peace in Northern Ireland has been hard won.  The Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent implementing agreements require difficult compromises from all sides.  These were made on the understanding that all sides would adhere to the agreements reached.  In 2014 the political parties, the British Government, and the Irish Government together signed the Stormont House Agreement, which put in place a framework to address the painful legacy of the past.  The UUP was the only party in Northern Ireland which did not sign up to that agreement and it gave an explanation as to why.  At Westminster, yesterday, the UK Government stated that it will prioritise the introduction of legislation that departs significantly from what we agreed together.</p><p>First and foremost, it is important to give a clear and strong message to victims and families, many of whom I know are worried by yesterday's announcements on legacy.  I heard that view expressed again today in Belfast.  We will continue to work to ensure that the legitimate needs of victims and survivors are at the heart of any legacy process.  We have not seen a formal or detailed proposal from the British Government at this stage and so cannot give a comprehensive response at this juncture.  Once that has been shared with us, I am sure we will have a detailed and broad range of questions.  Beyond those questions, however, there is a broader question of process.  As we have consistently said, it is essential that both Governments and the political parties have real and considered discussion on any way forward on this deeply sensitive issue that still impacts many families deeply  in Northern Ireland.  Victims and families must, crucially, be brought into the consideration of any way forward.  Unilateral action is not the way forward and will make matters worse, not better.</p><p>On the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland, this is the mutually agreed solution to address the challenges faced by Northern Ireland following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.  It is the result of four years of negotiations between the EU and this British Government, which involved compromises on all sides and was designed and agreed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process.  We have consistently sought to engage with the perspectives of everyone in Northern Ireland in regard to the protocol, including those in the unionist community.  Again, we had very good discussions today with Doug Beattie and the UUP on the legitimate concerns they have in the context of how the protocol could or should be implemented.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=33&amp;amp;MemberID=250"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Vice-President, Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, and the Commission have done likewise and will continue to do so.  We have never dismissed genuinely held concerns around the protocol and the Commission made proposals that directly address many of those concerns as late as October last.</p><p>It is clear that the protocol is broadly supported by people and businesses in Northern Ireland, with the majority of MLAs recently elected supportive of the protocol.  Some 53 of the 90 MLAs who have just been elected, if asked to vote tomorrow, would vote in favour of maintaining the protocol.  That is just under 60% support.  This corresponds with the clear message that I have heard first hand, including from the business groups I met this afternoon in Belfast.  They want the protocol to work and to take advantage of the opportunities it presents.  It presents significant economic advantages.  We have seen that in the past year.  Despite all the political wrangling, uncertainty and instability around the protocol, foreign direct investment and investment more generally in Northern Ireland on the back of the protocol has seen positive growth - the strongest economic growth anywhere in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Our message for the British Government is clear.  Partnership and consultation are the only credible way forward.  Obligations under international agreements must be performed in good faith.  This is the very basis of the international legal order.  The EU stands ready to talk to the UK at any time and remains fully committed to working jointly with the UK to bring long-term legal certainty and predictability to Northern Ireland.  The voices of the people of Northern Ireland need to be heard through their democratically elected representatives on these issues and more.  The Government will continue to work to support the implementation of, and the institutions of, the Good Friday Agreement, and all subsequent implementing agreements.</p><p>My visit today was the first in a while to Northern Ireland but I suspect I will be travelling across the Border many, many times over the coming weeks and months as we work with all parties as both Governments, and with the European Commission, to find solutions to outstanding problems so that we can support the stability, the predictability and the improved relations that are needed to ensure that the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement can deliver what they were designed to deliver.</p></speech>

He has had a very busy day already but it is welcome to see him here to discuss this very important issue for our nation.</p> <p>I would like also to add my congratulations to the Sinn F&eacute;in Party on its election results in Northern Ireland, and similarly to the DUP and the Alliance Party which had very successful elections, but also offer commiserations to the UUP and the SDLP which did not have elections that they would have liked.  That is how elections go.  They have a job at hand.  They all have a mandate to deliver an Assembly and to make governance work in Northern Ireland for the people who they are elected to represent.  I wish everyone well in that regard.</p> <p>The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will not be opposing this motion.  The Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion raises some serious concerns which we as a party share in relation to the provision for an electronic travel authorisation scheme in the UK Government's new Nationality and Borders Act.  However, the difficulty I have with the motion is it is somewhat out of date and does not take into account some important recent developments.  We will not get into the difficulties.  The general theme behind it is right but the wording in parts of it could have been somewhat different.</p> <p>Those recent developments include engagement on this issue by the Government at both political and official level, by the Minister here who has been working on this for many years, with the Home Office and the Northern Ireland Office.  It has not taken into account statements by the Home Office on the matter on 20 April and the fact that the Act received royal assent on 20 April.</p> <p>Where the Act still provides for the electronic travel authorisation, ETA, provision which would apply to non-Irish and non-British citizens travelling from the South into Northern Ireland, the Irish Government has received positive indications, as the Minister has outlined, from the Home Office through the Minister, Mr. Kevin Foster, that further discussions can take place in the context of developing secondary legislation and possible exemptions.  It is critically important that we keep up that pressure that now exists on the authorities to try to create that secondary legislation that will look at dealing with exemptions that will lead with the Irish position.</p> <p>I am just after leaving our own parliamentary party meeting where the Taoiseach was updating us on how he, too, has had negotiations with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Boris Johnson, even as late as yesterday on this and many other issues.  I am pleased that the Government is very much hands-on in relation to the ETA and also issues such as the protocol and the putting together of a new Executive in Northern Ireland.  These are critically important issues to ensure proper governance and the day-to-day workings in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The Minister mentioned the protocol.  It galls me from day to day to hear UK Ministers and Boris Johnson referring to the EU's unwillingness to move on the protocol.  The Minister referenced October.  Last year one of the big issues was medicines and through the Minister's negotiations, that and other issues have been resolved.  Therefore, we must constantly knock the narrative that the EU is not willing to create the conditions of change.  It is actually the opposite to what the British Government is saying; it is their unwillingness to engage.</p> <p>We need proper engagement from the UK Government.  We need proper engagement from Boris Johnson's Government.  This playing with words must stop.  It is not helpful.  It is not serving anybody's purpose.  We need proper engagement whereby the British Government is willing to come and look at these issues with a view to resolving them but also with an approach where there is give and take.  That has not happened heretofore.  We are asking and pushing that they do that.</p> <p>I wish the Minister well in his engagements over the next few weeks where he endeavours to put the Executive together.  I hope that Friday is a successful day because it is really important for all of this island that there is a Government working in Northern Ireland.  Issues of the day that affect us on a North-South basis can then be dealt with.  Whether it be infrastructure, health or whatever, it is really important.  I wish the Minister well.</p></speech>

I support its spirit.  I am aware things have moved on.</p> <p>I thank the Minister for outlining the updates, not only regarding the UK Borders and Nationalities Act but also recent developments around the protocol, the election and legacy.</p> <p>The imposition of an electronic travel authorisation scheme on non-Irish and non-British citizens entering Northern Ireland across the Border is entirely out of touch with the practicalities and sensitivities of life on this island.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Emer Currie:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=EmerCurrie&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Unfortunately, it reflects a lack of awareness and a willingness to work with us on the practicalities and sensitivities of life on the island.  It affects cross-Border workers, education, access to everyday services, essential healthcare, economic drivers such as tourism and of course our integrated supply chains.  It brings more questions than answers in terms of the information that we have.  It disrupts day-to-day family life.  I want to acknowledge the people here who have travelled this evening to hear the motion.  Fifty years on since joining the EU, Ireland is home to citizens of all EU countries and beyond.  According to the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance, NITA, 9% of the population are legally resident but are not Irish or British citizens.  This will have a huge impact on those people.  We are already dealing with the fallout of Northern Ireland, as part of the UK, leaving the EU; the logistical impact that is having on the movement of goods and the integrity of the Single Market; and the threat of a hard border.  Now we are dealing with visa requirements through an electronic authorisation on non-Irish and non-British citizens who need and want to cross the Border just to live their lives or earn their livelihoods.  The biggest emotional issue is that it reimposes a border.  It imposes barriers where we have had fluidity.  It reinforces difference when we have worked so hard to build cohesion.  It takes us backwards into the language of the past.  The psychological and administrative barrier through this electronic authorisation is incredibly damaging.  It undermines all-island projects.  For example, the work we do on healthcare is undermined by this, as is tourism and our cross-Border bodies such as Waterways Ireland and Tourism Ireland.  I worked in tourism for years, in marketing for F&aacute;ilte Ireland, which worked for Tourism Ireland.  I know the efforts that go into creating a marketing campaign that targets the entire island.  About &euro;1 billion has been spent on doing that.  Now this undermines that work.</p><p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw how confusing it was to have two sets of guidelines for Covid-19 on the island.  People were coming into and out of different airports and wondering what guidelines applied to them.  This is another example of more disruption and more difference.  It would be very difficult for tourism to operate within that environment, especially coming out of Covid-19 when tourism has taken such a beating.  How do we tell people they need authorisation to cross something that is not there and that we have put all our efforts into ensuring that it is not there?  I found the NITA briefing very helpful.  The &pound;1 billion tourism industry in the North is under threat from this.  Questions arise such as whether there will be single-entry or will people require multiple-entry whenever we have 300 crossings; the costs that will be attached; the issues already mentioned in regard to the EU identity card and the fact that a passport is needed for this and all the non-Irish EU nationals working in tourism.  We know, and it was said in the brief, that hassle and expense are key deterrents when people choose a holiday destination.  Ireland as a whole will be impacted by this, when people are planning trips, never mind their fears about whether there is a threat of prosecution if they are not seen to be co-operating.  These are all things that will play on people&rsquo;s minds.  Research by NITA reports that 25% of people from outside the common travel area would see it as a barrier to travelling north.  When combined with the home holiday market, with the exception of residents who should be all right, that would be a combined impact of 15%.  Derry and the north-west and Donegal would be severely impacted by this.  I welcome the exemptions for which the Minister has been working hard.  We need to work towards an exemption for tourism as well.  I know that NITA has put forward one suggestion that the ETA could be introduced when people are arriving by boat or through the airports but not on the island of Ireland.  Those are things to consider.  I am aware of everything the Minister has been doing.  I want to thank Margaret Ritchie in the House of Lords who put forward the original amendment and of course such people as Stephen Farry, Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna, who are raising this issue in the House of Commons.  </p></speech>

In a previous life, I worked on the hard Border in the early 1990s prior to the ceasefires in armed support operations for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As a young man from Dublin with no experience of living along the Border, it was immediately apparent to me that any border on this island makes no sense for socioeconomic or cultural reasons and even from a narrow military or security perspective it made no sense.  The permanent vehicle checkpoint between Newry and Dundalk was a massive eyesore on the landscape.  It had a huge environmental impact and physical presence.  Who was going to drive into that checkpoint carrying weapons or ammunition?  It was purely a target.  It served no purpose whatsoever except to send a political and symbolic message that &ldquo;You are garrisoned, you are controlled&rdquo;.  This ETA system reminds me of that.  It is a virtual border that serves no purpose whatsoever except to inhibit freedom of movement, which is a fundamental right in the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  It would frustrate economic and cultural activity as set out by the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators.  We are a country that prides itself on its digital economy and our digital future which requires an international, highly mobile, highly qualified workforce.  Everything about this ETA waiver would serve to have a chilling effect on that and on tourism, that is obvious.  In fact I would describe it as a self-inflicted injury on the part of the British establishment.</p><p>In the mid-2000s as <i>The</i><i>Irish Times</i>security analyst I was on one of the last British army patrols that came out of Bessbrook Mill and went on patrol along the Border area there.  Then Brigadier-General Wayne Harper who accompanied me on that last patrol said to me that the dismantling of the observation post and listening posts along the Border was most welcomed by two groups in south Armagh, namely, Sinn F&eacute;in and the British army.  One of the most austere and conservative elements of the British establishment saw no value whatsoever in a hard border or any of its physical infrastructure.  Similarly, they would be appalled I imagine by the imposition of this virtual or digital border.  That raises other questions, such as who would have the burden of enforcing this?  Would it be the PSNI?  Would it be the UK Border Agency?<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Tom Clonan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=TomClonan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Imposing such an administrative burden on them, when they have enough to deal with in trying to promote community policing, would set back the aims of community policing and bring out unfortunate rhetoric and issues around identity that we had hoped belonged in the past.  It is a completely retrograde step.  Also, I wonder about anybody who accidentally, intentionally or inadvertently might find himself or herself in breach of the ETA.  Would that raise a marker, a question or a cause for concern on his or her travel in other jurisdictions?  There are all sorts of anticipated and unanticipated outcomes, but this seems to me to be a completely senseless provision.</p><p>Again, I thank my Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues for proposing the motion.  I fully support it as an Independent Senator.  I also thank the Minister for all the heavy lifting that will be undertaken in the coming weeks and months, particularly after the extraordinary outcome over the weekend.  I congratulate Sinn F&eacute;in and all the other parties that experienced gains in their seat numbers.</p><p>We have a really challenging task ahead of us.  I think it was reported today that it is not yet clear whether the British Government will act in partnership to resolve some of the challenges that lie ahead, but something such as this is emblematic.  It is a retrograde step.  Let us, therefore, hope we will be able to persuade the British Government to see reason and to move forward in step with us.</p></speech>

I commend the Sinn F&eacute;in team of Senators on having tabled the motion.  It will, of course, see full support from the Green Party-An Comhaontas Glas, and I am glad to see that the House is speaking with one voice and that no one will oppose it.</p> <p>Earlier today I had the pleasure of meeting a delegation which included Dr. Joanne Stuart, OBE, of the Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance.  Its mission statement is "one voice for tourism".  I got Dr. Stuart's business card.  We are speaking as one voice tonight.</p> <p>I recently had occasion to visit Northern Ireland to travel to a funeral.  The cort&egrave;ge made its short way on foot from Killynoogan, County Fermanagh.  The remains were received in Pettigo.  I, therefore, walked through the two jurisdictions on foot.  It was a stark reminder of how absurd the Border is.  It also reminded me of how horrific it was for quality of life when a close-knit community suddenly had to go into a different jurisdiction, in an often hostile policed environment, to shop, to socialise, to work and to worship.  It was just incredible.</p> <p>I congratulate Sinn F&eacute;in and others who did well in the election.  I am disappointed, obviously, for our two wonderful Green former MLAs, Rachel Woods and Clare Bailey, but hopefully their time will come again.  It occurred to me that in the Brexit referendum a majority in Northern Ireland voted against Brexit.  As the Minister said, a safe majority of MLAs are against Brexit.  Sorcha Eastwood was victorious for the Alliance Party in Lagan Valley.  I watched her being interviewed after she was elected and she said the protocol and Brexit came up on two doorsteps in all her canvassing.  For the Greens who went up to Northern Ireland to help our fellow party members, it came up on no doorsteps.  There is something missing there.</p> <p>According to Dr. Joanne Stuart, this provision will create financial havoc in the North of this beautiful isle.  No one will be immune from being financially burnt by this.  Therefore, the people who are proposing this or who are not actively trying to support a lifting of the ETA will include in this dreadful unintended consequence their own people - all people, but including unionists.  They are not immune to this.  It reminds me that there has to be a better way forward.  Northern Ireland is in a unique situation in that it can inhabit three universes: it can have full access to the British market; it can have full access to the EU market - and, of course, due to the Good Friday Agreement, Northern Irish people are entitled to become citizens of Ireland and European citizens; and it has unfettered access to the Republic of Ireland.  That is a new Northern Ireland that people have not fully grasped yet, and this would be a retrograde step to introduce to the ETA.  It is a Northern Ireland that can have a future spanning a continent and yet not lose its home, but that has not yet become clear to unionism.</p> <p>It did become abundantly clear to the person whose funeral I attended, namely, the late Canon Pat McHugh, who, in 2017, when his church in Castleblayney had to undergo significant renovations, and when his flock, his congregation, had nowhere to pray, the nearby Church of Ireland rector, Neal Phair, opened up his church to the Catholic congregation.  One might think that that is normal, but it was not and is not yet on this island, but he was ahead of his time.  There was hope in that regard.  For several months there were christenings, funerals and masses for Catholics in the local Church of Ireland.  We need more of that togetherness.  At one stage, Canon Pat McHugh, in pre-Good Friday Agreement times, had to assert his fundamental civil rights with just cause when the RUC was around.  It was heartening at the funeral cort&egrave;ge that a member of the successor to the Royal Ulster Constabulary was directing traffic on the way into the funeral.  I approached the officer and said it was good to see him there.  The police officer said things were much better now but that we still have a long way to go.  He said he lived very close to the late Pat McHugh's family.</p> <p>I would love to see more of that, but unionism must stand up and change or it will be left behind.  It is an important part of the fabric of our history.  The future for Northern Ireland is an exciting one.  It is encapsulated in how Andrew Trimble, the rugby player, identifies unionism, how Rory McIlroy, perhaps, identifies Northern Ireland, and how Barry McGuigan of yesteryear had an understanding of mutual respect.  Let us start with tolerance, but let us move on to embracing and celebrating difference.</p></speech>

I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Senators for tabling the motion.  Yet again we face a situation where our neighbours and their virtue-signalling towards the little Englanders on their own island have impacted our island in ways they cannot understand because they simply do not care.  They are imposing on people who live and work here, who love here and who travel over the Border but who may not be citizens of their country.  It just shows how they think.  They thought the proposal would be okay because they did not include Irish citizens in it, showing a complete lack of understanding of what a 21st century Ireland looks like and how it operates.  That imposes a border on the island of Ireland and hinders the free movement of people.  Members have spoken about how we market ourselves on an all-island basis when it comes to tourism and how that is important for our economy and our people.</p> <p>It is also important, as Senator Boylan said, that we think about what the Nationality and Borders Act does and what it is.  It is one of the most shameful actions a government has taken, undermining as it does well-established international rights for those who are fleeing war and persecution.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Rebecca Moynihan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=RebeccaMoynihan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> The spin by the British Government to the effect that it is disrupting the business model of smugglers is disgraceful.  It was a dark day when the House of Commons passed that legislation.  I commend people like Alf Dubs, a hero of mine who fled Czechoslovakia as a young man, arrived on Britain's shores, built a life and became a Member of Parliament.  For his whole life, he has advocated on behalf of children in the same situation and child refugees.  I commend the work that he and others like him did and the reasonable amendments they submitted to try to block that legislation.</p><p>War has returned to Europe's borders.  We need a co-ordinated humanitarian response at an EU level and on this island.  The UK is the outlier in its response to refugees.  The proposal to send refugees to be processed in Rwanda sickens me to my stomach, but that is what the UK and its Government are doing.  History will judge them for what they are doing.  This will impact on us and on our island, but is designed to target the most vulnerable people at the most vulnerable time of their lives.  UK Government members should hang their heads in shame in the context of the UK Nationality and Borders Act 2022.</p></speech>

It is heartening to see the Seanad united on this issue.</p> <p>I will reflect on the broader impact of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 before dealing with the Border issue.  The Act does five things: it allows, as others have said, asylum seekers to be sent to Rwanda; it allows the British Home Secretary to strip citizens of their citizenship without warning; it allows asylum seekers to be criminalised; it allows people who arrive across the English Channel to be treated more harshly; and it ensures that protections against modern slavery are undermined.  I will use a word I have not used in the six years I have been in this House.  This is truly wicked legislation.  There is no other way to describe it.</p> <p>I agree with Senator Boylan.  I believe the British people are better than this.  When I was at the Council of Europe at the migration committee a couple of weeks back, there were British representatives present.  They included the peer, Leslie Griffiths, who spoke openly of his horror at the legislation being passed.  He was not the only one.  It is clear many people were upset about this Act being passed.  Unfortunately, there were also overtones of xenophobia from some of the British Conservative members we met during that week at the human rights body.</p> <p>As to why this legislation was brought forward, I am reminded of a song written in the 1970s called "Nothing but the Same Old Story", in which the songwriter referred to trying to drown out the sound of the crumbling foundations.  That is what is happening.  The extreme right-wing UK Government is trying to drown out the disaster it has created for itself with Brexit, and its actions are having dreadful consequences for human rights.  I did not ever expect to see legislation like this passed in Britain.</p> <p>On the Border issue, it is the height of economic insanity.  I had the pleasure of meeting a group of about 30 students from the Kelley School of Business in Indiana this morning.  They were heading up to the North later on.   In two years' time, if this Act is implemented, that will not be happening.  They will still come to visit us but will not travel to the North.  The impact of this on tourism in the North will be cataclysmic.  I am glad to hear Tourism Ireland was here today, and it is important that we speak with one voice about this. </p> <p>It is a trend with the British Conservative Party - and, unfortunately, some unionist colleagues - that, regardless of economic consequences, it seems hell-bent on carrying on to the detriment of everyone's future.  Let us talk about some examples.  After this legislation becomes law, a taxi driver who brings a family of Americans across the Border and realises that they have not applied for an ETA could be subject to a &euro;2,000 fine for each passenger if stopped by the police for any reason.  For someone who lives in Donegal, wants to go shopping in Derry and on the way witnesses a crime, if they talk to the police and their identity is checked, they could face serious consequences if they do not have an ETA.  This has not been thought out properly.  Will coach tours continue to cross the Border to the Six Counties?  It is highly unlikely in many cases.</p> <p>It is vital that the Irish Government and the EU engage with the British Government to ensure that this legislation is reversed in order that there will be no return to a hard border, electronic or otherwise, for anyone living in Ireland.  James Connolly famously said that partition would bring a carnival of reaction, North and South.  Unfortunately, 100 years later we are still seeing that carnival bell being rung by the British Tory Government.  It is important that all of us unite on this and make a vow across the Chamber to insist that this wicked legislation be dropped.</p></speech>

It goes without saying that there can be no electronic border, just as there can be no hard border, on the island.  As the Minister said, it is unnecessary, unjustifiable and inconsiderate of our island of workers, families, tourists and students.  Thankfully, the Seanad is united in one voice and on the same page.  I thank Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile for bringing forward the motion on behalf of the team and I thank all the parties for supporting it.  It calls on the Government to mobilise international and diplomatic influence to effect change.  Will the Minister address that?  Is that happening in terms of the development of secondary legislation or with the legislation?  Are we mobilising international opinion?</p> <p>On the tourism industry, Senator Carrigy was here.  We sit on the joint Oireachtas committee on tourism.  It will be something for us to look at but for the tourism industry not to even be consulted as a key stakeholder is incredible.  Senator Currie mentioned the hassle and expense that will face tourists.  For those of us lucky enough to travel abroad during Covid we know about the hassle, bureaucracy and stress associated with the pandemic, necessary as it was.  This Nationality and Borders Act fundamentally affects the Good Friday Agreement so it is all the more important that we mount a united challenge, as my colleague has said.</p></speech>

The Minister is welcome to the House.  As a member of Fianna F&aacute;il, I can say we are proud of our role in the history of the State, especially of our involvement in the negotiation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I again offer my gratitude to former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, for his tireless work on that agreement.  At a time of huge personal difficulty and loss for him, he put the peace and prosperity of the island first.  I acknowledge the voices of women that were hugely important to that agreement, particularly Liz O'Donnell, Pearl Sagar, Monica McWilliams, Mo Mowlam and all the women who encouraged their men to take the step.  I remember being incredibly struck at the site of the Battle of the Boyne in Oldbridge listening to Baroness Eileen Paisley speaking about the importance of peace and of the generations that had been handed the gift of peace to work on.  She spoke of the role women played in the background encouraging and supporting those on every side of the political divide to take this step.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Fiona O'Loughlin:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=2441"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=2441&amp;amp;pid=FionaOLoughlin&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We fully support the Good Friday Agreement in its absolute entirety.  Since the conclusion of the agreement in 1998, the Irish State, regardless of political leadership, has defended and supported the continuing peace we have seen on the island.</p><p>We have seen huge advancements on both sides of the Border, socially, politically and economically.  There is no doubt the Good Friday Agreement has played a key role in this regard.  All we have to do is go to Belfast and see the prosperity.  I was speaking to a lady from Northern Ireland who works for the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.  She went to Queens University and spoke about the difference she sees now.  It is a completely different city.  The agreement is not perfect but it is the best we have.  It is all we have.  We have to make sure it works for all of the people of the island of Ireland.</p><p>I take this opportunity to congratulate all of the MLAs elected to Stormont last week.  I was disappointed that good, strong leaders such as Nichola Mallon and Clare Bailey were not re-elected, but these are the vagaries of politics.  I acknowledge the achievements of Sinn F&eacute;in in the election and I wish it well.  We may not be cut from the same cloth but as a proud republican I am pleased to see a nationalist majority elected to the assembly.  As chair of the Oireachtas women's caucus and a steadfast advocate of increased female participation in politics, I congratulate Northern Ireland's next First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, on her historic election.  I also congratulate Naomi Long and the Alliance Party.  What it achieved was incredible.  It shows that there is a need and desire for another way and that people want to get on with their lives.  For themselves and their families, they want to see a progressive and prosperous community with no conflict.</p><p>Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, the institutions in Northern Ireland can deliver for the people there.  We all look forward to engaging with MLAs from across the political spectrum in the term ahead.  If I may, I take this opportunity to call on Jeffrey Donaldson in particular to do what he and his colleagues in the DUP were elected to do, which is to govern, make decisions, sign up to what they agreed in the Good Friday Agreement and get to work for the citizens in the North.  Democracy must prevail over political posturing.</p><p>With regard to the specifics of the motion, a number of weeks ago, I raised on the Order of Business the ridiculous proposal of an imposition of an electronic travel waiver for non-Irish and non-British citizens going from the South to the North of Ireland.  I said then what I will reiterate now.  This is a nonsensical and unnecessary step by the United Kingdom.  There is absolutely no need to go down this route.  What is the purpose of it?  What is trying to achieve?  Will it make the Border a more secure place for citizens of either jurisdiction?  I do not believe so.  Will it benefit either side in any way?  I do not believe so.  It is completely and utterly unnecessary.  We need to protect the peace and prosperity for which we have fought for many years.  We need to ensure we maintain a frictionless border on this island.  Anything less is unacceptable.</p><p>I welcome the strong position of the Irish diplomatic corps on this issue.  I welcome the strong position the Minister is taking.  I appeal to him to hold the line on this.  We need to maintain openness and accessibility for workers, families and businesses.  While the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 received royal assent in the UK on 28 April, how it will actually be implemented still needs to be set out.  We must continue to work to encourage the British Government to apply exceptions to its ETA scheme.  A core commitment in the programme for Government is to strengthen bilateral relations with the UK.  If introduced as proposed, the scheme would create many challenges in the relationship.  Our objective must be to work in partnership with our closest neighbour to address these challenges and further deepen our relationship.</p></speech>

It will have the unanimous support of the House.  It is important that this should be so.  It would be a mistake to introduce it if it resulted in anything different.  I also congratulate Sinn F&eacute;in on its election results last week.  I recognise the achievement of the Alliance Party also.  That sends its own message.  Congratulations are in order in both cases.</p> <p>I welcome my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  If he brings the same determination and competency to the issue of the ETA and the remaining negotiations on the protocol to set up the Executive that he brought to the Brexit question we can be confident.  I know he is determined to do this.  I respect the fact, and it should be acknowledged, that he is up and running and at it already today.  He could not be at it any quicker because it is just after the count.  It is important, and I recognise that.</p> <p>It is a crazy concept that we would have the return of a virtual and electronic border.  If it were to be implemented in its original form it would greatly disrupt trade, normal life, education, healthcare and social interactions such as inter-family ties.  It would hugely threaten tourism.  It is an absurd situation.  It is contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is contrary to logic and common sense.  It is very important that it is vigorously opposed.  It is very important that the Minister continues to do this.  What everyone in the House is trying to say is that we want vigorous opposition to it to continue as the Minister tries to negotiate amendments to it.  It is important to recognise the Minister has already raised it with the Secretary of State at the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is also important to recognise that the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, has raised it with her counterparts and that the embassy and the diplomatic corps are working on it.  This is all positive and has to continue.</p> <p>An interesting statistic came up during Senator Currie's contribution.  She stated surveys have suggested that 25% of potential tourists or people outside would see it as a barrier.  These are people who would not come because of it.  We can find it in reality.  If, as the Minister stated, people come to Dublin to travel around and they see a difficulty with the North, they will go on to Donegal, down the western seaboard or elsewhere.  They will not put themselves through this process and hardship.  It will be a disincentive from the word go.  If they do go to Northern Ireland, they will not come south.  They will stay around the Giant's Causeway and the Titanic Quarter, but they will not come down south in these conditions.  What is proposed has huge implications.  As the Minister said, we are marketing the country as an all-island tourism entity.  To put this at risk is shocking.</p> <p>This is an area in respect of which we could have had, should have and, I hope, can continue to have co-operation.  It is an area of obvious co-operation.  This is also the case with our healthcare.  The cross border health initiative is one of the great successes.  People have gone to Belfast to have medical procedures.  That has been a great success.  It has worked very well.  It is very quick and the reimbursement system works well.  Perhaps it needs a few modifications to deal with people who have difficulty raising the funds.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Joe O'Reilly:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=26&amp;amp;MemberID=1610"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=1610&amp;amp;pid=JoeOReilly&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It was a huge success and unifying factor on the island, and we cannot have something that would disrupt that.  Education, including cross-Border education, is important.  Coming from County Cavan, it is very clear to me how absurd this is and its potential danger.  One has to hope and assume that a number of derogations will be achieved, but, ultimately, we need to achieve its abolition or an effective derogation in the case of tourism.  An earlier speaker cited visitors with family in Donegal who wish to study in Northern Ireland or whatever.</p><p>No matter how we look at it, it is very dangerous.  I thought it was instructive to listen to our new Senator who, in one of his first contributions, which was excellent, cited the ludicrous nature of it, its potential to reignite trouble and the ludicrous nature of what was there previously.  His contribution, given his previous role, was interesting.  It is a good motion.  We have to unite behind it.  We need the Minister to stay strong, and I have no doubt that he will.</p></speech>

My colleague, Senator Black, who would have loved to be here is, of course, a member of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which has also very clearly communicated its serious concerns.</p> <p>In this debate, a suite of extraordinarily aggressive steps in policy by the UK regarding the treatment of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers have been correctly identified.  We saw that begin with Windrush.  I will come to Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland in a moment, but in terms of the general suite of measures, it has been an incredibly sad thing for the UK, which is a place with extraordinary diversity.  It has a problematic history of colonialism around the world, yet people from many different origins could go there to make an imprint and shape a diverse future for the United Kingdom.  The way those from the EU and the people affected by the Windrush scandal have been treated in the UK is isolating people within the UK.  Those seeking to enter or leave are not the only ones affected.  I am concerned for our neighbours in respect of the effects of these sets of policies and the damage they do in terms of separating people from their neighbours and honest engagement with their history.</p> <p>These measures are also, sadly, another example of an extraordinary disregard for the rights and well-being of those citizens in Northern Ireland, in particular those who are not Irish or UK citizens, but rather EU citizens.  There is an extraordinary disrespect for the Good Friday Agreement.  We have spoken about some of the other issues, such as tourism.  People who visit Grianan of Aileach also go to Derry.  They are almost the same thing and involve the same tour.  </p> <p>There are also practical ways in which quality of life is being damaged in terms of co-operation.  We have spoken about tourism, but all of the all-Ireland bodies will now face new obstacles, jeopardies and embarrassments in terms of their international co-operation measures.  Senator Joe O'Reilly mentioned concrete measures in terms of health co-operation.  The multiple unnecessary difficulties, obstacles and damages that could be created by a measure like this are substantial. </p> <p>Core to the Good Friday Agreement is human rights.  Human rights, and the entitlement of persons right across the island to an equivalent standard of human rights, is a fundamental pillar of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is massively important.  What is happening is concerning on two levels.  There is a human rights breach within the Act, because the Act is not in line with international law and human rights.  There are multiple examples, but the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, has highlighted how it violates the refugee convention.  The Law Society in the UK said it is violating the refugee convention.  The UK's equality impact assessment of the Act found it would produce discrimination on the grounds of race and nationality.  Racial profiling has been highlighted in that regard.  It is fundamentally at odds with international human rights laws and laws on the treatment of migrants.  It also diminishes the rights of relationship.  The practical human rights of everybody on the island are diminished by this.  </p> <p>I take from the Minister his very clear message that we do not need to have a hard border return.  The measures are very clear.  If we start talking about particular waivers being sought, we are, in effect, talking about border controls.  The electronic system for travel authorization, ESTA, in the US is a check on borders.  We are talking about a mechanism becoming a hard border.  We are also talking about things like racial profiling in terms of who gets stopped and asked questions.  </p> <p>It is also important that Ireland, at this and every level, continues to resist any race to the bottom in terms of rights, or any race downwards, given the very concerning race downwards in terms of human rights and standards.  Ireland needs to be continue to have generous, welcome and inclusive refugee, migrant and asylum policies.  We need to demand a rise in standards from those with whom we share a common travel area.  I am glad the Minister is supportive of the motion.  I support it, and it is an important message for the Seanad to send.</p></speech>

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion.  I recognise and congratulate the MLAs that have been elected in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>We celebrated Europe Day on 9 May.  It was about peace and prosperity.  We have seen how it has been so crucial for peace and prosperity.  We see the threats to democracy across and outside of European borders.  On the island of Ireland, we need to protect the people of Ireland.  We are now yet again at a critical juncture.  The Minister has faced pressure over the past number of years to manage the Brexit process and put measures in place to protect the people in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland.  We need to figure out how we are going to manage and work well with our neighbours in the future with a plan and process in place.  </p> <p>I lived in Northern Ireland prior to the Good Friday Agreement.  I know the power of that agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol to give assurance to people.  At the T&aacute;naiste has noted, the majority of MLAs in Northern Ireland support the Northern Ireland protocol.  It is crucial that the Minister feels the support from Seanad &Eacute;ireann today for the negotiations he faces in the time ahead and that Ireland speaks with a very clear voice about threats to agreements that have been negotiated on behalf of the people of Ireland.  The United States has been has been clear in its support of the Northern Ireland protocol.  </p> <p>As someone with family and friends in the North, I know the importance of the recent elections.  The Alliance Party is there to look at how we build consensus and compromise and to look at how to move forward with a society in Northern Ireland that will represent all of Northern Ireland.<!--/p--><!--p></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Aisling Dolan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1"></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=seanad&amp;amp;memberid=&amp;amp;pid=AislingDolan&amp;amp;year=2022&amp;amp;month=05&amp;amp;day=11"></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We must acknowledge there is a voice there that must be listened to and we must show our strength when in negotiations in the time ahead.

T&aacute;im bre&aacute; s&aacute;sta go bhfuil an seal seo agam freagra a thabhairt ar an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht anocht.  I thank the Minister for his contribution, and all my colleagues who support or will not oppose this motion.  Both stances are appreciated.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the legitimate and understandable concerns around racial profiling, because they have featured several times in this debate.  It is right for this issue to be raised.  There are live concerns the other way about the racial profiling of people travelling from the North into the South.  People are being stopped on buses and this issue has been raised by groups such as the Committee on the Administration of Justice, CAJ, the North West Migrants Forum, NWMF, and End Deportations Belfast.  I raised this matter with the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner.  This is a live issue of concern and one equally worth mentioning and drawing to the attention of the Government.</p> <p>I welcome the Minister's remarks about the need for the institutions in the North to return.  I thank my colleagues across the Chamber who congratulated Sinn F&eacute;in, all the other parties and all the MLAs elected to the Assembly.  I also take this opportunity to encourage all parties to heed the clearly-expressed will of the majority of people who want the Assembly and the Executive to be re-established.  They want the DUP to nominate a deputy First Minister to serve alongside Michelle O'Neill, whom the people have elected to be their First Minister.  People also want to see the more than &pound;330 million that is available invested in order those funds can reach people and help to tackle the cost-of-living crisis, as well as commencing the process of investing more than &pound;1 billion into the health service over the next three years.  </p> <p>Regarding this motion, and I say this not to be contentious but merely to acknowledge that the Minister will continue to engage with the British Government on this issue, the Minister in his contribution outlined a litany of issues where the British Government has not kept its word.  These include the protocol and legacy issues.  I add the matter of Acht na Gaeilge, and we could cite many more such examples.  Respectfully, therefore, as the proposer of this motion, I am genuinely concerned that if this has been our experience to date, how can we and, indeed, why should we trust the British Government to act in good faith regarding resolving our concerns about this legislation?  </p> <p>I do, however, welcome the Government's engagement on this issue, be that at political or official level.  The reality remains, however, that this Act is now on the books.  This is the political and legal reality in which we are all operating.  It is why the passing of this motion is so important.  We will have sent a clear and unified message.  We have work to do together to ensure this legislation cannot have, and will not have, the negative impact on life here that we all know it could.  All the examples have been cited here tonight.</p> <p>I also wish to hone in on the question put to the Minister by Senator Warfield regarding the part of this motion that deals with mobilising international pressure and support and solidarity, as the Minister has done effectively and exemplarily on the issue of Brexit.  We will need to do that again to ensure international attention is focused on the implications of this legislation for life in Ireland.  I appreciate that the Minister has referred to some potential moves forward.  Tourism, however, cannot be left behind.  For all the reasons the Minister knows and has outlined, and all the reasons outlined by colleagues across the Chamber, we cannot say: "That will do".  I want to see this issue resolved in the fullest and most comprehensive and conclusive way possible to genuinely and sincerely ensure that the negative impact of this legislation is not felt in the way that it could be here, North and South.  I again thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach, my colleagues and the Minister for taking part in this debate and for supporting this motion.  </p></speech>
